Have you ever found
yourself needing

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.750 align:middle line:10%
to make sacrifices
for a higher purpose

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.960 align:middle line:10%
or to establish greater
balance in your life?

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.630 align:middle line:84%

We're halfway

we pass through
the turning point

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:07.400 align:middle line:10%
at the bottom of the wheel,
and then begin our ascent

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.680 align:middle line:10%
up the right side.

So as we take this next
step on the Hero's Journey,

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.800 align:middle line:90%
we meet Justice.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.350 align:middle line:10%
And Justice holds
the central position

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.510 align:middle line:10%
in the major arcana sequence.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a pivot for all the
other keys, an exchange

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.000 align:middle line:84%
point that all the
archetypal energies

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.160 align:middle line:90%
are transmitted through.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.550 align:middle line:10%
Justice is the
mediator in tarot.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.640 align:middle line:10%
It maintains a dynamic
balance among all of them,

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.460 align:middle line:10%
and it's constantly
weighing, negotiating,

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.010 align:middle line:10%
and deciding what's aligned
with the highest good of all.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.410 align:middle line:10%
If The Wheel is the gate
or the portal to ascension,

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.670 align:middle line:10%
then Justice is the
guardian at that gate.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.310 align:middle line:84%
The old alchemists used
to say that equilibrium

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.430 align:middle line:84%
is the basis of the
great work, and Justice

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.240 align:middle line:84%
is all about this concept
or lesson of equilibrium,

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.280 align:middle line:84%
the balancing of
polarities in order

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.600 align:middle line:84%

[GAVEL KNOCKS]

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.380 align:middle line:10%
And so, Justice is
teaching us about the laws

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.320 align:middle line:10%
of karma or cause and effect.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's time for
us to realize how

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.830 align:middle line:84%
all effects have their cause
and how we are at cause.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.530 align:middle line:84%
But being at cause isn't
always a matter of just

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.850 align:middle line:90%
our physical actions.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.640 align:middle line:84%
It could be that we caused
a string of events based

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.320 align:middle line:84%
purely on our activities
in the mental,

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.080 align:middle line:90%
emotional, and spiritual planes.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.840 align:middle line:90%
Justice teaches us discernment.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.720 align:middle line:10%
Not only do we need to be
discerning in our actions,

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.100 align:middle line:10%
we must also be discerning in
our thoughts, in our words,

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.310 align:middle line:10%
and in what emotions
we let drive us.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.740 align:middle line:84%
She also assesses whether
we're treating others

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.460 align:middle line:84%
fairly and being treated
fairly ourselves.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.650 align:middle line:84%
Justice also embodies
the archetypes

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.490 align:middle line:84%
that deal with all matters
of law, both universal laws

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.250 align:middle line:90%
and human laws.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, our task is to come to
understand the universal laws

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.010 align:middle line:90%
and become aligned with them.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, Justice is ruled
by the number 11,

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.350 align:middle line:84%
so let's take a look
at this numerology.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.950 align:middle line:84%
11 is the first master
number in the sequence

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.940 align:middle line:90%
and it's in mystical number.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.210 align:middle line:84%
It has a lot of
mystical properties.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.820 align:middle line:84%
A master number is when a single
number is repeated in sequence.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.130 align:middle line:84%
In this case, we're
repeating the number 1

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.530 align:middle line:90%
and it's doubly emphasized.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.700 align:middle line:90%
So 11 is a double emphasis of 1.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, 11 is also a
higher octave of 2,

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.490 align:middle line:84%
because when we add the 1 and
the 1 together it gives us 2.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, 2 is the first
duality, which

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.710 align:middle line:84%
results from the one reflecting
or duplicating itself.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.350 align:middle line:90%
It's a mirror.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.870 align:middle line:84%
So the 11, then, is when our
individual self-consciousness

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.760 align:middle line:84%
will see its own reflection in
the mirror of the true self.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.029 align:middle line:84%
Let's look now to the imagery
and the symbolism contained

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:21.140 align:middle line:90%
within the Justice card.

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.260 align:middle line:10%
[GAVEL KNOCKS]

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.420 align:middle line:10%
We see a blonde
androgynous woman

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.420 align:middle line:10%
who sits between the
Pillars of Polarity

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.670 align:middle line:10%
with a set of scales
in her left hand

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.512 align:middle line:10%
and a sword raised
in her right hand.

00:04:34.512 --> 00:04:37.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, the sword
represents discernment,

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.830 align:middle line:84%
while the scales
represent balance.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And this suggests that
discerning individuals examine

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.570 align:middle line:84%
and balance both their mental
and emotional prejudices

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.750 align:middle line:90%
in order to make wise decisions.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.280 align:middle line:84%
In one side of the
scales is our mind.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.340 align:middle line:84%
In the other side is our
emotions and our desires.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, the scales universally
will signify the weighing

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.460 align:middle line:84%
of our actions, our deeds,
and the outcome of our intent

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.860 align:middle line:84%
and motive against
our actions and deeds.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.470 align:middle line:90%
Do they weigh in the balance?

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.830 align:middle line:84%
The Justice's scales
show her function

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.000 align:middle line:84%
is to constantly compensate
and adjust for any imbalances.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.600 align:middle line:84%
So she acts like the
carpenter's level,

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:28.530 align:middle line:84%
showing which side of a project
or issue needs adjustment.

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.870 align:middle line:84%
If a person is imbalanced
on the side of mercy,

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.420 align:middle line:84%
for example, then
the sword of Justice

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.350 align:middle line:84%
swings to the side of
severity and vise versa.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.920 align:middle line:84%
The unbalanced aspects get
severed by the sword of Justice

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.700 align:middle line:84%
in a very controlled
yet martial fashion.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.550 align:middle line:84%
Her sword is lifted in
the defense of Justice

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.040 align:middle line:90%
and none can escape it.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And it points upward here in the
card, which indicates victory.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.360 align:middle line:90%
It's a positive symbol.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is also though
a double-edged sword.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.620 align:middle line:90%
So it can swing both ways.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.460 align:middle line:84%
It can either cut
away or it can be

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.700 align:middle line:84%
used to consecrate
so that whatever

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.866 align:middle line:84%
is false may be separated
from whatever is true.

00:06:10.866 --> 00:06:14.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, its action is
also like a pendulum,

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.470 align:middle line:84%
which only comes to
rest at the very center

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.240 align:middle line:84%
after that swinging
of the pendulum

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.360 align:middle line:84%
between the different
polarities has been quieted down

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.150 align:middle line:90%
and it comes to center.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.280 align:middle line:84%
We also see that
Justice is crowned,

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.220 align:middle line:84%
which is a reference to
Kathara on the Tree of Life

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.580 align:middle line:90%
at the very top the crown.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
highest or most perfect

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.090 align:middle line:84%
state of being on
the Tree of Life.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.750 align:middle line:84%
So she is said to be crowned
with the Cap of Maintenance,

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:47.320 align:middle line:84%
which is her job to maintain
that equilibrium and purity.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.240 align:middle line:10%
Now Justice's robes
are red and green,

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.800 align:middle line:10%
indicating a combination
of Mars, which is the red,

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.310 align:middle line:10%
and Venus, which is the
green, working together.

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:01.780 align:middle line:10%
Now, that red symbolizes
action or masculine energy,

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.780 align:middle line:10%
and is also associated
with The Emperor.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.410 align:middle line:10%
While the green is the color of
Venus, the goddess of nature,

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:12.220 align:middle line:10%
and love, and beauty,
and she is The Empress.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.550 align:middle line:10%
So very much like how The
Emperor and The Empress

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:19.400 align:middle line:10%
characteristics act together
to complement one another,

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.642 align:middle line:10%
we see them both coming
together here within Justice.

00:07:23.642 --> 00:07:25.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, just like the
colors of red and green

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.240 align:middle line:84%
also compliment each
other, when they're

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.060 align:middle line:90%
combined they make gray.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And gray is a color associated
with wisdom and neutrality.

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.060 align:middle line:10%
And gray, we see
here, is the color

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:42.680 align:middle line:10%
of the pillars, the foundation,
and the seat of Justice.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.740 align:middle line:10%
Justice is also
associated sometimes

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.200 align:middle line:10%
with the color yellow
in the background,

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.790 align:middle line:10%
and this refers
to the connection

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:53.330 align:middle line:10%
to the element of air and
our thinking capacities.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Notice, also, how Justice
extends her foot, showing

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.550 align:middle line:90%
that she's ready to act.

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:01.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, psychologically
this picture

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:05.480 align:middle line:84%
illustrates the law of
poise and self-direction.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:09.680 align:middle line:84%
A balanced personality is one
that's faithful, constant,

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:14.090 align:middle line:84%
confident, and because of
the right use of reason,

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:17.810 align:middle line:84%
it helps us to know that
our actions are just.

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:21.950 align:middle line:10%
Now, behind Justice we
also see a purple curtain.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:24.680 align:middle line:10%
And that purple relates to the
color of the Wheel of Fortune,

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.000 align:middle line:10%
which was the previous key.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.390 align:middle line:10%
Now, this curtain is
stretched between the pillars

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:32.090 align:middle line:10%
and it covers what
is beyond them,

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:36.799 align:middle line:10%
and this hints at Justice's role
as the guardian at the gate.

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:40.190 align:middle line:84%
The pillars form the
two sides of a gate,

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:43.490 align:middle line:84%
and we must be weighed in the
balance of Justice's scales

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:46.990 align:middle line:84%
before we can pass
through beyond that veil.

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:51.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, the veil represents the
illusions, the delusions,

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:54.650 align:middle line:84%
and the self-deception that
we must break through in order

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:58.950 align:middle line:90%
to clearly see and truly see.

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:01.680 align:middle line:10%
Now, the pillars that
Justice sits between also

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.960 align:middle line:10%
reflect the imagery
in The High Priestess,

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.390 align:middle line:10%
where we also see those pillars.

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:08.790 align:middle line:10%
We also see them
in The Hierophant.

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:11.370 align:middle line:10%
And like in The High
Priestess and The Hierophant,

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:15.360 align:middle line:10%
Justice's pillars symbolize
that achieving of neutrality

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.790 align:middle line:10%
or a well balanced
perspective and coming

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.840 align:middle line:10%
into the middle pillar.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:24.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, what is Justice
trying to teach us?

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:26.810 align:middle line:90%
Well, Justice is our conscience.

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:29.470 align:middle line:84%
It's our own inner
voice that's guiding

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:31.930 align:middle line:84%
us to make the right
decisions and helping

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:34.390 align:middle line:84%
us recognize where we
need to achieve greater

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:36.940 align:middle line:90%
balance within ourselves.

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:39.280 align:middle line:84%
It releases the
energy for clearing

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.710 align:middle line:84%
the baggage from our
life and the karma,

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:43.860 align:middle line:90%
both past and present.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:47.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's a life path that
will stimulate and even force

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:49.090 align:middle line:90%
equilibrium.

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:51.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, Justice manifests
opportunities

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:55.020 align:middle line:84%
for us to learn the proper
application of our thoughts,

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:58.440 align:middle line:84%
our actions, as well as
how to properly blend

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:02.120 align:middle line:84%
both physical and
spiritual aspects of life.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And once we realize
that we are souls first,

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.370 align:middle line:84%
then that is when the higher
levels will open up to us.

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:14.086 align:middle line:84%
This is about knowing and
living our purpose in life.

00:10:14.086 --> 00:10:16.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, what are some other
important correspondences

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.016 align:middle line:90%
of Justice?

00:10:18.016 --> 00:10:22.310 align:middle line:10%
Well, in the Egyptian
system, the Halls of Judgment

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:24.980 align:middle line:10%
belong to the
goddess Ma'at, who is

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.650 align:middle line:10%
the goddess of truth and order.

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:31.550 align:middle line:10%
Her symbol was the white feather
that represented righteousness

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:34.730 align:middle line:10%
and purity, and she
sat upon the scales

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:38.020 align:middle line:10%
in the Egyptian
story of the Dead.

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:42.230 align:middle line:84%
As the story goes, once a soul
transitions into the afterlife,

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:45.570 align:middle line:84%
they must first pass through
the trials in the underworld.

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:47.620 align:middle line:84%
They're basically
opportunities to help

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:50.500 align:middle line:84%
us let go of regrets,
falsehoods, and attachments

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:51.940 align:middle line:90%
from our physical life.

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:54.410 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like a life review.

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
these trials, the soul

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:59.410 align:middle line:84%
comes to a place called
the Halls of Judgment.

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And there, the heart
of the deceased

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:03.940 align:middle line:84%
is going to be
weighed in the scales

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:07.570 align:middle line:90%
against the feather of Ma'at.

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:10.630 align:middle line:84%
This is to assess the
deeds of that person

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:13.930 align:middle line:84%
and whether they lived a
righteous and pure life.

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And Thoth, the lord
of wisdom, is the one

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:18.010 align:middle line:90%
who measures the balance.

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:20.820 align:middle line:90%
He assesses.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, the soul, the
deceased, stands

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.380 align:middle line:84%
in the presence of
42 gods and goddesses

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.840 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient
Egyptian pantheon.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And during this
process, they would

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:33.820 align:middle line:84%
speak what they call
the negative confession.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:35.440 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like a repentance.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.440 align:middle line:84%
They're confessing
what they know

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.650 align:middle line:84%
they did in life, and maybe
the regrets that they had,

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:44.170 align:middle line:90%
and they're giving their story.

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And their heart is
what knows and weighs

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:51.490 align:middle line:84%
in the balance with that feather
of Ma'at, the Feather of Truth.

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And only once their heart
weighs as light as a feather,

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:59.470 align:middle line:84%
then will the soul be permitted
to pass through that portal

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:01.120 align:middle line:90%
and to join the eternal gods.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.150 align:middle line:90%


00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:07.150 align:middle line:84%
So this idea of
living a pure life,

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:10.480 align:middle line:84%
and letting go of the
burdens, and cutting them away

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.610 align:middle line:84%
so that our heart and
our soul can become

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:14.890 align:middle line:84%
as light as that
Feather of Truth

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:18.300 align:middle line:84%
is the key lesson
here with Justice.

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:21.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, the secret name
of Justice, as well as

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:25.680 align:middle line:84%
the secret name of Ma'at, is The
Daughter of The Lords of Truth

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:29.070 align:middle line:90%
and The Ruler of The Balance.

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:31.750 align:middle line:10%
She relates to the
element of air,

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:36.510 align:middle line:10%
which is related to the
sign of Libra and astrology.

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.890 align:middle line:90%
Libra is an active air sign.

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And the main attribute
of Libra is a desire

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:44.210 align:middle line:90%
for refined balance and truth.

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:47.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, Libra, which is also
symbolized by the scales,

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:50.280 align:middle line:84%
rules the seventh house
of the zodiac, which

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.820 align:middle line:84%
is the house of partnership,
both business and marriage type

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.760 align:middle line:90%
partnerships.

00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:01.620 align:middle line:84%
Because there is a fine
line between love and hate,

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:04.980 align:middle line:84%
it should not be surprising
to note that Libra also

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:09.780 align:middle line:84%
governs both close relationships
as well as open enemies.

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:14.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, Libra tries to be fair, but
at times can appear judgmental.

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:16.920 align:middle line:10%
Now, Libras would
do well in careers

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:20.820 align:middle line:10%
dealing with legal issues,
financial balancing,

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:23.140 align:middle line:10%
or business acumen.

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:25.050 align:middle line:10%
Now, in astrology,
Libra is also ruled

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:29.130 align:middle line:10%
by the planet Venus, which is
associated with The Empress.

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:31.410 align:middle line:10%
And because it's ruled
by Venus, Libras often

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:34.988 align:middle line:10%
have a sense of peace,
tranquility, regeneration,

00:13:34.988 --> 00:13:36.405 align:middle line:10%
especially when
they're in nature.

00:13:36.405 --> 00:13:39.270 align:middle line:90%


00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:42.340 align:middle line:84%
The Libra personality
says, I balance,

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:47.680 align:middle line:84%
I equilibrate, I adjust,
I agree, I idealize,

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.600 align:middle line:90%
and I harmonize.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Some of the strengths that
she helps us to achieve

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:55.150 align:middle line:84%
and the virtues that get
awakened within us as we work

00:13:55.150 --> 00:14:00.820 align:middle line:84%
with Justice are a sense of
integrity, responsibility,

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:03.210 align:middle line:90%
and being objective.

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:06.347 align:middle line:84%
Now, these strengths are the
pure expression of Justice.

00:14:06.347 --> 00:14:07.930 align:middle line:84%
But if they go out
of balance, then it

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:10.880 align:middle line:84%
creates the
weaknesses of Justice.

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, some of those
weaknesses and vices

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:16.450 align:middle line:84%
that we have to watch out for
here are being too judgmental,

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:20.440 align:middle line:84%
or getting caught up
in dualities, maybe

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:24.630 align:middle line:84%
a failure to make
good decisions.

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:28.282 align:middle line:84%
Now, Justice really helps us
to make the karmic adjustments

00:14:28.282 --> 00:14:29.740 align:middle line:84%
that we need to in
our life to come

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.020 align:middle line:90%
to a greater state of grace.

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:35.990 align:middle line:84%
It also encourages us to
access artistic creativity,

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:37.600 align:middle line:84%
and it gives us
courage to do what

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:40.920 align:middle line:84%
we need to do to achieve
greater balance in life.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes that also
means forgiveness, forgiving

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.020 align:middle line:84%
what we need to let
go of in the past.

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And it helps us with
revelations as well as

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:52.825 align:middle line:90%
dealing with consequences.

00:14:52.825 --> 00:14:56.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, think of times when you've
either been or encountered

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.082 align:middle line:90%
Justice in your life.

00:14:58.082 --> 00:15:01.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, as children, we all
come to a point in our lives

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.890 align:middle line:84%
where our parents
had to take some kind

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:07.660 align:middle line:84%
of disciplinary action with
us, to set boundaries or give

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:10.717 align:middle line:90%
consequences for bad behavior.

00:15:10.717 --> 00:15:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you're a parent,
then perhaps you've

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:15.010 align:middle line:84%
had to be the hand of
Justice in the life

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:17.320 align:middle line:90%
of your own child at times.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.930 align:middle line:84%
It's hard, but when
it's done from love

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:23.870 align:middle line:84%
and with the right measure of
discipline, then it is just,

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:26.680 align:middle line:84%
and it helps that
child to mature.

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, at different
times in our life,

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Justice will also
step in to bring

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:33.340 align:middle line:84%
balance between two
opposing areas of life

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:36.020 align:middle line:90%
representing the scales.

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:37.690 align:middle line:84%
For example, we
often hear people

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:41.210 align:middle line:90%
talk about work-life balance.

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, how much are we
taking care of ourselves

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:48.550 align:middle line:84%
versus pouring our
energy into work?

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:52.840 align:middle line:84%
Also, any time that we've
worked to achieve, or maintain,

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.030 align:middle line:84%
or even regain
balance in life, we

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:58.680 align:middle line:84%
have been drawing upon
the energy of Justice.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And the more you recognize
Justice in your life

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:03.040 align:middle line:84%
here and now, the
more it will also

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.080 align:middle line:84%
connect you with one
of your parallel lives

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:08.830 align:middle line:84%
where Justice is the
dominant archetype.

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:13.330 align:middle line:84%
Examples might include a
judge, a negotiator, lawyer,

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:14.890 align:middle line:90%
law enforcement officers.

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:15.720 align:middle line:90%
[SIRENS WAIL]

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.990 align:middle line:84%
Justice also deals with
publications and weighing

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:20.430 align:middle line:90%
our words.

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:24.690 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes they might thrive
as a writer or an editor.

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:28.440 align:middle line:10%
By working with Justice
and invoking its energies

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.900 align:middle line:10%
into your life, you can
heighten your abilities

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:35.080 align:middle line:10%
to discern truth from false
and to bring greater balance

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:35.880 align:middle line:10%
into your life.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:38.005 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:38.005 --> 00:16:42.360 align:middle line:10%
Now, once we pass Justice's
test and measuring,

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.190 align:middle line:10%
our next step on
the Hero's journey

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:46.890 align:middle line:10%
brings us to The Hanged Man.

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:49.215 align:middle line:10%
Often you'll find
interpretations of The Hanged

00:16:49.215 --> 00:16:51.420 align:middle line:10%
Man as being more
about a punishment

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:54.300 align:middle line:10%
of a traitor in which
Justice has just

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:57.150 align:middle line:10%
delivered their sentence.

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:59.970 align:middle line:84%
But when looking at these
cards from a surface level,

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:01.450 align:middle line:90%
yeah, that might make sense.

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:04.079 align:middle line:84%
But the esoteric meaning
of The Hanged Man archetype

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:06.980 align:middle line:90%
is far more profound than this.

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:10.230 align:middle line:10%
The Hanged Man is
the first card that

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:12.510 align:middle line:10%
begins our ascension
of consciousness

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:15.990 align:middle line:10%
back up the wheel
of the 231 gates.

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:20.579 align:middle line:84%
It's a key of what we call
suspended animation or a vision

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:21.669 align:middle line:90%
quest.

00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:24.569 align:middle line:10%
Now, it represents the
principles of surrender

00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:27.930 align:middle line:10%
as well as a reversal
of our concepts,

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:29.940 align:middle line:10%
and it links us to the
archetypal energies

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:34.170 align:middle line:10%
that stimulate new
perspectives in life.

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:36.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're not meant
to focus solely

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.460 align:middle line:84%
on just the material
plane and what it's

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:40.680 align:middle line:90%
like to be in a physical life.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.800 align:middle line:84%
So this path releases
the desire to merge

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:47.230 align:middle line:90%
with a universal consciousness.

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:50.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, The Hanged Man is
ruled by the number 12.

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:53.910 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look at
the numerology of 12.

00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:57.810 align:middle line:84%
It represents a complete
cycle of manifestation

00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:59.580 align:middle line:90%
into the physical.

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.470 align:middle line:84%
There are many
significant occurrences

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:04.080 align:middle line:84%
of this number
throughout history.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:07.470 align:middle line:10%
For example, we have
12 months in a year,

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:13.900 align:middle line:10%
12 signs of the zodiac, 12
Apostles, 12 tribes of Israel,

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:17.891 align:middle line:10%
12 dimensions of Earth,
just to name a few.

00:18:17.891 --> 00:18:21.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, 12 usually relates
to the physical around.

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:23.710 align:middle line:84%
The Hanged Man's
position on the wheel

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:25.510 align:middle line:84%
is the beginning
of the ascension,

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:28.420 align:middle line:84%
so it tells us that
we've already learned all

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:29.920 align:middle line:84%
that we need to
learn about being

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:33.070 align:middle line:84%
physical through
the previous keys.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:37.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's time to reclaim
our spiritual powers.

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:41.310 align:middle line:10%
The Hanged Man's number 12
also breaks down to a 1 plus 2

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:45.090 align:middle line:10%
equals 3, which is the
number for The Empress,

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:47.350 align:middle line:10%
The Path of Love.

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And this is a reminder
that divine love

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:53.820 align:middle line:84%
includes complete love
for ourselves and others.

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And The Hanged Man is thus
an outward form or expression

00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:00.250 align:middle line:90%
of this love.

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:03.400 align:middle line:10%
Now, let's explore the symbolism
and imagery of The Hanged Man

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.990 align:middle line:10%
card.

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:07.300 align:middle line:10%
We see a young man
hanging suspended

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:11.620 align:middle line:10%
from his right foot that's tied
to a tree shaped like a capital

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:16.330 align:middle line:10%
T. His other foot crosses
behind it forming a cross out

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:18.250 align:middle line:10%
of his legs.

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:21.610 align:middle line:10%
His arms are clasped
behind his back,

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:25.090 align:middle line:10%
and he hangs inverted with
his head though illuminated

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:28.000 align:middle line:10%
by a halo of yellow light.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And notice the
expression on his face.

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:32.350 align:middle line:90%
It's very peaceful.

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:35.710 align:middle line:90%
Plus, his eyes are opened.

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:37.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is
clearly not an image

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:41.020 align:middle line:84%
of execution or
even persecution.

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:42.940 align:middle line:84%
A more appropriate
title might be

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.790 align:middle line:84%
The Hanging Man or
The Hanging One,

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:49.610 align:middle line:84%
the one suspended
between Heaven and Earth.

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:51.940 align:middle line:84%
So he represents a
vantage point which

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:56.860 align:middle line:84%
brings a radical new perspective
or a reversal of our concepts.

00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:01.810 align:middle line:84%
He's literally turning
his world upside down.

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:05.010 align:middle line:10%
Now, The Fool has reached
a point in his journey

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:07.350 align:middle line:10%
where the knowledge
of his inner world

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:12.680 align:middle line:10%
becomes far more important
than that of the outer world.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:15.440 align:middle line:84%
He must now come to grips
with unconscious forces

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.020 align:middle line:90%
within himself.

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And he needs to sacrifice the
control of his conscious ego

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:24.890 align:middle line:84%
by now surrendering
to his inner world.

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:27.200 align:middle line:90%
So he's on a vision quest.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:31.610 align:middle line:84%
This is a rite of initiation
that is depicted here.

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:33.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is something
that can only

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:36.830 align:middle line:84%
be done by our willing
and conscious choice.

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:39.980 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that can
be forced on us from anything

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:43.550 align:middle line:84%
outside, although maybe
sometimes circumstances

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:48.330 align:middle line:84%
might contribute to us
wanting to pursue such a path.

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, as Carl Jung says, "It's
as if the conscious mind

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:57.600 align:middle line:84%
volunteers to die in order to
bear a new and fruitful life

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:01.230 align:middle line:84%
in the unconscious despite
the fears of the unknown

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:03.780 align:middle line:84%
and the fear that
inevitably arises

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:08.285 align:middle line:84%
when a journey to the underworld
of Hades is completed."

00:21:08.285 --> 00:21:10.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, The Fool
started his journey

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:12.480 align:middle line:84%
with a sense of trust,
and willingness,

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.870 align:middle line:84%
and wanting to take a
risk no matter what.

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And here, once again,
he has to take a risk

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:23.250 align:middle line:84%
and to dare to now make
the journey inward.

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:26.400 align:middle line:10%
His card represents that total
reversal of all knowledge that

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.950 align:middle line:10%
was previously gained,
but it's in order

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:31.770 align:middle line:10%
so that we may more
fully understand and gain

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:34.200 align:middle line:10%
an even greater perspective.

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.880 align:middle line:10%
Now, being turned
upside down, he's

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:39.630 align:middle line:10%
in a position that's contrary to
what most people would position

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:42.840 align:middle line:10%
themselves in life.

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.240 align:middle line:84%
This especially
relates to the reversal

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:47.830 align:middle line:90%
of thought and concepts.

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:51.450 align:middle line:84%
For example, we might
realize that disease drives

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:55.080 align:middle line:84%
us to learn the laws of
health, and that relationship

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.690 align:middle line:84%
challenges are what
compel us to figure out

00:21:57.690 --> 00:21:59.910 align:middle line:90%
the secrets of harmony.

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:03.060 align:middle line:84%
Thoughts like this are often
the exact opposite or reverse

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:06.470 align:middle line:84%
of what most people
in the world think.

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:07.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, The Hanged
Man has often been

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.130 align:middle line:84%
referred to as the ah-ha
card, because it allows

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:15.890 align:middle line:84%
you to view a stagnant situation
with a new perspective,

00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:19.290 align:middle line:84%
and it may provide a sudden
sense of illumination,

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:24.850 align:middle line:84%
like the proverbial light
bulb that suddenly turns on.

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:29.550 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is a card then
of meditation, stillness,

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:32.880 align:middle line:10%
inner quiet, quieting
the mind and coming

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:35.940 align:middle line:10%
into a state of
complete receptivity.

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:38.670 align:middle line:10%
He's waiting for an
illumination or a vision

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:41.190 align:middle line:10%
to enter from the divine realm.

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:43.780 align:middle line:90%


00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:45.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, for this reason,
The Hanged Man's mantra

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:50.990 align:middle line:90%
becomes not my will, but thine.

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:52.870 align:middle line:84%
This is the attitude
of the initiate.

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:56.530 align:middle line:84%
It's a voluntary surrender
of our ego's grasp

00:22:56.530 --> 00:23:00.240 align:middle line:90%
upon our will and our mind.

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:03.675 align:middle line:10%
Now, take a look again at
the cross of the man's body.

00:23:03.675 --> 00:23:05.960 align:middle line:10%
Now, this confirms
that the hanging man

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:09.790 align:middle line:10%
is in a position of gaining
wisdom through suffering.

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:13.400 align:middle line:10%
Not everything gained
by deliberate discomfort

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:17.060 align:middle line:10%
is relevant to this
particular path or key.

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:21.590 align:middle line:10%
It represents the potential
fruits of hardship.

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And his tale is
the archetypal myth

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:26.840 align:middle line:84%
of the willing
sacrifice that leads

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:31.460 align:middle line:84%
to a greater understanding
and wiser actions.

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.590 align:middle line:84%
We can see a great
example of this archetype

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:37.760 align:middle line:84%
in the story of the Norse God
Odin, who hung from the World

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.610 align:middle line:90%
Tree for nine days and nights.

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:45.590 align:middle line:84%
He hung inverted, he fasted,
he bled onto the Earth,

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:48.290 align:middle line:84%
much like, for example,
how Native American sun

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:50.300 align:middle line:90%
dancers do each year.

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And he did this until he was
able to peer down to the depths

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:57.900 align:middle line:84%
and receive a
vision of the runes.

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of his
willing self-sacrifice,

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:04.790 align:middle line:84%
he was able to bring back this
magical language of the runes

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:09.880 align:middle line:84%
from the other realms and
then teach it to others.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And, ultimately, the only
truly worthwhile sacrifice

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:16.360 align:middle line:84%
is the sacrifice
of our lesser self.

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:18.730 align:middle line:84%
The true self really
can't be sacrificed.

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:19.885 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:19.885 --> 00:24:22.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, this idea is also
captured in a metaphorical way

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:26.270 align:middle line:84%
through the story of the
ancient Egyptian God, Osiris.

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:28.450 align:middle line:10%
Now, his sacrifice
was not so much

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:30.100 align:middle line:10%
a willing one,
because his life was

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:35.050 align:middle line:10%
taken by his jealous brother,
Set, who assassinated him.

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And then, his body was
further torn into 14 pieces

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:41.140 align:middle line:90%
and scattered across Egypt.

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:43.120 align:middle line:10%
And then, and I'm
abbreviating here,

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:47.020 align:middle line:10%
but his wife, Isis, goes to
regather all these body parts

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:49.620 align:middle line:10%
and magically revives him.

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And Osiris then, after
that, becomes the risen god

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:57.850 align:middle line:84%
of the Underworld, meaning his
true self is eternal and cannot

00:24:57.850 --> 00:24:59.980 align:middle line:90%
really be killed or sacrificed.

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:01.495 align:middle line:90%
So his true self is revived.

00:25:01.495 --> 00:25:04.100 align:middle line:90%


00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:06.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the best
sense, The Hanged Man

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.150 align:middle line:84%
reflects the lessons
of balance that

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:12.320 align:middle line:84%
were learned from Justice or
Ma'at in the previous step.

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.210 align:middle line:84%
He represents this
balance between

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:17.870 align:middle line:90%
human and spiritual needs.

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:20.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, even his clothing
shows this balance.

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:23.850 align:middle line:84%
He has red leggings, which
represent fire and action,

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:27.140 align:middle line:84%
but he also has a blue tunic,
which represents receptivity

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:29.280 align:middle line:90%
and water.

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:33.100 align:middle line:84%
So The Hanged Man offers
us two major challenges.

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:36.450 align:middle line:84%
The first one is something
we call reframing, which

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:40.080 align:middle line:84%
is the ability to set aside
our personal typical viewpoint

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:43.650 align:middle line:84%
and perceive a situation
in another way.

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:48.090 align:middle line:84%
The second lesson is timing,
waiting for that right moment

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:50.880 align:middle line:84%
to receive knowledge
or to initiate action.

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.750 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:55.260 align:middle line:84%
So what's Hanged Man
trying to show us here?

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Most have said it's a path of
initiation, which kind of takes

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:04.446 align:middle line:84%
us into a trance-like state or
a period of suspended animation.

00:26:04.446 --> 00:26:07.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, in alchemy, this
suspended animation

00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:10.860 align:middle line:84%
is part of the separation
stage where we've already

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:15.120 align:middle line:84%
dissolved the solution from the
previous stage of disillusion,

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:18.210 align:middle line:84%
and now we take that and
we set it aside for a while

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:20.706 align:middle line:90%
and just leave it to settle.

00:26:20.706 --> 00:26:23.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, within us, this
separation stage

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:27.150 align:middle line:84%
is a state of meditation
where we really intensely

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:28.860 align:middle line:90%
self-examine.

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And upon this path, our
personal consciousness

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:34.470 align:middle line:84%
can give way to that
universal consciousness.

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:38.230 align:middle line:84%
We can come to that
point of surrender.

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:40.950 align:middle line:84%
One other important reminder
that The Hanged Man gives us

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:45.690 align:middle line:84%
is that we can't always
control what happens in life.

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:50.280 align:middle line:84%
But we can control how we
react to those circumstances.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.280 align:middle line:84%
The Hanged Man's esoteric
title or secret name

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.460 align:middle line:84%
is The Spirit of
the Mighty Waters.

00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And the element is associated
with water here, which

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:02.670 align:middle line:84%
relates to the astrological
correspondence which

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:06.060 align:middle line:90%
is the planet Neptune.

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, Neptune is a planet with
a watery fluidic kind of state.

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:14.040 align:middle line:84%
It has this gaseous
fog, but it has also

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.110 align:middle line:84%
a mist, and that
makes it actually

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:20.150 align:middle line:84%
difficult for us to clearly
see the surface of Neptune.

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:24.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, Neptune's fluid state makes
it very emotional, sensitive,

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:29.580 align:middle line:84%
intuitive, and psychic at
a level of correspondence.

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And Neptune can
spend so much time

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:34.343 align:middle line:84%
daydreaming that
it might not always

00:27:34.343 --> 00:27:35.385 align:middle line:90%
be in touch with reality.

00:27:35.385 --> 00:27:38.090 align:middle line:90%


00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:41.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, Neptune got its name
from the Roman God of the sea,

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:44.830 align:middle line:84%
or he's also Poseidon
to the Greeks.

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:49.210 align:middle line:84%
He could bestow calm waters
when he was at a state of peace.

00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:55.100 align:middle line:84%
But when he was upset, he
would cause stormy seas.

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:58.750 align:middle line:84%
In astrology, Neptune
co-rules Pisces

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:02.620 align:middle line:84%
and the 12th house, which is
the house of self-undoing,

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:06.900 align:middle line:84%
mysticism, and
places of seclusion.

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:09.550 align:middle line:84%
Some other key words
associated with The Hanged Man

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:13.750 align:middle line:84%
include having a new
perspective, surrender, faith,

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:15.940 align:middle line:90%
and sacrifice.

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:17.650 align:middle line:84%
As we work with The
Hanged Man card,

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:22.360 align:middle line:84%
it helps us to find the sense
of truth and courage within us.

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:24.830 align:middle line:84%
Helps us see those
new perspectives,

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:27.530 align:middle line:90%
as well as clarify our emotions.

00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:29.800 align:middle line:84%
It uplifts us, and
it grants us access

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:32.710 align:middle line:84%
to opportunities
for new visions,

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:35.470 align:middle line:84%
and heightened awareness,
heightened instincts,

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:37.020 align:middle line:90%
and sensitivity.

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:40.465 align:middle line:84%
And it can also work for us to
help discover our life purpose.

00:28:40.465 --> 00:28:43.300 align:middle line:90%


00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, think of times when you've
either been or encountered

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:48.890 align:middle line:90%
The Hanged Man in your life.

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:51.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, as children,
for example, we often

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:54.530 align:middle line:84%
looked at situations from
many different perspectives

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:56.120 align:middle line:90%
and positions.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.460 align:middle line:84%
Children see the
world with fresh eyes

00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:00.500 align:middle line:84%
and creative
imagination, and it's

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:04.400 align:middle line:84%
difficult to limit or
restrict a child in any way.

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:07.420 align:middle line:84%
These are all Hanged
Man qualities.

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:09.810 align:middle line:84%
But even as adults,
we might find

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:12.690 align:middle line:84%
that were often assisting others
to look at their life problems

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:14.930 align:middle line:90%
from different perspectives.

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And the more you recognized
The Hanged Man in your life,

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.070 align:middle line:84%
the more it will
then also connect you

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:22.250 align:middle line:84%
with one of your parallel
lives where The Hanged

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:26.360 align:middle line:90%
Man is the dominant archetype.

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:28.340 align:middle line:84%
But what might one
of our parallel lives

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:31.280 align:middle line:84%
look like under the
archetype of The Hanged Man?

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:34.340 align:middle line:84%
Might be someone who for
seeks the luxuries of money

00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:36.770 align:middle line:84%
and worldly possessions
in order to dedicate

00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:39.080 align:middle line:90%
their life to a sacred path.

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:42.200 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be someone who
pursued material success

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:45.800 align:middle line:84%
and achieved it, only to then
have his life turned upside

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:49.700 align:middle line:84%
down by an unexpected
accident or health trauma,

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:52.700 align:middle line:84%
for example, a
near-death experience.

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:55.370 align:middle line:10%
Their perspective of
what's important in life

00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:57.110 align:middle line:10%
is radically changed
now, and they

00:29:57.110 --> 00:30:00.500 align:middle line:10%
know that they have been
given a second chance at life,

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:03.260 align:middle line:10%
and they need to use it well.

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:06.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, a less severe way that
this archetype might manifest

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:09.050 align:middle line:84%
is through someone who's
like a death psychologist,

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:13.520 align:middle line:84%
or a therapist who helps people
to dive into their subconscious

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:17.400 align:middle line:90%
and learn its inner workings.

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.320 align:middle line:10%
By working with The
Hanged Man archetype

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:21.480 align:middle line:10%
and invoking its
energies into your life,

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:24.360 align:middle line:10%
you too can awaken your
ability to see things

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:27.570 align:middle line:10%
from a new perspective
and more gracefully make

00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:29.210 align:middle line:10%
the needed sacrifices.

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:32.380 align:middle line:90%

we explore further

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:37.410 align:middle line:84%
into the 22 archetypes
of Tarot, and how

00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:41.460 align:middle line:84%
they can help us to make our
big shift in consciousness.
