>> I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard and
this is "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.130 align:middle line:10%
How do we truly access our
multi-dimensional potential

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.530 align:middle line:10%
and become our true self?

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.870 align:middle line:84%
Can we become like
Neo in the movie

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.810 align:middle line:84%
"The Matrix," who finally
awakens to become the one?

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.250 align:middle line:10%
This season's
"Mystery Teachings"

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.040 align:middle line:10%
has been about the hero's
journey of self-discovery

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.900 align:middle line:10%
and transformation.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.660 align:middle line:10%
We've worked our way through
the 22 archetypes of Tarot,

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.830 align:middle line:10%
using them as keys to awaken
our multi-dimensional selves.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.370 align:middle line:84%
This journey has brought us to a
greater awareness of all the 22

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.980 align:middle line:90%
archetypes of our true self.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, our final task is to
bring them all into coherence,

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.360 align:middle line:84%
into our life here and
now so that we can take

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.090 align:middle line:90%
our next leap of evolution.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.610 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we reach
the final step of the world

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.640 align:middle line:84%
and discover how to
merge the 22 into one.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.420 align:middle line:10%
The world represents the
culmination of the great work.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.960 align:middle line:10%
This is where we reach
true cosmic consciousness

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.960 align:middle line:10%
and mastery of
the dance of life.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.930 align:middle line:84%
The world is the philosopher's
stone of alchemy.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.270 align:middle line:84%
The perfected human who's fully
awakened to their eternal self.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And such a state of being
requires a full integration

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.710 align:middle line:84%
and embodiment of all the other
archetypes and their lessons.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.610 align:middle line:84%
Now in this final stage of our
search for self-actualization,

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.700 align:middle line:84%
we're shown what it
takes to accomplish this.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.100 align:middle line:84%
Now before we dive
into the world, let's

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.710 align:middle line:84%
quickly review where we've
been on this journey.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.240 align:middle line:84%
On the mandala wheel of the 231
gates, as it rotates around,

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.220 align:middle line:90%
we begin as The Fool.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.740 align:middle line:10%
Descending into
greater physicality

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.510 align:middle line:10%
and learning the key
lessons of physical life.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.720 align:middle line:10%
Then as we reached the
bottom of the wheel,

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.170 align:middle line:10%
we came to a turning point
or a pivot on the journey

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.140 align:middle line:10%
where we passed through
a gate of initiation

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.020 align:middle line:10%
and began the
journey of ascension.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.750 align:middle line:84%
The ascent taught us
to master the deeper

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.430 align:middle line:90%
aspects of our being.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And to turn our focus
inwards to elevate our soul

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.150 align:middle line:90%
towards spiritual attainment.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.730 align:middle line:10%
The journey has taken us
through all the stages

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.700 align:middle line:10%
of the alchemical
process, as well.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.470 align:middle line:10%
And now, as we come to the
key 21, the final step,

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.700 align:middle line:10%
we return to where we began,
which is the top of the wheel.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.330 align:middle line:10%
Only now, we're a
transformed being.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.150 align:middle line:84%
This culmination results
in a complete change

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.950 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness and character.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And cosmic
consciousness basically

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.270 align:middle line:84%
means that we're
no longer living

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.300 align:middle line:84%
from ego, but from
a full awareness

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.330 align:middle line:90%
that we are the whole universe.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.950 align:middle line:90%
That all is one.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.480 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.030 align:middle line:90%
Let's now meet the world.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.540 align:middle line:10%
Here we have a picture
of our true self depicted

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.236 align:middle line:10%
in a state of joy and delight
and dancing with the cosmos.

00:03:15.236 --> 00:03:18.770 align:middle line:84%
We followed our development
through the hero's journey.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And the journey
has transformed us.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.730 align:middle line:84%
The World shows us
this transformed being.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is how
we feel when we're

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.930 align:middle line:84%
truly free to enjoy
ourselves and be

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.710 align:middle line:84%
more spontaneous in
the dance of life.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.400 align:middle line:84%
We become fully aware of
our oneness with the cosmos

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.440 align:middle line:84%
and how the forces
of creation flow

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.590 align:middle line:90%
through us into manifestation.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.560 align:middle line:84%
We remember ourselves
as an eternal being.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And we've transcended
beyond personality,

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.750 align:middle line:84%
while still in a physical body
that can now enjoy this world.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.785 align:middle line:90%
This is a state of nirvana.

00:03:55.785 --> 00:03:59.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, The World key
enlivens a spiral dance

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.390 align:middle line:90%
of creation in our lives.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And it opens up new worlds,
perspectives, and awareness.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, The World illustrates
complete integration

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.800 align:middle line:84%
of the self, the ultimate
in self-knowledge.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
we know who we are.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.839 align:middle line:84%
And we discover that we are
who we were in the beginning.

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:22.600 align:middle line:84%
Only now, we're aware
of the work to be done,

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.890 align:middle line:90%
and we're prepared to do it.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.280 align:middle line:90%
And so a new cycle begins again.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.080 align:middle line:84%
And only this time,
though, it will

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.550 align:middle line:84%
be a journey of fulfilling our
purpose versus discovering it.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, The World is
ruled by the number 21.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.410 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look
at that numerology.

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.270 align:middle line:10%
21 is a mirror image
of 12, which gives us

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.810 align:middle line:10%
a hint at its
connection to Key 12,

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.920 align:middle line:10%
the Hanged Man, and how
that relates to The World.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.440 align:middle line:10%
Notice the similarities
and the differences

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.690 align:middle line:10%
between these two keys.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.780 align:middle line:10%
They reveal the, as
above, so below principle.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.030 align:middle line:10%
The Hanged Man, however,
is bound to the World Tree

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.270 align:middle line:10%
and limited by it, whereas
the figure in The World

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.730 align:middle line:10%
is liberated and free.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:14.290 align:middle line:10%
Thus, Key 21 is the final
result of the act that was taken

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.730 align:middle line:10%
in Key 12 with the Hanged Man.

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.740 align:middle line:84%
The Hanged Man says,
be still and know

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.000 align:middle line:84%
that I am God, while The
World says, keep moving

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.300 align:middle line:84%
and know that I am God,
yet while maintaining

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.871 align:middle line:90%
an inner stillness.

00:05:30.871 --> 00:05:33.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, this reveals the
importance of Key 12

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.590 align:middle line:84%
as the foundation of
success to Key 21.

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.050 align:middle line:10%
And together, they form
a complete picture.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.320 align:middle line:10%
Also, the numbers
2 and 1 form 21,

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.540 align:middle line:10%
which indicates
that The World is

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.690 align:middle line:10%
the successful merger
of self-consciousness

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.210 align:middle line:10%
or the magician with
subconsciousness

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.298 align:middle line:10%
or the high priestess.

00:05:56.298 --> 00:05:58.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, in addition,
the imagery of Key 21

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.720 align:middle line:84%
shows the nude
encircled by an ellipse,

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.810 align:middle line:90%
which is the shape of 0.

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, this shows us that
not only are self-conscious

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.840 align:middle line:84%
and subconscious united
here, but they're also

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.290 align:middle line:84%
blended together with super
consciousness, which was

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:17.312 align:middle line:90%
related to the fool, or Key 0.

00:06:17.312 --> 00:06:21.340 align:middle line:10%
Now, Key 21 also
adds to 3, which

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.770 align:middle line:10%
connects her to the Empress.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.400 align:middle line:10%
And we see that The World
is the outer expression

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.420 align:middle line:10%
of the Empress in her most
complete and perfected form--

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.300 align:middle line:10%
the Empress representing
Mother Nature,

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.940 align:middle line:10%
while The World shows
us that she's not just

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.780 align:middle line:10%
the Mother of Earth,
but of the whole cosmos.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, altogether,
though, this makes 21

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:46.960 align:middle line:84%
a very positive number,
indicating the victory achieved

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.940 align:middle line:90%
after a long struggle.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:53.090 align:middle line:84%
It's considered to be the karmic
reward that brings freedom,

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.135 align:middle line:90%
independence, and achievement.

00:06:55.135 --> 00:06:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And this number also
means that a major cycle

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.830 align:middle line:90%
has been completed now.

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And new paths will begin
soon to continue onwards

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:06.480 align:middle line:90%
on our spiritual journey.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.420 align:middle line:10%
Let's now explore further
into the imagery and symbolism

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.550 align:middle line:10%
of The World card.

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:16.140 align:middle line:10%
We see a nude loosely wrapped in
a purple flowing scarf, dancing

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.990 align:middle line:10%
inside of a victory wreath.

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:21.960 align:middle line:10%
She has a wand in each hand.

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.360 align:middle line:10%
And framing the
wreath are the heads

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.940 align:middle line:10%
of four holy living
creatures that we also

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:29.670 align:middle line:10%
saw in the Wheel of Fortune.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:33.870 align:middle line:84%
The dancer is gracefully
poised on one foot.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:39.010 align:middle line:84%
She is centered and in harmony,
in body, mind, and soul.

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And from this balanced play,
she performs the dance of life.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:46.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, dancing is an art and
a skill where we harmonize

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.140 align:middle line:90%
our movements with music.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.780 align:middle line:84%
The dance of life
should be similar.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:55.560 align:middle line:84%
Our actions should move with
the rhythm of daily life.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.620 align:middle line:84%
And we should be
having fun doing it.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:02.070 align:middle line:10%
The more we become attuned to
the rhythm, the more harmonious

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:05.070 align:middle line:10%
our movements, the more
we can make our dance

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:08.730 align:middle line:10%
of life an ecstatic experience.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:12.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, the dancer holds a wand
in each hand, which symbolizes

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:15.450 align:middle line:90%
the fire of divine inspiration.

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And these wands are
double terminated,

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:21.630 align:middle line:84%
functioning like antenna
that draw the energy both in

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:27.810 align:middle line:84%
and out, receiving and sending
from both above and below.

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:30.420 align:middle line:84%
The wands form also
like the two pillars

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.480 align:middle line:84%
of polarity on the Tree
of Life, while the dancer

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.580 align:middle line:90%
is the middle pillar.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.799 align:middle line:84%
And the dancer has
fully reconciled

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:39.840 align:middle line:84%
all of life's
polarities and is now

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:44.820 align:middle line:84%
able to just gracefully
conduct this dance of life.

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.190 align:middle line:84%
There's also a small
wreath around her head

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:49.320 align:middle line:84%
here, which is a
symbol of having

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:53.830 align:middle line:84%
personal victory over the
trials that she's been through.

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And the purple scarf that
drapes the dancer forms

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:01.570 align:middle line:84%
a spiral around her, indicating
the principle of rhythm and

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:05.660 align:middle line:84%
is also the color associated
with the Wheel of Fortune.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, according to tradition,
the scarf actually

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:10.870 align:middle line:84%
conceals the fact
that this dancer

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:14.200 align:middle line:84%
is a hermaphrodite
with male genitals,

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:18.560 align:middle line:84%
combining male and
female into one form.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.680 align:middle line:10%
Now, in ancient
mythology, the being

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.950 align:middle line:10%
called Hermaphroditus was
the offspring of Hermes

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:27.550 align:middle line:10%
and Aphrodite who, in
Tarot, are the magician

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:29.770 align:middle line:10%
and the high priestess.

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:34.720 align:middle line:10%
Now, conscious and subconscious
unite to produce The World

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.180 align:middle line:10%
and perfectly merging their
powers together now as one.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And this symbolizes the
union and reconciliation

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:43.960 align:middle line:90%
of opposites.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the state of
cosmic consciousness,

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:52.390 align:middle line:84%
which The World represents, all
sense of separateness is gone.

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:56.238 align:middle line:10%
There really is only one.

00:09:56.238 --> 00:09:58.360 align:middle line:10%
Now, moving out to
the ellipse, this

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:03.070 align:middle line:10%
represents life itself in
the form of a victory leap.

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And she's doing
her victory dance

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.570 align:middle line:84%
after the completion
of the great work.

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:10.660 align:middle line:10%
So the wreath, though--
it also forms something

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.210 align:middle line:10%
like a womb around her.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Because she's about to be
birthed as a cosmic being,

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.950 align:middle line:90%
an ascended being.

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:21.940 align:middle line:10%
Now, the red ribbons at the top
and the bottom of the wreath

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.370 align:middle line:10%
are also like
infinity loops that we

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:28.470 align:middle line:10%
have seen over the heads of The
Magician and the Strength keys.

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:30.430 align:middle line:10%
And they have the same
meanings of connection

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:32.710 align:middle line:10%
to our eternal being.

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And here, they're
red, suggesting

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:38.480 align:middle line:84%
that the energies of Key 1
and 8 have been acted upon.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm moving out now
to the corners.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.290 align:middle line:10%
Similar to how we see in Key
10, the Wheel of Fortune,

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:47.680 align:middle line:10%
here we have the four
holy living creatures.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.080 align:middle line:84%
These are mystical
animals that correspond

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.560 align:middle line:84%
to the four fixed signs of
the zodiac as well as the four

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:54.970 align:middle line:90%
elements.

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:58.630 align:middle line:84%
The bull is Taurus,
the element of Earth.

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:02.320 align:middle line:84%
The lion is Leo,
the element of fire.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.830 align:middle line:84%
The man represents Aquarius,
the element of air.

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:08.170 align:middle line:10%
And the eagle is a
symbol for Scorpio

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:12.510 align:middle line:10%
in its highest form, which
is the element of water here.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:16.320 align:middle line:10%
Now, here we only see their
heads, not their bodies.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.830 align:middle line:84%
And in Key 10, the bull and the
lion were facing each other.

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:22.620 align:middle line:84%
But here, they're
facing forward.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And this symbolizes
that they're not

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.700 align:middle line:84%
so attached to the
physical Earth plane

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.940 align:middle line:84%
anymore, which Taurus
especially represents.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:31.380 align:middle line:84%
They've now turned
their attention

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:34.610 align:middle line:84%
toward the infinite
world of the spirit.

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:37.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, these four creatures,
being the four elements,

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:42.040 align:middle line:84%
also relate to the tools
on The Magician's altar.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And when we're truly
aligned with our true self,

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:48.585 align:middle line:84%
the elements and the tools
now become our allies.

00:11:48.585 --> 00:11:51.240 align:middle line:90%


00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.860 align:middle line:84%
What's The World trying
to teach us here?

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, the archetypal
role captured here

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:59.100 align:middle line:90%
is paradise regained.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.740 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes this key is
even named The Universe

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.900 align:middle line:10%
to emphasize that
it truly represents

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:08.140 align:middle line:10%
cosmic consciousness,
which is its key lesson.

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And this key represents the sum
of all life experiences merged

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.280 align:middle line:90%
with spiritual attainment.

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:20.520 align:middle line:84%
This physical and spiritual
are now in perfect oneness.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.670 align:middle line:84%
Masculine and feminine
are in perfect balance

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:25.470 align:middle line:90%
and integration.

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:28.990 align:middle line:84%
And in alchemy, this key
represents the final stage

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:33.300 align:middle line:84%
which we call coagulation,
which is a crystallization.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.820 align:middle line:10%
It's the gold or the
philosopher's stone

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:37.980 align:middle line:10%
that we hear of,
about in alchemy.

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:41.400 align:middle line:84%
It's the perfection and the
completion of the great work

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:45.150 align:middle line:84%
where everything has now
crystallized and solidified

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:49.210 align:middle line:90%
into a perfected form.

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:51.790 align:middle line:84%
This dancer, again, is
our true self and master

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:54.310 align:middle line:84%
of all the archetypes
who resides

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:58.210 align:middle line:84%
beyond the hologram, The
World that represents

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:02.930 align:middle line:90%
all 22 merged into one.

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:06.220 align:middle line:84%
What are some other important
correspondences of The World?

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, her esoteric
title or secret name

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:12.420 align:middle line:84%
is The Great One of
the Night of Time.

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:14.890 align:middle line:90%
And the element here is Earth.

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:18.040 align:middle line:84%
And these both relate to the
astrological correspondence

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.695 align:middle line:90%
here, which is Saturn.

00:13:19.695 --> 00:13:23.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, Saturn is a majestic
sight with its rings

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:24.910 align:middle line:90%
that encircle it.

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:27.440 align:middle line:90%
And it's a giant gas planet.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:31.210 align:middle line:84%
It's known to set limitations
and deliver hard lessons.

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:32.920 align:middle line:84%
But this is all
so that we can be

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.430 align:middle line:84%
ready to take our next
steps of evolution.

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:40.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, in astrology, Saturn rules
Capricorn and the Tenth House

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:41.940 align:middle line:90%
of career and status.

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:45.660 align:middle line:84%
And it co-rules Aquarius and
the Eleventh House of friends.

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:47.980 align:middle line:84%
And in ancient times,
Saturn was considered

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:51.730 align:middle line:84%
to be the father of the
gods, the father of time,

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:53.890 align:middle line:84%
who also gave life
to his children,

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:58.730 align:middle line:84%
but then devoured them again,
like that ouroboros sign.

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:01.900 align:middle line:84%
And wherever Saturn is
traversing in our chart,

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.000 align:middle line:84%
it's going to teach
us to learn to apply

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.870 align:middle line:84%
maturity and self-discipline
in that area of life.

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:12.460 align:middle line:84%
It's a planet of limitation
and boundaries, responsibility,

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:14.680 align:middle line:84%
doing your due
diligence, and whatever

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:18.067 align:middle line:84%
is needed to bring about
stability and structure.

00:14:18.067 --> 00:14:19.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's the important
thing here with how

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.820 align:middle line:90%
it relates to The World key.

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.800 align:middle line:84%
Because it's all
about stabilizing,

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.310 align:middle line:84%
crystallizing, solidifying,
bringing things

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:30.550 align:middle line:84%
into their final and
most stable form.

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:37.630 align:middle line:10%
And The World key here is a
mature form of our true self.

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:40.240 align:middle line:10%
Some other keywords
associated with The World

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:46.510 align:middle line:10%
include manifestation,
self-actualization, expansion,

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:52.420 align:middle line:10%
liberation, self-discipline,
and groundedness.

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:55.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, these strengths are
the pure or the balanced

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:57.620 align:middle line:90%
expressions of The World.

00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.070 align:middle line:84%
But if any of them go to
be too much, or too little,

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:02.680 align:middle line:84%
or get into distortions,
they create the weaknesses

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.622 align:middle line:84%
and the shadow
side of The World.

00:15:04.622 --> 00:15:06.580 align:middle line:84%
So some of the things
that we need to watch out

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.650 align:middle line:84%
for with The World's
shadow side would

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:12.790 align:middle line:84%
include things that are
self-limiting, melancholy,

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:17.880 align:middle line:84%
being scattered, depression,
and a lack of feeling.

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, some of the
other benefits that

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:21.180 align:middle line:84%
can be gained by
working with The World

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:23.610 align:middle line:84%
is that it helps us to
crystallize and strengthen

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:26.970 align:middle line:84%
our light body or
our magical body.

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:29.580 align:middle line:84%
Recall that this process
of invoking the 22

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:31.920 align:middle line:84%
archetypes into our
life energizes us

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.640 align:middle line:90%
in an atomic level.

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And that builds up, step by
step, that magical body, which

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:39.840 align:middle line:84%
is a more conscious
version of ourselves.

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:43.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, through it, we can manifest
more of our full potential

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:46.380 align:middle line:90%
and multi-dimensional essence.

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:48.330 align:middle line:84%
The World brings
this magical body

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:51.897 align:middle line:84%
into a more solidified
and perfected form.

00:15:51.897 --> 00:15:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And the gift that
ultimately comes with this

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:56.910 align:middle line:84%
is the balance between
flow and restriction,

00:15:56.910 --> 00:16:00.390 align:middle line:84%
teaching us that we can
create and manifest.

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:03.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, how does The World
show up in your life?

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:06.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, think of times when you've
either been or encountered

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.440 align:middle line:90%
The World in life.

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.650 align:middle line:84%
One example might be any
time that you've really

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:14.640 align:middle line:84%
felt a sense of accomplishment,
of victory and completion

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.560 align:middle line:84%
in your life,
especially if it was

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:20.280 align:middle line:84%
at the end of a long journey
towards achieving a goal.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.980 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps there were times
when you found yourself

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:26.070 align:middle line:84%
questioning the origins
of the universe as a whole

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:28.320 align:middle line:90%
and how it all works.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.870 align:middle line:84%
Or if you've ever found
yourself deeply concerned

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:32.970 align:middle line:84%
about the Earth,
you might have been

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:35.738 align:middle line:84%
feeling the influence
of The World,

00:16:35.738 --> 00:16:37.530 align:middle line:84%
especially any time
you've devoted yourself

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:40.650 align:middle line:84%
to helping make this world
a better place to live in.

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And then the more
you come to recognize

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:43.860 align:middle line:84%
The World in your
life, the more it

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:46.230 align:middle line:84%
will also connect you with
one of your parallel lives

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:50.190 align:middle line:84%
where The World is the
dominant archetype.

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:51.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, what might
our parallel life

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:54.767 align:middle line:84%
be like under the
archetype of The World?

00:16:54.767 --> 00:16:56.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, people who come in
under The World archetype

00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:00.660 align:middle line:84%
usually have a long and
arduous journey of life,

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:02.640 align:middle line:84%
but it's one that
ultimately leads them

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.520 align:middle line:90%
to true mastery and joy.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.710 align:middle line:90%
They experience it all.

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:09.270 align:middle line:90%
They learn from it all.

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:12.660 align:middle line:84%
They figure out how to balance
the polarities within them--

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:15.359 align:middle line:84%
the male to female, the
shadow, the light, the good,

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:16.385 align:middle line:90%
and the evil.

00:17:16.385 --> 00:17:18.510 align:middle line:84%
They have a deep desire to
understand the mysteries

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:20.040 align:middle line:90%
of life and the universe.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And they devote themselves
to the great work

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:25.000 align:middle line:90%
with passion and vigor.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And they discover that the path
to true service, to The World

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:32.220 align:middle line:84%
is where they will find
their greatest joy.

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And they become
enlightened leaders

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.750 align:middle line:84%
who don't just teach
from the confines

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:39.090 align:middle line:84%
of a temple or an
ashram, but who

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:43.140 align:middle line:84%
brave the great wide world,
who live life to the fullest

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.260 align:middle line:90%
and teach by example.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.940 align:middle line:84%
Siddhartha, after he
became the Buddha,

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:50.500 align:middle line:90%
might be one such example.

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And in the Western
mystery school tradition,

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:55.800 align:middle line:84%
there is an initiatory
title called Ipsissimus,

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.020 align:middle line:84%
which is the highest
level an initiate can

00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:59.730 align:middle line:90%
attain on the path.

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:02.520 align:middle line:84%
Often, they have found,
also, a sacred union

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.190 align:middle line:84%
with a partner who's
ready to serve with them

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:08.310 align:middle line:84%
and support their mission
so that together, they

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:10.590 align:middle line:84%
can weave the
creational energies

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:13.560 align:middle line:90%
of masculine and feminine.

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.540 align:middle line:84%
Examples of power
couples like this

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:19.080 align:middle line:84%
might include King
Solomon and Queen Sheba

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.940 align:middle line:84%
as well as MacGregor
Mathers and Moina

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:23.340 align:middle line:84%
Mathers, one of the founding
couples of the Hermetic

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:25.440 align:middle line:90%
Order of the Golden Dawn.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:28.500 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they will also
portray other archetypes.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.800 align:middle line:84%
But The World key is about
experiencing and integrating

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.840 align:middle line:90%
all 22 of them.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And this allows them
to wear whatever hat

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:40.660 align:middle line:84%
they need to wear for
any piece of the mission.

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, incarnations of
The World archetype

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:44.790 align:middle line:90%
are natural visionaries.

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And they find it difficult
to be limited, restricted,

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:51.180 align:middle line:84%
or restrained in any way, as
the visions of their spirit

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:55.470 align:middle line:84%
far exceed the limits of
physical practicalities.

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:58.380 align:middle line:84%
But they also realize that
they are miracle workers.

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And they can conduct
this symphony of life

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:03.030 align:middle line:84%
to orchestrate events
and people who can help

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:05.550 align:middle line:90%
them to manifest their vision.

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:09.420 align:middle line:84%
They come to serve in a mission
of global transformation

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:12.900 align:middle line:84%
and creating a new
and better world.

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And by working with The World
and evoking its energies

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.910 align:middle line:84%
into your life, you too
can awaken the ability

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:19.495 align:middle line:84%
to integrate with
your true self.

00:19:19.495 --> 00:19:22.330 align:middle line:90%


00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:25.540 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at the journey
we've been through as a whole

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:29.320 align:middle line:84%
and how we can start to merge
these 22 archetypes and our 22

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:32.070 align:middle line:90%
parallel lives into one.

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:34.170 align:middle line:84%
How do we truly
complete the work

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:36.690 align:middle line:84%
of awakening to our
multi-dimensional being

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:40.640 align:middle line:84%
so that we can harness the
fullness of who we truly are?

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.590 align:middle line:10%
And we all begin our
life as The Fool--

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:47.100 align:middle line:10%
enthusiastic, hopeful,
idealistic, naive,

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:50.160 align:middle line:10%
and carefree, feeling like
we can take on the world

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.560 align:middle line:10%
and accomplish anything.

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.990 align:middle line:84%
Then we begin our
journey of involution

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:58.590 align:middle line:84%
or the descent of learning
what it's like to be physical

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:00.775 align:middle line:90%
and to live in society.

00:20:00.775 --> 00:20:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And during this time, we learn
the fundamental archetypes

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:04.290 align:middle line:90%
of life.

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:05.430 align:middle line:90%
We become educated.

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:10.110 align:middle line:84%
And we prepare for our
mission of self-realization.

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:14.220 align:middle line:84%
As we venture away from what's
familiar into the unknown,

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:17.700 align:middle line:84%
we begin to encounter various
challenges that catalyze

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:20.430 align:middle line:90%
our alchemical transformations.

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:22.560 align:middle line:10%
We also meet several
teachers and guides

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:25.140 align:middle line:10%
along the way, who
show us the next steps

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:28.860 align:middle line:10%
to help us learn
important lessons.

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:32.580 align:middle line:10%
Then we come to a turning
point where the wheels of fate

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:36.900 align:middle line:10%
are spun and really
test our merits.

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:39.030 align:middle line:10%
We come to a gate of initiation.

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:42.720 align:middle line:10%
And at that gate, we meet
its guardian, Justice,

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:47.700 align:middle line:10%
or Ma'at, who measures our heart
against the feather of purity

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.470 align:middle line:10%
and truth.

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:51.660 align:middle line:10%
Only once we pass
her test, and show

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:54.420 align:middle line:10%
that our intentions
are true and pure,

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.070 align:middle line:10%
and that we're now
ready to cut away

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:58.110 align:middle line:10%
what doesn't serve
our progression,

00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:01.550 align:middle line:10%
are we then permitted to pass.

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, at this point,
we go through

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.170 align:middle line:84%
a willing self-sacrifice in
order to reverse our direction

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:11.100 align:middle line:84%
and begin our evolutionary
journey of ascension.

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:14.130 align:middle line:84%
This starts with a death
of the old and a journey

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:18.210 align:middle line:84%
into the underworld or the
shadow world of ourself.

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:21.000 align:middle line:10%
We must overcome our
fears and attachments

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.330 align:middle line:10%
and be tempered until we
are strong and mature in who

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:25.830 align:middle line:10%
we are.

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:28.770 align:middle line:10%
As we emerge from this
dark night experience,

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:32.040 align:middle line:10%
we find our way towards
greater light, joy,

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:36.000 align:middle line:10%
and spiritual awakening,
until finally, we

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.750 align:middle line:10%
make the leap into higher
dimensional reality and awaken

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:42.810 align:middle line:10%
to cosmic consciousness.

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:46.620 align:middle line:10%
Now, this entire journey
can be summarized by just 4

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:48.990 align:middle line:10%
of these 22 archetypes--

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:53.430 align:middle line:10%
The Fool who descends until
he comes to The Wheel.

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:55.590 align:middle line:10%
Then The Wheel
and Justice create

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:58.380 align:middle line:10%
a combination or a
pivot point to see

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.840 align:middle line:10%
if we've really learned
the lessons of balance

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.880 align:middle line:10%
and self-awareness.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:06.240 align:middle line:10%
After passing, The Fool
then gradually ascends

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:10.260 align:middle line:10%
until he becomes The World,
or the cosmic dancer.

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:14.850 align:middle line:10%
Together, these four keys
summarize the whole journey.

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:18.540 align:middle line:84%
Even just the Wheel of Fortune
card alone captures so much

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:20.100 align:middle line:90%
of this process.

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:23.610 align:middle line:84%
The serpent on the left
side shows the descent

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:28.140 align:middle line:84%
and embodies the principles
of vibration and rhythm.

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:30.480 align:middle line:90%
The Hermanubis shows the ascent.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.990 align:middle line:84%
And the red depicts the
passion and the willful action

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:39.400 align:middle line:84%
that's needed to keep on going,
even when the going gets tough.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.810 align:middle line:84%
The sphinx at the top has the
same meaning as The World key.

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:46.440 align:middle line:84%
It depicts our true self that's
free from the ups and downs

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:49.550 align:middle line:90%
of the wheels and its cycles.

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And the four holy
living creatures

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:54.530 align:middle line:84%
that surround both the
wheel and The World keys

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:57.140 align:middle line:84%
represent our need
to master and balance

00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:00.620 align:middle line:90%
the four elements of our lives.

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And inside The Wheel is
the riddle of the Sphinx.

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:07.880 align:middle line:84%
It shows the alchemy of
balancing the elements,

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:12.260 align:middle line:84%
then separating the essentials
through the act of disillusion

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:15.560 align:middle line:84%
and then accessing the
radiant light from within.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.800 align:middle line:84%
Until finally, we come
to the calm center

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:21.320 align:middle line:90%
around which the wheel rotates.

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:24.680 align:middle line:84%
This alchemical seal
also reveals a portal

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:27.160 align:middle line:90%
to higher dimensions.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.360 align:middle line:10%
Now, if we look at
The World again,

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:33.470 align:middle line:10%
we see that she's located
at the center of the oval.

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:35.720 align:middle line:84%
The center is sometimes
called the place

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.270 align:middle line:90%
of holiness in the midst.

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:41.480 align:middle line:84%
It's the eye of the
storm, the still point,

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:43.730 align:middle line:90%
the place of peace.

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:48.020 align:middle line:84%
The center acts like the zero
point or the quantum gap.

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:52.250 align:middle line:84%
It's the access point to
moving beyond the 3D hologram

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:57.820 align:middle line:84%
and into the true reality where
all is an eternal oneness.

00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:00.520 align:middle line:10%
If we return to the
231 Gates mandala,

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:04.830 align:middle line:10%
we see all the 22 archetypes
around its perimeter.

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:07.960 align:middle line:10%
And when each point is
connected with every other point

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:11.140 align:middle line:10%
and all the archetypes have
been activated and then linked

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:15.850 align:middle line:10%
with all the others, then
we see that at the center

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:18.760 align:middle line:10%
is where they all merge as one.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:20.470 align:middle line:84%
But we can only
reach this center

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:23.650 align:middle line:84%
once we've truly activated
and become aware of all 22

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:25.780 align:middle line:90%
archetypes in our lives.

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:28.270 align:middle line:84%
Each archetype has
its vices and virtues,

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:30.370 align:middle line:84%
its strengths and
weaknesses that we

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:32.800 align:middle line:90%
need to harmonize one by one.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.630 align:middle line:84%
Once we balance each
one within itself

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:38.050 align:middle line:84%
and we achieve that
state of individuation

00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:40.840 align:middle line:84%
with each archetype,
then we can begin

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.730 align:middle line:84%
the work of bringing
them altogether

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:45.476 align:middle line:90%
into coherence with each other.

00:24:45.476 --> 00:24:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And reaching the center
is like finding our way

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:51.020 align:middle line:84%
into the control
room of the cineplex

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:55.530 align:middle line:84%
where we can watch all 22 movies
of our parallel lives at once.

00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And from that control
room, or the sacred center,

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.740 align:middle line:84%
we merge with our true
self and become an avatar.

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:06.290 align:middle line:84%
That's like the moment
when Neo in "The Matrix"

00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:08.100 align:middle line:90%
becomes The One.

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And from that point on, he's
able to change the matrix

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.070 align:middle line:90%
and bend it to his will.

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:15.570 align:middle line:84%
He even reprograms
it down the line.

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:18.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, Neo is still able
to go into the matrix,

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:21.140 align:middle line:90%
but he's not bound by it.

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:26.022 align:middle line:84%
It's like saying being in
the world, but not of it.

00:25:26.022 --> 00:25:28.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, from this
central control room,

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:32.050 align:middle line:84%
we can reprogram the
hologram and change

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:36.970 align:middle line:84%
the scripts of how our movies
in life are playing out.

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:39.550 align:middle line:84%
We can create the life
that is our true destiny

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:45.490 align:middle line:84%
and birthright, a life of
joy, peace, beauty, abundance,

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:48.910 align:middle line:90%
purpose, and love.

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And not only would
we be able to change

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:53.170 align:middle line:84%
the script for
our own life, we'd

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:56.290 align:middle line:84%
also be able to step into
an active role of service

00:25:56.290 --> 00:26:00.730 align:middle line:84%
to awaken others and help them
remember who they truly are.

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:04.110 align:middle line:84%
Show them how they can
change their scripts as well.

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And when enough people start
changing their scripts,

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:08.800 align:middle line:84%
that's when we'll
reach a critical mass

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.830 align:middle line:84%
of awakening that sends
a tidal wave of evolution

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:13.840 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.910 align:middle line:84%
When the collective
consciousness of humanity

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:18.550 align:middle line:84%
shifts to a higher
octave, then we'll

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:22.130 align:middle line:84%
be able to create a better
world for all beings.

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:24.160 align:middle line:90%
We'll become galactic humans.

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.280 align:middle line:84%
And we'll take our rightful
place in the cosmos.

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:31.970 align:middle line:84%
We'll become the cosmic dancers
depicted in The World key.

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And by actively engaging with
these symbols of The World

00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:37.660 align:middle line:84%
and the 231 Gates
of mandala, you

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:40.330 align:middle line:84%
can consciously use them
as communication tools

00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:42.950 align:middle line:90%
to your true self.

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:45.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, keep track of your
dreams and insights,

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.710 align:middle line:84%
and what energies get set
in motion in your life,

00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:51.100 align:middle line:84%
and what you learn about
yourself through this process.

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And to really get the most
out of this information,

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:57.160 align:middle line:84%
put these tools into application
and journal your reflections.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:00.610 align:middle line:84%
This is about feeling it and
experiencing these energies

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:02.460 align:middle line:90%
alive in your life.

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And working with these
archetypes-- again,

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:07.820 align:middle line:84%
it reorganizes and
rewires our brain.

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:10.300 align:middle line:10%
And as we become aware
of these archetypes,

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:12.640 align:middle line:10%
then we'll consciously
be able to perceive them

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:16.570 align:middle line:10%
at work in our lives
ongoingly and eventually merge

00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:18.160 align:middle line:10%
with our true self over time.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:22.580 align:middle line:90%


00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:23.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard.

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:26.360 align:middle line:10%

the mysteries of Tarot

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.160 align:middle line:10%

multi-dimensionality with me

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:31.130 align:middle line:10%
