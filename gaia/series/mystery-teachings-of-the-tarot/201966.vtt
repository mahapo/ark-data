00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Hi.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.310 align:middle line:10%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard,
host of "Mystery Teachings".

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.800 align:middle line:10%
Now, today, I'm
going to lead you

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.620 align:middle line:10%
through a meditation on the
archetypes of The Hierophant

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:30.805 align:middle line:10%
and The Lovers.

00:00:30.805 --> 00:00:34.030 align:middle line:10%
Now, together they help
us sharpen our intuition

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.860 align:middle line:10%
and our discernment.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.240 align:middle line:10%
The Hierophant helps us to learn
and grow from our life lessons,

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.760 align:middle line:10%
as well as how to
walk a mystical path

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.300 align:middle line:10%
with practical feet,
while The Lovers help

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.730 align:middle line:10%
us to learn the
Dance of Polarity

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.500 align:middle line:10%
within our relationships
and our choices in life.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's explore now some
practical and experiential

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.810 align:middle line:84%
things that we can do to work
with both these archetypes,

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.730 align:middle line:90%
The Hierophant and The Lovers.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.640 align:middle line:84%
Here's a formula that you can
follow for invoking these two

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.220 align:middle line:90%
archetypes into your life.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.680 align:middle line:84%
First, we'll work with
one card at a time,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.200 align:middle line:90%
beginning with The Hierophant.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.990 align:middle line:84%
Once you're ready, find The
Hierophant card in your deck

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.530 align:middle line:90%
and take it out.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.560 align:middle line:84%
Place this card in front
of you at eye level.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.800 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a meditation
stool or a cushion,

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.260 align:middle line:84%
you can sit on that
in front of a table,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.350 align:middle line:84%
and then place the card
upright on the table.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.340 align:middle line:84%
Get yourself into a relaxed
position and a light meditative

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.750 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:40.800 align:middle line:84%
Take several deep breaths, relax
your body, and empty your mind.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Make sure that you're
bringing yourself

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.990 align:middle line:84%
into a positive, or at least
a neutral state of being,

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.038 align:middle line:84%
so that nothing's disturbing you
either mentally or emotionally.

Once you've accessed this
light meditative state,

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.310 align:middle line:84%
look at the image of The
Hierophant card for a while.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.680 align:middle line:84%
Keeping your eyes
open, study the card

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.220 align:middle line:90%
for about 5 to 10 minutes.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.620 align:middle line:84%
Really take in all the details,
the imagery, the symbolism.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.660 align:middle line:90%
Study all of its aspects.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.020 align:middle line:90%
Memorize it.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And begin to let that really
impress itself upon your mind.

We'll remain silent now
for the next five minutes

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.186 align:middle line:10%
as we now meditate on the
symbolism of the card.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Next, we want to take it inside
and work with it in our mind.

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:31.430 align:middle line:84%
We're going to close
our eyes, bring

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:33.440 align:middle line:84%
the image of The
Hierophant inside,

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.990 align:middle line:84%
and work with it for
another 10 minutes,

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.810 align:middle line:84%
building up all the
aspects of this image,

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.360 align:middle line:84%
remembering all the
details, all the symbols.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.550 align:middle line:90%


00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:46.880 align:middle line:90%
See the colors.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.890 align:middle line:90%
See the characters in the card.

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:53.010 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that it's a doorway,
there's a door frame,

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:55.965 align:middle line:84%
and through that door frame you
see the imagery of the card.

00:07:55.965 --> 00:07:58.690 align:middle line:90%


00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:02.780 align:middle line:84%
And once this image is firmly
established in your mind,

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.270 align:middle line:90%
let it come to life.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:09.050 align:middle line:84%
Walk through that
doorway into the scenery,

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:14.390 align:middle line:84%
and let it take on like a
virtual reality experience.

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.310 align:middle line:90%
The characters come to life.

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:17.990 align:middle line:90%
Observe them for a while.

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:22.580 align:middle line:84%
Notice what they do, how
they behave, how they move,

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:26.880 align:middle line:84%
any messages that they
might say, and especially

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.160 align:middle line:84%
feel the energy
of The Hierophant.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.020 align:middle line:84%
Notice the kind of
energy that he emanates.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:37.559 align:middle line:84%
And after observing for a while
and connecting to this energy

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:42.870 align:middle line:84%
and feeling it, then you want
to merge with The Hierophant.

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:45.090 align:middle line:90%
Become The Hierophant.

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:48.540 align:middle line:84%

those two pillars, students

You are The Hierophant.

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:10.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, really allow this
sense, this feeling

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.860 align:middle line:84%
of being The Hierophant to
fully integrate and take

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.846 align:middle line:90%

with this energy,

you're then going to sit
up straight within a chair

posture of The Hierophant.

up while the rest
are just folded.

with three cross
bars at the top.

And holding this
position, you're

going to say the
affirmation, I am

And once you feel
strong in this position

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:10.540 align:middle line:10%
as the archetypal form, you're
going to say this affirmation,

I am the Magus of
the Eternal Gods.

We are the essence of love.

00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:02.340 align:middle line:10%
All opposites are
reconciled through us.

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:04.200 align:middle line:10%
Allow that affirmation
in that energy

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.970 align:middle line:10%
to reverberate
through your being.

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:07.830 align:middle line:10%
Let it resonate.

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:13.010 align:middle line:10%
Let it awaken its energies
and vibration in yourselves.

00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:14.610 align:middle line:10%
Anchor it deeply within you.

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:58.150 align:middle line:90%


00:29:58.150 --> 00:29:59.910 align:middle line:84%
When you're ready,
we're next going

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:03.070 align:middle line:84%
to place both The Hierophant
and The Lovers cards next

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:06.730 align:middle line:84%
to each other and meditate
upon them together.

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:08.830 align:middle line:10%
Put The Hierophant
on the left side

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:11.930 align:middle line:10%
and The Lovers on
the right side.

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:15.970 align:middle line:10%
See how they
contrast each other.

00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:20.090 align:middle line:10%
See how they
complement each other.

00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:23.890 align:middle line:10%
The Hierophant stimulates your
intuition and inner voice,

00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:28.210 align:middle line:10%
and also is the education
of The Lovers, where

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:31.480 align:middle line:10%
The Lovers stimulate your
discernment and relationship

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:34.390 align:middle line:10%
abilities and making choices.

00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:36.250 align:middle line:10%
Finally, we want to
take these energies

00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:39.340 align:middle line:10%
and express them
into our outer life.

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:41.080 align:middle line:10%
Examples of how to
do that could be

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:45.130 align:middle line:10%
to bring the primary colors,
such as red and orange,

00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:48.910 align:middle line:10%
into our environment or
the colors of our clothing.

00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:51.880 align:middle line:10%
Continue meditating on these
symbols and images daily

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:54.700 align:middle line:10%
for the next week, and
work with the affirmations

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:56.320 align:middle line:10%
that we just used.

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.240 align:middle line:10%
Contemplate the
meaning of each card

00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:00.670 align:middle line:10%
and how it applies to your life.

00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:03.790 align:middle line:10%
And watch for these archetypes
to appear in your dreams.

00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:07.470 align:middle line:10%
And then, analyze whatever
messages they might give you.

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:09.940 align:middle line:10%
And pay attention also
to how you personally

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:13.322 align:middle line:10%
embody the strengths and
weaknesses of each one.

00:31:13.322 --> 00:31:15.280 align:middle line:10%
And then, consciously
work to make improvements

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:18.200 align:middle line:10%
in these areas.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And, again, realize that
when we work with archetypes,

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:23.840 align:middle line:84%
they will set forces
in motion in our life.

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:26.350 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to really
engage with this experience,

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:29.830 align:middle line:84%
then commit to seeing it all the
way through to the end working

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:33.610 align:middle line:84%
with each key in the order given
as we go through the series,

00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:37.750 align:middle line:84%
don't skip steps, and really
just give it your attention.

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:40.210 align:middle line:84%
Join me again, as
we explore further

00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:43.060 align:middle line:84%
into the 22 archetypes
of Tarot, and how

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:46.810 align:middle line:84%
they can help us to make our
big shift in consciousness.
