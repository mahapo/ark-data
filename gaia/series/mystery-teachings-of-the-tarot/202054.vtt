00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.200 align:middle line:10%
>> Hi, I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard,
host of "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.640 align:middle line:10%
And today we're
going to meditate

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.580 align:middle line:10%
on the archetypes of the Hermit
and the Wheel of Fortune.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.710 align:middle line:10%
Together, they help us to come
to trust our inner guidance

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.290 align:middle line:10%
and to hear the call of destiny.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.460 align:middle line:10%
The Hermit helps us to tap into
the wisdom and illumination

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.910 align:middle line:10%
of our higher self
through deep meditation,

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.150 align:middle line:10%
while the Wheel forms
a portal or a gateway

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.960 align:middle line:10%
to ascension that sets us
on the path of expansion

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.505 align:middle line:10%
towards our higher purpose.

00:00:52.505 --> 00:00:55.510 align:middle line:90%


00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's now explore
some practical things

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.660 align:middle line:84%
to do to work with both
these archetypes, the Hermit

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.050 align:middle line:90%
and the Wheel.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.769 align:middle line:84%
We're going to work with our
typical meditation formula

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.950 align:middle line:84%
that we can use to invoke
these archetypes into our life.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.870 align:middle line:84%
So we'll begin with
one card at a time,

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.360 align:middle line:90%
starting with the Hermit.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.060 align:middle line:10%
Once you're ready, find the
Hermit card in your deck

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.810 align:middle line:10%
and take it out.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.670 align:middle line:10%
Place the card in front of
you somewhere at eye level.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.990 align:middle line:84%
So if you have your
meditation stool or cushion,

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.150 align:middle line:84%
you can sit on that
in front of a table

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.640 align:middle line:84%
and place the card
upright on the table.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.720 align:middle line:84%
Get yourself into a relaxed
position in a light meditative

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.100 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.150 align:middle line:90%
Take several deep breaths.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.150 align:middle line:90%
Relax your body.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And begin to empty your
mind and bring yourself

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.830 align:middle line:84%
into a neutral or
a positive state

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.070 align:middle line:84%
so that you feel at peace,
no things disturbing you,

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.980 align:middle line:84%
either mentally or
emotionally, and you're

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.890 align:middle line:90%
ready for a new experience.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.240 align:middle line:84%
Once your body and your
mind relax and quiet down,

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.640 align:middle line:84%
then open your eyes
and look at the image

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.110 align:middle line:84%
of the Hermit for about five to
10 minutes with your eyes open.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.990 align:middle line:10%
Study its imagery,
its symbolism.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.370 align:middle line:10%
Take in all the details
and also its simplicity.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.920 align:middle line:10%
Really ingrain this
imagery into your mind.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.935 align:middle line:10%
As you study the imagery,
consider all of its meaning.

00:02:22.935 --> 00:02:25.940 align:middle line:90%


00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.000 align:middle line:10%
I'll remain silent now
for the next five minutes

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.670 align:middle line:10%
as we now meditate on the
symbolism of the card.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:07:22.180 align:middle line:90%


00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Take it now inside and work with
it in your mind for another 10

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:28.930 align:middle line:90%
minutes with your eyes closed.

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.290 align:middle line:84%
Really build this image
up within your mind,

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:37.030 align:middle line:84%
repeating and recreating all
the details of the Hermit,

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.160 align:middle line:84%
imagining that the
frame of the card

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.400 align:middle line:84%
is like a door and the
Hermit is on the other side

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.470 align:middle line:90%
on that mountain peak.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And really build
up those details

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.320 align:middle line:90%
and see that imagery before you.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.705 align:middle line:84%
Really allow yourself to
sink into this process.

00:07:52.705 --> 00:07:56.020 align:middle line:90%


00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And really impress this
imagery upon your subconscious

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.210 align:middle line:90%
as you meditate with the Hermit.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:07.750 align:middle line:84%
Once the image is firmly
established in your mind,

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.580 align:middle line:90%
let it come to life.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.280 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that that
doorway is now something

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.310 align:middle line:90%
that you are walking through.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And as you walk
to the other side,

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:19.870 align:middle line:84%
it takes on a three-dimensional
virtual reality

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:23.530 align:middle line:90%
type of imagery and setting.

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And allow the Hermit
to come to life.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:28.960 align:middle line:84%
Just observe the
Hermit for a while.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.370 align:middle line:90%
Notice his way of being.

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:33.960 align:middle line:90%
He might have a message.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.799 align:middle line:90%
Just receive that.

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:43.250 align:middle line:10%
And feel the energy that
the Hermit emanates.

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:46.010 align:middle line:10%
See the light that
shines out of his lamp.

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:50.400 align:middle line:90%


00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:57.950 align:middle line:10%
Notice how balanced the Hermit
is and how much of a connection

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:01.160 align:middle line:10%
is established between
above and below,

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.110 align:middle line:10%
between the eternal
and the physical.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:13:46.870 align:middle line:90%


00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:49.840 align:middle line:10%
Once you feel firmly
connected to and established

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:54.400 align:middle line:10%
with this energy, next you're
going to merge with the Hermit.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.650 align:middle line:10%
Become the Hermit.

00:13:56.650 --> 00:14:00.790 align:middle line:10%
See and feel him come
alive within you.

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:01.780 align:middle line:10%
You are the Hermit.

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:08.980 align:middle line:90%


00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:16.360 align:middle line:10%
Taking on all of his qualities
of wisdom and attainment,

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:19.680 align:middle line:10%
remembering that this is your
inner guide or higher self

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.610 align:middle line:10%
you're connecting to.

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:25.220 align:middle line:10%
And when you feel
integrated with this energy,

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:27.200 align:middle line:10%
you're going to stand
up and actually take

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.600 align:middle line:10%
on the posture of the Hermit.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:33.590 align:middle line:10%
Assume his archetypal
form and body positioning.

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:36.140 align:middle line:10%
You're holding the staff
with your left hand

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:38.300 align:middle line:10%
and the lantern with
your right hand,

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:42.290 align:middle line:10%
and the head is slightly bowed.

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:46.460 align:middle line:10%
From this position, you're
going to say the affirmation--

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:50.030 align:middle line:10%
I am the prophet of the
eternal and the magus

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:53.120 align:middle line:10%
of the voice of power.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:57.080 align:middle line:10%
I am one with the
universal will.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:57.995 align:middle line:10%
I am.

00:14:57.995 --> 00:15:01.690 align:middle line:90%


00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:04.540 align:middle line:10%
Feel those words
reverberating within you

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:08.620 align:middle line:10%
and activating
within yourselves.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.780 align:middle line:10%
And really integrate this
energy of the Hermit.

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:59.665 align:middle line:90%


00:15:59.665 --> 00:16:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And then when
you're ready, we're

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.070 align:middle line:84%
going to move on to doing the
same process with the Wheel

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:05.570 align:middle line:90%
card.

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:07.340 align:middle line:90%
So find your Wheel card.

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:09.230 align:middle line:84%
Place it in the
position where you

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:12.690 align:middle line:90%
can look at it at eye level.

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:16.140 align:middle line:84%
Sit in your meditation
stool or position.

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And begin to study the
Wheel with your eyes

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:22.470 align:middle line:84%
open for five to 10
minutes, meditating upon it,

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:25.290 align:middle line:84%
taking in all of its
details, studying

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:26.890 align:middle line:90%
all the different aspects.

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:29.820 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot going on
here with the Wheel card.

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:33.660 align:middle line:84%
Really take your time memorizing
the imagery and the symbolism

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:36.887 align:middle line:84%
of this card while also
contemplating the meaning

00:16:36.887 --> 00:16:37.845 align:middle line:90%
of each of the symbols.

00:16:37.845 --> 00:21:36.420 align:middle line:90%


00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.030 align:middle line:84%
Once you feel like you've
really got the imagery,

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:42.970 align:middle line:84%
you're going to close your
eyes and take this image inside

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:46.500 align:middle line:84%
and work with it in your inner
mind with your eyes closed

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:47.300 align:middle line:90%
for 10 minutes.

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:50.100 align:middle line:90%


00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:54.270 align:middle line:10%
Really build up and
recreate the imagery inside,

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:59.190 align:middle line:10%
all the details, all the colors,
all the symbols going on here

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:05.140 align:middle line:10%
with the Wheel, first allowing
it to just be a static image,

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:09.800 align:middle line:10%
and the frame of a card
becomes like a door.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And on the other
side of that door,

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.030 align:middle line:84%
you see the imagery
of the Wheel.

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:17.780 align:middle line:84%
Once you've built up this
energy and this imagery,

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:20.360 align:middle line:84%
then you're going to
let it come to life.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:24.230 align:middle line:84%
You're going to move through
the doorway into the scene.

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:26.690 align:middle line:10%
Let it take on a
three-dimensional experience

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:28.100 align:middle line:10%
around you.

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:31.490 align:middle line:10%
And let all these characters
of the Wheel come to life.

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:34.730 align:middle line:10%
Watch as the Wheel
spins and rotates

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:37.190 align:middle line:10%
and the various cycles
of transformation

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:38.435 align:middle line:10%
and transmutation happen.

00:22:38.435 --> 00:22:41.590 align:middle line:90%


00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:43.030 align:middle line:10%
Observe the Wheel.

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:45.790 align:middle line:10%
Observe all the characters
and what they're going through

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:48.210 align:middle line:10%
and how they're expressing.

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:50.265 align:middle line:10%
Feel the energy of the Wheel.

00:22:50.265 --> 00:22:55.770 align:middle line:90%


00:22:55.770 --> 00:23:03.020 align:middle line:10%
Notice, especially, the
Sphinx and its way of being.

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:06.905 align:middle line:10%
And you might even
receive a message.

00:23:06.905 --> 00:23:09.880 align:middle line:84%
Just take in and allow
yourself to receive all

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:12.150 align:middle line:84%
that this card has
to offer to you.

00:23:12.150 --> 00:27:58.665 align:middle line:90%


00:27:58.665 --> 00:28:01.400 align:middle line:10%
And then when you feel
connected to this energy

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.650 align:middle line:10%
of the card of the
Wheel, now you're

00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:05.630 align:middle line:10%
going to merge with the Wheel.

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:06.920 align:middle line:10%
Become the Wheel.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:11.060 align:middle line:90%


00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:15.650 align:middle line:10%
Feel its cycles, its movement.

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:20.890 align:middle line:10%
But also take yourself into
the position of the Sphinx

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:24.160 align:middle line:10%
and feel that eternal
being, your true self

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.880 align:middle line:10%
that the Sphinx represents.

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:28.570 align:middle line:10%


00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:32.370 align:middle line:10%
It stands above and beyond
the Wheel and its cycles.

00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:37.310 align:middle line:10%
And yet it also controls
the cycles of the Wheel.

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:40.240 align:middle line:10%
Then, when you feel
integrated with this energy,

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:42.200 align:middle line:10%
sit up in a chair
and actually take

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.640 align:middle line:10%
on that posture of the Sphinx.

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:48.010 align:middle line:10%
Assume its archetypal form.

00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:50.080 align:middle line:10%
Imagine that you're
holding a sword

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:53.680 align:middle line:10%
in your left hand, which is
resting on your left shoulder.

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:55.660 align:middle line:10%
You visualize that
Wheel spinning

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:57.670 align:middle line:10%
below you, which is
spinning clockwise

00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:00.530 align:middle line:10%
from your perspective.

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:02.150 align:middle line:10%
From this position
of the Sphinx,

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:06.940 align:middle line:10%
you're observing those cycles
of involution and evolution,

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:09.850 align:middle line:10%
the descending
and the ascending,

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:14.030 align:middle line:10%
the flux and the reflux, the
cycles of cause and effect.

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:17.430 align:middle line:90%


00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:20.400 align:middle line:10%
Also, connect to the four
fixed points around you

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.070 align:middle line:10%
that are anchored by the
four holy living creatures

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:25.730 align:middle line:10%
or the angelic beings.

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:28.530 align:middle line:10%
And feel the contrast
between the rotation

00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:32.985 align:middle line:10%
of the Wheel and the
eternal being that just is.

00:29:32.985 --> 00:29:36.720 align:middle line:90%


00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:40.230 align:middle line:10%
Once you feel this merging
and this connection,

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:43.590 align:middle line:10%
say this affirmation--

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:47.320 align:middle line:10%
I am the lord of
the forces of life.

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:50.580 align:middle line:10%
I am the cycle of life.

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:55.095 align:middle line:10%
Every effect has its cause,
every cause its effect.

00:29:55.095 --> 00:29:59.460 align:middle line:90%


00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:03.360 align:middle line:10%
Feel those words reverberate
throughout your being,

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:07.250 align:middle line:10%
activating the atoms and
the cells of your body

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:09.200 align:middle line:10%
and integrating more
fully within you.

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:47.890 align:middle line:90%


00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
feel complete, we're

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:52.640 align:middle line:84%
going to now work with both
the Hermit and the Wheel cards

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:53.850 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:55.860 align:middle line:10%
So place them next
to each other,

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:58.400 align:middle line:10%
and we're going to
meditate upon them together

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:02.900 align:middle line:10%
with the Hermit on the left
and the Wheel on the right.

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:06.140 align:middle line:10%
As you meditate upon
them and observe them,

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:08.570 align:middle line:10%
notice how they contrast
with each other.

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:11.400 align:middle line:10%


00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:13.220 align:middle line:10%
Notice, also, how
they complement

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:15.260 align:middle line:10%
each other and what
kind of connections

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:17.195 align:middle line:10%
there might be between
these two cards.

00:31:17.195 --> 00:31:20.720 align:middle line:90%


00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:23.870 align:middle line:10%
The Hermit simulates your
inner guide and the ability

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:28.730 align:middle line:10%
to know thyself, while the
Wheel stimulates change

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:29.960 align:middle line:10%
and the cycles of destiny.

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:33.080 align:middle line:90%


00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:35.030 align:middle line:10%
Finally, we want to
take these energies

00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:39.440 align:middle line:10%
and express them into our outer
life so that they can manifest.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:43.250 align:middle line:10%
So ways to do this would include
bringing the primary colors

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:46.010 align:middle line:10%
of gray and purple
into your environment

00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:48.650 align:middle line:10%
or the color of your clothing.

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:51.020 align:middle line:10%
Meditate upon the
symbols and the images

00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:54.530 align:middle line:10%
daily for the next week and keep
working with these affirmations

00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:56.510 align:middle line:10%
that we just used.

00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:58.730 align:middle line:10%
Also, contemplate the
meaning of each card

00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:01.460 align:middle line:10%
and how it applies
into your life.

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:03.020 align:middle line:10%
Really watch for
those archetypes

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:06.890 align:middle line:10%
to appear in your life during
synchronicities as well

00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:10.430 align:middle line:10%
as in your dreams and
really analyze any messages

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:12.930 align:middle line:10%
that they might be
delivering to you.

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:14.480 align:middle line:10%
And pay attention
especially to how

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:18.630 align:middle line:10%
you embody the strengths and
the weaknesses of each one.

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:20.630 align:middle line:10%
And then consciously
work to make improvements

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:21.430 align:middle line:10%
in these areas.

00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:23.703 align:middle line:90%


00:32:23.703 --> 00:32:25.370 align:middle line:84%
Remember, again, that
when we're working

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:27.950 align:middle line:84%
with archetypes like
this, they will set forces

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:29.060 align:middle line:90%
in motion in our life.

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:31.760 align:middle line:84%
They will catalyze
that alchemy for us.

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.990 align:middle line:84%
So we really want
to pay attention.

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And if we're going
to engage with this

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:38.330 align:middle line:84%
in an experiential
way, then really

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:42.290 align:middle line:84%
commit to seeing it all the way
through, doing each key step

00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:45.890 align:middle line:84%
by step in the order given
as we go through this series,

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:50.490 align:middle line:84%
and really give it
your full attention.

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:53.640 align:middle line:84%
By actively engaging with
these symbols, with each key,

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:56.640 align:middle line:84%
we are using them
as doorways or tools

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:58.890 align:middle line:84%
for communication
to our true self.

00:32:58.890 --> 00:32:59.820 align:middle line:90%
And it will continue.

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:01.260 align:middle line:84%
The further we
go, the more these

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:03.735 align:middle line:84%
are going to awaken
within your psyche.

00:33:03.735 --> 00:33:06.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, remember to keep
track of your insights,

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:09.960 align:middle line:84%
your dreams, any energies that
get set in motion in your life.

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:13.110 align:middle line:84%
Really just observe and
notice what happens.

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And notice what you
learn about yourself,

00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:18.055 align:middle line:84%
and write these things down
throughout the journey.

00:33:18.055 --> 00:33:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And to really get
the most out of this,

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.930 align:middle line:84%
put those tools
into application.

00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:23.670 align:middle line:90%
Journal your reflections.

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And remember to really tune into
the feeling and the experience

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:30.250 align:middle line:90%
of these energies in your life.

00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:33.190 align:middle line:84%
Working with these archetypes is
going to reorganize and rewire

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:34.300 align:middle line:90%
our brain.

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And over time, it even begins
to rewire and reorganize

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.130 align:middle line:90%
our soul body.

00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:42.130 align:middle line:84%
The more we become aware
of these archetypes,

00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:43.930 align:middle line:84%
the more we will
consciously begin

00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:48.250 align:middle line:84%
to perceive them at work in our
lives and in our relationships.

00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And then this process
is energizing us

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:53.380 align:middle line:84%
at an atomic level,
at a cellular level,

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:55.820 align:middle line:84%
creating that magical
body step by step,

00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:59.140 align:middle line:84%
building it up so that we can
become more conscious versions

00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:00.760 align:middle line:90%
of ourselves.

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And through it, we can
manifest our full potential

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:06.030 align:middle line:90%
and our multidimensional being.

00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:08.770 align:middle line:84%
Join me again as
we explore further

00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:11.620 align:middle line:84%
into the 22 archetypes
of Tarot and how

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:16.020 align:middle line:84%
they can help us to make our
big shift in consciousness.

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:21.000 align:middle line:90%
