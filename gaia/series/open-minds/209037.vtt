I'm sitting writing and I get

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.700 align:middle line:84%
deeper and deeper
into the story.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm hooked.

have two characters--

Grace being the embodiment
of the divine feminine.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.770 align:middle line:84%
Luke is on his course
of the divine masculine.

The beauty of this relationship
as Luke and Grace go

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.550 align:middle line:84%
through the life times that
are portrayed in the next three

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.590 align:middle line:84%
books is that their love,
of course, is eternal

and they recognize each other.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.280 align:middle line:84%
And so these stories
enable us to remember

who we fundamentally are.

This isn't a classic historical

>> REGINA: Last time we
had Gates McKibbin with us,

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.910 align:middle line:10%
we spoke of democracy according
to her channeling from three

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.130 align:middle line:10%
former founding
fathers and presidents.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.420 align:middle line:10%
A beautifully clear idea of
democracy in its purest form.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.390 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're focusing on an
equally beautiful and clear

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.960 align:middle line:84%
take on a subject, that of
love between twin flames.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.490 align:middle line:84%
The only danger
here is that you'll

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.910 align:middle line:84%
be tempted to wait it out until
you can reunite with yours

after hearing all of this.

00:01:34.993 --> 00:01:36.910 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm hearing
from the people who've

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.110 align:middle line:90%
read the series of books.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.630 align:middle line:90%
It is so juicy and tempting.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.192 align:middle line:90%
So welcome back, Gates.

00:01:42.192 --> 00:01:43.150 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: Thank you.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.878 align:middle line:10%
It's so good to be back and
talking about love this time.

00:01:46.878 --> 00:01:47.920 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: You know what?

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.720 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.370 align:middle line:84%
What the world needs
now is love, sweet love.

Man, there couldn't be
a more perfect topic

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:55.970 align:middle line:90%
for the times than love.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.710 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, here you're
talking to dead presidents

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.900 align:middle line:84%
and now, this is a
whole different thing

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.330 align:middle line:90%
that happened back then, right?

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.820 align:middle line:84%
Wasn't this from,
maybe, 20 years

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.170 align:middle line:90%
ago when this first started?

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.420 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: About 20 years ago,
I get guidance from spirit that

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.410 align:middle line:90%
is very simple.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.830 align:middle line:84%
Grab a journal, grab a
pen, let's get started.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And then you just--
you're sitting here like this

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.455 align:middle line:90%
and your hand's doing this.

00:02:20.455 --> 00:02:23.590 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: And I never know
what the topic is going to be.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.180 align:middle line:10%
So I started writing the first
book, it was about Atlantis.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow,
this is different.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.660 align:middle line:10%
I wonder if it's real, I
wonder if it's authentic,

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.655 align:middle line:10%
I wonder if they're
making this up.

00:02:36.655 --> 00:02:39.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's important
because you personally

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.492 align:middle line:84%
didn't know anything
about Atlantis.

00:02:41.492 --> 00:02:43.075 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's not
in your wheelhouse.

00:02:43.075 --> 00:02:43.765 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: No.

00:02:43.765 --> 00:02:44.020 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.395 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now, first people
need to know you were a very

00:02:46.395 --> 00:02:47.855 align:middle line:90%
high-powered businesswoman, OK?

00:02:47.855 --> 00:02:48.655 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: Yes.

00:02:48.655 --> 00:02:50.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You were a very
successful high powered

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.370 align:middle line:84%
businesswoman and you got--
you became ill at one point,

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.100 align:middle line:84%
something happened, cracked
open the old egg here up

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.170 align:middle line:84%
to the universe, and things
started pouring through you.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.800 align:middle line:84%
So just to get that
background out of the way,

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.790 align:middle line:84%
you were not studying
esoterica like this at all.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.000 align:middle line:90%
So let's now go from there.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.720 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: Wasn't studying
anything about Atlantis.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.270 align:middle line:90%
I had never read about Atlantis.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.230 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, I'm sitting
writing about what

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.640 align:middle line:84%
I think is a fantasy, a fiction,
something that may or may not

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.470 align:middle line:90%
have existed.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:33.100 align:middle line:84%
And a couple who come together
after an androgynous person,

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.350 align:middle line:84%
makes the choice of going
through a high frequency

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.850 align:middle line:84%
spiritual process and
being split into two.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.730 align:middle line:84%
Into identical twins--
a male and a female.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.130 align:middle line:84%
So I'm writing all of this
thinking, this is phenomenal.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.580 align:middle line:90%
How can it be real?

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:53.770 align:middle line:90%
How can it be true?

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.550 align:middle line:84%
But I keep going and I
get deeper and deeper

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.810 align:middle line:90%
into the story.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:59.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm hooked.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:00.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.145 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, now, and you're
writing this longhand.

00:04:03.145 --> 00:04:04.062 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: Longhand.

00:04:04.062 --> 00:04:06.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: On a piece of paper
with a pen and your hand--

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.910 align:middle line:84%
you will write hours and hours
a day but your hand doesn't even

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:10.710 align:middle line:90%
cramp.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.280 align:middle line:90%
It's not even you writing.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.400 align:middle line:84%
They were using your hand
to do automatic writing.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, the interesting thing
about what you just brought up,

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.660 align:middle line:84%
in hermetic texts, it does
talk about that process

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:28.520 align:middle line:84%
of a ray, a soul splitting in
to twin rays of male and female.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.588 align:middle line:84%
This is part of
hermetic teachings

00:04:30.588 --> 00:04:32.380 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know that
you're aware of that.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.770 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: Unaware of it.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:34.570 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:35.470 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:36.860 align:middle line:90%
So let's continue on.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.390 align:middle line:84%
So you're being downloaded and
so this story is progressing

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.293 align:middle line:90%
and you have two characters.

00:04:42.293 --> 00:04:43.210 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about them.

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.260 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: Luke and Grace.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.060 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.120 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: Luke takes a
job at a research institute,

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.440 align:middle line:84%
he thinks it's totally
legitimate, and finds out that,

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.440 align:middle line:84%
in fact, they're doing a lot of
corrupted research that is out

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.970 align:middle line:84%
of alignment with anything
that can be considered ethical.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.040 align:middle line:90%
And he begins to dig into it.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.210 align:middle line:84%
To try to discover what
are they doing really

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:17.050 align:middle line:84%
which is trying to supersede
the power of spirit

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.510 align:middle line:84%
by implanting cells,
implanting technological cells

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.750 align:middle line:84%
or chips into the
brains of people

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.840 align:middle line:84%
who are their subjects
of these experiments.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:35.410 align:middle line:84%
They have the ridiculous idea
that technology can be stronger

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:36.280 align:middle line:90%
than spirit.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.050 align:middle line:90%
Stronger than the divine.

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And that would give them
control over everything.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What's
interesting about this,

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.720 align:middle line:84%
Ray Kurzweil who many
people would say is kind

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.200 align:middle line:84%
of the godfather of
AI and, probably,

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.730 align:middle line:84%
the primary research center for
AI is MIT in the United States,

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:55.580 align:middle line:90%
anyway.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And now what you're
talking about

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.675 align:middle line:84%
are the very things that are
being grappled with in society,

00:06:01.675 --> 00:06:03.740 align:middle line:90%
in that world at large.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.060 align:middle line:84%
This is the exact subject
that's now on the table.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.550 align:middle line:84%
Even television shows and
movies are being made about it.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.700 align:middle line:84%
So you must have been
channeling it and picking it up

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.600 align:middle line:84%
when they were very first
contemplating or working

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.110 align:middle line:90%
on this technology.

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.220 align:middle line:84%
So what you're doing
is giving a forewarning

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.110 align:middle line:90%
to people in these books.

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.660 align:middle line:90%
So continue on what happens.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:30.250 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: So he finds out--
he has absolute evidence that

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:36.640 align:middle line:84%
the experimentation that's going
on is corrupted and takes that

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:42.130 align:middle line:84%
evidence to the tribunal
which, purportedly, is ethical,

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:47.620 align:middle line:84%
purportedly has a high level
of integrity and he is thrown

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.430 align:middle line:90%
into prison.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.810 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime,
Grace has discovered

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.010 align:middle line:84%
that she can commune with
plants and that, in fact, she

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:00.740 align:middle line:84%
understands the healing
power of plants.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.160 align:middle line:84%
She creates a
healing center that's

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.940 align:middle line:84%
based on the use
of herbs and also

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:11.120 align:middle line:84%
personal responsibility
for one's own health

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:16.310 align:middle line:84%
rather than leading a
profligate decadent life

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.780 align:middle line:84%
and then turning to
technology to change it all.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.730 align:middle line:90%
To get-- to make you healthy.

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.230 align:middle line:84%
So it's about personal
responsibility,

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.770 align:middle line:90%
it's about health and healing.

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And the healing center
becomes so successful.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:37.140 align:middle line:84%
She creates kiosks that sell
healing soup to everyone.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, give a lot of it--
the kiosks give a lot of it

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.030 align:middle line:90%
away.

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:46.090 align:middle line:84%
So Grace is on her
own dynamic course.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:49.350 align:middle line:84%
Being the embodiment of
the divine feminine, which

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:53.020 align:middle line:84%
is all about healing and
creating and nurturing

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.640 align:middle line:84%
and being there
for the community.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.870 align:middle line:84%
Luke is on his course of
the divine masculine, which

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:05.070 align:middle line:84%
is uncovering the
lack of integrity

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:10.525 align:middle line:84%
as the masculine attempts
to control every God.

00:08:10.525 --> 00:08:11.325 align:middle line:90%
Play God.

00:08:11.325 --> 00:08:12.125 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:12.125 --> 00:08:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: He's in present
and the question then becomes,

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.350 align:middle line:90%
what happens?

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:19.380 align:middle line:84%
What happens with the
information he has?

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:22.005 align:middle line:84%
Is it going to be
suppressed completely?

00:08:22.005 --> 00:08:22.805 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:08:22.805 --> 00:08:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: Can he
get out of prison?

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:25.858 align:middle line:90%
What do they do?

00:08:25.858 --> 00:08:27.900 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you're not
going to tell because--

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:28.192 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: I'm not.

00:08:28.192 --> 00:08:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We don't want to--
we don't want to do any--

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:32.909 align:middle line:84%
we'll have to do a bunch
of spoiler alerts here.

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:35.370 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to spoil
it for anybody because this

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:37.590 align:middle line:84%
is a series of four
books that are really

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:41.010 align:middle line:84%
meant to be read sequentially
because these two

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:43.960 align:middle line:84%
progress in time as they
continue finding each other.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.310 align:middle line:84%
So we won't tell what
happens to spoil the plot.

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:51.000 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, this
was flowing through you.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.240 align:middle line:90%
The point of it.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.760 align:middle line:90%
I want to get to this question.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:09:00.590 align:middle line:84%
After all these books came
through you, did you ask why?

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Why are you following this
information through me

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:05.490 align:middle line:90%
at this time?

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.035 align:middle line:84%
And I want to know the
answer to that before we go

00:09:08.035 --> 00:09:10.410 align:middle line:84%
and so we have a framework
for the rest of these stories.

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:12.120 align:middle line:84%
That's just the
beginning of book 1.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:16.020 align:middle line:84%
Really doesn't even talk
about the incredible integrity

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.790 align:middle line:84%
and beauty of the union
between these two people

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:21.030 align:middle line:84%
who any male or female
would say yes, that's

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:22.320 align:middle line:90%
how I want to do it.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.480 align:middle line:84%
So why was it
flowing through you?

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.780 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: Great question.

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:29.250 align:middle line:84%
I ask that because,
again, I was wondering,

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:32.550 align:middle line:84%
why am I writing
fiction after working

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:36.660 align:middle line:84%
with presidents after publishing
seven volumes of wisdom

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.480 align:middle line:84%
from the other side
and now fiction.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.660 align:middle line:84%
The answer was
very clear, we have

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:50.460 align:middle line:84%
fallen into a pattern of
the disempowered feminine

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.280 align:middle line:84%
and the overly
powerful masculine.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.220 align:middle line:84%
The dominant masculine,
the patriarchy.

00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And the feminine has allowed
itself to become powerless

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:08.190 align:middle line:84%
in the face of that dominant,
overwhelming patriarchy, which

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.680 align:middle line:90%
has been going on for millennia.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.260 align:middle line:84%
It's in the collective
consciousness.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And we may not realize it, but
we're being affected by it.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:24.420 align:middle line:84%
So what better way to remind
us that we're all divine,

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:27.990 align:middle line:84%
we all have the capacity
for divine love.

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:31.830 align:middle line:84%
To be divine love, to
hold that divine love.

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:36.930 align:middle line:84%
We all can be in
relationship with another

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:40.890 align:middle line:84%
that is rooted in that
divinity rather than

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:46.200 align:middle line:84%
a relationship that exists
because of extreme compromises.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.470 align:middle line:84%
For the male, what
we call the divine

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:54.270 align:middle line:84%
masculine is really someone
who's capable of right action.

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:55.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:56.340 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: Right action.

00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:01.090 align:middle line:84%
What we call the divine
feminine is someone who

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:05.185 align:middle line:90%
stands in her power to create.

00:11:05.185 --> 00:11:09.530 align:middle line:84%
You bring those two
together in love,

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:14.300 align:middle line:84%
and then we're able to
live in our divinity, which

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:15.950 align:middle line:90%
is why we're here.

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:19.280 align:middle line:84%
But we've so walked
away from that.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.000 align:middle line:90%
We've fallen away from it.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.820 align:middle line:90%
We've lost touch with it.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:26.600 align:middle line:84%
These novels give
readers the opportunity--

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.805 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's like a
blueprint for what can be.

00:11:29.805 --> 00:11:30.605 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: Yes.

00:11:30.605 --> 00:11:33.260 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, and we don't
have any other blueprints.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.300 align:middle line:84%
I can't think of
another blueprint

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.050 align:middle line:84%
out there that even comes close
to these books in what can be.

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing is, we
see the entertainment industry,

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:49.430 align:middle line:84%
for example, picking up the
themes of the über warrioress

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:50.570 align:middle line:90%
woman, right?

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:53.330 align:middle line:84%
She's going to kick ass even
harder than the guys do.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:56.900 align:middle line:84%
She's the lead person now even
in a lot of films, for example,

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.690 align:middle line:84%
and doing things
the way men do it.

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:02.220 align:middle line:84%
Although maybe even more
brutal, for example.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:03.890 align:middle line:84%
So that's supposed
to be empowering

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:07.640 align:middle line:84%
young women to know that
they can play alongside men.

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:11.460 align:middle line:84%
But what you just said
that's so important here.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:15.270 align:middle line:84%
The ancestral memory
that is in our DNA--

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:18.300 align:middle line:84%
masculine and feminine,
every time we incarnate

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:21.120 align:middle line:84%
is affecting us and
in our subconscious,

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.910 align:middle line:84%
that's great subconscious
that we have.

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:24.870 align:middle line:90%
It's in us.

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And you can be a millennial,
you can be a little Zoomer

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.720 align:middle line:90%
girl who's feeling her power.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.390 align:middle line:84%
You get with a boy and suddenly
you're just like, oh, well,

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:34.810 align:middle line:90%
whatever you want to do.

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:39.360 align:middle line:84%
It's baked into the cake
now because of the millennia

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.840 align:middle line:84%
of living under this
agreed upon or not

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.820 align:middle line:84%
agreed upon situation
between men and women.

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.980 align:middle line:90%
So this does affect us all.

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:48.780 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:50.700 align:middle line:84%
We may not remember
but it's even

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.652 align:middle line:84%
affecting the
youngest generations

00:12:52.652 --> 00:12:53.610 align:middle line:90%
and they don't know it.

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:54.930 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: I agree.

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And so these stories
enable us to remember

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:04.950 align:middle line:84%
who we fundamentally are
and to celebrate who we are.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:08.610 align:middle line:84%
The beauty of this relationship
as Luke and Grace go

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:11.820 align:middle line:84%
through the lifetimes that are
portrayed in the next three

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:16.830 align:middle line:84%
books is that their love,
of course, is eternal

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:20.220 align:middle line:90%
and they recognize each other.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.715 align:middle line:90%
But these aren't fantasies.

00:13:22.715 --> 00:13:26.870 align:middle line:84%
They're living in
difficult circumstances.

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:29.875 align:middle line:84%
But the quality of their
relationship as equals--

00:13:29.875 --> 00:13:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And
the communication.

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:32.090 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: Yes.

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:33.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: All of it.

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:35.120 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: Their
decision making.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:38.180 align:middle line:84%
Everything about who
they are together

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:41.900 align:middle line:84%
is an affirmation of
the extraordinariness

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:45.450 align:middle line:84%
that they are individually
and who they are together.

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:49.730 align:middle line:84%
And I love that as kind
of a thread running

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:51.260 align:middle line:90%
through all of the stories.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.597 align:middle line:84%
They never compromise
their relationship ever.

00:13:53.597 --> 00:13:55.805 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And they don't
compromise their integrity.

00:13:55.805 --> 00:13:56.510 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: No.

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:59.010 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Even if it means
they have to sacrifice something

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:00.410 align:middle line:90%
in the relationship.

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:03.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's-- again, it's the
most beautiful template I have

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:07.760 align:middle line:84%
ever seen for what is the
potential between the masculine

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:08.580 align:middle line:90%
and the feminine.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.190 align:middle line:90%
So we got to continue on.

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:12.690 align:middle line:84%
That's just book 1 and
we just kind of teased

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:13.490 align:middle line:90%
a little bit of it.

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:15.470 align:middle line:10%
But let's go in
now to book number

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:19.970 align:middle line:10%
2 which is called
"Love, 24 AD" and--

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:22.130 align:middle line:10%
while I loved all
of the books, I

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:24.110 align:middle line:10%
think that one was my favorite.

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's take us into
the times of history.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And again, important
to note, you're

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.510 align:middle line:84%
writing about historical
figures in this book

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:34.457 align:middle line:90%
you had never even heard of.

00:14:34.457 --> 00:14:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out you
went and looked them up

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:39.620 align:middle line:84%
and they were real historical
figures in that time.

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:42.810 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I love it because
you're actually channeling it.

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:46.055 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
"Love, 24 AD."

00:14:46.055 --> 00:14:51.120 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: Gracila is the
daughter of a woman healer.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.320 align:middle line:84%
She lives in a
community of women.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And they work at
such a high frequency

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.080 align:middle line:84%
and live at such
a high frequency

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:06.520 align:middle line:84%
that the community is, actually,
invisible most of the time.

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:11.010 align:middle line:84%
Lukan is the son of
a tribal chieftain.

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And their parents-- her
mother and his father

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:17.070 align:middle line:90%
were together in Atlantis.

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:19.260 align:middle line:84%
They've come back
together in order

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.997 align:middle line:84%
to give birth to these two
and then bring them together

00:15:22.997 --> 00:15:23.955 align:middle line:90%
when the time is right.

00:15:23.955 --> 00:15:25.920 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And this is
in ancient Britannia.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.060 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: Ancient--

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:27.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.670 align:middle line:90%
Yes, Britannia.

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:32.160 align:middle line:90%
She's born in 24 AD.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.085 align:middle line:90%
So the story starts then.

00:15:35.085 --> 00:15:38.670 align:middle line:84%
They find each other, they,
of course, love each other.

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:44.160 align:middle line:84%
They marry and, simultaneously,
the Roman invasion

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.150 align:middle line:90%
is about to occur.

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:45.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:48.600 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: So just when they
get married and start a life

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:55.380 align:middle line:84%
together, they have to face this
horrific invasion on the part

00:15:55.380 --> 00:16:04.110 align:middle line:84%
of a very sophisticated
Roman Legion which has highly

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:06.420 align:middle line:90%
developed weaponry--

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:09.570 align:middle line:84%
engineering,
organizational capacity.

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And here are these tribes that
come together but not really

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:18.780 align:middle line:84%
that have been existing
independently around Britannia,

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:21.510 align:middle line:84%
they've got to
defend against this.

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:25.860 align:middle line:84%
Lukan's father
understands quickly

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:31.830 align:middle line:84%
that it's not going to be
possible for the tribes

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:34.860 align:middle line:84%
to defend themselves
effectively.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:39.330 align:middle line:84%
He sees what the
Romans bring with them

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:43.050 align:middle line:84%
and knows that the
only solution is

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:45.210 align:middle line:90%
to create a negotiated peace.

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:48.330 align:middle line:84%
This is after they've gone
on to the battlefield,

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:49.785 align:middle line:90%
they've tried their best.

00:16:49.785 --> 00:16:52.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And Gracila and
Lukan have been separated

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:55.485 align:middle line:84%
and he's been wounded pretty
severely in battle, actually.

00:16:55.485 --> 00:16:57.322 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: Yes,
Lukan is wounded.

00:16:57.322 --> 00:16:58.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: He chose to do it.

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:00.655 align:middle line:84%
His father tried to get
him out of it, he said, no.

00:17:00.655 --> 00:17:02.875 align:middle line:84%
Again, living to-- if
we're sending the others,

00:17:02.875 --> 00:17:03.675 align:middle line:90%
we're sending me.

00:17:03.675 --> 00:17:04.275 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: Exactly.

00:17:04.275 --> 00:17:04.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:05.829 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: Exactly.

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And so when his father
approaches Vespasian and says,

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:15.329 align:middle line:84%
I want to have a
conversation with you,

00:17:15.329 --> 00:17:19.710 align:middle line:84%
one tribal chieftain to
another commander of legions,

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:22.109 align:middle line:84%
let's see if we can
find common ground.

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:25.140 align:middle line:90%
And in fact, they do.

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:28.140 align:middle line:84%
It is one of my favorite
parts of the story.

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:30.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's one of my
favorite parts of all four

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:31.020 align:middle line:90%
books, is that.

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:31.695 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: Is it?

00:17:31.695 --> 00:17:31.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:32.520 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: Me too.

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:33.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.865 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: Because here
are these purported enemies.

00:17:35.865 --> 00:17:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And you know, we have this
stereotype of the good guy,

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:42.870 align:middle line:90%
the bad guy.

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:45.560 align:middle line:90%
We've got to come and vanquish.

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.780 align:middle line:84%
We've got to hold our
ground against the evil.

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And rather than falling
into that caricature,

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:58.080 align:middle line:84%
they come together as two
intelligent, capable leaders

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:02.700 align:middle line:84%
who communicate authentically
with each other.

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:05.880 align:middle line:84%
Lukan's father
doesn't say, well,

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm here because I know that--

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:13.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing you a favor because
we could overcome your invasion.

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:17.040 align:middle line:84%
He says, I realize
the position we're in.

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Isn't there a way for us to
come to an agreement that

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:25.350 align:middle line:84%
allows our
communities to remain,

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:27.523 align:middle line:84%
that gives Rome
some presence here--

00:18:27.523 --> 00:18:29.940 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Whatever resources
and whatever they're looking

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:30.740 align:middle line:90%
for, yeah.

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: So that we can all
find a way to live together,

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:37.060 align:middle line:90%
which is--

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:37.860 align:middle line:90%
it's a totally--

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:38.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It was so beautiful.

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:40.000 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: --different
paradigm from--

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:40.262 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: The thoughts.

00:18:40.262 --> 00:18:41.062 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: Yeah.

00:18:41.062 --> 00:18:43.695 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The dialogue were
so crystal clear and logical.

00:18:43.695 --> 00:18:44.610 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: I know.

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And honoring of
what is instead of the delusion

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:50.220 align:middle line:84%
and ego that goes into
what we know as war now.

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:51.095 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: Exactly.

00:18:51.095 --> 00:18:52.178 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's beautiful.

00:18:52.178 --> 00:18:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: So then, that
story ends up being fascinating

00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:01.650 align:middle line:84%
because Lukan and Gracila go
to Rome as representatives

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:05.760 align:middle line:84%
of Britain because he also is
very practical and he knows

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.370 align:middle line:84%
that the survival
of the culture--

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:14.790 align:middle line:84%
if there's any way the survival
of the clans will be possible,

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:17.130 align:middle line:90%
it's through trade.

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And so let's make
trade something

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:23.940 align:middle line:84%
really dynamic and
positive for both sides.

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:27.720 align:middle line:84%
Lots of great things happen
when they're in Rome.

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.190 align:middle line:84%
They live a fascinating
life together.

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:32.520 align:middle line:84%
They come back together
with Vespasian.

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.250 align:middle line:84%
I won't go into any
more detail there,

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:40.052 align:middle line:84%
but it's really fun
and so affirming.

00:19:40.052 --> 00:19:41.385 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It was very powerful.

00:19:41.385 --> 00:19:42.185 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: Yeah.

00:19:42.185 --> 00:19:45.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And the thing laced
throughout all of this was

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.340 align:middle line:90%
the sensuality of Earth.

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:51.120 align:middle line:84%
Earth is always very
present in this and beauty.

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:54.390 align:middle line:90%
And the way the--

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:56.640 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the environment
they're living in,

00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:00.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can even
smell the inside

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:03.630 align:middle line:84%
of where she lived with her
mother before Lukan came along

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:06.900 align:middle line:84%
and all the herbs wafting
in the air and the fur

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:08.370 align:middle line:90%
pelts they were sleeping on.

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:09.900 align:middle line:90%
You can feel that on your skin.

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:14.400 align:middle line:84%
Every it's, essentially,
alive in the books but also

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.830 align:middle line:90%
the sheer, beauty.

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:20.670 align:middle line:84%
Everything has this element
of craftsmanship and quality

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:23.850 align:middle line:84%
and the finest of
Earth's offerings

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:26.680 align:middle line:84%
combined with human
intelligence and creativity.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:29.640 align:middle line:84%
So the beauty and creativity
is very, very alive

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:32.910 align:middle line:84%
in this book-- coming from both
the masculine and the feminine,

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:34.140 align:middle line:90%
which I loved.

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.168 align:middle line:84%
So are you ready
to go on to book 3?

00:20:36.168 --> 00:20:37.210 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: Let's do it.

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:38.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:39.990 align:middle line:90%
That's a whole other story.

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:43.920 align:middle line:10%
OK, so in book 3,
which is called "Hope,"

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:49.380 align:middle line:10%
we have a situation in which the
two aren't so easily reunited.

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's a story-- it's
a very powerful story.

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:55.180 align:middle line:90%
And you talk about it with--

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:56.950 align:middle line:84%
again, it's brought
through in such

00:20:56.950 --> 00:21:00.700 align:middle line:90%
a direct, non-judgmental way.

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:04.390 align:middle line:84%
But there's Gracila
or Gracila, her name

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:07.960 align:middle line:84%
is always a variation of Grace,
comes through in this time

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:12.100 align:middle line:84%
to a woman who fell on
misfortune and became a slave.

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:16.900 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about her and
what Greek and Roman times

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.010 align:middle line:90%
were like in terms of slavery.

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:20.590 align:middle line:90%
We don't understand.

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:25.180 align:middle line:84%
Up to half the population
in Rome were slaves.

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:27.100 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that
and how one became

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:29.050 align:middle line:90%
a slave, accidentally even.

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:33.010 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: Graci's
mother was in a family--

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:35.710 align:middle line:90%
a moderately wealthy family.

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:39.820 align:middle line:84%
Her father was a merchant
who got overextended

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:44.080 align:middle line:84%
and then took out more loans and
became even more overextended.

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, the entire
family was thrown into slavery.

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.950 align:middle line:84%
Graci's mother,
who thought she was

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:56.840 align:middle line:84%
going to lead a
relatively good life,

00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:00.950 align:middle line:84%
ended up not only resenting
the slavery but, of course,

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:03.260 align:middle line:84%
resenting every
aspect of her life

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:06.320 align:middle line:84%
because it wasn't at all
what she anticipated.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:10.620 align:middle line:84%
Gave birth to Graci,
resented the daughter.

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:21.590 align:middle line:84%
So Graci was born into the most
difficult situation imaginable

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:26.400 align:middle line:84%
and yet she was given
an opportunity to learn.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't want-- don't have
to go into detail how,

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:30.560 align:middle line:90%
but she was educated.

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.740 align:middle line:10%
And because of her
ability to work

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:37.620 align:middle line:10%
with spices which began
in Atlantis and then

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:42.170 align:middle line:10%
on into Britannia,
and then now she

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:46.370 align:middle line:10%
becomes a helper, a
slave in the kitchen

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:53.170 align:middle line:10%
and creates magnificent
sauces out of these spices.

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:58.450 align:middle line:84%
It ends up just transforming how
this family have their meals.

00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:01.030 align:middle line:90%
How much they enjoy their meals.

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:08.590 align:middle line:84%
Lucan, on the other hand, is
born into a very powerful,

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:11.080 align:middle line:90%
highly--

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:14.230 align:middle line:90%
very wealthy family in Rome.

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:17.530 align:middle line:84%
It's the sort of epitome
of the patriarch.

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:21.910 align:middle line:84%
His father expects him to
live out the family legacy,

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:27.890 align:middle line:84%
be a senator, agree to an
arranged marriage with someone

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:32.330 align:middle line:84%
else from a wealthy family
so we can combine our wealth

00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:34.430 align:middle line:90%
and expand our power.

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:37.340 align:middle line:90%
So he is on that trajectory.

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:42.350 align:middle line:84%
Graci is a slave, she ends
up being taken to Rome.

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:48.320 align:middle line:84%
She's serving in the kitchen,
creates deliciousness

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:53.780 align:middle line:84%
for our banquet, and
Lucan tastes her food

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:55.430 align:middle line:90%
and recognizes it.

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:59.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: He recognizes
the spice combinations.

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:02.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKIBBIN: And she comes
out, because they're so

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.870 align:middle line:84%
blown away by the meal
and he recognizes her.

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:13.720 align:middle line:84%
But they can never come together
because it's a law in Rome

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:17.140 align:middle line:84%
that senators can
never marry either

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:20.380 align:middle line:90%
a slave or a freed woman.

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:24.790 align:middle line:84%
So even if she's freed,
they can never be married.

00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:27.460 align:middle line:84%
They can never be
legally together.

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:32.185 align:middle line:84%
And that's the situation they're
thrown into when they meet.

00:24:32.185 --> 00:24:34.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And she has been
gracious enough in her own

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:36.280 align:middle line:90%
life, understanding her lot.

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:38.170 align:middle line:84%
This is what she-- just
what she's born into.

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:40.630 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you
had a lot of choices.

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:42.430 align:middle line:84%
To feel grateful for
the fact that she

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:45.130 align:middle line:84%
was elevated because
of her cooking skills

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:47.090 align:middle line:90%
and she's accepted this.

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And so when they asked to meet
face to face, he recognizes her

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:53.980 align:middle line:84%
but she doesn't seem to be
seeing those possibilities

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:55.135 align:middle line:90%
right away.

00:24:55.135 --> 00:24:57.845 align:middle line:84%
She is a slave
working the kitchen.

00:24:57.845 --> 00:24:58.645 align:middle line:90%
She's a cook.

00:24:58.645 --> 00:24:59.860 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: She is.

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And she says, we
may love each other

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:04.420 align:middle line:90%
but we can never be together.

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:05.472 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:25:05.472 --> 00:25:06.805 align:middle line:90%
And she was pretty firm on that.

00:25:06.805 --> 00:25:07.300 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: She was.

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:09.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And he was the one
that, actually, fought for it.

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:11.420 align:middle line:84%
We'll go into that
in a little bit.

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:13.600 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
that was interesting here

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:16.960 align:middle line:84%
is, during that
lifetime, because she

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:21.490 align:middle line:84%
was a favored person for
making this delectable cuisine

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:25.910 align:middle line:84%
for everybody in Rome, she
was granted certain favors.

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, remind me of how she
came across these manuscripts

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.600 align:middle line:90%
because she was--

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.070 align:middle line:90%
educated she could read.

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:37.510 align:middle line:84%
She came across
manuscripts about Yehshua

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:39.490 align:middle line:90%
from 100 years prior.

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:40.720 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:46.150 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: So she
discovers that--

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:47.740 align:middle line:84%
well, of course,
she can read and she

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:49.600 align:middle line:90%
learned to read in Greek.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And her owner who
loves her, knows her

00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:57.750 align:middle line:84%
and loves her in his
own way because he's

00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:01.900 align:middle line:90%
from the previous two lifetimes.

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:05.460 align:middle line:84%
He, in fact, is Lucan's
father in Britannia.

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:09.640 align:middle line:84%
So he takes her under his
wing and says, here's a book.

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.250 align:middle line:90%
Here's a book you might enjoy.

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:12.690 align:middle line:90%
A book from my collection.

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And she reads about him and
discovers that, in fact, she

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:24.510 align:middle line:84%
not only is able to
relate to the story,

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:30.720 align:middle line:84%
but she's deeply affected by
all of the teachings of Yehshua.

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:33.580 align:middle line:84%
She knows-- she deeply
believes that he,

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:35.280 align:middle line:90%
in fact, was a prophet.

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:40.680 align:middle line:84%
This is before any organized
religion really has come about.

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.165 align:middle line:84%
This is what the pure,
early teachings--

00:26:43.165 --> 00:26:43.965 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:26:43.965 --> 00:26:46.590 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: --of
Yehshua and his followers

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:48.840 align:middle line:90%
and their experiences with him.

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And so that gives
her an opportunity

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:56.070 align:middle line:84%
to believe deeply
in something else.

00:26:56.070 --> 00:27:00.150 align:middle line:84%
If she can't exactly
believe in the love

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:03.990 align:middle line:84%
she shares with Lucan, which
is real, but it's impossible.

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But
unexpressed, yeah.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.040 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: She can believe in
the stories of Yehshua as told

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:12.930 align:middle line:90%
by his followers.

00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:15.840 align:middle line:90%
And so that gives her--

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:23.070 align:middle line:84%
it really provides a source
of solace for her and peace

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:26.220 align:middle line:84%
and comfort even as they
undergo the difficulties

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:28.315 align:middle line:90%
they face in that lifetime.

00:27:28.315 --> 00:27:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What also happens
is he does go on with great,

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:35.040 align:middle line:84%
great resistance because
they love each other.

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.220 align:middle line:84%
It's now-- it's known,
they love each other.

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:41.810 align:middle line:84%
With great resistance, he does
go into an arranged marriage.

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:43.710 align:middle line:90%
We won't get into any of that.

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:46.010 align:middle line:84%
But there is so much
grace in this story

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:48.830 align:middle line:84%
because in spite of
the circumstance,

00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:52.550 align:middle line:84%
the two are allowed to be
together in a certain way.

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:57.640 align:middle line:84%
And well, she's allowed to
continue doing what she does

00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.350 align:middle line:90%
and he does what he does.

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:01.310 align:middle line:90%
He has family and so forth.

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:03.100 align:middle line:84%
But there is a real
grace and beauty

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:05.200 align:middle line:84%
that comes in later
on in the story

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.020 align:middle line:90%
between his wife and Graci.

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's another element
of really not just grace,

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:19.730 align:middle line:84%
but honoring relationship
in an open way.

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Honoring relationship in a way
of recognition and true honesty

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:26.240 align:middle line:84%
with self that you,
again, you don't

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.650 align:middle line:90%
see in modern relationships.

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:30.060 align:middle line:84%
You don't see in relationships
very often at all.

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's exemplified
even in this kind

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:35.105 align:middle line:84%
of complicated triangle that
ends up occurring, right?

00:28:35.105 --> 00:28:38.880 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: Well, his
wife Euphemia says,

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.415 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to be in this
arranged marriage either.

00:28:41.415 --> 00:28:42.215 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:28:42.215 --> 00:28:45.200 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: But out of
respect for each other--

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:49.130 align:middle line:84%
they did have respect for
each other and to some extent,

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:52.160 align:middle line:84%
affection, but he told
her at the very beginning

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.195 align:middle line:84%
of their marriage,
I love someone else.

00:28:54.195 --> 00:28:54.995 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:28:54.995 --> 00:28:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: I
will be respectful,

00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:58.600 align:middle line:84%
we'll have children,
but my heart is--

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But know
my heart is elsewhere.

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:00.890 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: Yes.

00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:01.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:02.920 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: And she
understands that.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:03.720 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:07.010 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: So after they've
had their family and she

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:13.400 align:middle line:84%
realizes Graci's circumstances,
she decides that she's done

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:14.550 align:middle line:90%
what she needed to do.

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:15.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And then wonderful
things happened.

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:19.587 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: We won't
say what they are.

00:29:19.587 --> 00:29:23.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Then, unwonderful
things happen and, again,

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:27.080 align:middle line:84%
we have to remember that
at this time period,

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:30.080 align:middle line:84%
Christians are not
popular in Rome.

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:33.920 align:middle line:84%
They're entertainment in
a bad way, shall we say?

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And so Graci gets
caught up in all of this

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:42.290 align:middle line:84%
and refuses to back
down on her affection

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:45.560 align:middle line:84%
for the teachings of
these followers of Yehshua

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:46.370 align:middle line:90%
in the day.

00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:50.990 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: Lucan has made an
attempt with Marcus Aurelius

00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:56.960 align:middle line:84%
right before he dies to create
some kind of decree to turn

00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.690 align:middle line:84%
Rome back into a Republic
and does something--

00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:01.700 align:middle line:90%
and he's not successful.

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:03.290 align:middle line:90%
Commodus takes over.

00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:06.680 align:middle line:84%
Commodus knows
Lucan's role in this

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:11.300 align:middle line:84%
and punishes Graci
for being a Christian.

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:13.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now, you didn't
know about Commodus either.

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:15.170 align:middle line:90%
You didn't know Roman history.

00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:16.700 align:middle line:84%
You hadn't studied
Roman history.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's what makes all
this so shocking, really.

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:22.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean-- it shows that
you're a very clear Channel,

00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:23.240 align:middle line:90%
I will say that.

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:27.013 align:middle line:84%
Because I started looking up
everybody and the character

00:30:27.013 --> 00:30:28.430 align:middle line:84%
traits that were
given in the book

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:30.560 align:middle line:84%
turned out that is the
character of these people

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:33.240 align:middle line:84%
and what they were
known as historically.

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.850 align:middle line:90%
So you nailed that character.

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:36.750 align:middle line:90%
Commodus was not a nice person.

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:39.964 align:middle line:84%
He did not have a
positive effect on Rome

00:30:39.964 --> 00:30:43.375 align:middle line:84%
and he did not
have a kind reign.

00:30:43.375 --> 00:30:44.400 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: No.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.590 align:middle line:84%
The Christians were
taken to the Colosseum

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:49.410 align:middle line:84%
for public entertainment
and killed.

00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:50.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:53.850 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: So that story--

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:58.400 align:middle line:84%
that was a difficult story
for me to write parts of it

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:01.170 align:middle line:84%
because we want the lovers
to be able to come together.

00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:02.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:06.653 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: This isn't a
classic historical romance

00:31:06.653 --> 00:31:07.695 align:middle line:90%
the way we think of them.

00:31:07.695 --> 00:31:08.280 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.155 align:middle line:90%
It's not Harlequin.

00:31:09.155 --> 00:31:14.010 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: But it is about
how they come together in love.

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:16.350 align:middle line:90%
They still love each other.

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:19.050 align:middle line:84%
How-- and does
that love survive?

00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:20.520 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it does.

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:21.385 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it does.

00:31:21.385 --> 00:31:22.185 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:31:22.185 --> 00:31:22.985 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: But.

00:31:22.985 --> 00:31:26.700 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: --Graci is
very wounded by this whole

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:27.840 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:33.150 align:middle line:84%
She is imprisoned at
the end and is going

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:34.740 align:middle line:90%
to be taken to the Colosseum.

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And he says to her, renounce
your belief in Yehshua.

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:41.670 align:middle line:90%
And she says, I can't.

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:43.020 align:middle line:90%
I won't.

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:43.860 align:middle line:90%
I won't.

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:47.030 align:middle line:90%


00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:51.900 align:middle line:84%
I won't walk away from that
in order to save my life.

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:54.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she's very
clear about that.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:58.460 align:middle line:84%
It was so wounding for her
that she doesn't come back

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:01.055 align:middle line:90%
for 1,500 years to be with him.

00:32:01.055 --> 00:32:02.993 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now, let
me ask you a question.

00:32:02.993 --> 00:32:04.910 align:middle line:84%
Did you get anywhere in
there because you only

00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:05.675 align:middle line:90%
get what you get.

00:32:05.675 --> 00:32:06.320 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: I know.

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it's not like
they're going to tell you

00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:08.960 align:middle line:90%
everything in between.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:14.120 align:middle line:84%
Did you get a sense that she
had incarnated during that 1,500

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:17.030 align:middle line:84%
years but she had not
incarnated at a time where they

00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:18.410 align:middle line:90%
would hook up together again?

00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:23.420 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: He gave up the
opportunity to be with her

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:27.770 align:middle line:84%
during that 1,500 years so
she could reincarnate and work

00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:29.360 align:middle line:90%
through the wounding.

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:34.445 align:middle line:84%
She did that because
of her rootedness

00:32:34.445 --> 00:32:38.600 align:middle line:84%
in Yehshua and then as
it became Christianity.

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And as we've said,
women have not

00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:48.650 align:middle line:84%
had power over their
own lives really ever.

00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:51.170 align:middle line:84%
In the days when she
was reincarnating,

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:53.240 align:middle line:90%
women had two choices--

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:58.670 align:middle line:84%
to either-- if they didn't
have money, to be, essentially,

00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:02.780 align:middle line:84%
slaves in a household, if they
did come from a wealthy family,

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:04.250 align:middle line:90%
to be in an arranged marriage--

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:05.345 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Or a convent.

00:33:05.345 --> 00:33:08.360 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: --or the
other choice is a convent.

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:10.850 align:middle line:84%
She chose a convent
because, at least, there

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:14.360 align:middle line:84%
was a sisterhood there and
they could, to some extent,

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.490 align:middle line:84%
even under the thumb
of the patriarchy,

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:19.040 align:middle line:90%
they still had some freedoms.

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:24.290 align:middle line:84%
So she reincarnated as a nun
multiple lifetimes in order

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:29.600 align:middle line:84%
to heal and take her
power back as a woman

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:33.517 align:middle line:84%
after that difficult
lifetime of slavery.

00:33:33.517 --> 00:33:34.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Go ahead.

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:35.580 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: And then--

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:37.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So then we
come to book number 4.

00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:41.310 align:middle line:10%
So now, it's called
"Give" in 1671.

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:43.560 align:middle line:10%
So we've let 1,500 years pass.

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:44.790 align:middle line:10%
Now they're back.

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And in this time, again,
they're worlds apart.

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And Lucan, his
character continues

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:54.900 align:middle line:84%
to incarnate in positions
that have some kind of stature

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:57.630 align:middle line:84%
to them throughout
in each of the books.

00:33:57.630 --> 00:34:00.840 align:middle line:84%
And this time, he has stature,
again, but now we go to France,

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:01.640 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:03.098 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: Provence, France--

00:34:03.098 --> 00:34:04.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Love Provence.

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:05.310 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: I know.

00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:06.452 align:middle line:90%
I wrote this in Provence.

00:34:06.452 --> 00:34:07.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, did you?

00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:11.070 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: I was staying with
a friend whose aunt and uncle

00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:14.850 align:middle line:84%
have not one but two
villas in Provence.

00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:18.659 align:middle line:84%
Two weeks-- I wrote this book
in two weeks in Provence.

00:34:18.659 --> 00:34:24.600 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, Luc has inherited
a massive estate

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:29.270 align:middle line:84%
with a huge chateau and
all kinds of small villages

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:30.070 align:middle line:90%
around it.

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:31.830 align:middle line:90%
People working the land.

00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:34.679 align:middle line:84%
He can't stand the
gilt furniture,

00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:39.112 align:middle line:84%
he deplores the decadence
of everyone else

00:34:39.112 --> 00:34:42.614 align:middle line:84%
in his demographic group,
if I can call it that.

00:34:42.614 --> 00:34:44.061 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:44.061 --> 00:34:48.840 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: She is born,
actually, in Italy, in Venice.

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:53.130 align:middle line:84%
She's the daughter of a
senator and his courtesan.

00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:57.030 align:middle line:84%
She's taken, immediately,
to a convent to be raised.

00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:59.040 align:middle line:90%
He dies after six years.

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:01.860 align:middle line:84%
They can't afford to keep
her, they send her to France

00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:05.980 align:middle line:84%
to another convent
where she is educated.

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:08.530 align:middle line:84%
Has the opportunity
to take her vows.

00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:10.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is what's
interesting because she

00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:14.140 align:middle line:84%
could have taken her
vows one more time as she

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:16.810 align:middle line:90%
had done in that 1,500 years.

00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:20.770 align:middle line:84%
But she knows, on
some level, that she's

00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:22.520 align:middle line:90%
ready to be out in the world.

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:25.960 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't know what will
happen, but she's educated,

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:28.660 align:middle line:84%
she figures she could
earn a living somehow.

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
the abyss says, well,

00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:37.360 align:middle line:84%
I happen to know there might
be an opening for a governess.

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:40.730 align:middle line:90%


00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:44.050 align:middle line:84%
A count has two sons,
his wife has died.

00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:46.150 align:middle line:90%
They need to be educated.

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:50.260 align:middle line:84%
Maybe, there would be an
opportunity for you there and--

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:51.620 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:52.420 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:53.800 align:middle line:90%
They come back together again.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.910 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And this time in a
different environment

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:01.000 align:middle line:84%
with less resistance
against them.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.880 align:middle line:84%
But what was so
beautiful and fascinating

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:08.030 align:middle line:84%
about that book was, again,
his character and as you say,

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:08.830 align:middle line:90%
right action.

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:09.630 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: Yes.

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:11.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And being able
to take something that,

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:14.740 align:middle line:84%
as you say, is just dripping
in decadence and turn it

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:17.290 align:middle line:84%
into something that's
a benefit for all.

00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:21.340 align:middle line:84%
So they, ultimately, are able
to marry in this book, right?

00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:22.697 align:middle line:90%
So we don't-- that's OK.

00:36:22.697 --> 00:36:23.530 align:middle line:90%
Everyone knows that.

00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:24.940 align:middle line:90%
That's going to happen.

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:27.563 align:middle line:84%
And she has been wonderful
with his kids, of course,

00:36:27.563 --> 00:36:29.230 align:middle line:84%
they fall in love
with her because she's

00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:32.890 align:middle line:84%
so clever and creative and
makes learning fun for them.

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:35.740 align:middle line:84%
But it's what happens with
the other people surrounding

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:38.230 align:middle line:84%
their lives because in
each of these lifetimes

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:41.260 align:middle line:84%
one thing that happens is,
she does not bear children,

00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:43.060 align:middle line:90%
not in any of these lifetimes.

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:46.680 align:middle line:84%
So we come back and they're
trying, it's not working.

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:49.290 align:middle line:84%
But they have this
trip to Paris.

00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:51.720 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
what happens then.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:56.110 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: They go to Paris
and he's selling his wine which

00:36:56.110 --> 00:36:56.910 align:middle line:90%
is the--

00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:57.907 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exorbitant prices.

00:36:57.907 --> 00:36:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: And
exorbitant prices.

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:01.200 align:middle line:84%
It's the best wine
in France and he

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:04.580 align:middle line:84%
says, if all these wealthy
people are willing to pay--

00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:06.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I can
fund everything else.

00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:09.420 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: For my wine and I
can fund what I want to do with

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:11.940 align:middle line:84%
my money, which is
help others, great,

00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:13.740 align:middle line:84%
I'll make the wine
and sell it to them.

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:20.370 align:middle line:84%
He's doing that and she goes to
the Ile Saint Louis for lunch.

00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:24.060 align:middle line:84%
She's having her-- having
some soup and a little girl

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:27.420 align:middle line:84%
walks up with a scraggly
stalk of lavender and asks

00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:29.400 align:middle line:90%
if she wants to buy it.

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And she looks at her
and asks if she'd

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:36.720 align:middle line:84%
like to have some soup and,
maybe, some hot chocolate.

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And she learns that this
girl is living on the street.

00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:42.700 align:middle line:90%
That her mother has died.

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:44.400 align:middle line:84%
The girl doesn't
know it, but she's

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.670 align:middle line:84%
died because she had to
resort to prostitution

00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:51.175 align:middle line:84%
just to feed them and
even that wasn't enough.

00:37:51.175 --> 00:37:51.975 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:37:51.975 --> 00:37:56.190 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: And the girl has
a best friend whose mother is

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:58.920 align:middle line:84%
really taking care of them
both, but she's also living

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.300 align:middle line:90%
on the street.

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:04.308 align:middle line:90%
Very horrible circumstances.

00:38:04.308 --> 00:38:05.725 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But
common for the day.

00:38:05.725 --> 00:38:06.725 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: But common.

00:38:06.725 --> 00:38:10.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is
what Luc abhorred

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:16.510 align:middle line:84%
about the times with the hideous
decadence and the hideous

00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:21.240 align:middle line:90%
poverty existing side by side.

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:27.510 align:middle line:84%
So she takes the girl back to
the place where they're staying

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:34.320 align:middle line:84%
and lets her have a bath and
a nap and Luc arrives home

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:38.400 align:middle line:90%
and there she is.

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Of course, he loves her
immediately and thinks,

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:45.000 align:middle line:84%
well, we can't send her
back to the streets.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.080 align:middle line:84%
So let's, at least, tomorrow
morning, go back with her

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:51.630 align:middle line:84%
so that the woman
who's been taking care

00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:55.060 align:middle line:84%
of her and the daughter will
know that she's going with us

00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:58.650 align:middle line:84%
and she's going to be OK because
we don't want them to worry.

00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:01.110 align:middle line:90%
And she agrees to go with them.

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Of course, what happens is,
all of them go together.

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And they go back and it's the
beginning of just a marvelous

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:15.390 align:middle line:84%
part of the story because
they are living out

00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:21.390 align:middle line:84%
what Luc and Graciella
want, which is to create--

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:24.570 align:middle line:84%
if I can call it
this, a democracy

00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:29.080 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of
the France which

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:31.810 align:middle line:90%
is anything but a democracy.

00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:35.740 align:middle line:84%
Luc shares his profits
with all the people

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:38.170 align:middle line:84%
who are working the
land, he provides

00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:42.550 align:middle line:84%
opportunities for the children
to get educated and learn

00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:47.540 align:middle line:84%
a trade so that they can, maybe,
rise above where they've been.

00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:48.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: He funds a school.

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:52.060 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: He funds a school.

00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:55.750 align:middle line:84%
He's got a-- and because
he has so much land

00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:59.020 align:middle line:84%
and he has considerable
wealth, he's

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:03.020 align:middle line:84%
able to do, basically,
whatever he chooses.

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And he chooses something very
different from court life

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:10.270 align:middle line:84%
and from the aristocracy
living in France.

00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:15.460 align:middle line:84%
It's so fulfilling to see
how they come together

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:18.835 align:middle line:84%
with the exuberance and the
abundance of their love.

00:40:18.835 --> 00:40:22.150 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:24.070 align:middle line:90%
I have to say, and it is.

00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And how everyone that comes in
contact with the two of them

00:40:26.890 --> 00:40:30.400 align:middle line:84%
always benefits from their
relationship with them

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:34.120 align:middle line:90%
on multitude of levels.

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say, I
have a friend who is just

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:41.755 align:middle line:84%
kind of a-- she's
been through life

00:40:41.755 --> 00:40:43.630 align:middle line:84%
and she's kind of seen
it all and done it all

00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:46.000 align:middle line:84%
and she always says,
yeah, I wish I could cry.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.280 align:middle line:84%
I just can't even
cry about anything.

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:51.160 align:middle line:90%
And beautiful, beautiful heart.

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:53.470 align:middle line:90%
But just not a romantic.

00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:55.700 align:middle line:90%
Let's just say that.

00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:59.200 align:middle line:84%
So as I got each of your books
at the very beginning when

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:01.660 align:middle line:84%
you were first, first
putting them out about one

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:04.710 align:middle line:84%
at a time initially and then
I'd pass them to her to read.

00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:06.400 align:middle line:90%
She was, oh my god.

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:08.530 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out
she read the series,

00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:10.120 align:middle line:84%
she went and read
the series again.

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:13.180 align:middle line:84%
She started sending the series
to everyone and she said,

00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:14.470 align:middle line:90%
I can't stop reading them.

00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And I realized I am not going
to settle for a relationship

00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:21.640 align:middle line:90%
unless it feels like that.

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:26.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to wait no matter how
many incarnations until I find

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:29.410 align:middle line:84%
that kind of divine
compliment where we can live

00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:31.600 align:middle line:84%
these kinds of
lives of integrity

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:33.460 align:middle line:84%
because she's a
woman of integrity.

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And so I was just
blown away to watch

00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:39.310 align:middle line:84%
how she was transformed
on some level

00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:43.480 align:middle line:84%
and restored in terms
of her faith in love

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:45.070 align:middle line:84%
by reading these
books, of course,

00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:46.300 align:middle line:90%
like a lot of other people.

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: I've heard
something similar from a lot

00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:50.230 align:middle line:90%
of readers.

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And they talk about how I'm
no longer willing to settle,

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:57.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm no longer
going to compromise

00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:00.130 align:middle line:84%
to make a relationship
work, I'm no longer going

00:42:00.130 --> 00:42:02.560 align:middle line:90%
to turn my back on who I am.

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:03.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:04.660 align:middle line:90%
All of this.

00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:05.840 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: All of this.

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, the story isn't
about finding your twin flame,

00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:18.580 align:middle line:84%
it's really about being clear
enough and empowered enough

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:21.700 align:middle line:84%
in oneself to say,
this is who I am,

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:24.520 align:middle line:84%
this is who I want to
be in relationship.

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:28.780 align:middle line:84%
I want to show up in
relationship in these ways.

00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:32.950 align:middle line:84%
If someone can be in
relationship with me

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:35.840 align:middle line:90%
bringing his best, wonderful.

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:39.185 align:middle line:84%
If not, I can still
be fully who I am.

00:42:39.185 --> 00:42:39.985 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:42:39.985 --> 00:42:40.785 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: Yeah.

00:42:40.785 --> 00:42:44.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that is the
feeling that's coming up.

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think what you just
said is very important.

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:49.270 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean you have to wait
for your twin flame or divine

00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:51.010 align:middle line:84%
compliment, that
could be a while.

00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:55.840 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't-- it also does
mean there are many people

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:59.350 align:middle line:84%
on a frequency range level
where their frequency matches

00:42:59.350 --> 00:43:02.380 align:middle line:84%
for every person on this
planet if we don't just go

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:05.920 align:middle line:84%
for the convenient choice
or what's laid before us

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:10.135 align:middle line:84%
or something we don't even feel
we have a choice in per se.

00:43:10.135 --> 00:43:12.220 align:middle line:84%
If we avoid that and
we-- like you say,

00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:14.060 align:middle line:90%
make these conscious choices.

00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:16.107 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to ask
one more question

00:43:16.107 --> 00:43:18.190 align:middle line:84%
because we're getting close
to the end of our time

00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:19.677 align:middle line:90%
together on this.

00:43:19.677 --> 00:43:21.760 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people say, is
she writing about herself?

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:22.690 align:middle line:90%
Is this her?

00:43:22.690 --> 00:43:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And you have your
own answer to that.

00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:27.160 align:middle line:84%
But what-- tell us
that answer first,

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:31.180 align:middle line:84%
and secondly, what did this
do for your life, personally?

00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:32.860 align:middle line:84%
Because this just
flowed through you.

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:35.140 align:middle line:84%
You didn't even read
them till after they

00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:37.890 align:middle line:84%
were put into a
transcript, actually,

00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:40.130 align:middle line:84%
it's like, wow, what
stories these are.

00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:41.995 align:middle line:90%
So what did it do for you?

00:43:41.995 --> 00:43:45.930 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: These are not
stories of my past lives.

00:43:45.930 --> 00:43:50.640 align:middle line:84%
They-- I think that they come
from a much higher frequency

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:51.741 align:middle line:90%
than that, quite frankly.

00:43:51.741 --> 00:43:54.390 align:middle line:90%


00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:56.220 align:middle line:90%
These are stories for everyone.

00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:57.810 align:middle line:90%
They're about all of us.

00:43:57.810 --> 00:44:02.620 align:middle line:84%
They're about who we all
have the capacity to be.

00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And so they're stories
that enable us to remember.

00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:12.010 align:middle line:84%
We can affirm so much about
the fullness of who we are.

00:44:12.010 --> 00:44:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And so I like to think
of the stories that way

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:19.620 align:middle line:84%
rather than trying to make some
connection between what I wrote

00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:21.870 align:middle line:90%
and what my past lives might be.

00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:24.720 align:middle line:90%
But what they have done for me--

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:27.750 align:middle line:84%
and this is me being
brutally honest.

00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:30.246 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK, let's hear it.

00:44:30.246 --> 00:44:32.430 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: Ever
since I wrote those,

00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:39.520 align:middle line:84%
I integrated the
message which was, yes,

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:43.550 align:middle line:84%
be all you can be
and want to be.

00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:47.170 align:middle line:84%
Be that kind of
phenomenal woman.

00:44:47.170 --> 00:44:48.580 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And if it means that
you live your life

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.590 align:middle line:90%
by yourself, no problem.

00:44:54.590 --> 00:44:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And for me, that's
what it's meant.

00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:57.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:57.160 --> 00:45:01.730 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: And it's not that
I push relationships away,

00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:05.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm just really clear about
who I am, what I value,

00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:08.980 align:middle line:84%
how I want to live,
and my life is so full.

00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:09.780 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is.

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:10.580 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: It's
so full of joy--

00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:11.487 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You're so creative.

00:45:11.487 --> 00:45:12.920 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: It's so-- yes.

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:14.555 align:middle line:90%
I'm able to be--

00:45:14.555 --> 00:45:17.940 align:middle line:84%
so many facets of
who I want to be,

00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:20.150 align:middle line:90%
I get to be in this lifetime.

00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:24.860 align:middle line:84%
If someone can come
in and be there with

00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:29.390 align:middle line:84%
me and I can be there with him
and we meet at the same level

00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:31.310 align:middle line:84%
in the same way,
with the same love

00:45:31.310 --> 00:45:34.670 align:middle line:84%
and the same frequency and
the same joy and abundance

00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:37.260 align:middle line:90%
and all of that, great.

00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:39.187 align:middle line:90%
If not, still great.

00:45:39.187 --> 00:45:40.145 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Still great.

00:45:40.145 --> 00:45:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: And
that's how I'm living.

00:45:40.310 --> 00:45:41.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And
your life is great.

00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:42.530 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: It is.

00:45:42.530 --> 00:45:44.197 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I have to
say-- and you know,

00:45:44.197 --> 00:45:47.180 align:middle line:84%
I had you on for my
personal book club, right?

00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:49.730 align:middle line:84%
And so other people
in the book club now

00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:50.930 align:middle line:90%
are forming book clubs--

00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: Yes.

00:45:51.730 --> 00:45:53.720 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --of their
own around these books

00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:55.760 align:middle line:84%
because it's speaking
so deeply to them.

00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.920 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to say,
thank you for letting

00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:01.700 align:middle line:84%
that flow through you and also
you got a message not long ago

00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:05.180 align:middle line:84%
to write yet another book
about your own personal journey

00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:08.190 align:middle line:84%
and experience and to
how all this came about.

00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:09.697 align:middle line:90%
So you're in the midst of that?

00:46:09.697 --> 00:46:10.655 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: It's done.

00:46:10.655 --> 00:46:11.155 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's done.

00:46:11.155 --> 00:46:12.380 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: I wrote
it in two weeks.

00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh my god.

00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:14.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:15.050 align:middle line:90%
How did it turn out?

00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:18.263 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: It's really good.

00:46:18.263 --> 00:46:19.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What's the title?

00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:20.510 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a title
or anything else?

00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: Well, I
have to apologize--

00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:22.333 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, OK.

00:46:22.333 --> 00:46:24.125 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: --because
the original title--

00:46:24.125 --> 00:46:26.660 align:middle line:84%
the titles came from my neighbor
across the street who was

00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:28.190 align:middle line:90%
brilliant at all of this.

00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:33.140 align:middle line:84%
The original title was Gates
to Divinity, Gates to Divinity.

00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:34.265 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: A play on words.

00:46:34.265 --> 00:46:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: And then
he read it and he said,

00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:39.500 align:middle line:84%
I have a different
title for you.

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:40.670 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what?

00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:42.480 align:middle line:90%
And he said, "Open Gates."

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:43.355 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:46:43.355 --> 00:46:45.303 align:middle line:10%
>> MCKIBBIN: But then I
thought of Open Minds.

00:46:45.303 --> 00:46:46.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, well.

00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:48.530 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: Well,
and Regina, I--

00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:51.510 align:middle line:84%
truthfully, it came
from him not me.

00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:52.797 align:middle line:90%
So I hope that's OK with you--

00:46:52.797 --> 00:46:53.630 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, gosh.

00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:53.930 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:55.445 align:middle line:84%

>> REGINA: I love it.

00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:57.620 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: The book is done.

00:46:57.620 --> 00:47:02.210 align:middle line:84%
It is-- writing it was a
combination of remembering

00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:03.830 align:middle line:90%
and channeling.

00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And I have one last
thing to tell you.

00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:09.770 align:middle line:10%
My fingers flew
across the keyboard.

00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:11.690 align:middle line:90%
I typed it into the computer.

00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:12.565 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh my god.

00:47:12.565 --> 00:47:13.398 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKIBBIN: I know.

00:47:13.398 --> 00:47:14.233 align:middle line:90%
I can't believe it.

00:47:14.233 --> 00:47:16.191 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You got rid
of the paper and pencil.

00:47:16.191 --> 00:47:17.660 align:middle line:90%
Good on you, girl.

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:19.640 align:middle line:84%

people who've read these books,

00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:30.470 align:middle line:90%
I just--

00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:34.380 align:middle line:84%

Thank you.

00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:40.920 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKIBBIN: Well, and thank you
because the appreciation goes

00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:43.290 align:middle line:90%
both ways.

00:47:43.290 --> 00:47:47.040 align:middle line:10%
You have provided an
opportunity for so many to share

00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:48.990 align:middle line:10%
their love and joy and wisdom.

00:47:48.990 --> 00:47:50.473 align:middle line:84%
And you've made a
huge difference.

00:47:50.473 --> 00:47:51.390 align:middle line:90%
