00:00:16.474 --> 00:00:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
By now, I would

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.560 align:middle line:84%
guess that every one
of you have likely

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.480 align:middle line:90%
heard of the term "chemtrail."

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.550 align:middle line:84%
They're the white, puffy streaks
in the sky that many confuse

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.470 align:middle line:84%
with simple condensation
trails or contrails.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.650 align:middle line:10%
These white streaks that
stretch from horizon to horizon

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.729 align:middle line:10%
are thought by some
to be the greatest

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:34.350 align:middle line:10%
menace to the
health of all living

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.120 align:middle line:10%
things on this planet, far more
impactful than climate change.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.940 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Michael Murphy and
many other experts in this field

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.690 align:middle line:84%
would argue that
climate change is

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.440 align:middle line:84%
a direct result of
this military program.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.450 align:middle line:10%
First of all, I
need to find out how

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.980 align:middle line:10%
you got into this, because
your films are doing really,

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:51.790 align:middle line:10%
really well.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.940 align:middle line:10%
Why In the World has
been winning awards.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.630 align:middle line:10%
It's globally acclaimed.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.837 align:middle line:84%
And I think you've
done a beautiful job.

00:00:58.837 --> 00:01:00.170 align:middle line:90%
The production values are great.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.410 align:middle line:10%
The information is great.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.530 align:middle line:10%
But the topic itself
is absolutely critical,

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.210 align:middle line:10%
in my opinion, for
everyone to know about.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.940 align:middle line:10%
>>MICHAEL MURPHY: It is, and
after studying and researching

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.062 align:middle line:10%
for several years, me and
a number of other people

00:01:13.062 --> 00:01:15.270 align:middle line:10%
have come to the conclusion
there has been no greater

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.510 align:middle line:10%
threat to not only human
health but the world itself

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.640 align:middle line:10%
than from these programs,
short of nuclear catastrophe.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.696 align:middle line:90%
But it's interesting.

00:01:24.696 --> 00:01:26.320 align:middle line:84%
The first person that
told me airplanes

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.970 align:middle line:84%
were spraying
chemicals into the sky

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.740 align:middle line:84%
to create artificial
clouds, I really

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.890 align:middle line:90%
thought that person was crazy.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.790 align:middle line:84%
But I lived in
Arizona at the time,

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.610 align:middle line:84%
and when I moved out there
for college back in the '80s,

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.440 align:middle line:84%
I remembered the deep
blue skies that we had.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And rarely did we
ever have a blemish.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.590 align:middle line:90%
And I moved away for a while.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.410 align:middle line:84%
But when I returned, I
noticed, about five days out

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.830 align:middle line:84%
of the week, we
had what appeared

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.190 align:middle line:90%
to be high cirrus clouds.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What year was this?

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: This was
probably in the early 2000s

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.670 align:middle line:84%
when I moved back
into that region.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:58.920 align:middle line:90%
So I knew something was wrong.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.794 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't aware of it.

00:01:59.794 --> 00:02:01.470 align:middle line:84%
And then somebody
pointed out, actually,

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.410 align:middle line:90%
a trail behind an airplane.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.090 align:middle line:90%
And they said, watch that trail.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.010 align:middle line:84%
That trail will turn
into the high clouds

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.039 align:middle line:90%
that you're looking at.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.389 align:middle line:84%
So I became interested
in what was going on,

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:14.180 align:middle line:84%
started researching the issue,
which many people refer to

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.480 align:middle line:84%
as chemtrails, and
came to the realization

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.320 align:middle line:84%
that something, probably,
was happening in the sky.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.020 align:middle line:84%
What really got me involved
with this was back in 2010,

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.790 align:middle line:84%
I was invited to go to a
geoengineering conference.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.790 align:middle line:84%
It was the American
Association for the Advancement

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:31.610 align:middle line:90%
of Science meeting.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And for three days, geoengineers
spoke about their plans

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.190 align:middle line:84%
and proposals to spray 10 to 20
million tons of toxic aluminum

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.770 align:middle line:84%
oxide and other
toxins into our sky

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.340 align:middle line:84%
for what they said was
the stated goal of cooling

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.910 align:middle line:90%
our planet.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:45.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, now.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.650 align:middle line:10%
10 to 20 million tons--
is that globally?

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.462 align:middle line:10%
Or was that specific
to a given region?

00:02:50.462 --> 00:02:51.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: That's
actually globally.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:52.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.466 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: And what
they want to do

00:02:53.466 --> 00:02:55.610 align:middle line:84%
and are currently doing
at this time, which we'll

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.840 align:middle line:84%
talk about a lot of
the documentation,

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.890 align:middle line:84%
is they have started
these programs.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.200 align:middle line:84%
What was interesting were
some of the consequences

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.130 align:middle line:90%
that they spoke about.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.510 align:middle line:84%
Some of the major consequences
were, at first, weather.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.650 align:middle line:84%
Droughts in certain areas,
floods in other areas--

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.550 align:middle line:90%
obviously, we're having that.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.810 align:middle line:84%
Ozone depletion-- we now
have a huge major ozone

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.560 align:middle line:84%
hole, above both the northern
and southern hemisphere.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.675 align:middle line:84%
A number of people
now are recognizing

00:03:22.675 --> 00:03:24.550 align:middle line:84%
that they're burning
much quicker in the sun.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And we have documented
cases of our UV going up.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.269 align:middle line:84%
And again, that's a stated
consequence of geoengineers.

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which should
be directly relating

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.550 align:middle line:90%
to skin cancers, as well.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.160 align:middle line:84%
I would think a rise
in skin cancers.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Which we've seen
an incredible increase--

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.792 align:middle line:84%
and respiratory mortality,
which has gone from number eight

00:03:40.792 --> 00:03:42.750 align:middle line:84%
down to the number three
in the past six years,

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.240 align:middle line:84%
which geoengineers
deny about that.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.480 align:middle line:84%
But pH changes in our soil--
and they even state that once,

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.130 align:middle line:84%
if they implement
these programs,

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.215 align:middle line:90%
which they already have--

00:03:53.215 --> 00:03:54.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: If?

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.149 align:middle line:84%
They've been doing this
for well over a decade.

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:57.981 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Well over a
decade, and they state

00:03:57.981 --> 00:04:00.410 align:middle line:84%
that it could disrupt the
food supply of over two

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:01.400 align:middle line:90%
billion people.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.860 align:middle line:84%
We're now in a global food
crisis, which hopefully we'll

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:04.840 align:middle line:90%
talk about today.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.685 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, we're going to
talk to every single thing you

00:04:06.685 --> 00:04:07.860 align:middle line:90%
hit on, as a matter of fact.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is a
subject that-- it's

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.590 align:middle line:84%
frosted me for
about 13 years now.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.820 align:middle line:84%
I also was living in
Arizona starting in 2000.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.149 align:middle line:84%
And the people were talking
about these chemtrails.

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And like you, I said, what
are you talking about?

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And once I started
looking at the patterns,

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.320 align:middle line:84%
I was friends with
one of the doctors

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.360 align:middle line:90%
in town, whom I've interviewed.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.890 align:middle line:84%
And he was saying, oh, my
office is packed on these--

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.710 align:middle line:90%
they call them spray days.

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.320 align:middle line:84%
Everyone in that town,
which was Sedona,

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.430 align:middle line:84%
was aware of the chemtrails--
everyone I met, anyway.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.290 align:middle line:10%
So I started
compiling data myself,

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.930 align:middle line:10%
massive amounts
of data-- in fact,

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.190 align:middle line:10%
almost brought my binder on
chemtrails with the photos

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.910 align:middle line:10%
and documents.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.450 align:middle line:10%
And I got so far as to getting
one little admission out

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.660 align:middle line:10%
of an FAA public
information officer, when

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.270 align:middle line:10%
I exhausted everything
and said, come on.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.960 align:middle line:84%
You can see-- they're
flying right above my head.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.210 align:middle line:90%
Air traffic denies it.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.750 align:middle line:90%
FAA denies it.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.460 align:middle line:84%
Even the National Weather
Service won't talk about these.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.640 align:middle line:84%
Is this because it could
be a military operation?

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.890 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yes.

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.300 align:middle line:90%
And I thought that was huge.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.000 align:middle line:84%
I stopped gathering
data at that point.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.550 align:middle line:90%
That was in 2001 or '02.

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.570 align:middle line:84%
Yet you say in this
geoengineering conference,

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.144 align:middle line:84%
they were saying, if we
begin these programs.

00:05:20.144 --> 00:05:20.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Right.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.860 align:middle line:84%
What they're doing is
selling these programs

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.890 align:middle line:84%
to the public as a way to
mitigate global warming.

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And the theory is
putting these chemicals

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.800 align:middle line:84%
into our sky will actually
reflect sun back into space

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.420 align:middle line:90%
and thus cool the planet.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Since we released the first
film, What in the World

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.510 align:middle line:84%
Are They Spraying?, we found
a number of university,

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.800 align:middle line:84%
even NASA studies, which
indicate putting aerosols

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.340 align:middle line:84%
into our sky
temporarily regionally

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.230 align:middle line:90%
will cool the planet.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.612 align:middle line:84%
A number of people
notice on a warm day

00:05:46.612 --> 00:05:48.320 align:middle line:84%
when they start
spraying, the temperature

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.560 align:middle line:84%
will drop about seven
or eight degrees.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.480 align:middle line:84%
The problem with this is at
night, the aerosols actually

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.890 align:middle line:84%
act as a blanket,
and they trap heat.

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:57.730 align:middle line:84%
In the past 10 to
15 years, we've

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.240 align:middle line:84%
seen a great increase
in night time highs.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.450 align:middle line:84%
So the question
really remains, what

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.657 align:middle line:84%
is the objective
of these programs?

00:06:05.657 --> 00:06:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And why would they
implement something

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.670 align:middle line:84%
that's so damaging to the planet
and all life that inhibits it?

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
at the same time,

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:16.400 align:middle line:84%
you have all of the
agendas and carbon credits

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.730 align:middle line:84%
and so forth that they're
trying to implement regarding

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:23.290 align:middle line:84%
global warming-- the very thing
that you say they're creating.

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Well, without question
it exacerbates global warming.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.180 align:middle line:10%
And what it appears
it has done--

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.400 align:middle line:10%
we're talking about the
poisoning of populations, also

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.250 align:middle line:10%
the destruction of our ability
to grow natural organic foods.

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:39.090 align:middle line:10%
Hopefully, we'll discuss some
of the ecological challenges.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.990 align:middle line:10%
But the warming of
our planet, actually,

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:43.850 align:middle line:10%
is related to the
methane release.

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And methane is very, very
much of a greenhouse gas--

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.530 align:middle line:90%
hundreds of times more than CO2.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.550 align:middle line:84%
So it appears that they've
actually sparked the methane

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.320 align:middle line:84%
release that we have, which
could be a runaway train

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.090 align:middle line:84%
and really be a game changer on
a number of different fronts.

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.910 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about some
literally catastrophic events

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:06.967 align:middle line:84%
that appear to be triggered
by these damaging programs.

00:07:06.967 --> 00:07:07.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And first of all, before
we go any further,

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.870 align:middle line:84%
let's talking about the
title of the first film,

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:16.980 align:middle line:84%
which you did with G.
Edward Griffin, was called

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.770 align:middle line:84%
What In the World
Are They Spraying?

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.354 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about what in the
world they're spraying on us.

00:07:21.354 --> 00:07:22.520 align:middle line:90%
Let's get into some of that.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.460 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going
to go to a sound byte

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.190 align:middle line:84%
with Dane Wigington, where he's
actually at that conference you

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:31.194 align:middle line:84%
mentioned earlier, asking some
very pertinent questions that

00:07:31.194 --> 00:07:32.360 align:middle line:90%
are not being answered well.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:32.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Yeah.

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.701 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we look at
the primary ingredient,

00:07:34.701 --> 00:07:36.490 align:middle line:84%
one thing that
geoengineers are stating

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:39.530 align:middle line:84%
is a very effective toxin to
put into our sky is aluminum,

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:43.430 align:middle line:84%
because it's lightweight
and it's highly reflective.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:46.220 align:middle line:84%
And scientists up in
northern California

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.940 align:middle line:84%
started noticing the
forest was collapsing

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.476 align:middle line:84%
and trees-- grass
was not growing,

00:07:51.476 --> 00:07:53.100 align:middle line:84%
natural organic foods
were not growing.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.750 align:middle line:84%
So they started
testing the soil pH.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And what they found
was devastating.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.980 align:middle line:84%
They found that the pH
of the soil in that area,

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.770 align:middle line:84%
which is typically acidic,
was booming to alkaline.

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:06.020 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about
some very, very substantial

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:11.670 align:middle line:84%
changes-- anywhere between 10 to
20 times the normal alkalinity.

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:13.540 align:middle line:84%
Basic science
tells us plant life

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.090 align:middle line:84%
that requires an
acidic soil will

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:19.020 align:middle line:84%
start to die when the pH
changes that dramatically.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.210 align:middle line:84%
So they started
testing the rain.

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And what they had found
was just shocking.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.450 align:middle line:84%
They found levels of aluminum,
barium, and strontium--

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:30.440 align:middle line:84%
the primary ingredients
of geoengineering programs

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.309 align:middle line:84%
in massive amounts--
and in some cases,

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:36.140 align:middle line:84%
those amount have increased
up to 50,000 percentage points

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.450 align:middle line:90%
in just about a six year period.

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:41.600 align:middle line:84%
These will drive
soil pH from acidic

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.074 align:middle line:84%
to basic-- exactly
what was happening.

00:08:45.074 --> 00:08:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let me ask
a question at this point.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.320 align:middle line:84%
One thing I've noticed,
even in California--

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.370 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to be
taking a look at this

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:57.090 align:middle line:84%
also later in-- on Maui-- people
are complaining each spring

00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:00.000 align:middle line:84%
and summer their gardens are
growing normally anymore.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.510 align:middle line:90%
Tomatoes aren't growing.

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:03.520 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it's two
months before you even

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.910 align:middle line:84%
start getting any
of the little guys.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And some crops aren't
growing at all anymore.

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:10.185 align:middle line:84%
They're just failing, for
backyard organic gardeners,

00:09:10.185 --> 00:09:10.804 align:middle line:90%
even.

00:09:10.804 --> 00:09:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Right.

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:15.260 align:middle line:84%
A couple of reasons-- and I
live on an organic farm in Maui.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:21.810 align:middle line:84%
During the past 10 years, we've
lost between about a 60% crop

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:23.139 align:middle line:90%
loss just in the past 10 years.

00:09:23.139 --> 00:09:24.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's just shocking.

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:27.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Couple of reasons--
the pH changes are devastating,

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:30.410 align:middle line:84%
but aluminum oxide is
very toxic to plant life.

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of trees and
a lot of plant life

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.270 align:middle line:84%
actually have root systems
that will shut down

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:39.700 align:middle line:84%
once bio available aluminum
has been introduced.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.690 align:middle line:84%
As a result, the
tree or the plant

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:45.350 align:middle line:84%
suffers a very long, slow
death, because it's not

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:46.690 align:middle line:90%
getting the nutrients.

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And this is not being found in
just Hawaii or even northern

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.350 align:middle line:90%
California.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:53.058 align:middle line:84%
But this is being
found around the world.

00:09:53.058 --> 00:09:55.772 align:middle line:84%
We have ecosystem collapses
literally around the world.

00:09:55.772 --> 00:09:57.230 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
corporations that

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:59.350 align:middle line:84%
benefit from this, which
hopefully, we'll talk about.

00:09:59.350 --> 00:09:59.609 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, we're
going to be talking

00:09:59.609 --> 00:10:02.020 align:middle line:84%
about that in just a
little later in the show.

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.061 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: A little later.

00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:03.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.860 align:middle line:84%
But also talking about
where in the world--

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:08.109 align:middle line:84%
you were saying they're doing
this all over the globe.

00:10:08.109 --> 00:10:10.760 align:middle line:84%
It's mostly specific
countries, NATO countries.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.270 align:middle line:84%
There are some that are
not being sprayed still,

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:15.210 align:middle line:90%
some tiny little populations.

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:18.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: I think a myth is
that it's only NATO countries.

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
expanded beyond that?

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:22.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Well, it's all NATO
countries, but not limited to.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
important thing to note

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:28.060 align:middle line:84%
is the fallout of these
programs, the destruction,

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.450 align:middle line:84%
is far reaching than
where they spray.

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:32.890 align:middle line:84%
It literally effects
everywhere because of drift.

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:35.010 align:middle line:84%
So we're finding the
primary ingredients

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:38.150 align:middle line:84%
of geoengineering
programs in rain tests

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:40.590 align:middle line:84%
around the world in
literally every region.

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:42.560 align:middle line:90%
So this does affect everything.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.030 align:middle line:84%
But what we have
to do is look back

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:47.250 align:middle line:84%
at geoengineers who are
now calling for emergency

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:51.230 align:middle line:84%
geoengineering to start this
early, quote unquote, legally

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:51.750 align:middle line:90%
this year.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.041 align:middle line:90%
They want to start immediately.

00:10:53.041 --> 00:10:55.840 align:middle line:10%
And what they want to
do is cover every region

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.600 align:middle line:10%
with this toxic
aerosol of aluminum,

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.480 align:middle line:10%
barium, and whatever
else they want

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.750 align:middle line:10%
to spray to achieve
their goals, which

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:06.120 align:middle line:10%
definitely are not
to cool the planet.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.440 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: In your documentary--
the first one, again--

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.660 align:middle line:10%
this show is mostly focusing
on the first documentary.

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:13.410 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have a
second conversation,

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:16.640 align:middle line:84%
just so you know this, focusing
on the second show and the why

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.420 align:middle line:84%
of it and who stands
to gain from it.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:21.400 align:middle line:84%
In this one, we
really want to lay out

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.220 align:middle line:84%
what's being sprayed,
has it been researched,

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.050 align:middle line:84%
what is it doing to us, what
is it doing to our plant life.

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And so in the
documentary, we'll go

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.170 align:middle line:84%
to our very first
little clip that we're

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:33.360 align:middle line:84%
going to see from
that geoengineering

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.500 align:middle line:84%
conference in which the man we
mentioned earlier-- first tell

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.630 align:middle line:84%
us a little bit
about Dane Wigington.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Dane Wigington
is a solar expert.

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:43.040 align:middle line:84%
He owns one of the largest
solar powered homes

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.650 align:middle line:84%
in northern California-- came
into the issue in about 2002,

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:49.150 align:middle line:84%
once he started noticing
on certain days,

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:52.810 align:middle line:84%
he was losing about 50%
to 70% of his ability

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:54.229 align:middle line:90%
of his solar uptake.

00:11:54.229 --> 00:11:55.770 align:middle line:84%
So he went outside,
he looked, and he

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:59.320 align:middle line:84%
noticed these trails above
his house from these airplanes

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.080 align:middle line:90%
and noticed a correlation.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.950 align:middle line:84%
So after researching
for a while,

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:05.870 align:middle line:84%
his research quickly
led them into the issue

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:08.740 align:middle line:84%
of geoengineering and
started getting involved

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.510 align:middle line:84%
with the scientists
and people from EPA

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:14.510 align:middle line:84%
and other government agencies
talking about the fallout,

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:17.210 align:middle line:84%
talking about the findings,
which they really started

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:20.710 align:middle line:84%
testing in that region, but now
are finding around the world.

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:24.410 align:middle line:84%
So Dane has been very
instrumental at getting

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.700 align:middle line:84%
the message out
in a very credible

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:27.870 align:middle line:90%
and a very factual way.

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:30.212 align:middle line:84%
So we've included him
in both documentaries.

00:12:30.212 --> 00:12:30.795 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:30.795 --> 00:12:33.480 align:middle line:84%
Very well spoken-- in the
clip we're going to see,

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:37.010 align:middle line:84%
he's now asking one
of the geoengineers

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:40.390 align:middle line:84%
about the research itself,
how safe is this, right?

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:41.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Well, yeah.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And that was at the
American Association

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:45.090 align:middle line:84%
for the Advancement
of Science meeting.

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And that was our last
conference that they

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.409 align:middle line:90%
have allowed us to go to.

00:12:48.409 --> 00:12:49.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
not invited anymore.

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:51.866 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Being that we
made them so popular--

00:12:51.866 --> 00:12:55.970 align:middle line:84%
and he asked him about the
toxicity and the human health

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:58.540 align:middle line:84%
consequences of dumping
this into the atmosphere.

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:00.875 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then let's
take a look at that clip.

00:13:00.875 --> 00:13:03.760 align:middle line:10%
>>DANE WIGINGTON: Numerous
air quality studies, including

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.320 align:middle line:10%
from CARB, California Air
Quality Research Board,

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.980 align:middle line:10%
have named sub-micron
sized particulates as

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:12.490 align:middle line:10%
been particularly harmful
for human respiration.

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:15.010 align:middle line:10%
Through all the
discussions today, I

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:18.270 align:middle line:10%
have not heard any
mention of this fallout.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And has this been studied,
and also the effects

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:25.030 align:middle line:84%
of a highly reactive metal like
aluminum on toxifying soils

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.531 align:middle line:90%
and waters?

00:13:25.531 --> 00:13:26.988 align:middle line:10%
>>ALAN ROBOCK: The
question is what

00:13:26.988 --> 00:13:29.900 align:middle line:10%
would be the effects of these
materials on human health

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:32.820 align:middle line:10%
if they came down
into the stratosphere,

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:36.550 align:middle line:10%
in particular small
particles and aluminum?

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:38.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SPEAKER: So the
collaborators of mine

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:40.512 align:middle line:84%
working on the aerosol
scheme are actually

00:13:40.512 --> 00:13:41.970 align:middle line:84%
folks from Carnegie
Mellon who have

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:43.100 align:middle line:90%
focused on human health impacts.

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And while we haven't
published it,

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.043 align:middle line:84%
that was the very
first thing we did--

00:13:46.043 --> 00:13:49.684 align:middle line:84%
was do the order of magnitude
calculation on pencil and paper

00:13:49.684 --> 00:13:52.100 align:middle line:84%
with an expert on human health
impacts about whether there

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.040 align:middle line:90%
could be an issue.

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.066 align:middle line:84%
And for aluminum
or other particles,

00:13:56.066 --> 00:13:57.690 align:middle line:84%
there are a lot of
toxicological things

00:13:57.690 --> 00:13:58.795 align:middle line:84%
that need to get
looked at seriously.

00:13:58.795 --> 00:14:00.878 align:middle line:84%
But if you're just thinking
about the sheer number

00:14:00.878 --> 00:14:02.764 align:middle line:84%
of particles and
the human health

00:14:02.764 --> 00:14:04.305 align:middle line:84%
impact of small
particles, the answer

00:14:04.305 --> 00:14:06.790 align:middle line:84%
is while we have published it,
that was the first thing we

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:08.748 align:middle line:84%
looked at-- was some of
the leading experts who

00:14:08.748 --> 00:14:12.010 align:middle line:84%
do epidemiological research
on human health impacts.

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:14.199 align:middle line:84%
And it's not even close
to being an issue.

00:14:14.199 --> 00:14:15.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Any comments on that?

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:16.948 align:middle line:10%
>>MURPHY: Well, it
was interesting,

00:14:16.948 --> 00:14:19.960 align:middle line:10%
because again, geoengineers
have done a tremendous amount

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:23.440 align:middle line:10%
of studies, financial
impact statements.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:29.870 align:middle line:10%
Even university studies are
now partnering with Bill Gates.

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:33.470 align:middle line:84%
So they've really done
a lot of work into this.

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And again, they're
pushing for aluminum

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:37.740 align:middle line:90%
to be the primary ingredient.

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:40.100 align:middle line:84%
What's ironic--
obviously, Dane asked him

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:42.490 align:middle line:84%
if there had been any studies
about the human health

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:45.530 align:middle line:84%
impacts of aluminum
and what spraying this

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:47.860 align:middle line:84%
into the atmosphere would
do to the population.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And they blatantly denied
that there were any studies.

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:52.090 align:middle line:90%
And that's a lie.

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:54.340 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line is there
have been a tremendous amount

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:57.619 align:middle line:84%
of studies linking aluminum to
Alzheimer's, ADD, and a number

00:14:57.619 --> 00:14:58.410 align:middle line:90%
of other illnesses.

00:14:58.410 --> 00:14:59.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that
fellow was lying to him.

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:00.906 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Well,
he absolutely was.

00:15:00.906 --> 00:15:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And we actually,
during that time,

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:06.370 align:middle line:84%
documented and showed a
document of an aluminum study

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:09.840 align:middle line:84%
that was done on rats that
linked to human health.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.020 align:middle line:84%
So without question,
aluminum is the link

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:14.040 align:middle line:90%
to a number of illnesses.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Since the-- In the
past 10 to 15 years,

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:20.560 align:middle line:84%
we've seen an
incredible increase

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.310 align:middle line:84%
in Alzheimer's in
Riverside County alone.

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:24.420 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
get into that, too.

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:26.130 align:middle line:84%
The health effects
of it alone-- we

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:27.720 align:middle line:84%
have another little
clip that we're

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.140 align:middle line:84%
going to run coming
from Dr. Lenny

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:31.672 align:middle line:84%
Thyme on that in
just a little bit.

00:15:31.672 --> 00:15:34.130 align:middle line:84%
What I wanted to find out from
you a little bit more about,

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.950 align:middle line:84%
while we're still in this
arena, is the actual levels.

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:38.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know there
were some studies done

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:41.800 align:middle line:84%
at Mount Shasta that
were pretty shocking.

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.417 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you can
tell about that.

00:15:43.417 --> 00:15:44.875 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Well,
the initial testing

00:15:44.875 --> 00:15:48.370 align:middle line:84%
that they did, they found seven
parts per billion of aluminum,

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:49.690 align:middle line:90%
which is already high.

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:52.710 align:middle line:84%
Within a six year period,
they've seen when the storms

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:55.910 align:middle line:84%
come in, and that's-- typically,
when they tend to spray,

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:58.940 align:middle line:84%
they've seen those numbers
escalate very high,

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.350 align:middle line:84%
as much as 50,000
percentage points.

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:03.650 align:middle line:84%
We covered in What In the
World Are They Spraying?

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:05.900 align:middle line:84%
a snow sample taken
on Mount Shasta.

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And this is expected
to be a pristine area.

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:13.230 align:middle line:84%
It's right where the jet stream
comes in off of the Pacific.

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:19.814 align:middle line:84%
And that test revealed 61,100
parts per billion of aluminum

00:16:19.814 --> 00:16:21.480 align:middle line:84%
and very high amounts
of barium and also

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.790 align:middle line:84%
strontium-- again, the
primary ingredients.

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:23.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's how
many times higher than what's

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:24.420 align:middle line:90%
acceptable?

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.295 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Well, acceptable
for drinking water

00:16:26.295 --> 00:16:27.840 align:middle line:90%
is 1,000 parts per billion.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:30.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And this is 61,000?

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:33.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Yeah, this is 61 times
what the allowable amount--

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:36.200 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately, hikers hike
on that mountain every year.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.300 align:middle line:84%
They use that snow
for hydration.

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:39.660 align:middle line:90%
And it's literally toxic.

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:41.868 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's going
into our water supplies,

00:16:41.868 --> 00:16:42.504 align:middle line:90%
as well, right?

00:16:42.504 --> 00:16:43.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: It is.

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:45.820 align:middle line:84%
It hasn't hit the aquifers
yet in Mount Shasta.

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:48.990 align:middle line:84%
It does take about 20 years
for that water to fall down.

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:53.100 align:middle line:84%
But a number of water supplies
do get impacted from this.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:57.084 align:middle line:84%
And the challenge is without
question, it is in the air

00:16:57.084 --> 00:16:57.750 align:middle line:90%
that we breathe.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:00.700 align:middle line:84%
So every breath that we
take, we're inhaling this.

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:01.590 align:middle line:90%
We are inhaling this.

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One thing
you didn't cover

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:06.960 align:middle line:84%
in this, which I don't know if
it was because it just simply

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.410 align:middle line:84%
can't be documented or there
aren't enough studies on it

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:13.720 align:middle line:84%
yet, but when I was chasing the
story down about a decade ago,

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.190 align:middle line:84%
one of the people I came across
who was taking samples up

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:21.130 align:middle line:84%
near Mount Adams-- they were
dealing with someone who was

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:24.290 align:middle line:84%
a scientists-- German scientist
from the Project Paper Clip

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:27.210 align:middle line:84%
time, someone who had a
very, very thorough lab.

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And as they were
capturing the snow samples

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:32.414 align:middle line:84%
and analyzing them, they were
finding the aluminum oxide

00:17:32.414 --> 00:17:33.830 align:middle line:84%
and the barium,
but they were also

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:35.820 align:middle line:90%
finding biological elements.

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:38.960 align:middle line:84%
They were finding certain
bacterial or viral elements

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:39.550 align:middle line:90%
in it.

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Yes.

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Clifford Carnicom has
done just a wonderful job

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:44.270 align:middle line:90%
at compiling that research.

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:45.640 align:middle line:90%
I support his work.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Our films are really focused
on the geoengineering

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:50.630 align:middle line:90%
aspect of that.

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:52.020 align:middle line:90%
So we specialized in that.

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And again, he does a
wonderful and very effective

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.460 align:middle line:84%
job at bringing to
light the biologicals.

00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:58.440 align:middle line:90%
One thing is for sure.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.580 align:middle line:84%
There are a number
of objectives--

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.290 align:middle line:84%
and this is
documented-- that can

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:04.720 align:middle line:84%
be achieved by putting
aerosols or even

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.540 align:middle line:90%
biologicals into our sky.

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And there's a history,
actually, of programs

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:12.260 align:middle line:84%
that have achieved some
of these objectives

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:15.120 align:middle line:90%
with biologicals here in the US.

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, because
there is no explaining

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.660 align:middle line:84%
why you would have certain--
I think one of them

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:23.160 align:middle line:90%
was streptococcus.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:26.210 align:middle line:84%
There was another one that
might have had something

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:27.720 align:middle line:90%
to do with typhus.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.510 align:middle line:90%
So don't take that to the bank.

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:32.660 align:middle line:84%
These were found in
those same snow samples,

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:34.854 align:middle line:84%
along with the
aluminum and barium.

00:18:34.854 --> 00:18:36.270 align:middle line:84%
There's no reason
for those things

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:38.555 align:middle line:84%
to ever be in there, no
less the aluminum-- ever.

00:18:38.555 --> 00:18:39.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Well, not for us.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:40.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not for us.

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:41.456 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: There shouln't be.

00:18:41.456 --> 00:18:42.930 align:middle line:84%
But we don't have
to look too far.

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:46.180 align:middle line:84%
Back in-- I believe it
was the '50s or '60s--

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.830 align:middle line:84%
an experiment called
the Tuskegee experiment,

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:51.300 align:middle line:84%
where a number of people in
the African American population

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:53.120 align:middle line:90%
were given syphilis.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.590 align:middle line:84%
So experimentation
is nothing new.

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:58.720 align:middle line:84%
It's been done on the American
people for a number of years.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.629 align:middle line:84%
So I ask that people
research this.

00:19:00.629 --> 00:19:02.170 align:middle line:84%
Look at everything
that we're saying.

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Look into
Carnicom, as well.

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:04.506 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
really important.

00:19:04.506 --> 00:19:05.480 align:middle line:90%
I know you collaborate.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's important to
look at all parts of this.

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:14.330 align:middle line:84%
This is a multi spectrum type
of agenda that's going on.

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's dastardly beyond
most people's comprehension.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:19.059 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Without question, yes.

00:19:19.059 --> 00:19:19.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.520 align:middle line:90%
So let's go on to Lenny Thyme.

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.670 align:middle line:84%
Also, one more
person-- Francis--

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:27.654 align:middle line:84%
how do you say his
name-- Mangels?

00:19:27.654 --> 00:19:28.320 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Close.

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.361 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: USDA inspector?

00:19:29.361 --> 00:19:32.230 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, he's talking
about soil, right?

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And he was talking about
the acidity in the soil,

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:38.190 align:middle line:84%
as you were earlier, because
we're not coming back

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:39.830 align:middle line:90%
to that in this conversation.

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:42.340 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything else around
the soil acidity and what

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:44.010 align:middle line:84%
it does to our crops
and forests that we

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:45.093 align:middle line:90%
need to look at right now?

00:19:45.093 --> 00:19:47.259 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Well, again,
plant life-- typically

00:19:47.259 --> 00:19:49.050 align:middle line:84%
northern California,
where they're located,

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:52.280 align:middle line:84%
has an acidic soil so that the
forest, the plant life there,

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:55.670 align:middle line:84%
much of it requires an
acidic soil to grow.

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And again, the pH has
changed in that area

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:03.320 align:middle line:84%
to alkaline from anywhere
from 10 to 20 times

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.400 align:middle line:90%
the normal alkalinity.

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.690 align:middle line:84%
Aluminum oxide,
barium, strontium--

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:11.010 align:middle line:84%
those oxides, which, without
question, are being sprayed

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:15.100 align:middle line:84%
into our skies, will
change a soil from acidic

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:17.170 align:middle line:84%
to alkaline, exactly
what we're seeing.

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:18.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is there any
kind of mitigation?

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:22.840 align:middle line:84%
At this point, organic backyard
farmers might be saying,

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.840 align:middle line:84%
well, what can I do, besides
obviously grow inside

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:27.341 align:middle line:84%
a greenhouse, which
is one solution.

00:20:27.341 --> 00:20:29.006 align:middle line:84%
It's certainly something
I'm looking at.

00:20:29.006 --> 00:20:31.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Yeah, and a couple
of things-- a number of farmers

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:34.190 align:middle line:84%
now in Maui, believe it
or not-- a tropical area

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:37.450 align:middle line:84%
which has very, very rich
soil-- a number of farmers

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:40.530 align:middle line:84%
have had to move into
greenhouses for certain crops.

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:42.050 align:middle line:90%
So some people are doing that.

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Oyster mushrooms
absorb aluminum.

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:50.520 align:middle line:84%
I spoke with a good friend and
fellow activist, Morgan Kerry,

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.550 align:middle line:84%
who has a organic
gardening business,

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:56.550 align:middle line:84%
also manages Skull, who
wrote Cry Die, which

00:20:56.550 --> 00:21:02.130 align:middle line:84%
is a chemtrail song-- he's a
famous artist-- reggae artist.

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:05.540 align:middle line:84%
But he stated, again,
he found that out,

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:06.590 align:middle line:90%
but what he looked into.

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And he said the amount
of aluminum that's

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:10.690 align:middle line:84%
being dumped on us
is just simply not

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:15.710 align:middle line:84%
enough for the oyster
mushrooms to literally pull out

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:16.240 align:middle line:90%
of the soil.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:19.052 align:middle line:84%
So this is something that
we have to address head on.

00:21:19.052 --> 00:21:20.510 align:middle line:84%
We have to create
public awareness.

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:22.680 align:middle line:84%
We have to alert our
officials to this

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:27.070 align:middle line:84%
and really take effective,
prudent political action

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:27.930 align:middle line:90%
in addressing this.

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Once we do, we can create the
change that we're working for.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:31.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And toward the
end, we'll talk about some

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:33.920 align:middle line:84%
of what we can do to mitigate
the effects on our health,

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:35.836 align:middle line:84%
which we haven't gotten
to yet in this program

00:21:35.836 --> 00:21:38.300 align:middle line:84%
and we're going
to in just a bit.

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:40.740 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Lenny Thyme was
talking about the effects

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:42.900 align:middle line:84%
on our health in
your documentary.

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And I thought we would go ahead
and take that little cut right

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:47.640 align:middle line:84%
now so we can see
what we're looking

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.210 align:middle line:90%
at-- some of the effects.

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:51.400 align:middle line:84%
So let's go ahead and
take a look at that cut.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LENNY THYME: Aluminum
is a very specific, nasty,

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.280 align:middle line:90%
and biological systems.

00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.630 align:middle line:84%
It takes that site
and it never lets go

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:02.210 align:middle line:84%
and it shuts down the
site and that's it.

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And so as you accumulate
aluminum over time,

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:10.180 align:middle line:84%
it causes major
neurological damage

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:13.890 align:middle line:84%
because it ends up as aluminum
oxide that's essentially

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:18.010 align:middle line:84%
stuck in place and can't be
flushed out by normal systems.

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:20.340 align:middle line:84%
>>TAMMY L. BORN: At the core
of everyone's condition,

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:22.350 align:middle line:84%
there's always some
level of toxins.

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:28.170 align:middle line:10%
And aluminum is known to
have cancer-causing effects.

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:30.870 align:middle line:90%
The half life is decades.

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:32.910 align:middle line:84%
I think that we
should be working

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:35.610 align:middle line:84%
on taking more of these
toxins out of our environment

00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:37.490 align:middle line:84%
instead of adding
more toxics in.

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:40.110 align:middle line:84%
It's very concerning that
if we add more toxins

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:42.330 align:middle line:84%
to our environment,
that we'll be increasing

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:44.500 align:middle line:90%
the rates and risks of cancers.

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:47.170 align:middle line:84%
Even one patient
is not worth it.

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:50.330 align:middle line:84%
So sad that they would
consider putting aluminum

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:55.610 align:middle line:84%
in our environment
to affect something

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:58.720 align:middle line:84%
when they could be causing
so much more damage.

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.220 align:middle line:84%
>>WIGINGTON: Wherever the
material is coming from,

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:02.090 align:middle line:90%
it is there.

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:04.870 align:middle line:84%
The amount of metal falling
on us cannot be disputed.

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:07.870 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, this
is not speculation.

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:10.790 align:middle line:84%
The amount of metal in the
last four years, as I said,

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:14.100 align:middle line:84%
have increased to a degree
of thousands of times.

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And the California Air
quality Resources Board

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:20.300 align:middle line:84%
has studied the
aerosols from China.

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:22.480 align:middle line:84%
These metals are
not amongst them.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:26.530 align:middle line:84%
Mike, the reason I've
chosen to focus so primarily

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:31.080 align:middle line:84%
on this issue is I feel all
other issues are secondary.

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:33.960 align:middle line:84%
What could be a greater
priority than not

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.825 align:middle line:84%
being able to walk out your
door and take in a breath of air

00:23:36.825 --> 00:23:39.000 align:middle line:90%
without sucking up heavy metals?

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.840 align:middle line:84%
If our land base
is being poisoned,

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.870 align:middle line:84%
if our waters are
being toxified,

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:46.810 align:middle line:84%
what will we have
left to work wtih?

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:49.690 align:middle line:84%
Whatever we choose to focus
our time and energy on,

00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:52.310 align:middle line:84%
whatever our political
beliefs, that this

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:54.220 align:middle line:84%
is a common ground
for all of us.

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:56.240 align:middle line:84%
We must have air
that we can breathe

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.560 align:middle line:84%
that's not full of toxic
chemicals and metals.

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:03.800 align:middle line:84%
We must have water that's not
completely laden with whatever

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.840 align:middle line:84%
is being emitted
from these aircraft.

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And if people stopped to
consider that the atmosphere is

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:14.610 align:middle line:84%
as thin as a layer of
paint on a basketball--

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:16.550 align:middle line:84%
it is an extremely thin
layer that allows life

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:19.235 align:middle line:84%
to exist on this planet-- to
simply treat it as a physics

00:24:19.235 --> 00:24:24.130 align:middle line:84%
lab and experiment with it
until it is broken beyond repair

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:27.688 align:middle line:84%
is folly of
unbelievable proportion.

00:24:27.688 --> 00:24:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And if people understood that
this sort of experimentation

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:35.110 align:middle line:84%
not only is going on, but has
been going on for a very, very

00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:37.830 align:middle line:84%
long time-- going
back 50 years, there's

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:41.880 align:middle line:84%
been countless
climate manipulation,

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.220 align:middle line:84%
weather modification programs
that the vast majority

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:46.220 align:middle line:84%
of the public is
completely unaware of.

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And if they think this is not
true, that certainly, somehow,

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:51.530 align:middle line:84%
they would have known
if it was occurring,

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:53.630 align:middle line:84%
I would ask them
to look at things

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:56.160 align:middle line:84%
like Agent Orange and the
things that governments

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:59.710 align:middle line:84%
do because they can, because
there's no one to stop them,

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:05.730 align:middle line:84%
because they have these
huge military machines that

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:07.150 align:middle line:90%
want to control everything.

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the
government's own document--

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:10.920 align:middle line:84%
perhaps you may
have seen, and it's

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:14.295 align:middle line:84%
available to anyone online--
is called "Owning the Weather,"

00:25:14.295 --> 00:25:16.380 align:middle line:84%
an express goal
of our government,

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:17.745 align:middle line:90%
and not just our government.

00:25:17.745 --> 00:25:19.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SPEAKER: He told
the Associated Press

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:22.170 align:middle line:84%
that the American government
has created weather

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:27.400 align:middle line:84%
tampering techniques so that
the new world order will

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.266 align:middle line:84%
be able to starve
millions of Americans

00:25:30.266 --> 00:25:31.750 align:middle line:90%
and to control the rest.

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:34.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SPEAKER: There is weather
control techniques-- number

00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:38.050 align:middle line:84%
one, the entire patents on
the equipment, number two,

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:42.255 align:middle line:84%
Senator Clayborne tells complete
statement and story of his own

00:25:42.255 --> 00:25:45.330 align:middle line:84%
that only does it exist,
but that we even utilized it

00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:47.382 align:middle line:90%
as far back as the Vietnam War.

00:25:47.382 --> 00:25:49.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SPEAKER: We're going
to do what we can.

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:51.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SPEAKER: Let's
see what we can do.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.006 align:middle line:84%
You've got the
scientists behind you.

00:25:53.006 --> 00:25:56.630 align:middle line:84%
The scientists are with you,
so-- at least this scientist

00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:58.530 align:middle line:90%
is with you.

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:00.420 align:middle line:84%
I may not have a
million dollar budget,

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:02.200 align:middle line:84%
but I've got enough to show that
something's dreadfully wrong

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:02.699 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:26:02.699 --> 00:26:03.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SPEAKER: You got it.

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:04.609 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:26:04.609 --> 00:26:05.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good job.

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:08.090 align:middle line:10%
I just totally commend the
amount of incredible effort

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:09.970 align:middle line:10%
you've gone to to
bring this to us.

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:13.260 align:middle line:10%
But let's talk more about
all of the different health

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:15.095 align:middle line:10%
effects that are
being documented now.

00:26:15.095 --> 00:26:15.970 align:middle line:10%
>>MURPHY: Well, yeah.

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:17.690 align:middle line:10%
And again, this is
showing up everywhere

00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:20.470 align:middle line:10%
in blood tests and hair
follicle tests as well.

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:23.950 align:middle line:10%
So aluminum is very
toxic to our system.

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:26.190 align:middle line:10%
And when we inhale it, we
have a blood brain barrier

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:27.798 align:middle line:10%
that should protect us from it.

00:26:27.798 --> 00:26:29.422 align:middle line:84%
What they're spraying
is nanoparticles,

00:26:29.422 --> 00:26:32.230 align:middle line:84%
so it will pass right through
the blood brain barrier

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:33.110 align:middle line:90%
into the brain.

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:36.430 align:middle line:84%
So now, we have documented
cases of Alzheimer's of people

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:37.980 align:middle line:90%
in their 40s.

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:40.510 align:middle line:84%
As Dr. Born stated,
she was shocked

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:43.720 align:middle line:84%
to think that somebody would
even propose spraying aluminum

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.230 align:middle line:84%
into our atmosphere
because of the toxicity.

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And it leads to a number
of neurological illnesses

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:53.130 align:middle line:84%
which, in turn, because
it's highly reactive,

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:56.400 align:middle line:84%
it will actually, in essence,
stick to other particles

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.200 align:middle line:90%
into our system.

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's very
difficult to flush out

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:02.430 align:middle line:84%
without normal chelation
and other things.

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:05.110 align:middle line:84%
As a result, it compromises
our immune system.

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:08.840 align:middle line:84%
So Dr. Born stated we should
expect a number of cancers

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:12.640 align:middle line:84%
and other illnesses to come
in from the daily inhalation

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:13.750 align:middle line:90%
of this metal.

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:16.560 align:middle line:84%
So aluminum-- that in
itself is very toxic.

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:19.360 align:middle line:84%
One of the other primary
ingredients that we're finding

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:21.210 align:middle line:90%
is barium.

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:22.990 align:middle line:90%
Barium is very toxic.

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:24.350 align:middle line:90%
It does a couple of things.

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:26.370 align:middle line:90%
It lowers our immune system.

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:29.160 align:middle line:84%
And then another thing-- I spoke
to a number of emergency room

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:29.760 align:middle line:90%
physicians.

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And they state during
heavy spray days,

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.160 align:middle line:84%
their emergency
rooms are packed.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, like my friend--
horrible upper respiratory,

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:37.360 align:middle line:90%
sinus infections.

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:38.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Yeah.

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:39.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Asthma.

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:41.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Asthma-- well,
respiratory mortality

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:44.010 align:middle line:84%
has actually gone
from number eight down

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:46.459 align:middle line:84%
to number three in
a six year period.

00:27:46.459 --> 00:27:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And a number of
physicians that we're

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.135 align:middle line:84%
talking to say their
waiting rooms now

00:27:51.135 --> 00:27:53.950 align:middle line:84%
are packed with people
with respiratory illnesses.

00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:58.810 align:middle line:84%
But due to the fact that it does
increase our blood pressure,

00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:01.780 align:middle line:84%
the physicians told me people
come in, typically of dry

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:04.690 align:middle line:84%
mouth, irritability, headache,
nausea-- some of the minor--

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:09.232 align:middle line:90%


00:28:09.232 --> 00:28:10.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Side effects.

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:12.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Side effects,
yeah, during those days.

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:16.200 align:middle line:84%
But again, they should expect a
higher incidence of both heart

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.660 align:middle line:84%
attacks and strokes, because
it does increase our blood

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:19.430 align:middle line:90%
pressure.

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:22.360 align:middle line:84%
Strontium, which, again, has
been found in massive amounts

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:24.290 align:middle line:84%
all around the world--
and this appears

00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:26.380 align:middle line:84%
to be the chemtrail
geoengineering footprint--

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:27.990 align:middle line:90%
aluminum, barium, and strontium.

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:29.500 align:middle line:90%
It's a carcinogen.

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:34.220 align:middle line:84%
So when our bodies are just
loaded with these metals,

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:36.490 align:middle line:84%
with these toxins-- and
there's a lot more than just

00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:38.130 align:middle line:84%
aluminum, barium,
and strontium--

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:40.100 align:middle line:84%
our immune systems
will be compromised.

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:41.729 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Add some
biologicals to that.

00:28:41.729 --> 00:28:43.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: And add some,
yeah, into the mix.

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:46.480 align:middle line:84%
So that, we believe, is
one of the main reasons why

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:49.500 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing this incredible
increase of illness,

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:52.620 align:middle line:84%
flus, and other things that
are ailing society today.

00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:55.284 align:middle line:90%


00:28:55.284 --> 00:28:57.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going
to say, during the spray

00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:58.980 align:middle line:84%
days in Sedona, when
I was living there--

00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:00.397 align:middle line:84%
it's still the
same in California.

00:29:00.397 --> 00:29:02.354 align:middle line:84%
It's just that that's
where I first noticed it,

00:29:02.354 --> 00:29:04.015 align:middle line:84%
because we had cobalt
blue skies that

00:29:04.015 --> 00:29:05.520 align:middle line:90%
were almost never blue anymore.

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.895 align:middle line:84%
There would only
be short periods

00:29:06.895 --> 00:29:08.190 align:middle line:90%
where they wouldn't spray.

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And I would take the time to
go out and cover my garden.

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:15.770 align:middle line:84%
I would use that white
fabric cover for gardens.

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:17.700 align:middle line:90%
They'd spray in the morning.

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:20.020 align:middle line:84%
Before the stuff puffed
up and obscured the skies,

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:22.750 align:middle line:84%
I'd make sure to cover the
garden, because the reality is

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:27.270 align:middle line:84%
this has now permeated every
leaf, every berry, everything

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:27.840 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:28.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: It has.

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:31.027 align:middle line:84%
And I spend a lot
of time in Maui.

00:29:31.027 --> 00:29:31.860 align:middle line:90%
That's where I live.

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:33.290 align:middle line:90%
And I live very organically.

00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And I took about
a six month break

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:38.040 align:middle line:90%
after the release of this film.

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.970 align:middle line:90%
I returned just in October.

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:41.590 align:middle line:84%
When I was there
before, we noticed

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:46.980 align:middle line:84%
about probably a 15% to 20%
death of the rainforest.

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:50.130 align:middle line:84%
This year, we noticed
it was about 35%

00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:52.150 align:middle line:90%
of the rainforest was dead.

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:53.970 align:middle line:90%
This is during the rainy season.

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And the Hawaiians tell
us, the locals tell us,

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.380 align:middle line:84%
during this time,
when the rains come,

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:01.300 align:middle line:84%
they expect everything
to turn more green.

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:03.500 align:middle line:84%
When the rains came about
a year and a half ago,

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:06.125 align:middle line:84%
everything started turning
brown-- so without question.

00:30:06.125 --> 00:30:07.629 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:30:07.629 --> 00:30:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I brought that
up about the Sedona thing

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:11.650 align:middle line:90%
is that's our food supply.

00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:13.910 align:middle line:84%
These trees are used for
many things, not the least

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:16.220 align:middle line:90%
of which is fruit-bearing trees.

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:19.650 align:middle line:84%
The trees are experiencing
bark just peeling off them,

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:22.570 align:middle line:84%
from what I saw in your
documentary, in Hawaii.

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:25.490 align:middle line:84%
You can come up and just stick
your fingernails in and peel

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:28.514 align:middle line:84%
back the bark, where it
shouldn't be that way.

00:30:28.514 --> 00:30:29.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Right.

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:33.340 align:middle line:10%
And that palm tree that
we included in the film--

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:35.740 align:middle line:10%
it was dying at the
time-- it's 100% dead,

00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:37.900 align:middle line:10%
with thousands of
other palm trees

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:41.290 align:middle line:10%
and other trees in the
rainforest during that time.

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:43.390 align:middle line:10%
One of the things
that we're noticing

00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:46.550 align:middle line:10%
is because these programs--
and again, the proponents

00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:49.350 align:middle line:10%
of geoengineering even state
that their programs will

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:52.970 align:middle line:10%
destroy our ozone-- we have
much more UV coming through.

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:55.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's very
common to see leaves

00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:57.970 align:middle line:84%
that are singed that
are getting burned.

00:30:57.970 --> 00:30:59.410 align:middle line:90%
A lot of bark is peeling.

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:00.920 align:middle line:84%
So these are,
again, consequences

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:05.490 align:middle line:84%
from geoengineering that is a
very slow death to our trees,

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:07.666 align:middle line:84%
to our plants, and our
food supply in general.

00:31:07.666 --> 00:31:09.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you were
talking about-- that's

00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:11.290 align:middle line:84%
just the aluminum part,
for the most part.

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And we know that, also, the
barium salts and the strontium

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:16.850 align:middle line:90%
must be implicated in that.

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:19.510 align:middle line:84%
But when they're talking
about geoengineering--

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:23.630 align:middle line:84%
and as you've said, these
very fine particulate

00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:27.000 align:middle line:84%
nanoparticles that they're
spraying supposedly

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.110 align:middle line:84%
to alter our weather
patterns-- and we're

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:32.250 align:middle line:84%
going to talk about
that much later.

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:33.310 align:middle line:90%
Then why the barium?

00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:34.600 align:middle line:90%
Why the strontium?

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:37.660 align:middle line:84%
What part does that play
in a geoengineering scene?

00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:40.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Well, geoengineers
don't specifically-- at least

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.430 align:middle line:84%
from what we've seen--
talk about barium.

00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:46.500 align:middle line:84%
Barium is included
in the HARP patent.

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:49.010 align:middle line:84%
There appears to be a
connection between HARP,

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:50.490 align:middle line:90%
which hopefully, we'll get into.

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:52.840 align:middle line:84%
But those are
things that we have

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:55.330 align:middle line:84%
found in this chemtrail
geoengineering footprint.

00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:57.850 align:middle line:84%
They do have a lot
of properties that

00:31:57.850 --> 00:32:02.180 align:middle line:84%
can be used in weather
control and even imaging

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:03.040 align:middle line:90%
for the military.

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.650 align:middle line:84%
So there are a
bunch applications.

00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:06.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again,
like we said, this

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:10.040 align:middle line:90%
is a multi-tentacled agenda.

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:11.970 align:middle line:84%
I think tentacle is
a good word to use

00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:15.380 align:middle line:90%
instead of prong at this point.

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:17.145 align:middle line:90%
Bees-- what about bees?

00:32:17.145 --> 00:32:19.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we're talking
about plant extinction,

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:23.340 align:middle line:84%
species extinction at
very, very rapid rates now

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:24.690 align:middle line:90%
over the last decade.

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:26.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember
the exact numbers

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:29.320 align:middle line:84%
on how many different
types of biological species

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.020 align:middle line:90%
are becoming extinct each year.

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:32.050 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk about that?

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:33.633 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: I believe
what we're looking

00:32:33.633 --> 00:32:36.670 align:middle line:84%
at is an extension rate
that is over 1,000 times

00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:38.440 align:middle line:90%
the normal rate.

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And again, these programs--
there's nothing on the planet

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:42.790 align:middle line:90%
that it does not affect.

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:46.260 align:middle line:84%
Even an insect so
small as a bee,

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:48.280 align:middle line:84%
this affects them,
because these are nano

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:52.430 align:middle line:84%
sized particles, and many
times, 1/10 of a micron in size.

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:55.360 align:middle line:84%
So they literally affect
each and every thing.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:57.500 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
speculation that the bee death

00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:00.290 align:middle line:90%
could be a result of this.

00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:02.660 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about why in
the world are they spraying,

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:05.020 align:middle line:84%
we can get-- dig a
little bit more deeply

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:06.700 align:middle line:90%
about who benefits from this.

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:07.440 align:middle line:84%
Why would any corporation
benefit from this?

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:08.856 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, we
definitely will.

00:33:08.856 --> 00:33:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And also, there's been
talk that part of it

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:14.650 align:middle line:84%
might also be some of the
RF and EMF frequencies,

00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:17.760 align:middle line:84%
HARP, and other things that
could be playing in with this

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.700 align:middle line:84%
and causing destruction of
the bee colonies as well.

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:25.340 align:middle line:84%
But just before we started
today, Jay came in and said,

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:28.200 align:middle line:84%
have you heard about that
study-- not the study.

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:30.290 align:middle line:84%
What is it with
Monsanto and the bees?

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:32.710 align:middle line:84%
A new patent that
they're looking

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:35.554 align:middle line:84%
to apply for or have
applied for regarding bees?

00:33:35.554 --> 00:33:37.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: I haven't
looked into that too much.

00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:39.570 align:middle line:84%
But it does look like
they're appearing

00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:42.490 align:middle line:84%
to genetically
modify certain bees.

00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:47.560 align:middle line:84%
So what this is-- it
comes through the death

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:51.200 align:middle line:90%
and destruction of nature.

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:52.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And our
children-- and this

00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:55.850 align:middle line:90%
is a really important part.

00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:58.160 align:middle line:84%
We ourselves might
be looking at oh,

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.489 align:middle line:84%
yeah, it's inconvenient
to go in to have

00:34:00.489 --> 00:34:02.780 align:middle line:84%
to deal with upper respiratory
infections and so forth.

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:05.120 align:middle line:84%
But these little
kids-- now anyone

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:07.810 align:middle line:84%
who's probably under
12 years of age or so--

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:10.050 align:middle line:90%
has been raised with this.

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:14.179 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people escape
to Maui, where you live,

00:34:14.179 --> 00:34:15.880 align:middle line:84%
places like Maui
and Sedona to get

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:20.239 align:middle line:84%
away from all of the toxicity
in the urban areas and so forth.

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:23.639 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, it's just
as bad, if not even worse,

00:34:23.639 --> 00:34:26.530 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to
chemtrails in these areas.

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And you're filming
this little girl.

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.050 align:middle line:84%
Let's set that up--
this sound byte.

00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:31.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Sounds good.

00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A little
girl whose parents

00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:35.719 align:middle line:84%
are living on an
organic farm, right?

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Organic farm,
far removed from anything,

00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:41.790 align:middle line:84%
in an area called Kipahulu,
so it's very organic.

00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:43.489 align:middle line:84%
There's no industry
in that area.

00:34:43.489 --> 00:34:45.750 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, they
raised her in that.

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:48.800 align:middle line:84%
At the time of the filming,
she was three years old,

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:52.560 align:middle line:84%
had never been exposed to
a vaccine or anything that

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:56.040 align:middle line:84%
would give her any high
amounts of heavy metals.

00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:56.607 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:34:56.607 --> 00:34:57.940 align:middle line:90%
We'll go to that byte right now.

00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's a little girl who has
had hair toxicity samples done.

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:02.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Correct.

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:02.781 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:35:02.781 --> 00:35:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SPEAKER: This
is the chart here.

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:08.365 align:middle line:90%
This is the reference range.

00:35:08.365 --> 00:35:14.676 align:middle line:84%
And this is where my
daughter is-- 23.1 aluminum.

00:35:14.676 --> 00:35:17.300 align:middle line:84%
The skies are covered
with a white mist.

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And I look up at
night anymore and I

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.170 align:middle line:84%
don't see the deep, dense
stars that I used to,

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:23.334 align:middle line:84%
and I can't help but
think this obviously

00:35:23.334 --> 00:35:25.780 align:middle line:84%
has something to do with
my daughter's health.

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:28.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where else these
heavy metals are coming from.

00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:30.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SPEAKER: Yeah, look.

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:31.280 align:middle line:90%
Look how old she is.

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:32.945 align:middle line:90%
She's been isolated here.

00:35:32.945 --> 00:35:33.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Here.

00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:35.304 align:middle line:90%
And she's--

00:35:35.304 --> 00:35:35.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SPEAKER: Here.

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:38.440 align:middle line:84%
Anybody looking at the
situation would be like,

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:39.740 align:middle line:90%
this is paradise.

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:42.040 align:middle line:84%
This child should
be, like, superhuman,

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:45.640 align:middle line:84%
and here you are, getting
all this heavy metal stuff.

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:50.409 align:middle line:84%
>>SPEAKER: She has the highest
level aluminum on the chart.

00:35:50.409 --> 00:35:52.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what does
this do to the development

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:56.000 align:middle line:84%
of the brain, of every
other biological function

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:56.760 align:middle line:90%
in the body?

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:58.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: I think quite a bit.

00:35:58.010 --> 00:36:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Born elaborated in the
film about the consequences.

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:04.260 align:middle line:84%
One thing-- we are finding
aluminum in rain tests.

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:05.770 align:middle line:84%
Since we released
the film, people

00:36:05.770 --> 00:36:07.300 align:middle line:90%
have been testing the rain.

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's been found
in thousands of times

00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:13.550 align:middle line:84%
the normal amounts that we
would expect to see in our rain.

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:16.040 align:middle line:84%
But people have, again,
started testing their blood

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.570 align:middle line:90%
and doing hair follicle tests.

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:21.280 align:middle line:84%
A group of over 20 people
in Mojave County, Arizona,

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:22.522 align:middle line:90%
started getting blood tests.

00:36:22.522 --> 00:36:23.730 align:middle line:90%
What they found was shocking.

00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:27.000 align:middle line:84%
85% of that group
had levels of barium

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.360 align:middle line:84%
that were considered to
be at least 1,000 times

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:31.750 align:middle line:84%
over the elevated
amounts of barium.

00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:34.647 align:middle line:84%
Aluminum levels were
very high as well.

00:36:34.647 --> 00:36:36.980 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And then we have
something that is very exotic

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:38.790 align:middle line:10%
and probably one
of the creepiest

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:40.650 align:middle line:10%
things I have ever researched.

00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:43.196 align:middle line:10%
And that's Morgellons disease.

00:36:43.196 --> 00:36:44.570 align:middle line:10%
Sophia Smallstorm
talks about it.

00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:46.361 align:middle line:84%
If you have a chance,
you can go to YouTube

00:36:46.361 --> 00:36:50.016 align:middle line:84%
and find an hour-long talk that
Sophia gives on Morgellons.

00:36:50.016 --> 00:36:52.140 align:middle line:84%
Can you give us a little
bit of background on that?

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:54.700 align:middle line:10%
>>MURPHY: Just a little
bit-- our studies primarily

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:57.640 align:middle line:10%
focus on the
geoengineering aspect.

00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:01.450 align:middle line:10%
But again, biologicals--
Clifford Carnicom and again,

00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:04.840 align:middle line:10%
Sophia-- they've done a very
effective, wonderful job

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:06.790 align:middle line:10%
at uncovering some of
the biologicals, some

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:08.570 align:middle line:10%
of the other aspects.

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Morgellons is something that
has been effectively demonized

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:13.430 align:middle line:84%
by the corporate
mainstream media

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:15.437 align:middle line:84%
as something that
is a mental illness.

00:37:15.437 --> 00:37:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the
patients, apparently,

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:20.810 align:middle line:84%
feel like bugs are running
underneath their skin.

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And from what I'm
told, there are

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:26.250 align:middle line:84%
fibers that are growing out of
many of these patients' skins.

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:27.010 align:middle line:90%
It's very painful.

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:30.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These fibers appear
to be metallic in nature.

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.440 align:middle line:84%
They appear to be
corporately made, metallic.

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:34.890 align:middle line:84%
Some of them have numbers on
them from what I understand.

00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:37.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is, again,
growing out of people's skin.

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:39.441 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: It's growing
out of the skin of people.

00:37:39.441 --> 00:37:42.610 align:middle line:84%
So again, it's believed to
be part of these programs.

00:37:42.610 --> 00:37:44.730 align:middle line:84%
I would reference
or refer anybody

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:46.720 align:middle line:84%
into Clifford Carnicom's
site, because he

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:48.932 align:middle line:84%
has done just an incredible
amount of research

00:37:48.932 --> 00:37:49.640 align:middle line:90%
into that aspect.

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:50.265 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good.

00:37:50.265 --> 00:37:52.040 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a
good place to go.

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:55.950 align:middle line:84%
As we're looking at this, one of
the things that keeps coming up

00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:59.220 align:middle line:84%
and has come up again for
myself and many others that

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:02.620 align:middle line:84%
have been interested in this is
that we feel almost completely

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:06.180 align:middle line:90%
helpless to stop it.

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:09.450 align:middle line:84%
As you say, it's some
kind of black ops project.

00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:12.090 align:middle line:84%
Whatever's going
on there, the FAA

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:15.060 align:middle line:90%
is not allowed to talk about.

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:17.170 align:middle line:90%
They're kept away from that.

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:19.730 align:middle line:84%
This is like a black
ops military project

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:22.150 align:middle line:84%
that is being funded
from somewhere.

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:24.620 align:middle line:84%
That has to cost-- when you
look at those tanker planes

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:27.630 align:middle line:84%
up there, that's a
lot of money to dump

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:30.900 align:middle line:84%
each one of those loads of
chemtrails crisscrossing

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:35.751 align:middle line:84%
the nation in their hatch
patterns and so forth.

00:38:35.751 --> 00:38:37.250 align:middle line:84%
So that money-- do
you have any idea

00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:38.500 align:middle line:90%
where the money's coming from?

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:40.291 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Well, that's
one thing that we're

00:38:40.291 --> 00:38:42.160 align:middle line:84%
going to be looking
at in the third film.

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:43.420 align:middle line:90%
Everyone is asking "who?"

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:46.327 align:middle line:84%
We answered the question what,
why, and now who is coming up.

00:38:46.327 --> 00:38:48.910 align:middle line:84%
So we're really going to focus
on that-- what corporations are

00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:51.880 align:middle line:84%
involved and the
money flow of this.

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:55.350 align:middle line:84%
I can relate to, at one time,
feeling helpless about this.

00:38:55.350 --> 00:38:59.500 align:middle line:84%
But this movement has
grown astronomically

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:00.869 align:middle line:90%
just in the past three years.

00:39:00.869 --> 00:39:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And Why In the World Are They
Spraying? and What In the World

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:06.360 align:middle line:84%
Are They Spraying? have
been very effective tools.

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And Maui was an area
that we really focused.

00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:11.130 align:middle line:90%
It's a smaller island.

00:39:11.130 --> 00:39:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And we did a lot of
screenings of both films

00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:15.640 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of public outreaches.

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:17.900 align:middle line:84%
We encourage anybody
who purchases a DVD

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:20.030 align:middle line:84%
to make copies and
hand out for free.

00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:22.400 align:middle line:84%
So we did street campaigns--
literally handed out

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:24.860 align:middle line:90%
thousands of free DVDs.

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:28.090 align:middle line:84%
Within about a year and a half,
we literally had critical mass.

00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:31.270 align:middle line:84%
When we first initially
went to film the first film,

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:34.620 align:middle line:84%
probably seven people on the
island were aware of this.

00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:36.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, I would say I've
met about seven people

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:38.100 align:middle line:90%
during my last stay.

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:39.922 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What year
was that when you first

00:39:39.922 --> 00:39:40.880 align:middle line:90%
started shooting there?

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: That was in 2010.

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: 2010-- and
only seven people

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:46.920 align:middle line:84%
you encountered
were aware of it?

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:49.350 align:middle line:84%
Weren't they wondering what was
happening to their blues skies?

00:39:49.350 --> 00:39:51.795 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Well, we don't see
any direct trails above Maui.

00:39:51.795 --> 00:39:52.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:53.508 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is
important to bring up.

00:39:53.508 --> 00:39:55.440 align:middle line:84%
Please explain this,
because many people--

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:58.132 align:middle line:84%
my friends on Maui say, no,
they never lay trails over here.

00:39:58.132 --> 00:39:59.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Right,
which is not true,

00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:02.060 align:middle line:84%
because now we're seeing
it on a more regular basis.

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:04.010 align:middle line:84%
But what they do-- we
look at satellite--

00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:06.440 align:middle line:84%
they spray offshore a
couple hundred miles.

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:07.760 align:middle line:90%
Then those aerosols come in.

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:11.361 align:middle line:84%
And what they look like is
a wispy type, very unnatural

00:40:11.361 --> 00:40:11.860 align:middle line:90%
cloud.

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:13.651 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at time
lapse-- and there's

00:40:13.651 --> 00:40:15.330 align:middle line:84%
plenty on the
internet-- you can see

00:40:15.330 --> 00:40:18.630 align:middle line:84%
what aerosols look
like in our atmosphere.

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:21.909 align:middle line:84%
For those who do not
believe, public official,

00:40:21.909 --> 00:40:23.450 align:middle line:84%
the director of
health, was concerned

00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:25.680 align:middle line:84%
about this, did
over 30 rain tests.

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:28.090 align:middle line:84%
In each and every rain
test, he found, again,

00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:31.470 align:middle line:84%
the chemtrail geoengineering
footprint of aluminium, barium

00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:34.720 align:middle line:84%
and strontium in very,
very high levels.

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:36.910 align:middle line:84%
But Hawaii is a very
effective place,

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:39.390 align:middle line:90%
because I saw what could happen.

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:42.640 align:middle line:84%
When a community gets together
and when you get critical mass,

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:43.970 align:middle line:90%
people become aware.

00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And the political officials,
at the county level, at least,

00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:49.460 align:middle line:90%
start giving this attention.

00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And we started what was called
the Maui Clean Sky Ordinance.

00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And we have Elle Cochran,
who's a member of the county

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.550 align:middle line:84%
board, who is
sponsoring this bill.

00:40:57.550 --> 00:41:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And it will effectively ban
chemtrail geoengineering

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:02.670 align:middle line:84%
programs on and around
the county of Maui.

00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:05.040 align:middle line:90%
So the bottom line is this.

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:07.710 align:middle line:84%
If you believe that
we don't have power,

00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:09.280 align:middle line:84%
that's a life from
the pit of hell.

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:11.370 align:middle line:84%
And the people who are
behind these programs, who

00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:13.905 align:middle line:84%
are profiting from these
programs, their greatest fear

00:41:13.905 --> 00:41:15.580 align:middle line:90%
is people actually waking up.

00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:18.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they've spent
literally millions of dollars

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:20.610 align:middle line:84%
on disinformation
campaigns and trying

00:41:20.610 --> 00:41:24.665 align:middle line:84%
to demonize people that question
geoengineering as being crazy

00:41:24.665 --> 00:41:26.560 align:middle line:90%
or being not factual.

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:28.050 align:middle line:90%
Bottom line is this.

00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:34.050 align:middle line:84%
A population who is
educated about this

00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:38.560 align:middle line:84%
is powerful and has
power and has the ability

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:40.700 align:middle line:84%
to create change and
to stop these programs.

00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And I can guarantee, when
we get critical mass,

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:45.690 align:middle line:84%
which we are very
close to, and when

00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:48.430 align:middle line:84%
the people who are aware of
this collectively stand up

00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:50.160 align:middle line:84%
and say, no, we
are not supporting

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:51.880 align:middle line:84%
the corporations
that are involved,

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:55.110 align:middle line:84%
no, we are not supporting you
if you're a public official who

00:41:55.110 --> 00:41:57.380 align:middle line:84%
is supporting these
programs, these programs

00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:58.370 align:middle line:90%
will come to a halt.

00:41:58.370 --> 00:42:01.670 align:middle line:84%
We will be able to restore
our fragile planet that's

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:03.270 align:middle line:90%
been molested in so many ways.

00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:04.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So many.

00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And this is a really
dangerous business

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:07.280 align:middle line:90%
for those on Capitol Hill.

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:10.310 align:middle line:84%
We're going to, in a
little bit, watch a clip

00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:13.840 align:middle line:84%
from your endeavors on Capitol
Hill, which says a lot.

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:15.310 align:middle line:90%
It says a lot right there.

00:42:15.310 --> 00:42:17.480 align:middle line:84%
But I happened to
be in attendance

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:19.190 align:middle line:84%
when Dennis Kucinich
first announced

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:21.720 align:middle line:84%
that he was going to
run for his presidency

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:23.070 align:middle line:90%
the first time around.

00:42:23.070 --> 00:42:27.940 align:middle line:84%
I was at that in Marin at
the Marin Civic Center,

00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:30.090 align:middle line:90%
at that event.

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:34.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, Dennis Kucinich,
which is important to know,

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:36.690 align:middle line:84%
wrote into his
space-based weapons-- ban

00:42:36.690 --> 00:42:39.150 align:middle line:84%
on space-based
weapons legislation

00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:42.720 align:middle line:84%
that chemtrails constituted
part of space-based weapons.

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:45.410 align:middle line:84%
He wrote it solidly
in the legislation.

00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:47.770 align:middle line:84%
Just before he announced
his presidency--

00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:52.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure there's some
tie there-- he pulled it.

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:56.470 align:middle line:84%
He pulled that language
specifically on chemtrails.

00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:58.900 align:middle line:84%
Someone in the audience,
when it came to the Q and A,

00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:01.820 align:middle line:84%
who was very angry about
that and well-informed

00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:04.200 align:middle line:84%
on chemtrails, stood up
and said, why did you

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:07.780 align:middle line:84%
pull that language in the
legislation, only specifically

00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:10.850 align:middle line:84%
the language about chemtrails
as a space-based weapon?

00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And he said, very clearly,
if I didn't pull it,

00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:21.330 align:middle line:84%
everything else I'm trying
to do was going to go down.

00:43:21.330 --> 00:43:22.820 align:middle line:90%
And he said, next.

00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:24.097 align:middle line:90%
He wouldn't elaborate.

00:43:24.097 --> 00:43:25.430 align:middle line:90%
Someone tried to do a follow up.

00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:27.020 align:middle line:90%
He would not talk about it.

00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:30.180 align:middle line:84%
I consider him to be one of the
bravest people on Capitol Hill.

00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:31.730 align:middle line:90%
He has taken on everything.

00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:34.570 align:middle line:84%
He even stood up against
Obamacare-- everything.

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:38.144 align:middle line:90%
And yet, even he had to cave.

00:43:38.144 --> 00:43:39.810 align:middle line:84%
So what does that
tell us about the kind

00:43:39.810 --> 00:43:41.270 align:middle line:90%
of pressure they're under?

00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:42.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Well, a
tremendous amount--

00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:45.730 align:middle line:84%
and as you'll see in the
next clip, our officials

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:50.610 align:middle line:84%
at the level of Congress
and in Senate, we're

00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:53.360 align:middle line:84%
told they serve us and
the American population.

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:54.690 align:middle line:90%
And that's a lie.

00:43:54.690 --> 00:43:56.440 align:middle line:84%
They serve the
political interests.

00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:58.840 align:middle line:90%
They serve corporate interests.

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:02.530 align:middle line:84%
As we revealed in the
next film, these programs

00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:06.000 align:middle line:84%
are a very, very effective
way to consolidate

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.930 align:middle line:84%
an enormous amount of both
monetary and political power

00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:12.510 align:middle line:84%
into the hands of few, literally
at the expense of everything.

00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:14.380 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's why
we have the silence.

00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:16.910 align:middle line:84%
However, I've had a
number of phone calls

00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:19.810 align:middle line:84%
from local officials,
state senators, who

00:44:19.810 --> 00:44:21.880 align:middle line:84%
want to get active
in implementing

00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:23.550 align:middle line:90%
these bills at the state level.

00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:25.287 align:middle line:90%
So we do have hope politically.

00:44:25.287 --> 00:44:26.870 align:middle line:84%
And there are a
number of other things

00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:28.910 align:middle line:84%
that we can do in terms
of creating awareness.

00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: However, when
you went to Capitol Hill,

00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:33.415 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't looking too good.

00:44:33.415 --> 00:44:34.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: To say the least.

00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:35.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.540 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at the next clip,

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:39.990 align:middle line:84%
which is your attempt to
educate members of Congress.

00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:40.750 align:middle line:10%
>>MURPHY: Yes.

00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:42.540 align:middle line:10%
Senator, a quick
question about the issue

00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:43.847 align:middle line:10%
of the geoengineering.

00:44:43.847 --> 00:44:45.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DIANNE FEINSTEIN:
I'm afraid I don't

00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:47.050 align:middle line:90%
know what you're talking about.

00:44:47.050 --> 00:44:49.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: I'm
wondering if you were

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.230 align:middle line:84%
supportive of geoengineers'
proposals of spraying 10 to 20

00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:55.085 align:middle line:84%
million tons of aluminum
into the atmosphere.

00:44:55.085 --> 00:44:57.418 align:middle line:84%
>>POLITICIAN: I should really
get a briefing paper on it

00:44:57.418 --> 00:44:58.610 align:middle line:90%
before I give an opinion.

00:44:58.610 --> 00:45:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Oh, not a prob--
are you aware of the issue?

00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:02.250 align:middle line:90%
>>POLITICIAN: Not completely.

00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:03.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: At all?

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.350 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a letter from
constituents-- and people

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:09.200 align:middle line:90%
have concerns.

00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:11.535 align:middle line:84%
>>MAN: We're making a

00:45:35.953 --> 00:45:38.458 align:middle line:10%

little unusual, huh?

>>SAXBY CHAMBLISS: I
haven't heard that, no.

00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:43.710 align:middle line:10%
>>MURPHY: You've
never heard of it?

00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:45.920 align:middle line:10%
And it appears that these
programs have already

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:46.890 align:middle line:10%
been deployed.

let me review it?

>>MURPHY: I can do that.

00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:54.002 align:middle line:10%
Are you aware of--

And I will act accordingly.

00:46:06.406 --> 00:46:09.730 align:middle line:10%
>>MURPHY: General--
oh, I'm sorry.

00:46:09.730 --> 00:46:11.710 align:middle line:10%
This program, this
openly covert program

00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:14.020 align:middle line:10%
of the aerosol spraying--
stratospheric aerosol

00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:17.470 align:middle line:10%
spraying, geoengineering,
using tons of aluminum,

00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:18.840 align:middle line:10%
spraying it up in the sky.

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:19.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LT GEN JAMES R.
CLAPPER JR: I have

00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:20.110 align:middle line:84%
no idea what you're
talking about.

00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:20.806 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: OK.

00:46:20.806 --> 00:46:23.410 align:middle line:84%
It's commonly called
chemtrails, sir.

00:46:23.410 --> 00:46:27.305 align:middle line:84%
When you were the head of NEMA,
did you see the aerosol trails?

00:46:27.305 --> 00:46:32.110 align:middle line:90%


00:46:32.110 --> 00:46:32.760 align:middle line:10%
Hi, sir.

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:36.150 align:middle line:10%
We're recovering an issue
called geoengineering

00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:38.520 align:middle line:10%
and wanted to know if you're
supportive of geoengineers'

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:39.019 align:middle line:10%
proposals.

00:46:39.019 --> 00:46:44.864 align:middle line:90%


00:46:44.864 --> 00:46:46.280 align:middle line:10%
Congressman?

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:48.600 align:middle line:10%
We're wondering if you're
supportive of geoengineers'

00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:53.590 align:middle line:10%
proposals, which is dumping 10
to 20 million tons of aluminum

00:46:53.590 --> 00:46:55.157 align:middle line:10%
into the atmosphere.

00:46:55.157 --> 00:46:56.865 align:middle line:10%
>>TIM HOLDEN: I'm not
familiar with that.

00:46:56.865 --> 00:46:57.364 align:middle line:10%
>>MURPHY: Pardon?

00:46:57.364 --> 00:46:59.780 align:middle line:10%
>>HOLDEN: I'm not familiar
with what you're talking about.

00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:02.312 align:middle line:10%
>>MARK SCHAUER: I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:47:02.312 --> 00:47:05.625 align:middle line:10%
You can take
complaints my office.

00:47:05.625 --> 00:47:07.110 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE KILDEE: I'm
not supportive.

00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:10.697 align:middle line:10%
I haven't looked at it.

00:47:10.697 --> 00:47:12.280 align:middle line:10%
>>MURPHY: Have you
heard of the issue?

00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:15.370 align:middle line:10%
Because it's becoming
mainstream and public.

00:47:15.370 --> 00:47:17.470 align:middle line:10%
And there are actually
congressional committees

00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:21.104 align:middle line:10%
which are being formed to
talk about these programs.

00:47:21.104 --> 00:47:22.072 align:middle line:90%
>>KILDEE: Yeah.

00:47:22.072 --> 00:47:26.912 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think if we drop
anything into the atmosphere,

00:47:26.912 --> 00:47:30.860 align:middle line:84%
we should know, prior to,
the effect of that, right?

00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:31.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Yes.

00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>>KILDEE: And if we don't
have the knowledge as to what

00:47:34.650 --> 00:47:36.276 align:middle line:84%
the effect will be,
we shouldn't do it.

00:47:36.276 --> 00:47:38.400 align:middle line:10%
>>BARRETt: I think there
are four different options

00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:40.580 align:middle line:10%
for thinking about
deployment of geoengineering.

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:42.230 align:middle line:10%
The first one would
be we just ban it.

00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:44.720 align:middle line:10%
>>MORGAN: I would
argue that one does not

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:48.400 align:middle line:10%
want to get too firm
a restriction in place

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.890 align:middle line:10%
on small scale studies
early on, because it'll

00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:52.814 align:middle line:10%
tie the science's hands.

00:47:52.814 --> 00:47:54.480 align:middle line:10%
I think what the
science community ought

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:57.610 align:middle line:10%
to be trying to do is say,
you do small scale stuff

00:47:57.610 --> 00:47:59.520 align:middle line:10%
inside this space.

00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's a scientific question
what that space ought to be.

00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:05.155 align:middle line:84%
There shouldn't be a lot of
oversight and restriction.

00:48:05.155 --> 00:48:06.071 align:middle line:10%
>>MURPHY: Congressman?

00:48:06.071 --> 00:48:08.180 align:middle line:10%


00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:09.520 align:middle line:10%
Excuse me.

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:11.210 align:middle line:10%
Hi, I'm Mike Murphy
from Los Angeles,

00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:14.330 align:middle line:10%
covering an issue
called geoengineering.

00:48:14.330 --> 00:48:17.480 align:middle line:84%
These guys are running from
the geoengineering issue.

00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:18.349 align:middle line:90%
I wonder why.

00:48:18.349 --> 00:48:20.307 align:middle line:10%
>>CHARLIE WILSON: I'd
have to talk to my staff.

00:48:20.307 --> 00:48:22.254 align:middle line:10%
I don't know what the
details on that are.

00:48:22.254 --> 00:48:24.295 align:middle line:10%
>>MURPHY: Has anyone made
you aware of the issue?

00:48:24.295 --> 00:48:27.770 align:middle line:90%


00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:29.160 align:middle line:10%
Sir?

00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:31.368 align:middle line:10%
Congressman, your committee
talk about geoengineering

00:48:31.368 --> 00:48:32.354 align:middle line:10%
last November.

00:48:32.354 --> 00:48:34.326 align:middle line:10%
Are you in support
of those proposals?

00:48:34.326 --> 00:48:35.805 align:middle line:10%
We'd love to give you a paper.

00:48:35.805 --> 00:48:39.760 align:middle line:90%


00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:40.705 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNEY FRANK: Which?

00:48:40.705 --> 00:48:41.550 align:middle line:10%
>>MURPHY: Geoengineering.

00:48:41.550 --> 00:48:42.520 align:middle line:10%
>>FRANK: Don't know
anything about it.

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:43.975 align:middle line:10%
>>MURPHY: You know nothing
about the geoengineering issue?

00:48:43.975 --> 00:48:44.475 align:middle line:10%
>>FRANK: No.

00:48:44.475 --> 00:48:45.802 align:middle line:10%
Don't know anything about it.

00:48:45.802 --> 00:48:46.597 align:middle line:10%
Never heard of it.

00:48:46.597 --> 00:48:48.180 align:middle line:10%
>>MURPHY: They call
it geoengineering.

00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:49.626 align:middle line:10%
>>FRANK: Yeah, I've
never heard of it.

00:48:49.626 --> 00:48:51.554 align:middle line:10%
It's nothing I've ever
heard anything about.

00:48:51.554 --> 00:48:57.230 align:middle line:90%


00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:59.396 align:middle line:10%
>>MURPHY: Quickly, have you
heard of geoengineering?

00:48:59.396 --> 00:49:00.229 align:middle line:10%
>>MAXINE WATERS: No.

00:49:00.229 --> 00:49:02.980 align:middle line:10%
>>MURPHY: The proposals to
shoot 10 million tons of metals

00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:03.606 align:middle line:10%
into the air.

00:49:03.606 --> 00:49:05.230 align:middle line:10%
This committee,
Science and Technology,

00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:06.085 align:middle line:10%
covered it for the first time.

00:49:06.085 --> 00:49:06.585 align:middle line:10%
No?

00:49:06.585 --> 00:49:08.290 align:middle line:10%
>>WATERS: No, I
never heard of it.

00:49:08.290 --> 00:49:10.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even our
liberal, Barney Frank.

00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:10.940 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:13.850 align:middle line:90%
Did anybody hear you out?

00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:16.290 align:middle line:90%
Very few, if any.

00:49:16.290 --> 00:49:19.140 align:middle line:90%
Some of the staff members did.

00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:20.147 align:middle line:90%
But bottom line is this.

00:49:20.147 --> 00:49:22.230 align:middle line:84%
There have been a number
of congressional hearings

00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:24.670 align:middle line:90%
on the issue of geoengineering.

00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And I believe, up to date,
now, since we filmed,

00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:30.660 align:middle line:84%
there have been even
some financial studies

00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:32.750 align:middle line:90%
on implementing these programs.

00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:35.670 align:middle line:84%
This is a taboo topic to
speak about in Washington, DC.

00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:36.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They were lying.

00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:37.060 align:middle line:84%
They had to have
been lying, then.

00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:39.680 align:middle line:84%
If there had been committee
hearings, at least some of them

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:40.970 align:middle line:90%
must have heard of it.

00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:42.090 align:middle line:90%
We know Feinstein has.

00:49:42.090 --> 00:49:42.870 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:46.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: And after talking
to a number of activists

00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:49.900 align:middle line:84%
who have been to Washington,
DC, each and every member

00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:53.070 align:middle line:84%
that we had spoken to has
been given information

00:49:53.070 --> 00:49:53.920 align:middle line:90%
about this issue.

00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:57.590 align:middle line:84%
But again, it's something that
if they address and they admit

00:49:57.590 --> 00:49:59.310 align:middle line:84%
to, they have a lot
of powerful forces,

00:49:59.310 --> 00:50:03.670 align:middle line:84%
a lot of forces and corporations
that benefit monetarily,

00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:06.380 align:middle line:84%
both politically,
from these programs.

00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:09.270 align:middle line:90%
So mum is the word.

00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:10.212 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:50:10.212 --> 00:50:11.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know,
one thing I decided

00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:14.000 align:middle line:84%
to go ahead and look into
because we were going

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.770 align:middle line:84%
to be talking about this
today that's so important

00:50:16.770 --> 00:50:20.910 align:middle line:84%
is it's easy right now to feel
pretty hopeless, and not only

00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:23.100 align:middle line:84%
for the planet, but--
and your children,

00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:25.660 align:middle line:84%
your crops, and so
forth, and your own body.

00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And so I talked to one of
our previous interviewees

00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:32.441 align:middle line:84%
named Dan Dunphy, who I have
a tremendous amount of respect

00:50:32.441 --> 00:50:32.940 align:middle line:90%
for.

00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:37.100 align:middle line:84%
He knows the body like almost
no one that I've spoken with.

00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him, what can
we do to leach aluminum?

00:50:41.330 --> 00:50:43.555 align:middle line:84%
I didn't ask about barium
or strontium-- but aluminum

00:50:43.555 --> 00:50:47.060 align:middle line:84%
from the body, since it seems to
be a preponderance of aluminum

00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:49.270 align:middle line:84%
in this mix, this
cocktail, right?

00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And so he did give me some
good information here.

00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:56.100 align:middle line:84%
So before I go on that,
I wanted to ask you

00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:58.440 align:middle line:84%
about anything you're
aware of that's

00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:01.834 align:middle line:84%
commonly useful in this way,
to leach it from the body

00:51:01.834 --> 00:51:03.000 align:middle line:90%
or chelate it from the body.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Absolutely.

00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And an organic diet
is something I highly

00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:10.420 align:middle line:84%
recommend-- keeping ourselves
and our immune system

00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:11.730 align:middle line:90%
functioning well.

00:51:11.730 --> 00:51:14.580 align:middle line:84%
A couple of things that we
can do is alkalize the body.

00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:17.960 align:middle line:84%
Eat foods, greens, things that
will keep our body alkalined.

00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Disease has a very
challenging time living

00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:23.160 align:middle line:90%
in an alkaline environment.

00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:26.700 align:middle line:84%
Once our body turns acidic, then
that's when disease comes in.

00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:29.720 align:middle line:84%
But there are a bunch of
things that we can do.

00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:34.290 align:middle line:84%
Chlorella is a popular
green that many people eat.

00:51:34.290 --> 00:51:39.000 align:middle line:84%
Zeolites are very effective
in removing heavy metals.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about
some of the clays?

00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:41.620 align:middle line:90%
Have you heard about that?

00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:43.690 align:middle line:84%
Any of the-- like bentonite
or anything like that?

00:51:43.690 --> 00:51:46.023 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Bentonite is something
that I use on occasion,

00:51:46.023 --> 00:51:46.640 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:48.684 align:middle line:84%
And that does remove
some minerals.

00:51:48.684 --> 00:51:50.100 align:middle line:84%
Along with the
aluminums, you want

00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:55.020 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that you're getting
an uptake of minerals, as well.

00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:57.580 align:middle line:84%
But Bentonite,
zeolites, other things,

00:51:57.580 --> 00:52:00.010 align:middle line:84%
are very effective at
removing the heavy metals.

00:52:00.010 --> 00:52:01.980 align:middle line:84%
So there are things
that we can do.

00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And my belief is that us as
activists, those of us who

00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:06.950 align:middle line:84%
are addressing this, who
are on the front lines,

00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:07.866 align:middle line:90%
we need to be healthy.

00:52:07.866 --> 00:52:10.350 align:middle line:84%
We need to be vibrant
when addressing this.

00:52:10.350 --> 00:52:12.160 align:middle line:90%
And when we do, we see miracles.

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:14.115 align:middle line:84%
We have the energy
to move forward.

00:52:14.115 --> 00:52:14.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And I don't see any point
in frightening people

00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:19.930 align:middle line:84%
with this information--
it's so vast,

00:52:19.930 --> 00:52:23.130 align:middle line:84%
it does tend to make people feel
rather helpless- without giving

00:52:23.130 --> 00:52:25.170 align:middle line:84%
some really good
follow up information.

00:52:25.170 --> 00:52:26.880 align:middle line:90%
You're not a sitting duck.

00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:28.620 align:middle line:90%
You can do something about this.

00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:31.520 align:middle line:84%
One thing you were mentioning
is the organic diet,

00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:34.210 align:middle line:84%
which for many reasons,
I agree with that.

00:52:34.210 --> 00:52:35.810 align:middle line:84%
But what if these
very same crops

00:52:35.810 --> 00:52:37.920 align:middle line:84%
are having the same
stuff dumped on them,

00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:39.172 align:middle line:90%
which they are in most cases?

00:52:39.172 --> 00:52:40.380 align:middle line:90%
Most of them are not covered.

00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:42.600 align:middle line:84%
Most of them don't come from
hot houses, greenhouses,

00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:43.320 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:44.320 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: This is true.

00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:46.260 align:middle line:84%
Everything, literally,
is being affected.

00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:49.510 align:middle line:84%
We found these
metals in tests that

00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:51.050 align:middle line:90%
have come from every region.

00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Have they
had produce tests done?

00:52:53.010 --> 00:52:55.990 align:middle line:84%
In Hawaii, for example, did they
have any of their leafy greens

00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:58.966 align:middle line:84%
or any of their vegetables
tested for this content?

00:52:58.966 --> 00:53:00.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: Not that
I'm aware of, but we

00:53:00.590 --> 00:53:01.904 align:middle line:90%
do know it's in the rain.

00:53:01.904 --> 00:53:03.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, yeah,
so it's got to be.

00:53:03.570 --> 00:53:04.903 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: And it is falling out.

00:53:04.903 --> 00:53:08.820 align:middle line:84%
So a number of people have
done surface tests on leaves

00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:13.240 align:middle line:84%
and also on other things, and
again, finding this footprint.

00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:14.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:53:14.010 --> 00:53:16.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, I wanted to share
with you-- thank you

00:53:16.610 --> 00:53:19.140 align:middle line:90%
for those suggestions.

00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:21.630 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are also what
Dan Dunphy had to say.

00:53:21.630 --> 00:53:25.740 align:middle line:84%
But he was also saying that you
want to keep the liver healthy.

00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:28.130 align:middle line:84%
The methylation cycles in
the body are super healthy.

00:53:28.130 --> 00:53:30.380 align:middle line:84%
He was saying it's
good to increase

00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:33.910 align:middle line:84%
levels of B6, B12,
and folic acid.

00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:34.610 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:53:34.610 --> 00:53:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's primarily
to keep our livers

00:53:37.290 --> 00:53:39.870 align:middle line:90%
functioning in a healthy way.

00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:42.760 align:middle line:84%
Another one is-- well,
he did say the chlorella.

00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I
thought was interesting

00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:48.380 align:middle line:84%
is he said that if you-- a
little trick, he called it.

00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:52.910 align:middle line:84%
If you take 50
milligrams of niacin

00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:56.660 align:middle line:84%
prior to going into a dry
sauna-- it can be far infrared

00:53:56.660 --> 00:54:00.130 align:middle line:84%
or a standard
conventional dry sauna--

00:54:00.130 --> 00:54:04.070 align:middle line:84%
the niacin flushes
open the pores, right?

00:54:04.070 --> 00:54:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And so you can start
sweating out the toxins.

00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:08.910 align:middle line:84%
He said saunas are a
great way to do it,

00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:09.960 align:middle line:90%
sweating out the toxins.

00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And also, ozone
therapy, if you can

00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:14.240 align:middle line:84%
happen to find an
ozone chamber, you'll

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:16.110 align:middle line:84%
see at the end of
an ozone bath, where

00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:19.410 align:middle line:84%
you have black at
the bottom of the tub

00:54:19.410 --> 00:54:21.510 align:middle line:84%
if you haven't done
one in a while.

00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:23.390 align:middle line:90%
So that's also very helpful.

00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And then one other thing
I was aware of when

00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:29.220 align:middle line:84%
I did some more
research was MSM.

00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And MSM softens the lining
of the cell, the cell wall.

00:54:33.830 --> 00:54:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And as it softens it,
it allows the cells

00:54:36.550 --> 00:54:39.410 align:middle line:90%
to sweat out any kind of toxins.

00:54:39.410 --> 00:54:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And this is being used by some
very avant garde researchers

00:54:42.450 --> 00:54:44.460 align:middle line:84%
in cancer therapies
right now, too.

00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:45.610 align:middle line:90%
So it makes total sense.

00:54:45.610 --> 00:54:47.420 align:middle line:84%
If it's dumping heavy
metals and toxins,

00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:49.480 align:middle line:84%
it's got to be dumping
the aluminum, too, right?

00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:49.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: Absolutely.

00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:50.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:52.551 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: That stuff's
cheap-- super cheap.

00:54:52.551 --> 00:54:55.360 align:middle line:84%
But you want to get a really
high quality one of the MSM.

00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:57.350 align:middle line:84%
So those are the
things I know about.

00:54:57.350 --> 00:54:58.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, we only have
a few minutes left.

00:54:58.930 --> 00:55:01.130 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to give a
little bit of a tease

00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:03.654 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what we're
going to be seeing coming up

00:55:03.654 --> 00:55:06.070 align:middle line:84%
in the next segment, on Why
In the World They're Spraying?

00:55:06.070 --> 00:55:08.455 align:middle line:84%
and then also part three, Who
In the the World Is Spraying?

00:55:08.455 --> 00:55:09.415 align:middle line:84%
We've only got two
or three minutes.

00:55:09.415 --> 00:55:09.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MURPHY: OK.

00:55:09.770 --> 00:55:11.340 align:middle line:10%
Well, it was
interesting, because we

00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:14.080 align:middle line:10%
started noticing
patterns of the aerosols.

00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:16.530 align:middle line:10%
And a couple of days
before storms, we

00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:18.800 align:middle line:10%
started noticing
the heavy aerosols.

00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:21.160 align:middle line:10%
Those are the days when
people have the symptoms

00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:23.380 align:middle line:10%
and our sun is
completely blocked out.

00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:25.540 align:middle line:10%
And then again,
within a day or two,

00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:27.130 align:middle line:10%
these massive storms
would come in.

00:55:27.130 --> 00:55:29.640 align:middle line:84%
So we started contacting
meteorologists,

00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:31.070 align:middle line:84%
people who worked
in the military.

00:55:31.070 --> 00:55:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And we found out that
while aluminum, yes, it's

00:55:33.830 --> 00:55:37.440 align:middle line:84%
highly reflective and it
can be used to reflect sun,

00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:39.960 align:middle line:84%
it's also a very effective
conductor in our sky.

00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:42.410 align:middle line:84%
So what they're doing,
part of the things,

00:55:42.410 --> 00:55:46.347 align:middle line:84%
they're creating a blanket
of aluminum in our sky.

00:55:46.347 --> 00:55:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And they have the ability,
through the HARP system

00:55:48.430 --> 00:55:50.400 align:middle line:84%
or microwave
technology, literally

00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:52.080 align:middle line:90%
to heat up that metal.

00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And in doing so, they can
actually create a lift

00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:57.730 align:middle line:84%
in our atmosphere, which
creates a low pressure vacuum

00:55:57.730 --> 00:56:00.290 align:middle line:84%
and enables certain
corporations to steer storms

00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:03.120 align:middle line:84%
into certain regions or
out of certain regions.

00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:05.400 align:middle line:84%
So we found a
definite connection,

00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:09.030 align:middle line:84%
even by the geoengineers
talking about how particulates

00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:11.840 align:middle line:84%
from their programs would
alter our weather program.

00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:14.180 align:middle line:84%
But I went to an aerosol
research conference

00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:16.030 align:middle line:84%
and I spoke with a
number of scientists

00:56:16.030 --> 00:56:18.590 align:middle line:84%
who stated, yes,
geoengineering could

00:56:18.590 --> 00:56:20.880 align:middle line:84%
be used to not only
control our weather,

00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:23.350 align:middle line:84%
but to completely
corporatize our weather.

00:56:23.350 --> 00:56:25.330 align:middle line:84%
Of course, if you
control the weather,

00:56:25.330 --> 00:56:26.610 align:middle line:90%
you control the planet.

00:56:26.610 --> 00:56:29.040 align:middle line:84%
You can control every food
supply, every political system.

00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:32.740 align:middle line:84%
So we looked into that and the
number of different industries

00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:34.980 align:middle line:90%
that actually profit from that.

00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:36.297 align:middle line:90%
So we have worked on that.

00:56:36.297 --> 00:56:37.755 align:middle line:84%
Why In the World
Are They Spraying?

00:56:37.755 --> 00:56:39.770 align:middle line:90%
is an award-winning film.

00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:42.940 align:middle line:84%
It's now been referenced
around the world.

00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:45.336 align:middle line:84%
But now, the question
remains who is spraying?

00:56:45.336 --> 00:56:47.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, you're getting
into really tricky and very

00:56:47.710 --> 00:56:48.740 align:middle line:90%
dangerous territory.

00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:50.198 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: It's
dangerous territory,

00:56:50.198 --> 00:56:51.590 align:middle line:90%
but it needs to be addressed.

00:56:51.590 --> 00:56:53.120 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking
into specifically

00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:55.240 align:middle line:84%
what corporations
and individuals

00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:57.300 align:middle line:84%
are responsible
for these programs.

00:56:57.300 --> 00:56:59.380 align:middle line:84%
We feel once we get
that information out,

00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:01.500 align:middle line:84%
we can get a step
closer to getting

00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:05.247 align:middle line:84%
these damaging programs stopped
and our fragile earth restored.

00:57:05.247 --> 00:57:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And give the
people the power back

00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:08.680 align:middle line:84%
to decide who we're going
to do business with,

00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:10.971 align:middle line:84%
because we're talking about
some mega corporations that

00:57:10.971 --> 00:57:12.042 align:middle line:90%
are involved, right?

00:57:12.042 --> 00:57:13.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MURPHY: I think
that's one of the keys.

00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:14.375 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:57:14.375 --> 00:57:15.120 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:16.019 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:57:16.019 --> 00:57:18.310 align:middle line:84%
You deserve all the awards
you've gotten for your film.

00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And we're going
to continue this.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.570 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
this conversation well

00:57:22.570 --> 00:57:25.222 align:middle line:84%
into another hour, talking
about why in the world

00:57:25.222 --> 00:57:25.930 align:middle line:90%
they're spraying.

00:57:25.930 --> 00:57:28.760 align:middle line:84%
This is his newest documentary
on the subject of chemtrails.

00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And it will look at the ways
in which climate change is

00:57:31.850 --> 00:57:33.640 align:middle line:90%
being manipulated for the worst.

00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:36.730 align:middle line:84%
Who stands to gain from
failed crops-- big hint,

00:57:36.730 --> 00:57:39.240 align:middle line:84%
Monsanto is one-- how
weather derivatives

00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:40.980 align:middle line:90%
are big business, and much more.

00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:44.020 align:middle line:84%
In the end, as Michael said,
he who controls the weather

00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:45.590 align:middle line:90%
controls the planet.

00:57:45.590 --> 00:57:49.610 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.

00:57:49.610 --> 00:57:57.934 align:middle line:90%
