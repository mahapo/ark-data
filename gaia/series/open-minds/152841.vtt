00:00:28.824 --> 00:00:31.240 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: From the
time most of us can remember,

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.580 align:middle line:10%
we've brought back dreams
from the other side,

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.400 align:middle line:10%
making dreams a source
of great curiosity.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.170 align:middle line:84%
David Jay Brown is
with us today to have

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.930 align:middle line:84%
a conversation about
lucid dreaming, substances

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.760 align:middle line:84%
that can enhance
that experience,

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.220 align:middle line:84%
and what dream research
is showing us now--

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.390 align:middle line:90%
a lot of interesting things.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.681 align:middle line:90%
I've read a lot of dream books.

00:00:47.681 --> 00:00:49.940 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed people
on dreams before.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.900 align:middle line:84%
However, you went the
extra mile on the research,

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.300 align:middle line:84%
because it brought up some
nuggets that I have not seen.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.900 align:middle line:84%
So I'll be happy for you to
share them with our viewing

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.000 align:middle line:90%
audience as we go on here.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.170 align:middle line:84%
But first of all, one
thing that struck me

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.319 align:middle line:84%
is that you have worked in
relationship with Rupert

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:06.940 align:middle line:90%
Sheldrake, who I just love.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.520 align:middle line:84%
We've both been
there to his home

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.750 align:middle line:84%
in Hampton Heath in
England, and he's

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.440 align:middle line:84%
such a brilliant mind while
at the same time being

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.450 align:middle line:90%
out of the box.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And he's also almost completely
rejected by British society,

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.850 align:middle line:84%
just like Prince Charles, and
they relate to each other.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.300 align:middle line:84%
He shares his research with the
prince, which is interesting.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.460 align:middle line:84%
And yet, these two
brilliant minds--

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.560 align:middle line:84%
on the subject of
environment, economy, and so

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.139 align:middle line:90%
forth-- are totally shunned.

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:35.680 align:middle line:84%
What is it you're
doing, what are you

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.800 align:middle line:84%
bringing to the picture
in that little matrix?

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.300 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID JAY BROWN: Oh, well,
I worked with Rupert for three

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.720 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.030 align:middle line:10%
It was really an honor.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.655 align:middle line:10%
I don't think I have
to tell you as you

00:01:43.655 --> 00:01:45.460 align:middle line:10%
know what an amazing man he is.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.580 align:middle line:10%
I was involved in the
research for two of his books.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.260 align:middle line:10%
I did all the
California-based research

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.000 align:middle line:10%
for his book "Dogs
That Know When

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.790 align:middle line:10%
Their Owners are Coming Home,"
and "The Sense of Being Stared

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:55.840 align:middle line:10%
At."

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.800 align:middle line:84%
So I was involved in looking
at some of the animals' ability

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.070 align:middle line:84%
to sense things that
conventional science has

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.440 align:middle line:90%
great difficulty explaining--

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.350 align:middle line:84%
psychic powers in both
animals, as well as in people.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.110 align:middle line:90%
And he was a mentor of mine.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.900 align:middle line:84%
I stayed with him at
his apartment in London

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.080 align:middle line:84%
for a while, and it was one
of the most powerful learning

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.390 align:middle line:90%
experiences of my life.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.190 align:middle line:90%
And, yeah--

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.310 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, he's--

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.700 align:middle line:84%
how did you find
him as a being to be

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.900 align:middle line:90%
around that amount of time?

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.840 align:middle line:84%
Because he's so lost
in thought, and he

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.870 align:middle line:84%
has a very grounded wife
who really keeps him

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.420 align:middle line:90%
fed and so forth.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.390 align:middle line:84%
How did you find the
way his mind works--

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.264 align:middle line:90%
just moment in, moment out?

00:02:39.264 --> 00:02:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Oh, just
absolutely brilliant.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.370 align:middle line:90%
I mean, absolutely brilliant.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.480 align:middle line:90%
He has an amazing--

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.360 align:middle line:84%
first of all, an encyclopedic
mind and the ability

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.790 align:middle line:84%
to synthesize from
many different areas

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.970 align:middle line:84%
and just bring together elements
from so many different--

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.220 align:middle line:84%
spirituality and
science together,

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.660 align:middle line:84%
he's able to integrate in a
really remarkable and unique

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.460 align:middle line:90%
way.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And his whole theory of
morphogenetic field and morphic

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.490 align:middle line:84%
fields is absolutely brilliant
and explains so many things

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.870 align:middle line:84%
that conventional science
has difficulty explaining.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.828 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And doesn't
that start crossing over

00:03:07.828 --> 00:03:08.940 align:middle line:90%
into your area, as well?

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:09.940 align:middle line:90%
>> BROWN: Into my area--

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:10.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Into dreams?

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.626 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Into the
area of dreams?

00:03:11.626 --> 00:03:14.582 align:middle line:84%
I spoke to Rupert quite a
bit, actually, about dreams.

00:03:14.582 --> 00:03:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And he believes that
there are morphic fields--

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I do, too.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.470 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: --for the dreams, and
that there are some dreams that

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.810 align:middle line:84%
are more personal, some
are more universal,

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.520 align:middle line:84%
and some are more
mystically-oriented.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And people have
experiences of these

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.120 align:middle line:84%
that reverberate, or
resonates, between one another.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.774 align:middle line:84%
And the people who
have had them tend

00:03:32.774 --> 00:03:34.690 align:middle line:84%
to have more experiences
with other people who

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:35.815 align:middle line:90%
have had those experiences.

00:03:35.815 --> 00:03:37.340 align:middle line:84%
As They connect
in different ways.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So the morphic
field is in operation whether

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.240 align:middle line:90%
you're awake or asleep.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.450 align:middle line:84%
You're just in another
phased-off dimension anyway.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Yeah, it
sure seems that way.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.376 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
I would think so.

00:03:45.376 --> 00:03:47.115 align:middle line:84%
I think I said
Hampstead Heath, right?

00:03:47.115 --> 00:03:48.990 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Yeah, that
was where it was, right.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.990 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It just
occurred to me.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.590 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for
that, and let's get

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.570 align:middle line:84%
into the notion of--
you've written a book,

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.760 align:middle line:84%
and it has both the
subject of dreaming

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.280 align:middle line:84%
and the use of various
substances and herbs,

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.040 align:middle line:84%
hallucinogens in
the dream state--

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.870 align:middle line:90%
or to enhance a dream state.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.462 align:middle line:84%
How did that end up
coming together for you?

00:04:07.462 --> 00:04:09.670 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Yeah, I've been
interested in the interface

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.790 align:middle line:84%
between shamanic healing,
psychedelic plants,

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.690 align:middle line:84%
and lucid dreaming since I've
been 16 when I had my first

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.769 align:middle line:90%
psychedelic experience.

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.779 align:middle line:84%
And within one or two
days after that, just

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:21.820 align:middle line:84%
spontaneously,
had a lucid dream.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.850 align:middle line:84%
That's how I first got
interested in the phenomena.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.520 align:middle line:84%
Over the years, I've
learned that many people

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.500 align:middle line:84%
who have had ayahuasca
experiences down in the Amazon,

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.000 align:middle line:84%
or who have experienced
iboga, the African root,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.470 align:middle line:84%
within one or two
days after that,

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.500 align:middle line:84%
will spontaneously
have a lucid dream.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.400 align:middle line:84%
Another interesting similarity
is that the brain states--

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.570 align:middle line:90%
the brain activity--

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.690 align:middle line:84%
is actually very similar in a
lucid dream state, in a dream

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.440 align:middle line:84%
state, and in a psychedelic
state with, say, psilocybin

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.655 align:middle line:90%
or with ayahuasca.

00:04:51.655 --> 00:04:54.860 align:middle line:84%
There's similar types
of brain activity.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.810 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting that people
refer to both phenomenas

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.610 align:middle line:90%
as waking up.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.180 align:middle line:84%
When people do a psychedelic
inside of a lucid dream--

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.470 align:middle line:84%
just a dream psychedelic-- it
will have a real experience.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.420 align:middle line:84%
People actually have a
visionary or mystical experience

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.160 align:middle line:84%
within the dream as a
result of doing that.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.600 align:middle line:84%
So there's really a number
of different connections.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.100 align:middle line:90%
It's used both in shamanism.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.920 align:middle line:84%
Shamanism utilizes
both certain plants--

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.340 align:middle line:84%
medicine plants like ayahuasca,
as well as lucid dreaming.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And most interestingly, in fact,
cultural anthropologists often

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.250 align:middle line:84%
have a hard time
distinguishing between reports

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.170 align:middle line:84%
from indigenous people--
whether they actually

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.360 align:middle line:84%
were talking about a
lucid dream experience

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.430 align:middle line:84%
or a visionary
experience with a plant.

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: So it's sometimes
very hard to even tell

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.220 align:middle line:90%
the difference.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.844 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of connections,
and I saw that nobody had ever

00:05:43.844 --> 00:05:45.430 align:middle line:90%
written about this before.

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.314 align:middle line:84%
So that was my inspiration for
putting together this book.

00:05:48.314 --> 00:05:49.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's well
done, well-written.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.354 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Thank
you so very much.

00:05:51.354 --> 00:05:54.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And let's get into
some more technical aspects

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.470 align:middle line:84%
of dreams that have been
broken down via EEG,

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.229 align:middle line:90%
work in laboratories, and such.

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:01.770 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Yeah,
well, let me explain.

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.436 align:middle line:84%
I think probably the
most exciting thing

00:06:03.436 --> 00:06:07.560 align:middle line:84%
to really explain is how lucid
dreaming became a science.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.350 align:middle line:84%
Sleep researchers had,
for the longest time,

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.950 align:middle line:84%
basically pooh-poohed the
whole idea of lucid dreaming.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.390 align:middle line:84%
It was basically occultists
and spiritual people that

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.780 align:middle line:84%
were talking about it, and
it wasn't really considered

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.170 align:middle line:84%
something that was a
real scientific reality.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:26.820 align:middle line:84%
It was through experiments using
EEG monitors and the ability

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.220 align:middle line:84%
to communicate from
within the dream state

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.440 align:middle line:84%
that people were able to
show that lucid dreaming was

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.040 align:middle line:90%
an actual reality.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.550 align:middle line:84%
So what they would do is they
would hook people up in sleep

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:39.750 align:middle line:84%
labs while they were sleeping to
EEG monitors so that they could

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.930 align:middle line:84%
demonstrate that the people
were actually in a sleep state--

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.790 align:middle line:84%
whether their
alpha, beta, theta,

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:46.560 align:middle line:90%
delta states had gone down--

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.810 align:middle line:84%
and that they were
genuinely dreaming.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And they would
then show that they

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.520 align:middle line:84%
were in what was called REM
sleep-- the rapid eye movement

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.000 align:middle line:84%
stage of sleep where people
are usually most actively

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.500 align:middle line:84%
dreaming-- although they can
dream in other phases of sleep,

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.460 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.690 align:middle line:84%
But what was remarkable
about this research that--

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.940 align:middle line:84%
Keith Hearne in England
did the first one,

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.680 align:middle line:84%
and the second one was done
by Stephen LaBerge, who

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.380 align:middle line:84%
is a physiologist at
Stanford University.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And what they
showed, remarkably,

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.240 align:middle line:84%
was that when people
were in the dream state,

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.790 align:middle line:84%
they were able to communicate
by moving their eyes.

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:20.790 align:middle line:84%
Your eyes are the
one part of your body

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:24.190 align:middle line:84%
that corresponds from your dream
eyes to your physical body.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.490 align:middle line:84%
So if you move your
eyes in the dream state,

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:27.780 align:middle line:90%
they will correspond.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.360 align:middle line:84%
So here we have the record
from the EEG monitor

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.419 align:middle line:84%
showing the person's
in sleep state,

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:34.710 align:middle line:84%
and then there are these
sweeping movements of the eyes

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.830 align:middle line:90%
right, left, right, left--

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:39.340 align:middle line:90%
going back and forth.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And this was a predetermined,
prearranged code,

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:43.050 align:middle line:90%
almost like a Morse code.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.075 align:middle line:84%
So this was really
definitive evidence--

00:07:45.075 --> 00:07:47.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But this was
conscious signaling from

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.840 align:middle line:84%
the lucid dream state
world to the lab techs?

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:50.640 align:middle line:90%
>> BROWN: Yes.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, that's what
I found really fascinating.

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:53.210 align:middle line:90%
>> BROWN: Yes, yes.

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And that was what demonstrated
that lucid dreaming was

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:58.830 align:middle line:84%
a reality, because they
showed that when people were

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:02.700 align:middle line:84%
in a dream state, they
were able to follow through

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.130 align:middle line:84%
with predetermined
instructions and carry them

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.480 align:middle line:84%
out the procedure, and then
consciously communicate

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.280 align:middle line:90%
from that state.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.495 align:middle line:84%
Because like I said, they
had just criticized this

00:08:10.495 --> 00:08:12.120 align:middle line:84%
and said they were
skeptical and didn't

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.530 align:middle line:90%
believe it was really true.

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's now been
replicated many times

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:17.930 align:middle line:90%
and many people have done it.

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing more and more
different types of research

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:23.510 align:middle line:84%
into locating the area of the
brain that's most responsible.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.860 align:middle line:84%
Some of the most interesting
neuroscience research

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:26.930 align:middle line:84%
that's going on
with lucid dreaming

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:29.550 align:middle line:84%
is they've actually discovered
what's going on in the brain.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:31.133 align:middle line:84%
And it's basically
the activation

00:08:31.133 --> 00:08:32.799 align:middle line:84%
of what's called the
prefrontal cortex--

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:34.380 align:middle line:84%
this area of the
brain right here--

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.900 align:middle line:84%
is normally inactivated
when people are asleep.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.129 align:middle line:84%
But in a lucid
dream, it becomes--

00:08:39.129 --> 00:08:39.929 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Engaged.

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:41.137 align:middle line:90%
>> BROWN: It becomes engaged.

00:08:41.137 --> 00:08:43.559 align:middle line:84%
And they've been able to,
with now transcranial brain

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:47.280 align:middle line:84%
stimulation, actually
activate that in people.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.880 align:middle line:84%
So on-demand, we can now
have people have lucid dreams

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.880 align:middle line:84%
while they're sleeping
just by activating there.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.190 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's going to
be interesting when little,

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:56.220 align:middle line:84%
pocket-sized devices are out
and people can just dial up

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.460 align:middle line:84%
a little activation in the
prefrontal cortex and go

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.074 align:middle line:84%
into lucid dreaming with
assistance of technology.

00:09:02.074 --> 00:09:04.240 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Yes, it's right
around the corner, really.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.614 align:middle line:84%
We have the
technology right now,

00:09:05.614 --> 00:09:08.750 align:middle line:84%
so it's just a matter of a
start up producing these devices

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:11.250 align:middle line:84%
and miniaturizing them
and lowering the price.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:14.220 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, it's like
Patrick Flanagan did with his

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:17.796 align:middle line:84%
little NEO device that
essentially creates

00:09:17.796 --> 00:09:19.920 align:middle line:84%
coordination between the
right and left hemispheres

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:20.720 align:middle line:90%
of the brain.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.880 align:middle line:84%
Amazing little device, but
pocket-sized, inexpensive.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.860 align:middle line:84%
You just put the
little electrodes on

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:28.116 align:middle line:84%
and your brain's
awake and functioning.

00:09:28.116 --> 00:09:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And I don't see
why that can't be

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:31.475 align:middle line:84%
done across all states
of consciousness.

00:09:31.475 --> 00:09:34.100 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: You'll be able to dial
and tune any reality you want,

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.220 align:middle line:90%
it looks like.

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's good, as
long as we're the programmers.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.860 align:middle line:90%
>> BROWN: Absolutely.

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So when
you're looking at REM,

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.630 align:middle line:84%
everybody knows that's basically
rapid eye movements when

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:46.170 align:middle line:90%
we're dreaming.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:47.378 align:middle line:90%
We're dreaming fast and hard.

00:09:47.378 --> 00:09:48.900 align:middle line:90%
Our eyes are moving.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.120 align:middle line:84%
But there are some
states of consciousness

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.150 align:middle line:84%
that seem to emerge more
prevalent than others.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is--
you say during REM,

00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:00.000 align:middle line:84%
a lot of times more
fearful situations

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.660 align:middle line:84%
start filtering in
through REM time.

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.987 align:middle line:84%
Does anyone understand
why, during that period?

00:10:05.987 --> 00:10:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: I don't think
anybody fully understands.

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:11.550 align:middle line:84%
There's different
theories as to why.

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.670 align:middle line:84%
People tend to have more
anxiety-related dreams

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:18.490 align:middle line:84%
than they do positive
dreams in general.

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:20.370 align:middle line:90%
Studies have shown that.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:23.130 align:middle line:84%
And in my own research
and talking to people,

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.740 align:middle line:84%
I find most people report
dreams where they're frustrated.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:26.540 align:middle line:90%
They're anxious.

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:27.480 align:middle line:90%
They're late for something.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.490 align:middle line:90%
Someone's chasing them.

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:31.290 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very common for
these things to happen,

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:33.990 align:middle line:84%
and especially during the rapid
eye movement phase of sleep

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:35.490 align:middle line:90%
that you're describing.

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:39.240 align:middle line:84%
One of the primary theories
that dream researchers have

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.110 align:middle line:84%
is that this serves an
evolutionary function.

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:45.030 align:middle line:84%
That in our past,
that having dreams--

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:47.370 align:middle line:84%
they would serve as a
model for the future.

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:48.430 align:middle line:90%
Things that we might do.

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And having some kind
of anticipation ability

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:55.459 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what your
reaction would be if a tiger

00:10:55.459 --> 00:10:57.000 align:middle line:84%
is going to jump on
you or something.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.590 align:middle line:84%
If you dream about
it beforehand,

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:02.340 align:middle line:84%
this may have had some type of
advantage for our ancestors.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.947 align:middle line:84%
And if so, that would
have propelled it forward.

00:11:04.947 --> 00:11:06.780 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the leading
theories as to why

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.000 align:middle line:90%
there's more anxiety in dreams.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.990 align:middle line:84%
It could also be that we just
have a very anxious world.

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, that
goes without saying, yes.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.990 align:middle line:84%
I used to have one of those
reoccurring dreams, which

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.390 align:middle line:90%
was as a news anchor--

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:24.120 align:middle line:90%
which is a stressful job, right?

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.430 align:middle line:90%
I'd show up and I'd get a call.

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:28.210 align:middle line:90%
The show was on in five minutes.

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:30.240 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have a chance
to brush my hair or teeth

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.024 align:middle line:90%
or put clothing on.

00:11:32.024 --> 00:11:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And the audio man
would come to mic me,

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.660 align:middle line:90%
but there was only skin.

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:39.270 align:middle line:90%
And it was the worst.

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:41.060 align:middle line:84%
It's been a while
since those, but--

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: But it's probably
pretty common for people

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:44.890 align:middle line:84%
to have those kind of
dreams, in your situation.

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:45.870 align:middle line:90%
It's probably very, very common.

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:47.203 align:middle line:90%
I mean, one of the most common--

00:11:47.203 --> 00:11:48.780 align:middle line:84%
people showing up
situations, not

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:50.409 align:middle line:90%
wearing clothes or something--

00:11:50.409 --> 00:11:52.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: When it's a public
situation and the camera's just

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:54.422 align:middle line:90%
about to go on.

00:11:54.422 --> 00:11:56.880 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: That's why it's so
wonderful to have lucid dreams

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.255 align:middle line:84%
where you can take control of
the dream and actually have

00:11:59.255 --> 00:12:00.375 align:middle line:90%
a little more fun with it.

00:12:00.375 --> 00:12:04.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, well, it ended
up kind of fun in the end.

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:06.000 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, then
there's something

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.130 align:middle line:84%
I've not heard of before called
NREM, which tends to bring

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:12.600 align:middle line:90%
on a different kind of state.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.700 align:middle line:84%
Talk about what that means
and what kind of state

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:15.360 align:middle line:90%
it brings on.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.318 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Yes, you can
divide sleep, basically,

00:12:17.318 --> 00:12:20.700 align:middle line:84%
into the REM state-- rapid
eye movement-- or the non-REM.

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.530 align:middle line:10%
There's three phases
of non-REM, but you

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:24.600 align:middle line:10%
can put them all together
in REM versus non-REM,

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.400 align:middle line:10%
because REM state is a
very active stage of sleep,

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.280 align:middle line:10%
whereas non-REM
sleep is basically

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.590 align:middle line:10%
pretty passive by comparison.

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And it was thought
that people only

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:35.730 align:middle line:90%
dream in REM sleep for a while.

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And more recently, they've
discovered that even

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.700 align:middle line:84%
in non-REM states, that
people dream as well.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.760 align:middle line:84%
Not only do they dream as well,
but they also can lucid dream.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:45.000 align:middle line:90%
And that's--

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, and you
can have total recall.

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:47.790 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: And you can
have total recall.

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:49.330 align:middle line:84%
And the dreams tend
to be different.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.450 align:middle line:84%
They tend to be less
action-oriented.

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:53.370 align:middle line:84%
The person tends to be
more of an observer,

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:54.810 align:middle line:90%
watching something.

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:57.540 align:middle line:84%
They're usually not
as anxiety-driven,

00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:59.070 align:middle line:90%
as you mentioned.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.780 align:middle line:84%
So there's definitely a
difference between these two.

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:04.489 align:middle line:84%
But I think people tend to
remember their REM dreams more.

00:13:04.489 --> 00:13:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Those are the ones that
usually we have in the morning,

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:08.860 align:middle line:84%
and they're ones people
remember the most.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, most
of mine are the other.

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:12.030 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: You mostly
remember mostly the non-REMS,

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:12.970 align:middle line:90%
the non-REM dreams.

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:13.770 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:14.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:16.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm oftentimes an
observer and just

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:20.010 align:middle line:90%
moving with people or so forth.

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:22.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, the vast majority.

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: That's fascinating,
because yeah, that's unusual.

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:25.550 align:middle line:90%
That's fascinating.

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:26.562 align:middle line:90%
You're unusual.

00:13:26.562 --> 00:13:28.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So a lot of this
book is based on your own

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:29.640 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.330 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
your own dream time.

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:35.670 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a lot of the
classic anxiety going on,

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:37.500 align:middle line:90%
or are they more adventurous?

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.590 align:middle line:84%
You share a lot of your
dreams in the book.

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:41.309 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Yeah, since
I've been a child,

00:13:41.309 --> 00:13:42.600 align:middle line:90%
I remember my dreams very well.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.815 align:middle line:90%
I have a lot of dreams that--

00:13:43.815 --> 00:13:45.750 align:middle line:90%
good dream recall.

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:48.570 align:middle line:84%
I think my dreams tend to
be more of the REM dreams

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:49.800 align:middle line:90%
that I recall in the morning.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.380 align:middle line:84%
I've never actually measured
the brain wave cycle,

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:54.210 align:middle line:90%
so I don't know for sure.

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:56.610 align:middle line:84%
But from what I
understand, they seem

00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:58.320 align:middle line:90%
to be more of the REM type.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.950 align:middle line:84%
I have lucid dreams maybe
about once a month or so.

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:02.750 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:04.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Do you instruct
yourself to have them,

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:05.850 align:middle line:90%
or do they happen randomly?

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: I practice a
number of techniques to try.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.440 align:middle line:84%
You have to keep
practicing them.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Lucid dreaming is
like riding a bicycle.

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:16.480 align:middle line:84%
It's not like riding a bicycle
where you just keep doing it.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.424 align:middle line:84%
It's more like doing
something fitness.

00:14:18.424 --> 00:14:20.340 align:middle line:84%
If you stop doing it,
you won't do it as well.

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:22.980 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you can just pick
it up and start doing it again.

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:25.800 align:middle line:84%
If you stop practicing the
techniques, what you'll find

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.480 align:middle line:84%
is that you'll
actually start having

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.884 align:middle line:90%
less and less lucid dreams.

00:14:29.884 --> 00:14:31.800 align:middle line:84%
So I practice the
techniques pretty regularly.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.020 align:middle line:84%
I have a lucid dream
about once a month.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:37.384 align:middle line:84%
My dreams tend to be
pretty anxiety-driven a lot

00:14:37.384 --> 00:14:38.300 align:middle line:90%
of the time, actually.

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which you
say is-- that's normal.

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:40.480 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Which is
pretty normal, yeah.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We generally
do, as human beings.

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:43.680 align:middle line:90%
>> BROWN: Yeah.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.912 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What about--

00:14:45.912 --> 00:14:48.120 align:middle line:84%
in lab settings I've been
in-- and I've been in a few

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.900 align:middle line:84%
different situations with
technology and EEGs and such--

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:55.890 align:middle line:84%
it shows really interesting
patterns in the brain,

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:59.070 align:middle line:84%
like waking delta,
which is fascinating.

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:02.760 align:middle line:84%
Those people are usually the
great geniuses on the planet,

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.430 align:middle line:84%
where information-- while they
are alert and awake during

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:06.430 align:middle line:90%
the day--

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:09.120 align:middle line:84%
deep, connected
information and revelations

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.320 align:middle line:90%
are flowing through them.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And I remember being this one
lab setting with this guy who

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:16.110 align:middle line:84%
was a gajillionaire
because he'd figured out

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:19.380 align:middle line:84%
an algorithm for this
particular process

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:22.860 align:middle line:84%
I can't mention that
people love doing.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:29.047 align:middle line:84%
And everything came through him
just in this quiet little place

00:15:29.047 --> 00:15:30.880 align:middle line:84%
while he's awake, not
while he was sleeping.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:31.910 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Yeah,
that's fascinating.

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:33.200 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Waking delta.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.997 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: I mean, I know people
who can meditate into delta,

00:15:35.997 --> 00:15:38.330 align:middle line:84%
so they can go into those
very deep states that normally

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.204 align:middle line:84%
people only experience
when they're sleeping.

00:15:40.204 --> 00:15:42.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Exactly, and that's
fascinating because a lot

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:45.650 align:middle line:84%
of revelations seem to be coming
through to humanity through

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:46.550 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:49.179 align:middle line:84%
They're able to determine
things and in the EEGs

00:15:49.179 --> 00:15:50.220 align:middle line:90%
they call angel patterns.

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:52.490 align:middle line:84%
So they can tell who's
intuitive and open to seeing

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:54.830 align:middle line:84%
from other realms and that
kind of thing, which--

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:55.910 align:middle line:90%
>> BROWN: Fascinating.

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:57.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's James Hardt.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.300 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if anyone wants
to see that interview I

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:02.180 align:middle line:84%
did with Dr. James Hardt, it's
a really fascinating interview

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.474 align:middle line:90%
on that degree.

00:16:04.474 --> 00:16:06.140 align:middle line:84%
It's grueling to go
through, by the way,

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:09.140 align:middle line:90%
grueling but fascinating.

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:11.030 align:middle line:10%
And so one of the
things that you

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:14.450 align:middle line:10%
talked about a little bit ago is
the general anxiety in society.

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:17.390 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
industrialization at large

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:21.320 align:middle line:84%
and what that has done to not
just dream time, but sleep

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.845 align:middle line:84%
patterns and the
brain in general.

00:16:22.845 --> 00:16:25.220 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Yes, well, thanks
to the Industrial Revolution,

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:27.080 align:middle line:90%
we have artificial lighting.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.912 align:middle line:84%
And artificial lighting
has changed sleep patterns.

00:16:29.912 --> 00:16:31.370 align:middle line:84%
There's interesting
evidence that I

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:34.320 align:middle line:84%
wasn't familiar with until I
did the research for this book

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.850 align:middle line:84%
that prior to the
industrial age,

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:39.291 align:middle line:90%
people had two periods of sleep.

00:16:39.291 --> 00:16:41.290 align:middle line:84%
They would call it first
period, or first sleep,

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:42.610 align:middle line:90%
and a second sleep.

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:44.480 align:middle line:84%
Where they would sleep
for about six hours

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:48.300 align:middle line:84%
or so, wake up around midnight,
be awake for about two hours,

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.840 align:middle line:84%
and then go back to sleep for
like another four hours or so.

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And this was a very,
very common sleep pattern

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:55.910 align:middle line:90%
that apparently we've lost.

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:57.647 align:middle line:84%
There's been
scientific studies that

00:16:57.647 --> 00:17:00.230 align:middle line:84%
show when people are put into
an environment where they're not

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:03.770 align:middle line:84%
exposed to any other
artificial light besides a very

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:07.310 align:middle line:84%
controlled setting for just a
certain number of hours a day,

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:09.710 align:middle line:84%
that they will fall into
a similar type of pattern

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:11.960 align:middle line:84%
where they sleep
for about six hours,

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.930 align:middle line:84%
wake up for about two
hours, and then go back

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:16.550 align:middle line:90%
to sleep for another two hours.

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And what we've lost as a result
of not having those two periods

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:23.020 align:middle line:84%
of sleep anymore is
that in-between period--

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:24.770 align:middle line:84%
that period between
first and second

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:28.220 align:middle line:84%
sleep when people were
not quite fully awake, not

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:29.330 align:middle line:90%
quite fully asleep.

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:31.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, something
similar to hypnogogia,

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:35.150 align:middle line:84%
but it's described as being a
trance-like, meditative state

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:37.430 align:middle line:84%
where people would talk
about their dreams,

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:41.090 align:middle line:84%
maybe walk around a little bit
or converse with their mate

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:42.480 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And during that period,
I think, it probably

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:47.870 align:middle line:84%
contributed to greater
periods of lucid dreaming,

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:49.880 align:middle line:84%
because we know from
lucid dreaming research

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.017 align:middle line:84%
that when people wake
up for a period of time

00:17:52.017 --> 00:17:54.350 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the night,
get their brain a little bit

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:55.889 align:middle line:84%
aroused and then
go back to sleep,

00:17:55.889 --> 00:17:58.430 align:middle line:84%
there's a greater chance they're
going to have a lucid dream.

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:00.320 align:middle line:84%
So I think that that's
one of the things that

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:01.550 align:middle line:90%
may have gotten lost.

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:02.440 align:middle line:90%
The other thing is--

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:05.180 align:middle line:84%
I spoke with Dr.
Rick Strassman, who's

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:08.150 align:middle line:84%
a researcher at the
University of Mexico.

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:10.760 align:middle line:84%
As you know, he did amazing,
fascinating research

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.310 align:middle line:90%
with dimethyltryptamine--

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:15.650 align:middle line:84%
DMT-- which is a
neurotransmitter

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:16.850 align:middle line:90%
found in the brain.

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:18.030 align:middle line:90%
It's also a psychedelic.

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:20.720 align:middle line:84%
It's also used in
the ayahuasca group.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And he says because all the
exposure to artificial light,

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:28.280 align:middle line:84%
we're producing less
melatonin in our brain.

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And he thinks as a result,
less DMT production

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:33.290 align:middle line:84%
in our brain, which then could
affect our dreaming, as well.

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:34.456 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That makes sense.

00:18:34.456 --> 00:18:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's totally
doable to cure that,

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:39.710 align:middle line:84%
but you have to
adjust the way you

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:42.740 align:middle line:84%
want to experience your
world, because I don't

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:44.720 align:middle line:90%
like artificial light at all.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:45.750 align:middle line:90%
I hate it.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And so in the daytime, I don't
have any lights on in the house

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:51.970 align:middle line:84%
ever, just windows
open so natural light

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:54.770 align:middle line:84%
comes in enough to do your
work, read-- read near a window.

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And then at night, only 20
watt-- a couple 20 or 30 watt

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:04.310 align:middle line:84%
bulbs, period, on in the
house mimicking candlelight.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And I do have that
pattern a lot of times.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.640 align:middle line:84%
First sleep, and then
wake up about 3:00 or 4:00

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.700 align:middle line:90%
in the morning.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll chat or
whatever and then fall back

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:15.770 align:middle line:90%
asleep for an hour or two.

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:18.740 align:middle line:84%
And you're right-- that's
when all those really

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.990 align:middle line:84%
robust, memorable
dreams come through,

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:22.460 align:middle line:90%
which is in the second sleep.

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:23.600 align:middle line:90%
>> BROWN: Right.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: But I agree with you.

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:30.050 align:middle line:84%
If you're watching television
till 10 or 11 o'clock at night,

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:32.390 align:middle line:84%
if you're working with
lights on in your house--

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:33.967 align:middle line:90%
even during the day--

00:19:33.967 --> 00:19:35.550 align:middle line:84%
that's really
disturbing to the brain.

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:37.070 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Well, you're
inhibiting melatonin production

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:37.370 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:37.845 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:19:37.845 --> 00:19:40.100 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: So yeah, it's throwing
everything out of balance.

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:41.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But we
can change that.

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.120 align:middle line:90%
It's up to us.

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.070 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
have bright lights

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.350 align:middle line:90%
on in the house at night.

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:44.150 align:middle line:90%
>> BROWN: Absolutely.

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:45.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Or even in the day.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.700 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted to toss that
in, because it's manageable.

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:49.820 align:middle line:84%
We can unplug from
the industrial notion

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:52.590 align:middle line:84%
of what lighting looks
like in our lives.

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:55.700 align:middle line:84%
The other thing you
talked about is the notion

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.680 align:middle line:84%
that men and women
dream differently.

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:01.679 align:middle line:84%
We tend to have a predominance
of different kinds of dreams.

00:20:01.679 --> 00:20:03.220 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
that for a second?

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:06.140 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: That men tend to dream
a little bit more aggressively,

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:08.570 align:middle line:84%
and women tend to dream more
about experiences with other

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:09.980 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.350 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if that's not
a reflection of the fact

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:15.710 align:middle line:84%
that men tend to be
more competitive, maybe,

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:18.960 align:middle line:84%
and women tend to
be more cooperative,

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.860 align:middle line:84%
and whether this is due to
some kind of societal influence

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:25.790 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's due to some
kind of genetic influence,

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:28.830 align:middle line:84%
because we see those
patterns in other animals--

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:31.410 align:middle line:84%
other species-- as well,
where the females tend

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:33.886 align:middle line:84%
to cooperate more and the
males tend to compete more.

00:20:33.886 --> 00:20:36.366 align:middle line:84%
So the dreams could be
reflecting something

00:20:36.366 --> 00:20:38.490 align:middle line:84%
to do with either one of
those two things, I think.

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:40.410 align:middle line:90%
But it is fascinating.

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:41.577 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very fascinating.

00:20:41.577 --> 00:20:43.868 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And another thing
we talked about off camera

00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:45.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm finding fascinating
is that so many men--

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:49.410 align:middle line:84%
just people that I talk to
in normal life about dreams--

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:50.290 align:middle line:90%
I live in Sedona.

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:53.100 align:middle line:84%
Dreams are a normal part
of conversation, right?

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:56.230 align:middle line:84%
But so many men,
now, are finding

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:59.820 align:middle line:84%
they're incapable of taking
a swing at another man,

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:04.020 align:middle line:84%
that the aggression slash
violent aspect of what

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:06.570 align:middle line:84%
used to happen doesn't
happen anymore.

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:09.040 align:middle line:90%
They are not able to do that.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And I just mentioned
that off camera,

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:14.160 align:middle line:84%
and I'd love to know your
thoughts on what's happening

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.999 align:middle line:90%
in the morphic field there.

00:21:15.999 --> 00:21:18.540 align:middle line:84%
Because these are men that don't
necessarily know each other.

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:19.230 align:middle line:90%
>> BROWN: Right.

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:20.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, I would love
to think that there's

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:23.790 align:middle line:84%
some kind of shift going
on in the universal mind

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:26.280 align:middle line:84%
where we're shifting away from
competition and aggression

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:29.470 align:middle line:84%
and moving more towards a more
peaceful, cooperative state

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:30.270 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:32.103 align:middle line:84%
We certainly desperately
need it with what's

00:21:32.103 --> 00:21:34.710 align:middle line:84%
going on right now
politically and ecologically.

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:39.330 align:middle line:84%
So I think that the male ego
is one of the things that's

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:41.910 align:middle line:84%
out of control on this
planet right now, causing

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:45.210 align:middle line:84%
tremendous destruction, and
the whole planet is threatened.

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:50.430 align:middle line:84%
So wouldn't that be wonderful
if this shift in our dreams--

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:53.230 align:middle line:84%
that men being less
aggressive-- is an indication

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:55.850 align:middle line:84%
that it's going to mirror
in the rest of society.

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:57.630 align:middle line:84%
That would be
absolutely-- so I'm going

00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:59.480 align:middle line:90%
to take that as an indication.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:02.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, I mean, I've
just noticed it casually over

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:04.710 align:middle line:90%
the last decade or so.

00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:06.690 align:middle line:90%
Now, granted, I live in Sedona.

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:09.150 align:middle line:84%
People tend to--
well, I wouldn't

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:11.320 align:middle line:84%
say it's an enlightened
society by any means.

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:16.440 align:middle line:84%
It's people who are aspiring
to that, more than anything.

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And yet, it's people
who are aspiring to it,

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:22.710 align:middle line:84%
who are finding more
cooperative and peaceful ways

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:26.310 align:middle line:84%
of living as a priority in
their lives-- men and women.

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And so most of the
people I've talked

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.740 align:middle line:84%
to that have had this experience
are at least in league

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:33.060 align:middle line:90%
with the notion that--

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:34.440 align:middle line:90%
what you just said.

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:37.920 align:middle line:84%
It's desirable to reduce
the amount of tension

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:38.820 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.640 align:middle line:90%
But still, this is dream time.

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And they literally are incapable
of taking a swing at someone

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:46.222 align:middle line:90%
when they're under fire.

00:22:46.222 --> 00:22:47.180 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that fascinating?

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:48.020 align:middle line:90%
>> BROWN: That is fascinating.

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:49.830 align:middle line:84%
I really hope that's
indicative that we're--

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:50.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I think it is.

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:51.900 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: I hope that we're
at the forefront of where

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:55.110 align:middle line:84%
the whole human species is in
the direction of moving right

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:56.495 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:22:56.495 --> 00:22:58.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It actually
gives me great hope.

00:22:58.290 --> 00:22:59.790 align:middle line:84%
That's the same way
I feel about it.

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:01.560 align:middle line:84%
There's something
happening there.

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:05.640 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, that's a
lovely little takeaway.

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:06.870 align:middle line:90%
Also feline deities.

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about your
dreams a bit, OK?

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:10.980 align:middle line:90%
OK, take it away.

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:13.990 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: OK, well, when I was
in Israel around 15 years ago,

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:16.070 align:middle line:90%
I had a fascinating dream--

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:18.630 align:middle line:84%
disturbing, deeply
powerful dream--

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:22.550 align:middle line:84%
where I was in some
sort of large temple.

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:26.100 align:middle line:84%
With a large group of people and
up in the stage of the temple

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:29.010 align:middle line:84%
was an altar of some
type, or a throne.

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And sitting on the altar was
what I recognized as a goddess.

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And everybody there was there
to worship this goddess.

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:39.270 align:middle line:84%
And the goddess had
the head of a wildcat.

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:43.540 align:middle line:84%
It was a cat head, a feline
head, and other animal parts

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:44.340 align:middle line:90%
to it.

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:46.560 align:middle line:84%
It was a hybrid
sort of creature.

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And it was sitting
up on the throne,

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:52.110 align:middle line:84%
and there was this tremendous
feeling of anxiety and fear

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:54.690 align:middle line:84%
that was rippling out
through the congregation.

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:58.200 align:middle line:84%
And everyone knew that it
was just a matter of time

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:02.190 align:middle line:84%
before one of us was going
to be sacrificed to this God.

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And out of the
eyes of this deity

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:10.920 align:middle line:84%
shot a laser beam that
struck one of the people

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:11.870 align:middle line:90%
in the audience.

00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:14.310 align:middle line:84%
They immediately fell
down dead, and there

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:16.467 align:middle line:84%
was a feeling of relief
throughout the whole room.

00:24:16.467 --> 00:24:17.925 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because
the person had--

00:24:17.925 --> 00:24:20.310 align:middle line:84%
it had happened already and
you were no longer in danger.

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: No one was in--
yeah, that was the sacrifice

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.180 align:middle line:90%
to the God, or something.

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:25.700 align:middle line:90%
And interestingly, the God--

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:28.950 align:middle line:84%
the deity, then,
turned to stone.

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:31.950 align:middle line:84%
Her eyes became empty, and she
suddenly looked very stone-like

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:37.380 align:middle line:84%
and didn't look like she was
a living entity any longer.

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:39.031 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What
was your take away?

00:24:39.031 --> 00:24:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: I woke up from the
dream sweating, and I was very,

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:42.030 align:middle line:90%
very anxious.

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't feel
like a personal dream.

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:45.900 align:middle line:10%
It felt like I was
tapping into something

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:49.710 align:middle line:10%
like what Carl Jung would call
the collective unconscious.

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:51.840 align:middle line:10%
It was some kind of
universal, big dream

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:53.190 align:middle line:10%
that I was tapping into.

00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:56.550 align:middle line:84%
But the most remarkable thing,
Regina, was a couple of years

00:24:56.550 --> 00:25:00.120 align:middle line:84%
later, I was looking through
a book on Egyptian mythology.

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.630 align:middle line:90%
And there I saw an image--

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:04.980 align:middle line:90%
a photograph-- of Bastet--

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:07.560 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptian deity
that was a replica

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:09.120 align:middle line:84%
of what I experienced
in the dream.

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And how she got into my dream
when I was in Israel, I--

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:14.580 align:middle line:84%
morphic field or
something like that.

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:16.288 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
other explanation there

00:25:16.288 --> 00:25:19.590 align:middle line:84%
is, because I had no
knowledge of that at the time.

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:23.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, and in general,
when you were studying ancient

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.870 align:middle line:90%
perspectives on dreaming--

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:28.170 align:middle line:90%
Greek and Egyptian, both--

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:30.360 align:middle line:84%
they believe that
they were interfacing

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:33.780 align:middle line:84%
with other beings and
higher intelligence forces

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:34.680 align:middle line:90%
during dream time.

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.580 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that a little bit,

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:39.120 align:middle line:84%
and maybe even some of your
own observations or experiences

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:43.500 align:middle line:84%
with what you felt was maybe
a more refined consciousness

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:44.962 align:middle line:90%
reaching into you.

00:25:44.962 --> 00:25:46.420 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Well,
one of the things--

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:48.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Not the scary
ones, the good ones.

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:50.120 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Well, one
of the things that--

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:52.320 align:middle line:84%
one of my favorite things
to do in lucid dreaming

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:55.520 align:middle line:84%
is to interact with
the dream characters--

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.290 align:middle line:84%
with the characters
themselves-- to actually start

00:25:58.290 --> 00:25:59.400 align:middle line:90%
talking to them.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.800 align:middle line:84%
And when you start talking
to them, I mean, some of them

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:05.520 align:middle line:84%
seem a little bit robotic
and not very bright.

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:10.590 align:middle line:84%
Others seem as
independently-minded as you

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:13.230 align:middle line:84%
and I seem, and it's very,
very compellingly real

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:15.270 align:middle line:84%
and it's very hard to
think that they're not

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:17.430 align:middle line:90%
an actual, living intelligence.

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And then you encounter
these other beings

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:21.090 align:middle line:84%
that seem to know a
whole lot more about you

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:22.080 align:middle line:90%
than you know yourself.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And I recall there
was the spiritual,

00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:25.500 align:middle line:90%
or the wise, masters.

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And you can encounter
this whole range

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:30.450 align:middle line:84%
of beings inside of a
lucid dream or inside

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:31.860 align:middle line:90%
of a shamanic experience.

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:33.040 align:middle line:90%
It's very similar.

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And what I found
even more powerful

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:38.130 align:middle line:84%
than talking to the
dream characters

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:40.530 align:middle line:90%
is to talk to the dream itself.

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:42.150 align:middle line:84%
To just simply ignore
the environment,

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:44.250 align:middle line:84%
to ignore the
characters, and to simply

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:46.800 align:middle line:84%
lift your head to the sky
and just ask a question

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:47.760 align:middle line:90%
to the dream.

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And surprisingly,
something responds.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:51.630 align:middle line:90%
The dream responds.

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And it will respond either by
speaking to you in English,

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.640 align:middle line:84%
or by changing the
scenery of the dream

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.620 align:middle line:90%
around in some kind of way.

00:26:58.620 --> 00:26:59.760 align:middle line:90%
But it does respond.

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.790 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it doesn't
respond in that dream.

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:04.850 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it'll respond
several dreams later.

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:06.480 align:middle line:90%
But it does respond to you.

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:08.121 align:middle line:90%
And who is it that's responding?

00:27:08.121 --> 00:27:09.120 align:middle line:90%
That's the big question.

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:11.340 align:middle line:90%
Is your unconscious mind?

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:14.430 align:middle line:84%
Is it one of these
daemons or one

00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:17.220 align:middle line:84%
of these other intelligences
that the Greeks believed

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:21.990 align:middle line:84%
that we were communicating
with, one of these spirits?

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:25.950 align:middle line:84%
I try, in my book,
not to adhere myself

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:27.916 align:middle line:84%
to any one particular
belief system,

00:27:27.916 --> 00:27:29.790 align:middle line:84%
but try to show the
different belief systems.

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:31.207 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Just
the possibilities.

00:27:31.207 --> 00:27:33.290 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Could be any
number one of those things.

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:35.250 align:middle line:84%
But whatever it is,
there is the ability

00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:37.750 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with these
beings or with this higher self,

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:39.495 align:middle line:90%
and it is very, very compelling.

00:27:39.495 --> 00:27:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And they will teach you
things about yourself

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:42.490 align:middle line:90%
that you don't already know.

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:44.156 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Absolutely
If I get messages,

00:27:44.156 --> 00:27:45.300 align:middle line:90%
there's a particular voice.

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And if I hear that voice
telling me something in a dream,

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:50.490 align:middle line:84%
then I better pay attention,
because it's always

00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:53.770 align:middle line:84%
a heads up that I really
needed at the time.

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And so that, to me,
is very sacred--

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.660 align:middle line:84%
those relationships that
we have in dream time.

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:04.280 align:middle line:84%
Especially when you have, again,
I think a trusted relationship

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:05.910 align:middle line:90%
that-- it's tried and true.

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:08.820 align:middle line:84%
Where you've seen the validity,
you've seen it bear out.

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:10.530 align:middle line:84%
You can develop a
lot of confidence

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:11.940 align:middle line:90%
once you realize that--

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:15.580 align:middle line:84%
ah, last time that happened,
this exactly happened.

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:16.380 align:middle line:90%
It did go that way.

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:18.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad I listened,
and so forth.

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:21.420 align:middle line:84%
So those are relationships to
develop trust between, just

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:23.290 align:middle line:90%
like on Earth, right?

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:24.630 align:middle line:90%
>> BROWN: Exactly.

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What about the
notion-- oh, I'm sorry.

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Did you have something
more on that?

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: I was
just going to say--

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:29.121 align:middle line:84%
that sort of trust that
builds up, I think,

00:28:29.121 --> 00:28:33.080 align:middle line:84%
is very important, because
people actually ask me about,

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.860 align:middle line:84%
when you encounter
one of these entities,

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:36.120 align:middle line:90%
how should you relate to them?

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And I always say,
just like you would

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:40.560 align:middle line:84%
relate to any other person
that you actually meet,

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:41.700 align:middle line:90%
any other stranger.

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:43.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, don't
immediately trust them.

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:45.319 align:middle line:90%
Be skeptical of what they say.

00:28:45.319 --> 00:28:46.860 align:middle line:84%
Don't assume that
everything they say

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:49.500 align:middle line:84%
is going to be
God-given advice to you.

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:53.340 align:middle line:84%
But be very open to it and
take it in and with time,

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:55.300 align:middle line:84%
when you see they're
right and they make sense,

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:56.970 align:middle line:84%
then you can build
up a sense of trust.

00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And that happens over
time with these entities.

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:00.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And we've got to look at
the other entities, as well.

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:08.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in dream time, as
with using other substances

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:12.120 align:middle line:84%
and hallucinogens, it
is every bit as likely

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:15.510 align:middle line:84%
a person will start
interfacing with lower realms.

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And lower realms
can be tricksters.

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:20.590 align:middle line:84%
Lot of tricky stuff
going on there.

00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:21.390 align:middle line:90%
>> BROWN: Right.

00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:23.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's talk about that
interface with darker realms,

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:24.370 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:26.703 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Well, that's why I
tell people to be skeptical

00:29:26.703 --> 00:29:29.220 align:middle line:84%
and to not always believe
everything you hear when

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:30.600 align:middle line:84%
you're encountering
these beings.

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.152 align:middle line:84%
I mean, who knows, really,
what their origin is

00:29:33.152 --> 00:29:35.610 align:middle line:84%
or what their intentions are
or whether they have your best

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:37.200 align:middle line:90%
intentions at heart?

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.560 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's very
important to always maintain

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:42.825 align:middle line:84%
a certain degree of
skepticism with these beings.

00:29:42.825 --> 00:29:44.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And the
discernment process, then,

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:46.124 align:middle line:90%
becomes critical.

00:29:46.124 --> 00:29:47.790 align:middle line:84%
Even when you're
sleeping, discernment--

00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:51.630 align:middle line:84%
if you're programming
your mind to become aware

00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:53.925 align:middle line:84%
and become discerning
even during dream time.

00:29:53.925 --> 00:29:56.910 align:middle line:84%
Which then, of course, leads to
a certain amount of lucidity.

00:29:56.910 --> 00:30:00.600 align:middle line:84%
But my observation
is really simple.

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:03.480 align:middle line:84%
If you have any
kind of being that's

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:07.380 align:middle line:84%
perpetuating fearful
circumstance of any kind

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:10.800 align:middle line:84%
or controlling or
demanding something of you

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:16.080 align:middle line:84%
or hierarchical, then I
will, without question,

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.930 align:middle line:84%
assume that this is
a lower realm that's

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:21.370 align:middle line:84%
trying to intrude upon
someone's consciousness.

00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:22.170 align:middle line:90%
Period.

00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:22.980 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: I think
that's a good gauge.

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:24.021 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Really simple.

00:30:24.021 --> 00:30:26.130 align:middle line:84%
If it's not
empowering, if it's not

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:28.920 align:middle line:84%
lifting you up, encouraging,
giving permission,

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:30.339 align:middle line:84%
you're dealing
with lower realms.

00:30:30.339 --> 00:30:32.130 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: I think, in
general, that's true.

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:33.990 align:middle line:10%
There is something to
be said for the fact

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:37.366 align:middle line:10%
that some of these people have
to confront traumas in order

00:30:37.366 --> 00:30:38.490 align:middle line:10%
to grow during the process.

00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:40.198 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And they
can show up that way,

00:30:40.198 --> 00:30:43.560 align:middle line:84%
to make you aware enough to know
that there is that issue there

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:46.290 align:middle line:90%
that must still be transformed.

00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:49.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think in that case,
that's where lower realms really

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:52.560 align:middle line:90%
serve their function well.

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And we tend to put everything
that's of a little bit darker,

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:59.380 align:middle line:84%
scarier, lower in--
and again, that's

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:00.630 align:middle line:90%
hierarchical even saying that.

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:03.300 align:middle line:84%
But darker, so to speak,
or more uncomfortable.

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:05.520 align:middle line:90%
We tend to demonize that.

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And they're called daemons,
as a matter of fact.

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:10.410 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is they're
showing up for a reason.

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:12.180 align:middle line:84%
There's something
unhealed, something

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:14.950 align:middle line:84%
that needs transforming, or
they wouldn't be showing up

00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:16.480 align:middle line:90%
on that dreamscape.

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:18.480 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Yeah, I think
everything that shows up

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:21.360 align:middle line:84%
in our dreams is there
because it needs healing.

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:24.310 align:middle line:84%
It needs to be recognized
at this particular time.

00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:27.510 align:middle line:84%
So I think that it's very
important to recognize and take

00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:29.600 align:middle line:84%
account for everything
you experience right now.

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:31.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so talk about
feelings in dream time,

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:36.360 align:middle line:84%
because the notion that a dream
can have all these symbols,

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:38.439 align:middle line:84%
symbols are different
for everybody.

00:31:38.439 --> 00:31:40.230 align:middle line:84%
What a squirrel is to
one person in a dream

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:41.280 align:middle line:90%
it's not to the other person.

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:42.080 align:middle line:90%
>> BROWN: Right.

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:44.220 align:middle line:84%
It's different for every
person, but every person

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:46.560 align:middle line:84%
should be able to recognize
what it means to them.

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:47.976 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
what I'm saying.

00:31:47.976 --> 00:31:50.280 align:middle line:84%
That's where feelings really
come in in dream time.

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:52.440 align:middle line:84%
How did that experience
make you feel?

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:55.740 align:middle line:84%
You say the feline character,
you woke up sweating.

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:59.550 align:middle line:84%
It was a very disturbing dream
about these controlling forces

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:02.460 align:middle line:84%
that were, again, these
lower realms demanding

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:03.980 align:middle line:90%
blood sacrifice--

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:05.970 align:middle line:90%
really low stuff.

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:08.970 align:middle line:84%
But it was very clear,
and that sense of relief--

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:10.870 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lesson
in that, right?

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:12.300 align:middle line:90%
Well, at least it wasn't me.

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:14.360 align:middle line:84%
Everything's OK in
the world, right?

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:15.160 align:middle line:90%
In that one.

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:17.690 align:middle line:84%
Everyone breathed
a sigh of relief.

00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:20.530 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: I mean, I took
that dream, by the way,

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:24.600 align:middle line:84%
as evidence for the origin
of religion, basically.

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.100 align:middle line:84%
That religion, that there were
a lot of animal sacrifices

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:30.204 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning of
religions, and why was that?

00:32:30.204 --> 00:32:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And it led me to
a lot of insight.

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:33.610 align:middle line:84%
I spoke to Rupert
Sheldrake, actually.

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:35.040 align:middle line:84%
I described in my
book, actually--

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:36.623 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What did
he say about that?

00:32:36.623 --> 00:32:40.830 align:middle line:10%
>> BROWN: He said that he
thought that the dream that I

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:45.510 align:middle line:10%
had in Israel was representative
of what he had read in Barbara

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:47.970 align:middle line:10%
Ehrenreich's book
called "Blood Rites"

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:52.050 align:middle line:10%
about how in early
human societies,

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:54.840 align:middle line:10%
we were often the
prey of animals--

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.250 align:middle line:10%
of wildcats.

00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And we recognized
that because one of us

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:02.550 align:middle line:84%
had to be sacrificed for
the wildcat to be satiated--

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:06.150 align:middle line:84%
that once it was satiated,
it would then leave us alone.

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And it would also
kill other prey.

00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:13.320 align:middle line:84%
It would kill other animals
that we would then harvest from.

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:14.190 align:middle line:90%
We would then eat.

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:17.500 align:middle line:84%
So it was providing for us and
also taking one of our own.

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And Barbara Ehrenreich
and Rupert Sheldrake

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:22.560 align:middle line:84%
told me that they
thought that this

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:25.710 align:middle line:84%
may have had an influence on
the development of religion.

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And Rupert saw that dream as
being some type of evidence

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:31.890 align:middle line:90%
for that type of idea.

00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:34.300 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:39.720 align:middle line:90%
So I also have come to--

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's fair
to say a belief, but maybe

00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:43.650 align:middle line:84%
my current
understanding, because it

00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:44.994 align:middle line:90%
morphs as I have new evidence.

00:33:44.994 --> 00:33:47.160 align:middle line:84%
If you're open-minded,
everything's morphing, right?

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:49.080 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Yeah, you're
entertaining ideas.

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:50.330 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Entertaining ideas.

00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:52.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm entertaining
this idea that when

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:56.130 align:middle line:84%
we look back at some of the work
that we feature here at Gaia--

00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:59.220 align:middle line:84%
the work of Zecharia Sitchin
and Erich von Daniken

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:02.820 align:middle line:84%
and others that have
basically run off

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:04.980 align:middle line:90%
with the Anunnaki story.

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:06.570 align:middle line:90%
Which is a pixel of history.

00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:09.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are a lot of other
influences far prior to that,

00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:11.400 align:middle line:90%
but even so.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:16.139 align:middle line:84%
When again you start looking at
the intrusion, or corruption,

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:18.510 align:middle line:90%
of the message upon humanity--

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:22.860 align:middle line:84%
that there are these
demanding, wrathful gods--

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:27.380 align:middle line:84%
which has been perpetuated
in Sunday school to this day,

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:28.409 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:34:28.409 --> 00:34:31.199 align:middle line:84%
In all of the
Abrahamic traditions.

00:34:31.199 --> 00:34:32.850 align:middle line:84%
When you have that
overlay that's

00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:38.130 align:middle line:84%
now been perpetuated in our
soul group and tribal families

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:40.889 align:middle line:90%
as stories, it's in our DNA.

00:34:40.889 --> 00:34:43.739 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's in
our spiritual DNA.

00:34:43.739 --> 00:34:47.190 align:middle line:84%
That has to be having a
tremendously negative impact

00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:49.110 align:middle line:84%
on humanity in their
dream time, as well.

00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Like you say-- sacrifices,
these fearful entities.

00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:56.050 align:middle line:84%
These entities that
are to be feared.

00:34:56.050 --> 00:34:58.300 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Right, right--
these religious institutions.

00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:00.883 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's why I bring
it up, is because you said that.

00:35:00.883 --> 00:35:02.550 align:middle line:84%
I think that the
religious institutions

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:05.350 align:middle line:84%
are hugely responsible for
the amount of anxiety and fear

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:06.150 align:middle line:90%
in dreams.

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:07.608 align:middle line:84%
If you just start
off with the fact

00:35:07.608 --> 00:35:10.560 align:middle line:84%
that you have to please
some wrathful God,

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:13.042 align:middle line:84%
your psyche is damaged
from day one, right?

00:35:13.042 --> 00:35:14.000 align:middle line:90%
>> BROWN: Right, right.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think that they're
responsible for a lot

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.400 align:middle line:84%
of the anxiety in
waking life, as well.

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:21.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Absolutely--
and waking life, as well.

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:22.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we're on that.

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:24.270 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's talk about
images that people

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:25.600 align:middle line:90%
see with their eyes closed.

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:28.550 align:middle line:10%
Let's talk about, now,
moving over into peyote--

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:30.950 align:middle line:10%
the whole spectrum
of hallucinogens.

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:33.719 align:middle line:84%
And each one has their
own characteristics.

00:35:33.719 --> 00:35:35.885 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Right, well, when
people do a psychedelic,

00:35:35.885 --> 00:35:38.700 align:middle line:84%
when people do ayahuasca,
peyote, magic mushrooms,

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:42.020 align:middle line:84%
psilocybin, one of the
most interesting aspects

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:44.550 align:middle line:84%
of the experience is that
with your eyes closed,

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:45.680 align:middle line:90%
you tend to see visions.

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:46.970 align:middle line:90%
You tend to see imagery.

00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:49.370 align:middle line:90%
You tend to see shifting forms.

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:54.020 align:middle line:84%
You tend to see patterns that
develop into beings or animals

00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:55.910 align:middle line:90%
or scenes or environments.

00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And what's most interesting
is that if you really

00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:00.320 align:middle line:84%
pay attention to
this imagery, you

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.600 align:middle line:84%
notice that it's not
completely random, that there's

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.200 align:middle line:90%
some kind of message.

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:05.990 align:middle line:84%
It's like if you
put them together,

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like the
different images are

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.250 align:middle line:84%
like different letters
in an alphabet.

00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And they're forming
sentences, and it's

00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:14.510 align:middle line:84%
trying to communicate
with you something.

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And in my own
experience with this,

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:19.610 align:middle line:84%
it really seems like there's
some type of higher mind that

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:21.230 align:middle line:90%
is using this imagery.

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And the imagery seems very
similar to dream imagery.

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:28.520 align:middle line:84%
It seems one image can have
four or five different meanings.

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:32.810 align:middle line:84%
Many meanings are encoded into
a particular image or scene.

00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And when you sit there
watching these things--

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:37.699 align:middle line:84%
particularly on
ayahuasca or mushrooms--

00:36:37.699 --> 00:36:39.740 align:middle line:84%
it's extremely common
where people will sit there

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:41.600 align:middle line:90%
with their eyes closed.

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:44.490 align:middle line:84%
First of all, a gap at how
just amazing these things look.

00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:45.290 align:middle line:90%
They're incredible.

00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:46.831 align:middle line:84%
Their visions truly
are-- the colors.

00:36:46.831 --> 00:36:48.360 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they're really amazing.

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:51.530 align:middle line:84%
But deeper than the bewilderment
from the amazement of that

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:54.250 align:middle line:84%
is the deep meaning that's
bestowed upon people.

00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And if you can really
sit there and really

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.470 align:middle line:84%
watch and really
pay attention, you

00:36:57.470 --> 00:37:00.440 align:middle line:84%
can often learn a
lot about yourself.

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:03.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And would you say
it's best if you have a guide

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:05.270 align:middle line:84%
of some kind and you're
taught how to do this,

00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:06.362 align:middle line:90%
or just jump in?

00:37:06.362 --> 00:37:08.320 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Oh, it's always
best to have a guide.

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:09.819 align:middle line:84%
It's definitely
something that could

00:37:09.819 --> 00:37:13.820 align:middle line:84%
be potentially psychologically
dangerous if someone is not

00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:14.840 align:middle line:90%
properly prepared.

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:17.990 align:middle line:84%
In indigenous society, it's
always been done with a shaman.

00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:20.480 align:middle line:84%
For thousands of years,
they've always used shamans.

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And right now, of course, what's
going on with psychedelics

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:25.350 align:middle line:84%
is they're using it
in psychotherapy.

00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:27.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's being used
with a therapist, which

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:29.887 align:middle line:84%
basically takes the modern
day equivalent of a shaman.

00:37:29.887 --> 00:37:31.970 align:middle line:84%
So these things-- especially
if they're being used

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:32.870 align:middle line:90%
for healing--

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:34.760 align:middle line:84%
are almost always
far more effective

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:37.250 align:middle line:84%
if they're used in conjunction
with some other healing

00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:38.050 align:middle line:90%
modality.

00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:40.299 align:middle line:84%
They work very well,
synergistically, on their own.

00:37:40.299 --> 00:37:41.840 align:middle line:84%
They're not quite
nearly as powerful,

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:43.760 align:middle line:84%
and they can be a
lot more dangerous.

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:46.040 align:middle line:84%
But together, they
really can be powerful.

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And together, they're
usually pretty safe.

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And people have really had
some really amazing healing

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:53.570 align:middle line:90%
experiences with ayahuasca.

00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:56.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, we hear about
all the people that have done

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:58.070 align:middle line:90%
LSD forever.

00:37:58.070 --> 00:38:00.710 align:middle line:84%
And again, just under
their own steam.

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:02.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's a whole
different thing.

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:07.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you do have to be
somewhat careful about your use

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:09.220 align:middle line:90%
of hallucinogens.

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:12.382 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm one of those people
that tries everything once.

00:38:12.382 --> 00:38:14.090 align:middle line:84%
Not everything, but
a lot of things once,

00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:15.214 align:middle line:90%
just to see what it's like.

00:38:15.214 --> 00:38:19.950 align:middle line:90%
And wow-- just randomly.

00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:21.660 align:middle line:90%
No education first.

00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:22.460 align:middle line:90%
No guidance.

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:24.980 align:middle line:84%
Just like, hm, I wonder
what that would feel like?

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And so I've had the
experiences that way.

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:29.210 align:middle line:90%
And it's been interesting.

00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:31.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, going to the
Louvre on LSD was fine.

00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:33.186 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I got stuck
looking at those--

00:38:33.186 --> 00:38:34.602 align:middle line:84%
can't remember the
artist's name--

00:38:34.602 --> 00:38:37.270 align:middle line:84%
those fruit and vegetable
heads from the 1500s.

00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: I know
who you're talking--

00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:40.278 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember the artist,
but I know who you mean, yeah.

00:38:40.278 --> 00:38:42.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I stayed there
almost the whole time,

00:38:42.290 --> 00:38:44.960 align:middle line:84%
and then ended up out on
a ledge on the third floor

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:46.310 align:middle line:90%
of the cafeteria--

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:50.900 align:middle line:84%
sitting on a ledge having
a snack with pigeons.

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:52.212 align:middle line:90%
So it had its ups and downs.

00:38:52.212 --> 00:38:53.420 align:middle line:90%
>> BROWN: So you and I, both.

00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:54.890 align:middle line:90%
I walked around Paris--

00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:56.120 align:middle line:90%
when I was in college I did.

00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:58.130 align:middle line:84%
I went to the Pompidou Center
while tripping on acid.

00:38:58.130 --> 00:38:58.930 align:middle line:90%
It was so fun.

00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:00.500 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It really was fun.

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:03.066 align:middle line:84%
They just asked us to
get back off of the ledge

00:39:03.066 --> 00:39:04.190 align:middle line:90%
and get back in the window.

00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:06.862 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know how we
managed to get out there.

00:39:06.862 --> 00:39:10.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everyone has
their unique experience.

00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And it also depends
a lot, though,

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:14.960 align:middle line:84%
on the psychology
that's underneath it

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:18.320 align:middle line:84%
and your own base,
psychologically,

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:21.890 align:middle line:84%
at the time-- whether it's
stable, unstable, more aware

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:24.470 align:middle line:90%
or more depressed, for example.

00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:28.237 align:middle line:84%
So what do you have to say
along that line about what

00:39:28.237 --> 00:39:30.320 align:middle line:84%
you would encourage people
to do if they're really

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.420 align:middle line:84%
looking for themselves
and having a hard time--

00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:33.520 align:middle line:90%
depressed, say, even?

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:35.270 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: With
psychedelics, you mean, or?

00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:36.267 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:36.267 --> 00:39:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: The most important
thing to remember about any

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.310 align:middle line:84%
psychedelic experience--
well, first of all,

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:41.934 align:middle line:84%
is reading as much
about it as you can.

00:39:41.934 --> 00:39:44.109 align:middle line:84%
Educate yourself is the
most important thing.

00:39:44.109 --> 00:39:46.400 align:middle line:84%
The next thing I would say
that's really most important

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.800 align:middle line:84%
is understanding
set and setting.

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:52.190 align:middle line:84%
Your set is the mental
state that you're

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:53.930 align:middle line:84%
in-- whether you're
depressed, happy.

00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:55.640 align:middle line:84%
You obviously want
to be in a state

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:58.070 align:middle line:84%
where you're feeling
very emotionally stable.

00:39:58.070 --> 00:40:00.170 align:middle line:84%
The setting is the
place where you actually

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:01.467 align:middle line:90%
do it-- your environment.

00:40:01.467 --> 00:40:03.800 align:middle line:84%
You want to be in a place
where you feel very safe, very

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:06.350 align:middle line:84%
comfortable, where there's no
interruptions, where you're

00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:09.170 align:middle line:84%
with people that you don't
feel any kind of animosity

00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:11.790 align:middle line:84%
with, where you feel
close bonding with.

00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:15.650 align:middle line:84%
Because I mean, doing this with
someone is extremely intimate.

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:17.630 align:middle line:84%
It's like becoming
naked with someone.

00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:19.620 align:middle line:84%
You become like a
little baby again.

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:21.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very, very,
very powerful experience

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:24.660 align:middle line:84%
that can go off in all
different directions.

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:26.479 align:middle line:84%
So it's very important
to be with someone

00:40:26.479 --> 00:40:28.020 align:middle line:84%
who knows what
they're doing, really,

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:31.022 align:middle line:84%
and to work with
somebody who's actually

00:40:31.022 --> 00:40:33.480 align:middle line:84%
had the experience before you--
to talk to other people who

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:34.520 align:middle line:90%
have had the experience.

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:37.450 align:middle line:90%


00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And preferably to
be with someone

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:41.861 align:middle line:84%
who's had the experience
when you do it.

00:40:41.861 --> 00:40:43.860 align:middle line:84%
The word they don't really
use anymore is guide.

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:45.030 align:middle line:90%
They've stopped using that.

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:46.196 align:middle line:90%
The maps stopped using that.

00:40:46.196 --> 00:40:47.820 align:middle line:84%
The word they use
now is "sitter,"

00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:48.330 align:middle line:90%
because you don't want to--

00:40:48.330 --> 00:40:49.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Sitter.

00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:50.790 align:middle line:84%
Sitter is like a
babysitter, right.

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:52.120 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Because you don't
want to influence, so much,

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:54.703 align:middle line:84%
their experiences, just be there
with them to be there if they

00:40:54.703 --> 00:40:56.444 align:middle line:90%
need you.

00:40:56.444 --> 00:40:58.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now, some of the
experiences people have during

00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:01.680 align:middle line:84%
sleep and will try to relate
these back and forth during

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:04.320 align:middle line:84%
sleep-- and also,
I think, at times,

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:06.360 align:middle line:84%
when they're using
various hallucinogens--

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:09.200 align:middle line:90%
is a state of paralysis.

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.920 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
that a little bit?

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:12.780 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Yeah, well,
sleep paralysis.

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:16.020 align:middle line:84%
Sleep paralysis is a state
when people sometimes

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:17.850 align:middle line:84%
experience when they
wake up in the morning

00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:19.650 align:middle line:84%
and they're not
fully woken up yet

00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:21.150 align:middle line:90%
and they can't move their body.

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's often a terrifying
experience for people.

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:27.835 align:middle line:84%
They're unable to
move, and they often

00:41:27.835 --> 00:41:30.210 align:middle line:84%
struggle, struggle, struggle
really, really, really hard.

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And in that interim,
trying to move,

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:34.864 align:middle line:84%
they're still in
somewhat REM sleep.

00:41:34.864 --> 00:41:36.780 align:middle line:84%
So they're actually
seeing some dream imagery,

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:39.180 align:middle line:84%
and it's very common for
them to experience, say,

00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:42.430 align:middle line:84%
a menacing figure to be coming
towards them or something.

00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And people get very frightened
and often just startle

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:47.760 align:middle line:90%
and jump awake very quickly.

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:50.850 align:middle line:84%
That state of sleep
paralysis, I've learned,

00:41:50.850 --> 00:41:53.250 align:middle line:84%
is actually a launching
pad for lucid dreaming

00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:54.805 align:middle line:90%
if you learn to not--

00:41:54.805 --> 00:41:55.680 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Freak out.

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:58.054 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Yeah, if you learn
to not freak out and get too

00:41:58.054 --> 00:42:02.220 align:middle line:84%
scared and just stay there with
it and focus your attention

00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:05.640 align:middle line:84%
from your physical body to--
if you try to move your body,

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:09.226 align:middle line:84%
you realize your body doesn't
move, but something does.

00:42:09.226 --> 00:42:11.100 align:middle line:84%
There's like an astral
limb, or a dream limb,

00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:12.270 align:middle line:90%
or something that moves.

00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And if you start trying to focus
your attention on that instead

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:18.390 align:middle line:84%
of your physical
body, you'll slowly

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:22.634 align:middle line:84%
start to identify more with the
dream body or the astral body.

00:42:22.634 --> 00:42:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And you can then use
that as a launching

00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:26.190 align:middle line:84%
pad to go off into an
out-of-body experience

00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:27.480 align:middle line:90%
or lucid dream.

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:30.270 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the
techniques that I've actually

00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:32.110 align:middle line:90%
learned from sleep paralysis.

00:42:32.110 --> 00:42:34.350 align:middle line:84%
The reason that people
go into sleep paralysis

00:42:34.350 --> 00:42:38.820 align:middle line:84%
is because when
people are sleeping,

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:41.640 align:middle line:84%
it's probably not
advantageous for their bodies

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:44.369 align:middle line:84%
to be moving around and
acting out the dreams--

00:42:44.369 --> 00:42:45.410 align:middle line:90%
the actions of the dream.

00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, especially
if you're what's called astral

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:48.510 align:middle line:90%
traveling.

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:51.760 align:middle line:84%
You want the body to be
quiet and safe, right?

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And there's a fine
line between dreaming

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:55.920 align:middle line:90%
and what we call astral travel.

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:58.510 align:middle line:90%
It can look very similar.

00:42:58.510 --> 00:43:01.260 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Well, the big
difference between dreaming

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:03.700 align:middle line:84%
and astral traveling is that
we can very clearly define

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:04.500 align:middle line:90%
dreaming.

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:06.000 align:middle line:84%
Astral traveling's
hard to define,

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.470 align:middle line:84%
and I've heard different
definitions of it.

00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:08.940 align:middle line:84%
So it's a little
bit harder for me

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:12.180 align:middle line:84%
to pin down exactly what's
happening when someone's astral

00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:13.050 align:middle line:90%
traveling.

00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:16.170 align:middle line:84%
But certainly, out-of-body
experiences and lucid dream

00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:18.810 align:middle line:84%
experiences-- there's a lot
of crossover between the two

00:43:18.810 --> 00:43:21.030 align:middle line:90%
types of phenomena.

00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:24.537 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Another somewhat--

00:43:24.537 --> 00:43:26.370 align:middle line:84%
if not common, at least
well-known phenomena

00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:28.080 align:middle line:84%
having to do with
sleep paralysis--

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:33.140 align:middle line:84%
often has to do with
people's experience

00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:35.250 align:middle line:90%
of interfacing with ET realms.

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:36.899 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
that a little bit?

00:43:36.899 --> 00:43:38.940 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: You know, I
haven't heard that so much.

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:40.731 align:middle line:84%
But I'll tell you what
that brings to mind.

00:43:40.731 --> 00:43:44.470 align:middle line:84%
That brings to mind Rick
Strassman's work with DMT--

00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:46.800 align:middle line:84%
the DMT spaces that
people accessed

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:49.530 align:middle line:84%
during those
experiences, which are

00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:53.550 align:middle line:84%
somewhat similar to
lucid dream experiences.

00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Many people report being
in the laboratories

00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:58.560 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial creatures
doing experiments on them,

00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:00.810 align:middle line:84%
communicating with
extraterrestrial or

00:44:00.810 --> 00:44:02.750 align:middle line:90%
interdimensional-type beings.

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:06.370 align:middle line:84%
It's a very, very
common experience.

00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:09.270 align:middle line:84%
So what the relationship
is is very mysterious,

00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:10.170 align:middle line:90%
or interesting.

00:44:10.170 --> 00:44:12.420 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people
have speculated

00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:15.020 align:middle line:84%
that in that state
of sleep paralysis,

00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:17.880 align:middle line:84%
people's DMT levels
are naturally going up.

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:20.510 align:middle line:84%
So it could be that
elevation in DMT

00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:22.230 align:middle line:84%
that is somehow
giving people access

00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:24.630 align:middle line:84%
to these other
hyper-dimensional realms.

00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's highly possible
that these realms are inhabited

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:31.260 align:middle line:84%
by beings that are more advanced
than us, that are more evolved

00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:34.710 align:middle line:84%
than us, and that are probably
eager to communicate with us

00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:36.960 align:middle line:90%
once we get there.

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It seems, though,
that in that particular

00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:41.760 align:middle line:84%
scenario where people have the
sleep paralysis that related

00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:45.200 align:middle line:84%
to ET experience, that
oftentimes-- for most of them--

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:46.000 align:middle line:90%
it's frightening.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.540 align:middle line:90%
It's a frightening experience.

00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:48.900 align:middle line:90%
And John Mack--

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:53.020 align:middle line:84%
Dr. John Mack, the late Dr.
John Mack, of course, did--

00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:54.000 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.350 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: OK, now I know
what you referring to, yeah.

00:44:56.350 --> 00:44:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Thousands of case
histories on this that happened

00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:58.640 align:middle line:90%
during that.

00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
hard to determine,

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:03.750 align:middle line:84%
when you listen to a person's
story, what's going on.

00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:05.940 align:middle line:84%
But it appears it's
interdimensional,

00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:09.270 align:middle line:84%
because your body's not
actually in two places at once.

00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:13.950 align:middle line:84%
But they can come back and
have the hallmarks of--

00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:16.350 align:middle line:90%
they have physical symptoms.

00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:18.450 align:middle line:84%
They'll have physical
implants, or some people

00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:21.240 align:middle line:84%
I know have this interesting
little thing that

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:24.220 align:middle line:84%
happens on their backs or
the back of their shoulder,

00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:28.690 align:middle line:84%
which is like a triangle
of pricks in a triangle.

00:45:28.690 --> 00:45:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And so you think, well, is this
another dimensional experience,

00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:34.120 align:middle line:90%
a dream experience?

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:36.760 align:middle line:90%
Or is this a physical reality?

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:38.864 align:middle line:84%
And this, to me, is an
interesting mystery.

00:45:38.864 --> 00:45:40.780 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Oh, it's such
a fascinating mystery.

00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:42.488 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I spoke to
John Mack about that.

00:45:42.488 --> 00:45:44.440 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed him
for one of my books.

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him
specifically what

00:45:46.330 --> 00:45:48.190 align:middle line:84%
he thought the difference
was between people

00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:51.580 align:middle line:84%
who have contact experiences--
through a psychedelic

00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:54.790 align:middle line:84%
experience or through
an abduction experience,

00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:56.450 align:middle line:90%
as it's often called.

00:45:56.450 --> 00:45:59.529 align:middle line:84%
And he said exactly
what you said--

00:45:59.529 --> 00:46:01.570 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes, they report
very similar experiences.

00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:02.986 align:middle line:84%
But with the
abduction experience,

00:46:02.986 --> 00:46:06.271 align:middle line:84%
it's often physical evidence
that often corresponds with it.

00:46:06.271 --> 00:46:08.770 align:middle line:84%
Not only the marks on the body
like you described, but often

00:46:08.770 --> 00:46:12.250 align:middle line:84%
radar readings, sometimes, or
sightings of UFOs and things

00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:14.710 align:middle line:84%
like that, that correspond
with the timing of the person's

00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:16.630 align:middle line:90%
abduction experience.

00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:18.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:21.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm still trying to understand.

00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:24.580 align:middle line:84%
Because we know that this
etheric template surrounding

00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:27.250 align:middle line:84%
the human body is
the precursor to what

00:46:27.250 --> 00:46:29.680 align:middle line:84%
happens in the
physical body and what

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:31.030 align:middle line:90%
manifests in the physical body.

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And thoughts, emotions,
everything impact

00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:37.840 align:middle line:84%
EMF fields-- everything
impacts this etheric field

00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:39.220 align:middle line:90%
around the body, right?

00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:40.734 align:middle line:84%
And so that will
end up manifesting

00:46:40.734 --> 00:46:41.650 align:middle line:90%
on the physical level.

00:46:41.650 --> 00:46:45.490 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that trauma that
happens on these other slightly

00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:47.890 align:middle line:84%
phased-off levels
of consciousness

00:46:47.890 --> 00:46:50.830 align:middle line:84%
can appear physically
in the physical body?

00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:53.074 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems like that
might be the implication

00:46:53.074 --> 00:46:54.740 align:middle line:84%
there, unless someone
came into the room

00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:57.321 align:middle line:84%
and started poking them
while they were sleeping.

00:46:57.321 --> 00:46:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: I think that's
certainly a very highly

00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:00.250 align:middle line:90%
plausible theory.

00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:02.041 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's hard to
say which comes first.

00:47:02.041 --> 00:47:04.450 align:middle line:84%
Could the physical body
influence the etheric body?

00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:08.842 align:middle line:84%
I mean-- it's like
the mind-body problem,

00:47:08.842 --> 00:47:11.050 align:middle line:84%
because we don't really know
whether the mind affects

00:47:11.050 --> 00:47:13.030 align:middle line:84%
the body more than the
body affects the mind.

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:14.770 align:middle line:84%
They certainly
affect each other.

00:47:14.770 --> 00:47:17.510 align:middle line:84%
So there's an interesting
communication between the two.

00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think it could apply
to the etheric and physical

00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:21.110 align:middle line:90%
bodies, as well.

00:47:21.110 --> 00:47:21.910 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:23.650 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that--
flip the lens a little bit

00:47:23.650 --> 00:47:25.170 align:middle line:84%
and talk about
healing that happens

00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:28.960 align:middle line:84%
through lucid dreaming and some
of the research you've read,

00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:30.650 align:middle line:84%
but also some of
your own experiences.

00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:31.450 align:middle line:90%
>> BROWN: Yeah.

00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:32.408 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that fascinating?

00:47:32.408 --> 00:47:34.770 align:middle line:84%
I think that's probably one
of the most practical areas

00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:36.894 align:middle line:84%
that lucid dreaming-- it's
one of the things that's

00:47:36.894 --> 00:47:40.120 align:middle line:84%
been used in shamanism
as a mode for healing.

00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:41.620 align:middle line:84%
I wish I could say
that there's been

00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:43.700 align:middle line:84%
a whole lot of scientific
research in this area.

00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:45.165 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, there
really hasn't been.

00:47:45.165 --> 00:47:45.440 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Not much.

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: There
really hasn't been.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.749 align:middle line:84%
There's been a few
little studies-- mostly

00:47:47.749 --> 00:47:49.390 align:middle line:84%
case studies-- of
people, but there's

00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:51.310 align:middle line:90%
been quite a few anecdotes.

00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:54.370 align:middle line:10%
When I spoke to Robert Waggoner,
the author of the book "Lucid

00:47:54.370 --> 00:47:57.390 align:middle line:10%
Dreaming"-- he edits
a quarterly magazine

00:47:57.390 --> 00:47:58.390 align:middle line:10%
called "Lucid Dreaming."

00:47:58.390 --> 00:48:00.460 align:middle line:84%
He says that every
issue he's flooded

00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:02.260 align:middle line:84%
with a certain number
of dreams where

00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:05.050 align:middle line:90%
people experience healing.

00:48:05.050 --> 00:48:08.170 align:middle line:84%
In researching my own book, one
of the stories that I recounted

00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:13.000 align:middle line:84%
was from someone who described
having a very serious infection

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.110 align:middle line:90%
in their tonsils.

00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:16.540 align:middle line:84%
Very, very serious from
having accidentally

00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:19.290 align:middle line:84%
poked it with a skewer
when they were eating.

00:48:19.290 --> 00:48:23.544 align:middle line:84%
And when they went to
sleep-- and in the dream,

00:48:23.544 --> 00:48:25.960 align:middle line:84%
they became lucid and said,
I'm going to try to heal this.

00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:27.495 align:middle line:90%
So they went over to a mirror.

00:48:27.495 --> 00:48:28.870 align:middle line:84%
They stood in
front of the mirror

00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:32.470 align:middle line:84%
and they imagined a
glowing light just coming

00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:35.344 align:middle line:84%
from around their neck-- just
imagined this glowing light.

00:48:35.344 --> 00:48:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And they felt like there
was some kind of shift that

00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:40.180 align:middle line:84%
was going on during the
dream, and just imagine that.

00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And when they woke
up, remarkably, they

00:48:41.830 --> 00:48:45.730 align:middle line:84%
reported that 95%
of the infection

00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:47.500 align:middle line:90%
had healed during that time.

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:49.670 align:middle line:90%
So it's really quite remarkable.

00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:51.520 align:middle line:84%
This is really something
that really should

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:52.840 align:middle line:90%
be researched a whole lot more.

00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:53.756 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:48:53.756 --> 00:48:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Have you played
with it yourself?

00:48:55.450 --> 00:48:57.610 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: I really haven't
played with it myself.

00:48:57.610 --> 00:49:01.240 align:middle line:84%
But I have spoken to people who
not only talked about healing,

00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:04.630 align:middle line:84%
but talked about healing
other people in their dreams.

00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:06.186 align:middle line:84%
They were able to
heal other people.

00:49:06.186 --> 00:49:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And the other people
then spoke to them

00:49:07.810 --> 00:49:12.764 align:middle line:84%
and confirmed that they were
able to confirm these things.

00:49:12.764 --> 00:49:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, I find
that part fascinating.

00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:16.638 align:middle line:84%
And I agree with you--
more research is needed.

00:49:16.638 --> 00:49:19.610 align:middle line:84%
But we don't need research, per
se, to start playing with it

00:49:19.610 --> 00:49:20.800 align:middle line:90%
if we have something.

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:24.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can also listen and
whether it's your higher self

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:26.860 align:middle line:84%
or other intelligences that
work with you-- guides,

00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:28.426 align:middle line:90%
whatnot come through--

00:49:28.426 --> 00:49:29.800 align:middle line:84%
they'll also
communicate with you

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:32.530 align:middle line:84%
about what's brewing, what's
taking place in the body

00:49:32.530 --> 00:49:34.450 align:middle line:84%
and what's about to
manifest so you can

00:49:34.450 --> 00:49:36.080 align:middle line:90%
deal with it a little earlier.

00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:36.940 align:middle line:90%
But, yeah.

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Yeah, I wanted to
say that I didn't use dreaming,

00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:41.292 align:middle line:84%
ever, to heal from a
physical injury or an illness

00:49:41.292 --> 00:49:42.250 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:45.330 align:middle line:84%
But I did use it to help heal
from a trauma from childhood.

00:49:45.330 --> 00:49:48.730 align:middle line:84%
It was instrumental in
helping me heal from childhood

00:49:48.730 --> 00:49:50.710 align:middle line:90%
post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:52.700 align:middle line:84%
So I know from
personal experience

00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:56.380 align:middle line:84%
that it has great
potential for healing.

00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:57.330 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:49:57.330 --> 00:49:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, you write in
the book that you

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:01.420 align:middle line:84%
need to be aware, even
in lucid dreaming,

00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:03.060 align:middle line:84%
because it can be
a little dangerous.

00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:06.150 align:middle line:84%
And you asked the question, can
lucid dreaming be dangerous?

00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:07.750 align:middle line:90%
And what was your answer?

00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:09.125 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Well,
it's interesting,

00:50:09.125 --> 00:50:11.270 align:middle line:84%
because somebody had asked
me that question first,

00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:12.981 align:middle line:84%
and I thought it was
a silly question.

00:50:12.981 --> 00:50:14.230 align:middle line:90%
I was like, what could happen?

00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:15.460 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
fall off your bed?

00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:16.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was trying to
think of what could actually

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:18.490 align:middle line:90%
happen that could be dangerous.

00:50:18.490 --> 00:50:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And people are, if anything,
trying to stay in lucid dreams

00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:23.570 align:middle line:90%
as long as possible.

00:50:23.570 --> 00:50:26.410 align:middle line:84%
However, there was a few
things in my research

00:50:26.410 --> 00:50:29.270 align:middle line:84%
that came up that gave me
a little pause as to how it

00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:30.630 align:middle line:90%
can be a little bit dangerous.

00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:34.190 align:middle line:84%
Maybe somebody who is not
fully mentally stable--

00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:36.350 align:middle line:84%
someone who suffers
from, say, schizophrenia,

00:50:36.350 --> 00:50:39.560 align:middle line:84%
who already has trouble
distinguishing between what's

00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:40.700 align:middle line:90%
real and what's not--

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:42.980 align:middle line:84%
maybe those people shouldn't
be using techniques

00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:44.324 align:middle line:90%
to try to expand the sense of--

00:50:44.324 --> 00:50:46.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because they're
already too open to other

00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:49.570 align:middle line:84%
influences of, usually, a lower
realm or darker realm nature.

00:50:49.570 --> 00:50:54.020 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Yeah, and in my book,
I describe a couple of tragic

00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:55.320 align:middle line:90%
cases, actually.

00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:58.850 align:middle line:84%
So there is reason to
think that, in some cases,

00:50:58.850 --> 00:51:00.110 align:middle line:90%
it could be dangerous.

00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:03.050 align:middle line:84%
However, in general, it's been
proven-- mostly-- to be safe.

00:51:03.050 --> 00:51:05.040 align:middle line:84%
Almost everybody has
positive experiences--

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:08.270 align:middle line:84%
therapeutic,
healing experiences.

00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:11.270 align:middle line:84%
Some people have to deal with
nightmares in the experience,

00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:12.740 align:middle line:90%
which can be frightening.

00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:14.480 align:middle line:90%
It's rare, but it does happen.

00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:15.890 align:middle line:90%
People have nightmares.

00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And then they sometimes need to
try to wake up from a nightmare

00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:21.490 align:middle line:90%
or try to figure out a way--

00:51:21.490 --> 00:51:23.210 align:middle line:84%
Stephen LaBerge
actually recommends

00:51:23.210 --> 00:51:25.310 align:middle line:84%
that if you encounter
a threatening figure

00:51:25.310 --> 00:51:27.800 align:middle line:84%
or a menacing figure in a
dream, that really the best

00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:29.730 align:middle line:84%
thing to do is to try
to approach the figure--

00:51:29.730 --> 00:51:31.670 align:middle line:84%
not to run, to try to
approach the figure.

00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:32.510 align:middle line:90%
Try to talk to it.

00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:34.250 align:middle line:84%
Ask it, say, what
do you represent?

00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:35.320 align:middle line:90%
What are you here?

00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:36.260 align:middle line:84%
Try to hug the
creature if you can.

00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, that's
very good advice.

00:51:37.390 --> 00:51:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Yeah, and then you
can actually help to integrate

00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:44.240 align:middle line:84%
and process those repressed or
damaged emotions and traumas

00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:45.147 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:51:45.147 --> 00:51:47.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And sometimes
you're actually helping to heal

00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:48.890 align:middle line:90%
another entity.

00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:50.490 align:middle line:90%
>> BROWN: Exactly, right, yeah.

00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:52.620 align:middle line:84%
So you're helping
each other, then.

00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:54.370 align:middle line:84%
What a beautiful
experience that could be.

00:51:54.370 --> 00:51:57.260 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Indeed-- if you're
cognizant enough not to just

00:51:57.260 --> 00:51:58.286 align:middle line:90%
start running.

00:51:58.286 --> 00:52:00.950 align:middle line:90%
Which most people do, of course.

00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:02.090 align:middle line:90%
You know, another area--

00:52:02.090 --> 00:52:04.640 align:middle line:84%
we only have a few minutes left,
but I find it fascinating--

00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:08.420 align:middle line:84%
is the notion of how
magnetic fields work with us.

00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:10.190 align:middle line:84%
We know how they work
with us in daytime.

00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:12.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot of
people do, anyway--

00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:12.980 align:middle line:90%
our waking mind.

00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And we're having a lot
of issues at large.

00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:18.290 align:middle line:84%
People are having
short-term memory loss.

00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:21.380 align:middle line:84%
As the magnetic field of the
Earth continues dissipating,

00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:23.480 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing more
unstable behaviors.

00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:24.920 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's just a fact.

00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And we can't blame
it all on psyops.

00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:29.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there is also
the damaging effect.

00:52:29.570 --> 00:52:32.180 align:middle line:84%
Not damaging-- the lack of
support of the magnetic field

00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:33.380 align:middle line:90%
that once was.

00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:35.870 align:middle line:84%
And you talk about the
relationship between dreams

00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:39.270 align:middle line:84%
and the magnetic fields of
Earth in the book, as well.

00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:41.580 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: I talk about
the volcanic activity.

00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:42.955 align:middle line:84%
Is that what you're
referring to?

00:52:42.955 --> 00:52:45.530 align:middle line:84%
The volcanic activity in
the Hawaiian Islands--

00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:47.720 align:middle line:84%
I was speaking to
a researcher who

00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:52.220 align:middle line:84%
talked about how there's a
relationship between reports

00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:55.730 align:middle line:84%
of sleep paralysis
and volcanic activity

00:52:55.730 --> 00:52:58.400 align:middle line:90%
in the Hawaiian Islands.

00:52:58.400 --> 00:52:59.980 align:middle line:90%
Now, what that means is really--

00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:00.780 align:middle line:90%
who knows?

00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:02.930 align:middle line:84%
But in part of my research
with Rupert Sheldrake,

00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:06.110 align:middle line:84%
I also learned that
there's a relationship

00:53:06.110 --> 00:53:09.350 align:middle line:84%
between the crystals in the
earth and the Piezoelectric

00:53:09.350 --> 00:53:10.937 align:middle line:90%
effect and animal behavior.

00:53:10.937 --> 00:53:12.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's all
electromagnetic, yeah.

00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:13.900 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Gives off
electric fields.

00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:15.980 align:middle line:84%
These electric fields
can influence an animal's

00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:18.860 align:middle line:84%
nervous system, influence
their neurotransmitter levels,

00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:21.670 align:middle line:84%
and influence their behavior
in interesting ways.

00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:24.260 align:middle line:84%
So we know that
geologic activity

00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:27.290 align:middle line:84%
can influence nervous
systems, influence behavior.

00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:29.430 align:middle line:84%
And what's going on in
the volcanic islands

00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:30.230 align:middle line:90%
is fascinating.

00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:32.325 align:middle line:84%
People are experiencing
more sleep paralysis

00:53:32.325 --> 00:53:33.200 align:middle line:90%
during these periods.

00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:36.020 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to
time it, you can

00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:38.157 align:middle line:84%
try to have--
sleep paralysis can

00:53:38.157 --> 00:53:39.740 align:middle line:84%
be a launching pad
for lucid dreaming,

00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:40.781 align:middle line:90%
like I mentioned earlier.

00:53:40.781 --> 00:53:42.636 align:middle line:84%
So try to get to the
Hawaiian Islands.

00:53:42.636 --> 00:53:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Hang out where
there's volcanoes.

00:53:44.010 --> 00:53:48.162 align:middle line:84%
But there might be safer ways to
have lucid dreams than hanging

00:53:48.162 --> 00:53:49.400 align:middle line:90%
out on top of a volcano.

00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:50.556 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I would agree.

00:53:50.556 --> 00:53:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And then I think a lot
of people, the biggest

00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:54.740 align:middle line:84%
frustration-- and this
will be my final question--

00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:57.510 align:middle line:84%
is that you have
a fabulous dream

00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:59.120 align:middle line:90%
and then you don't remember it.

00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:01.460 align:middle line:84%
So what are some
general practices

00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:04.550 align:middle line:84%
you find useful to help
people just simply remember

00:54:04.550 --> 00:54:06.570 align:middle line:84%
all their dreams, just
remember your dreams?

00:54:06.570 --> 00:54:08.330 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Yeah, well, the most
important thing if you really

00:54:08.330 --> 00:54:10.190 align:middle line:84%
want to remember dreams--
which is actually essential

00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:12.560 align:middle line:84%
for becoming lucid in dreams,
is remembering your dreams

00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:13.220 align:middle line:90%
better--

00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:14.860 align:middle line:84%
is to start paying
attention to them.

00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:16.693 align:middle line:84%
That's really just the
most important thing.

00:54:16.693 --> 00:54:18.050 align:middle line:90%
Start writing them down.

00:54:18.050 --> 00:54:19.425 align:middle line:84%
If you have a
snippet of a dream,

00:54:19.425 --> 00:54:21.133 align:middle line:84%
write it down in the
middle of the night.

00:54:21.133 --> 00:54:22.600 align:middle line:84%
Always keep a pad
next to your bed.

00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:24.920 align:middle line:84%
Always keep-- or a audio
recorder, something

00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:26.680 align:middle line:84%
where you can always
write it down.

00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:29.270 align:middle line:84%
Even if you just have a feeling,
write down that feeling.

00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:31.410 align:middle line:90%
I feel a little bit nauseous.

00:54:31.410 --> 00:54:32.600 align:middle line:90%
I feel anxious.

00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:34.290 align:middle line:84%
I feel happy-- whatever
the feeling is.

00:54:34.290 --> 00:54:35.190 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Keep your
old dream journal there.

00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:37.520 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Yeah, and you find
that the more attention--

00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:38.960 align:middle line:84%
the more you start
writing down--

00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:40.430 align:middle line:90%
more starts coming back to you.

00:54:40.430 --> 00:54:41.570 align:middle line:90%
It starts snowballing.

00:54:41.570 --> 00:54:43.220 align:middle line:84%
You start doing that
for a couple days,

00:54:43.220 --> 00:54:45.011 align:middle line:84%
and you'll actually
start to remember more.

00:54:45.011 --> 00:54:47.210 align:middle line:84%
So keeping a dream
journal, paying attention,

00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:49.490 align:middle line:84%
writing down whatever it
is that you remember--

00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:50.930 align:middle line:90%
even if it's just a feeling--

00:54:50.930 --> 00:54:53.180 align:middle line:84%
and then sometimes
just lying in the dark

00:54:53.180 --> 00:54:55.130 align:middle line:84%
without turning the
light on is a good way

00:54:55.130 --> 00:54:58.414 align:middle line:84%
to help bring back dreams before
they dissolve into the ether.

00:54:58.414 --> 00:54:59.330 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:54:59.330 --> 00:55:00.746 align:middle line:84%
Another little
trick I found, too,

00:55:00.746 --> 00:55:05.570 align:middle line:84%
was tell your subconscious mind
that when the crux of the dream

00:55:05.570 --> 00:55:07.970 align:middle line:84%
comes through-- the really
important part, the message--

00:55:07.970 --> 00:55:12.410 align:middle line:84%
to be sure to gently
but surely wake me up.

00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:15.270 align:middle line:84%
Wake me up when the major
message comes through

00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:16.070 align:middle line:90%
so I don't miss it.

00:55:16.070 --> 00:55:18.830 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise, you're just
going from dream to dream.

00:55:18.830 --> 00:55:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And I found that works
pretty well, too.

00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:22.611 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Yeah, you can instruct
your unconscious just to follow

00:55:22.611 --> 00:55:24.110 align:middle line:84%
through, and it
will follow through.

00:55:24.110 --> 00:55:25.026 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:55:25.026 --> 00:55:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Any final thoughts
before we say goodbye?

00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:28.980 align:middle line:10%
>> BROWN: Oh, hope everybody--

00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:32.870 align:middle line:10%
I just want to say that just by
talking about lucid dreaming,

00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:35.720 align:middle line:10%
just by thinking about lucid
dreaming, just by interacting

00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:37.460 align:middle line:10%
and having it in your
mind, I'll bet you

00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:39.590 align:middle line:10%
a good portion of
your audience is going

00:55:39.590 --> 00:55:41.210 align:middle line:10%
to have a lucid dream tonight.

00:55:41.210 --> 00:55:42.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I would
not be surprised.

00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And thank you so much
for all your research

00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:46.082 align:middle line:84%
and for your lovely
work on the book.

00:55:46.082 --> 00:55:47.456 align:middle line:84%
>> BROWN: Thank
you so very much.

00:55:47.456 --> 00:55:49.010 align:middle line:84%
It's been a real
pleasure, Regina.

00:55:49.010 --> 00:55:51.426 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The name of the
book is, "Dreaming Wide Awake,"
