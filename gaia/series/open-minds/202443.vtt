00:00:19.425 --> 00:00:21.800 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Marguerite
Rigoglioso is back with us,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.925 align:middle line:10%
and we're going to be
talking about what many of us

00:00:23.925 --> 00:00:26.390 align:middle line:10%
learned in Sunday
school, divine birth,

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.600 align:middle line:10%
as described in her book, "The
Mystery Tradition of Miraculous

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.680 align:middle line:10%
Conception."

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.140 align:middle line:84%
The way I heard it,
Mary was a humble woman

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.880 align:middle line:90%
whom God picked to impregnate.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And the poverty stricken
couple gave birth

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.200 align:middle line:84%
in an animal enclosure
eating out of a trough.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.010 align:middle line:90%
Does that sound about right?

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.010 align:middle line:90%
That's how I learned it.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.000 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Marguerite.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.600 align:middle line:90%
>>MARGUERTIE RIGOGLIOSO: Hi.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.400 align:middle line:90%
Nice to be back.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A simple little
story of humble people.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:48.920 align:middle line:90%
Not quite right.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.290 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah, not quite.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's-- gosh,
where do we get into this?

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.270 align:middle line:84%
Because I really want to
spend some time talking

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.468 align:middle line:84%
about immaculate conception,
because it's something

00:00:58.468 --> 00:01:01.010 align:middle line:84%
we don't do interviews on and
people don't write books about,

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.480 align:middle line:90%
normally.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.605 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yes, correct.

00:01:02.605 --> 00:01:04.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So first of all,
make your first comment

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.480 align:middle line:84%
about how that didn't
happen that way.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.600 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
talk about divine birth

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.670 align:middle line:84%
in other ancient
cultures, not just

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.110 align:middle line:90%
in the Christian tradition.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.130 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.420 align:middle line:10%
Well, I've been researching
this for more than a decade

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.650 align:middle line:10%
now, about divine birth.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.840 align:middle line:10%
And I discovered that there
was this whole tradition

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.670 align:middle line:10%
in Ancient Greece--

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.190 align:middle line:10%
not only in Ancient
Greece, but in Ancient Rome

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.570 align:middle line:10%
and all over the world.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.070 align:middle line:10%
In the ancient Middle
East, in northern Africa--

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.870 align:middle line:10%
all over.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.560 align:middle line:84%
Native American traditions
have what I call divine birth

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.380 align:middle line:90%
traditions, OK?

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.750 align:middle line:90%
Mary comes out of that.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.270 align:middle line:84%
She's not the first,
she's not the only,

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.260 align:middle line:84%
and she's not the last woman
to have divinely conceived.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.750 align:middle line:84%
But what I learned is
that this is not something

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.250 align:middle line:90%
that happens accidentally.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.550 align:middle line:84%
This is not something
that all of a sudden

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:53.960 align:middle line:90%
descends on a woman.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.350 align:middle line:84%
This was actually
a practice of women

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.590 align:middle line:84%
in lineages going back thousands
and thousands of years.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And so Mary was in that
lineage of this practice.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.600 align:middle line:84%
Her mother Anne before her
gave birth to her divinely.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Their relative
Elizabeth divinely

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.530 align:middle line:90%
gave birth to John the Baptist.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And Sarah, the mother
of the biblical Isaac,

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.560 align:middle line:90%
miraculously gave birth.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.520 align:middle line:90%
And many, many others.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.548 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about a
longstanding tradition.

00:02:26.548 --> 00:02:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we'll talk about
the various ways in which this

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.300 align:middle line:84%
has occurred, because
it seems like there

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.200 align:middle line:84%
are numerous ways in
which this was achieved.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.000 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yes.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the
interesting thing

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.810 align:middle line:84%
to me in reading
some of the chapters

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.790 align:middle line:84%
from your forthcoming book
is that the reason for doing

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.010 align:middle line:84%
so-- first of all,
you took women

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.680 align:middle line:84%
with advance knowledge that
were already high initiates.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And you wanted to preserve
that knowledge slash bloodline.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.240 align:middle line:84%
So it was really about not
disturbing the bloodline

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.120 align:middle line:84%
by injecting the DNA from
an outside bloodline in.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.920 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yes.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: As I understand it.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:05.570 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:06.570 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Very much.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And the other piece of that
is to bring in a divine star

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.310 align:middle line:90%
being bloodline.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, because that's
what it was all being set up

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.310 align:middle line:84%
for, is high-frequency body,
high-frequency entity being

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.430 align:middle line:84%
able to take that
body and offer what

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.595 align:middle line:84%
it's come to do in that given
lifetime or incarnation.

00:03:25.595 --> 00:03:27.470 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Definitely,
because the purpose

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.720 align:middle line:84%
was to bring in the
avatar, to bring

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.620 align:middle line:84%
in the holy being, the
one who could periodically

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.940 align:middle line:84%
give humanity an
uplift after humanity

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.580 align:middle line:90%
had started to degenerate.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And this has happened
time and time again.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.600 align:middle line:84%
So in, for example,
the Haudenosaunee--

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.490 align:middle line:84%
often known as the
Iroquois tradition--

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.387 align:middle line:84%
you have the peacemaker, who
came in, uplifted those people.

00:03:53.387 --> 00:03:55.220 align:middle line:84%
And they were able to
stop warring, and then

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.180 align:middle line:84%
unite the five and six
Iroquois Confederacy.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.470 align:middle line:90%
That's one example.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.955 align:middle line:90%
Jesus is another example.

00:04:01.955 --> 00:04:04.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to
go into a few others a bit

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.320 align:middle line:84%
down and talk about the
ways in which they're

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.510 align:middle line:90%
said to have arrived here.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.940 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
biological parthenogenesis.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:12.740 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yes.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So explain
what that means.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.269 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll go into the
various iterations of how

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:18.900 align:middle line:90%
these beings came through.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:19.700 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.300 align:middle line:84%
Parthenogenesis comes from
"parthenos" and "gignesthai,"

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.410 align:middle line:90%
two Greek words.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.110 align:middle line:84%
"Parthenos" more or less
means virgin, or maiden.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And "gignesthai"
means to be born.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.790 align:middle line:84%
So it means to be born
of a virgin or maiden,

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.260 align:middle line:84%
meaning biologically
conception without male sperm.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And oftentimes, this
would be women having sex,

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:45.080 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, in their own minds
and in their own energy field

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.167 align:middle line:90%
with a divine being.

00:04:46.167 --> 00:04:47.000 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Right.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, initially-- I find
these like four phases, right?

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.120 align:middle line:84%
Initially, it was
them having kind

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.480 align:middle line:84%
of a divine encounter
with themself as goddess,

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.860 align:middle line:90%
as universe.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.350 align:middle line:90%
That's divine parthenogenesis.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And the early
stages of conception

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.120 align:middle line:90%
could happen that way.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.680 align:middle line:84%
Then there was a
second phase, where

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.070 align:middle line:84%
they would have conception,
and it would result--

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.030 align:middle line:84%
the first stage would
result in a female child.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.830 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.280 align:middle line:90%
Because the woman's eggs--

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.010 align:middle line:84%
she's basically replicating
herself, essentially.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.067 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: X. XX.

00:05:22.067 --> 00:05:23.650 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah,
the X chromosomes.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.830 align:middle line:84%
But in a later phase
of this, the women

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.300 align:middle line:84%
would be able to self-conceive,
but conceive a male child.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.850 align:middle line:84%
But it was still
parthenogenesis.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Then, a little bit what
you were talking about,

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.210 align:middle line:84%
there was the phase
where the women started

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.460 align:middle line:90%
going into this ritual--

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.220 align:middle line:84%
it would be a very deep,
high-level ritual--

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.637 align:middle line:90%
attempting parthenogenesis.

00:05:46.637 --> 00:05:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
they would be met

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.740 align:middle line:90%
by the presence of a male God.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And then it would become a
kind of a sexual encounter.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.022 align:middle line:90%
And initially--

00:05:55.022 --> 00:05:56.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Between dimensions.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:57.605 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO:
Between dimensions.

00:05:57.605 --> 00:06:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And we have stories all
over the world of women

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.870 align:middle line:84%
having sex with
gods, essentially.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.800 align:middle line:84%
This really initially
wasn't a welcome thing.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.500 align:middle line:84%
This was more like
a rape seduction.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.300 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's where all the raped
maidens of the Greek tradition

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.290 align:middle line:90%
represent that phase of it.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.600 align:middle line:84%
As that further
degenerated, the women

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.680 align:middle line:84%
started then not being
able to fight that, fight

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.520 align:middle line:90%
that whole wave.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And so they started
cultivating it.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And they started actively
having these rituals and rites

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:29.350 align:middle line:90%
of having sex with these gods.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is how, for example,
the Egyptian pharaohs came in.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.820 align:middle line:90%
Well, actually, it was before.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.970 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian pharaohs
is a later stage.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.850 align:middle line:84%
But this would be the woman
having sex with a god,

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.410 align:middle line:84%
and then giving
birth, so we have

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.730 align:middle line:84%
many stories of Apollo and
Zeus in the Greek tradition,

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.380 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And then a later
stage of this is

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:55.000 align:middle line:84%
they would have a male priest as
the stand-in actor for the god.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.220 align:middle line:84%
It started degenerating,
degenerating, degenerating.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To where they needed
a physical male presence.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.890 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: And
that was Egypt, OK?

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:06.790 align:middle line:84%
So the male pharaoh would
kind of get out of the way,

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:10.870 align:middle line:84%
and then the god would come in
and would impregnate the woman.

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:13.720 align:middle line:84%
But at that point
then, because there

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.020 align:middle line:84%
was a male biological
body, they could claim

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.190 align:middle line:90%
the child in the male line.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:19.990 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.210 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And this
had implications.

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:24.370 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk
about the implications,

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:29.780 align:middle line:84%
because then the mother, who was
usually a priestess or a very

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:30.580 align:middle line:90%
high initiate--

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:31.663 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah, queen.

00:07:31.663 --> 00:07:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --no longer
had the ability

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:35.560 align:middle line:84%
to kind of inculcate
her knowledge

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.820 align:middle line:90%
into the child or the son.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.970 align:middle line:84%
It was taken under
the domain of the men.

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And a whole different
type of development

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.440 align:middle line:84%
occurred as a result of
that, as you would think.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.820 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, let's talk
about the role of the virgin.

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:49.810 align:middle line:90%
Why virgins?

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:51.340 align:middle line:90%
And these were often--

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.850 align:middle line:84%
we have to remember,
historically girls

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:58.510 align:middle line:84%
were conceiving and having
babies from the age of 13

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:02.170 align:middle line:84%
and 14 commonly, throughout
all different societies

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:03.400 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.170 align:middle line:90%
Not in Atlantean ancient times.

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:06.070 align:middle line:90%
Time ran differently.

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:07.120 align:middle line:90%
Age ran differently.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.760 align:middle line:84%
But in modern history,
this was common.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.570 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah.

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:12.700 align:middle line:90%
So why virginity?

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.580 align:middle line:90%


00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:19.660 align:middle line:84%
For a woman to give birth
to a certain type of being--

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:25.660 align:middle line:84%
this kind of star being, let's
say, for simplicity's sake--

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.200 align:middle line:84%
she needs to retain the
purity of her womb space.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And there is something about the
entry of a male into the womb

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.830 align:middle line:84%
space that disrupts
that particular thing.

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:38.659 align:middle line:90%
It's fine--

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It adds another
energetic imprint.

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:41.850 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: It adds
another energetic imprint.

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:45.062 align:middle line:84%
It's fine for conceiving the
way most people conceive.

00:08:45.062 --> 00:08:46.520 align:middle line:84%
So there's nothing
wrong with that.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.982 align:middle line:84%
It's not like that's
an impure act.

00:08:47.982 --> 00:08:50.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you're trying
to keep a pure bloodline,

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:51.040 align:middle line:90%
in this case.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.030 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah.

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:54.790 align:middle line:84%
And you're trying to keep
the woman's integrity

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:59.350 align:middle line:84%
and connection with Divine
Sophia, as we might call her.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:03.190 align:middle line:84%
Strict feminine divine
consciousness, right?

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And if you bring a male
into that, it switches it.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:10.000 align:middle line:84%
So the virginity has to be
there for energetic purposes

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.570 align:middle line:84%
and for the vibration of the
being that can be incarnated.

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:16.113 align:middle line:90%
That is what that was all about.

00:09:16.113 --> 00:09:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these
priestesshoods,

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:21.160 align:middle line:84%
in Ancient Greece and
elsewhere, required the women

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.070 align:middle line:84%
and the girls to be virgins,
because they were conducting

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:26.890 align:middle line:90%
all sorts of divine powers.

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:30.130 align:middle line:84%
And they could not
have that introduction

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:33.020 align:middle line:84%
of the element into their space
while they were doing that.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:36.790 align:middle line:84%
So most of the Greek
priestesses were virgins.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Or if they came into
a priestesshood,

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:41.270 align:middle line:84%
like later at Delphi, they
had to become celibate.

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:42.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:43.810 align:middle line:84%
That's what I was just
going to bring up, Delphi.

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:44.830 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:47.408 align:middle line:84%
So it was important to,
again, maintain one's

00:09:47.408 --> 00:09:48.950 align:middle line:84%
energies and their
direct connection,

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.080 align:middle line:84%
and not have it dissipated
through relationships

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:51.880 align:middle line:90%
with others.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:52.797 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Exactly.

00:09:52.797 --> 00:09:56.880 align:middle line:84%
But that became used, of course,
later as a sign of moral purity

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.950 align:middle line:84%
that was then
impressed and forced

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:02.620 align:middle line:90%
on all girls and all women.

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:05.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's not what
it's meant to do.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:06.520 align:middle line:90%
It was a tool.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Interestingly--
this is off-topic,

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.420 align:middle line:84%
but on, because you
brought that up.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.770 align:middle line:84%
There is a movement
happening right now--

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:18.130 align:middle line:84%
and there was
apparently a congress

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:20.290 align:middle line:84%
of people gathering--
where young women

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:23.530 align:middle line:84%
in strict Christian faiths
are leaving their faiths.

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:25.690 align:middle line:10%
And a big part of it
is because they're

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:30.700 align:middle line:10%
tired of having that kind of
morality imposed upon them

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:34.720 align:middle line:10%
but not the husbands, of having
to literally allow the male

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:35.950 align:middle line:10%
to have dominance over them.

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And they're bucking
that saying, we

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:39.890 align:middle line:84%
don't want to live
that tradition anymore.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:42.210 align:middle line:84%
We don't feel that's
our truth anymore.

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's a fairly sizable
movement occurring right now.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:46.060 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And yes, of course,
many people will not

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:52.870 align:middle line:84%
want the virginity
requirement imposed on them.

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:57.310 align:middle line:84%
I think that understanding
what the virginity is really

00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:01.240 align:middle line:84%
all about is it allows
women to make clearer

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:05.380 align:middle line:84%
choices about if they want
to go into a certain kind

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:09.700 align:middle line:84%
of a spiritual path, they can
willingly embrace the virginity

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.130 align:middle line:84%
without feeling like
they absolutely have to

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:13.390 align:middle line:90%
for moral purity reasons.

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:16.180 align:middle line:84%
But rather, they're doing it for
a certain energetic holy womb

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:22.420 align:middle line:84%
chakra reason, whereas
women who do not want that

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:24.350 align:middle line:90%
do not have to go there.

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And they can still
be just as holy.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.130 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there's
a whole tantric,

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:33.820 align:middle line:84%
you know, divine sexuality with
men path that's just as holy,

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:35.620 align:middle line:90%
but it's just a different thing.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.020 align:middle line:84%
So we're getting clear
now with this work

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:42.370 align:middle line:84%
about what virginity is,
why, and how and where it

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:44.420 align:middle line:84%
does and doesn't need
to be imposed on women.

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:45.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.095 align:middle line:84%
And this practice did
run through bloodlines.

00:11:47.095 --> 00:11:49.308 align:middle line:84%
This is all over in
all these traditions.

00:11:49.308 --> 00:11:50.350 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Definitely.

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:52.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about a few of them,

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:53.710 align:middle line:84%
which you've mentioned
in your book.

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And one of them
had to do-- well,

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:58.870 align:middle line:84%
you talked about Sarah,
who conceived Isaac

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:01.220 align:middle line:90%
as quite an elderly woman.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.020 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.100 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Right.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And see, that's also something
that I'm starting to realize,

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:11.770 align:middle line:84%
that the concept of
elderly was very different.

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:12.970 align:middle line:90%
There is a whole continuum.

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:16.930 align:middle line:84%
Because what I'm discovering
is that the women who

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:19.060 align:middle line:84%
were in this virgin
birth practice

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.820 align:middle line:84%
may never have been
menstruating from day one,

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:24.040 align:middle line:84%
because they were on
a purification diet.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.207 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which ceased that,
ceased the whole cycle.

00:12:26.207 --> 00:12:27.790 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Ceased
the menstruation.

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:30.940 align:middle line:84%
Because menstruation is
used to purify the system.

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:32.830 align:middle line:84%
When you already
have a pure diet,

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:35.360 align:middle line:84%
you don't need to
purify the system.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.665 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They lived more
ascetic lives, in that sense.

00:12:37.665 --> 00:12:39.040 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: More
ascetic lives.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:39.840 align:middle line:90%
so.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.080 align:middle line:90%
There was this continuum.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.450 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like, oh, these
girls were menstruating,

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:44.890 align:middle line:84%
and then they
stopped menstruating

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:47.830 align:middle line:84%
and now these older women
are somehow conceiving.

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:50.440 align:middle line:84%
It's that this
purification was happening

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.510 align:middle line:90%
throughout their lives.

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:55.330 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost as though it
was a seamless into elderhood.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:58.660 align:middle line:84%
So these women could
still conceive into what

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:01.330 align:middle line:90%
we consider elderhood.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it took the
women the whole lifetime

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:07.370 align:middle line:90%
to be able to get there.

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:09.940 align:middle line:90%
So that's where we have Sarah.

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:12.520 align:middle line:84%
That's where we have
Mary's mother, Anne.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.950 align:middle line:84%
That's where we have their
relative Elizabeth, who

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:16.750 align:middle line:90%
conceived John the Baptist.

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:18.250 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:21.430 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it took a very,
very long time for them

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:22.570 align:middle line:90%
to achieve it.

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And their partners were
never conjugal husbands.

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:27.610 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:31.150 align:middle line:84%
So Abraham, my research
shows that Abraham was not

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:33.620 align:middle line:90%
the conjugal husband of Sarah.

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:36.580 align:middle line:84%
Joakim was not the
conjugal husband of Anne.

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And Joseph was not the conjugal
husband, at least initially,

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:40.870 align:middle line:90%
of Mary.

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:43.930 align:middle line:84%
They were guardians,
sacred guardians

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:46.000 align:middle line:84%
who would support
them energetically

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.750 align:middle line:84%
in their role of divine
birth priestess, essentially.

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:51.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And with Mary, which we'll
get into a little bit later,

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.460 align:middle line:84%
she did end up having a
normal life, normal relations,

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:58.690 align:middle line:90%
and other children as well.

00:13:58.690 --> 00:13:59.410 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yes, later.

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:01.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We'll get
into that in a bit.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:05.260 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
Daoism and Lao Su.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:10.990 align:middle line:84%
His mother, Lao, apparently was
impregnated after witnessing

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:12.220 align:middle line:90%
a falling star?

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:13.090 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah.

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:13.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:17.837 align:middle line:84%
There are these
types of little codes

00:14:17.837 --> 00:14:19.420 align:middle line:84%
that, when I started
looking at these,

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:22.900 align:middle line:84%
I realized, OK, this is
a divine birth story.

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.040 align:middle line:84%
Witnessing a falling
star-- in other words,

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.920 align:middle line:84%
she was opening her
vessel to receive

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.710 align:middle line:84%
this star being, probably
because she was trained.

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:31.750 align:middle line:84%
But that's the part of
the story we don't hear,

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:32.860 align:middle line:90%
that she was trained.

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:36.700 align:middle line:84%
We barely hear what her name
is, and it focuses on the child.

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And so what's happening
now is the resurrection

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.770 align:middle line:90%
of the women in these practices.

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:43.750 align:middle line:90%
Zoroaster, same thing.

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.100 align:middle line:90%
His mother drank soma.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:47.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Soma, yes.

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:48.160 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: OK?

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And that means she was
using a ritual medicine

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.650 align:middle line:90%
to open her consciousness.

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And probably all these women
were using ritual medicines

00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:59.590 align:middle line:84%
to get to the requisite
state where they could start

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:02.860 align:middle line:84%
communicating with the star
beings that were helping,

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:04.990 align:middle line:84%
the angel Gabriel's,
so to speak,

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:06.940 align:middle line:84%
that were helping
with this process.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:10.090 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
other stories like this.

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, when you say
the notion of a falling star,

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.783 align:middle line:84%
was that metaphorical
for a being?

00:15:14.783 --> 00:15:15.700 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: A being.

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, of course.

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:21.268 align:middle line:84%
But to her consciousness it
appeared as a falling star.

00:15:21.268 --> 00:15:22.810 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: And
to the people later

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:25.690 align:middle line:84%
who were writing that
down, that's what they

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:27.060 align:middle line:90%
could make sense of, right?

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:28.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And so on this planet,
on Earth, you also

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:33.910 align:middle line:84%
chronicle that there
have been species--

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:37.660 align:middle line:84%
most of them seem to fall
into the reptile species--

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:40.300 align:middle line:84%
of creatures that have been
able to self-replicate.

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.020 align:middle line:84%
So it's not unknown
of on this planet.

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:43.280 align:middle line:90%
It is within other species.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.080 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.420 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, you hear
of-- especially when

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:47.860 align:middle line:90%
they're in captivity--

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.150 align:middle line:90%
snakes, sharks--

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Stressed.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.530 align:middle line:84%
Extremely stressed and
unable to reproduce normally.

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:55.370 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah,
you hear that.

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And then there have
been scientific studies

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.780 align:middle line:84%
that have induced
parthenogenesis in rabbits,

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:04.960 align:middle line:90%
in sea urchins, in mice.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:11.260 align:middle line:84%
And I had spoken to a researcher
where his mouse experiment--

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:15.070 align:middle line:84%
where he instigated the
meiosis of the mouse egg

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:20.475 align:middle line:84%
through chemicals and put them
back into the mice mothers,

00:16:20.475 --> 00:16:21.850 align:middle line:84%
the National
Institutes of Health

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:23.570 align:middle line:90%
shut that experiment down.

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:24.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:25.500 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:26.450 align:middle line:90%
Presumably for ethical--

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:27.533 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Too challenging.

00:16:27.533 --> 00:16:32.525 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, too challenging to our
tightly held belief systems.

00:16:32.525 --> 00:16:33.400 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Mm-hmm.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.998 align:middle line:84%
But I know women who have
had miraculous births.

00:16:36.998 --> 00:16:39.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You wrote about
one of them in the book

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.810 align:middle line:84%
too that another
man had chronicled.

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:43.820 align:middle line:84%
So talk about that
one, for example.

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:44.620 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah.

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:50.800 align:middle line:84%
So this woman, whose pseudonym
is Laurie, back in 1976,

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.920 align:middle line:84%
believe it or not, on
Christmas Eve she--

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.350 align:middle line:84%
now, she had been doing
all of these practices.

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:57.610 align:middle line:90%
She was a Breatharian.

00:16:57.610 --> 00:16:59.740 align:middle line:84%
She was a deeply,
deeply spiritual woman.

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:01.990 align:middle line:84%
This didn't all of a sudden
just happen to her walking

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:04.030 align:middle line:90%
down the street, right?

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:08.200 align:middle line:84%
She experienced a flash of light
and a messenger telling her

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.710 align:middle line:90%
that she was pregnant.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:11.470 align:middle line:90%
And indeed, she was pregnant.

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:12.640 align:middle line:90%
It was verified medically.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:17.200 align:middle line:84%
It was verified by a Hopi
elder that she went to.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.290 align:middle line:90%
There's a whole story.

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:21.250 align:middle line:84%
It's Den Poitras who writes
about it in his book called

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:22.599 align:middle line:90%
"Parthenogenesis."

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:24.819 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing, amazing story.

00:17:24.819 --> 00:17:27.410 align:middle line:84%
But the child was only
able to live three months.

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- there's another
child that I know that also

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.200 align:middle line:90%
died early.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.897 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why do
you think that is?

00:17:33.897 --> 00:17:35.480 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: A few
different reasons.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:39.670 align:middle line:84%
I think the vibration of the
planet can't hold it yet.

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:43.670 align:middle line:84%
I also do think that there
are eyes on these children,

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:51.020 align:middle line:84%
and they get noticed,
and they get taken out.

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:52.030 align:middle line:90%
So that's the thing.

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:54.820 align:middle line:84%
There needs to be a lot of
protection around this process

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:56.720 align:middle line:90%
when it does happen.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's why,
as we may discuss,

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.700 align:middle line:84%
Mary had a retinue
of virgin priestesses

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:02.230 align:middle line:90%
that were around her.

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:06.010 align:middle line:84%
The basilinna in
ancient Athens, who

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:09.670 align:middle line:84%
would have sex with
Dionysus and presumably

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:12.130 align:middle line:84%
give birth to his
child, was surrounded

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:17.950 align:middle line:84%
by 14 gerara, these sacred
elder women who held the space.

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:21.970 align:middle line:84%
These women weren't
just doing it alone.

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:25.090 align:middle line:84%
There was a retinue
around them of protection,

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:28.990 align:middle line:84%
because we know what's
going on in this realm

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:31.055 align:middle line:84%
with all of the
attacks on the planet.

00:18:31.055 --> 00:18:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And so of course,
they're going to be--

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Especially to those
that are particularly advanced.

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:38.320 align:middle line:84%
So let's go into an area
that a lot of our viewers

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:42.490 align:middle line:84%
are already familiar with
and get your understanding

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:46.030 align:middle line:84%
behind it, which is the
Nephilim, the whole notion

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:48.700 align:middle line:84%
of the daughters
of men procreating

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:51.910 align:middle line:84%
with the gods and the species
of giants that followed.

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And the notion of
giants have been

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:55.630 align:middle line:90%
chronicled around the world.

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:58.060 align:middle line:84%
These are physical
beings that existed.

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:00.210 align:middle line:84%
They existed in the
days of Atlantis.

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:02.270 align:middle line:90%
They emigrated to other places.

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And so they're commonly
chronicled, even

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:09.250 align:middle line:84%
in the United States and
Asia, Europe, all over.

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:10.160 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yes.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:10.960 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:13.540 align:middle line:84%
So I will talk
about the Nephilim

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.360 align:middle line:90%
and that whole situation.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:20.140 align:middle line:84%
On the continuum is something
that your listeners will also

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:27.010 align:middle line:84%
be interested in, which
is the alien impregnations

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:28.720 align:middle line:90%
and implantations.

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:34.630 align:middle line:84%
That is on this same continuum
of human sexual relations,

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:39.070 align:middle line:84%
or abductions or rapes, by
interdimensional beings.

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:43.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And in some cases,
by their own cooperation.

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.790 align:middle line:84%
I won't name her name, but I've
interviewed one woman who's

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:48.940 align:middle line:84%
well-known who states she
had a relationship with,

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:51.830 align:middle line:90%
in her case, a reptilian being.

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:52.690 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: OK.

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:53.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And they had a
full-on relationship,

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:59.230 align:middle line:84%
just kind of phased
off this reality from--

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:02.833 align:middle line:84%
so it seems to have every
single story around this.

00:20:02.833 --> 00:20:04.750 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yes because
some of these beings

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:06.830 align:middle line:84%
can be what we would
consider friendly there

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:10.820 align:middle line:84%
is a whole history
of spirit marriage.

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:11.620 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:12.987 align:middle line:90%
And some are not friendly.

00:20:12.987 --> 00:20:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And some, it's willing,
and some it isn't willing.

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:16.930 align:middle line:84%
But to go back to
the Nephilim, these

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:21.510 align:middle line:84%
are seared essentially
the children, the products

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:25.710 align:middle line:84%
of these women being
impregnated by what

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:29.730 align:middle line:84%
were called the Watchers, or
these angelic beings who were,

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:31.110 align:middle line:90%
quote, as high as the heavens.

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
they were giants.

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They were
literally overseeing

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:39.130 align:middle line:84%
the development of the human
species and the other kingdoms

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:39.930 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:42.450 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: And what
happened is they really

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:43.682 align:middle line:90%
liked the female women.

00:20:43.682 --> 00:20:44.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Some of them.

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:45.360 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Some of them.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:45.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They had a split.

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:46.710 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: OK.

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:47.940 align:middle line:90%
They had a split, right?

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:50.216 align:middle line:84%
The negative ones
were like, hmm,

00:20:50.216 --> 00:20:53.880 align:middle line:84%
they're looking
pretty attractive.

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.630 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to start getting
into the sexual activity

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:57.430 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:00.090 align:middle line:84%
So what they would do-- and this
is in the Testament of Reuben,

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:02.580 align:middle line:84%
which is one of these
Testament of the 12 Patriarchs.

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:06.300 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of-- no
one is really sure

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:08.370 align:middle line:84%
whether this is part of
the Hebrew tradition,

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:10.495 align:middle line:84%
whether it was made up by
the Christians, whatever.

00:21:10.495 --> 00:21:14.190 align:middle line:84%
But these are supposed
to be the sons

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:17.310 align:middle line:84%
of Jacob in their last words and
their teachings and everything.

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:18.900 align:middle line:84%
So in the Testament
of Reuben, it

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:21.810 align:middle line:90%
talks about how the Watchers--

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:23.850 align:middle line:90%
before the flood, I believe--

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:25.410 align:middle line:84%
they would see
these human women,

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:26.970 align:middle line:84%
and they would see
these human women

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:29.100 align:middle line:84%
having sexual relations
with their husbands

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:30.850 align:middle line:90%
and their partners.

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And these negative
ones were saying, wow,

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:34.620 align:middle line:90%
that looks pretty juicy.

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:36.960 align:middle line:84%
So they would get
in there, and they

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.230 align:middle line:84%
would get into the thought
forms of the woman.

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:41.550 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:44.760 align:middle line:84%
This is relevant, because this
is exactly how the gods would

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.700 align:middle line:84%
seduce, rape the
priestesses who would

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:51.710 align:middle line:84%
be right in the middle of a
virgin birth conception ritual.

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:53.310 align:middle line:90%
It was a similar thing.

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:54.960 align:middle line:90%
The woman would be having sex.

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:58.230 align:middle line:84%
These Watchers would
make themselves

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:01.590 align:middle line:84%
into a very attractive
human male image.

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:03.030 align:middle line:90%
And the woman is getting--

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:04.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And project
that into her mind?

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:06.088 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Project
that into her mind.

00:22:06.088 --> 00:22:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And the woman is starting
to get seduced and attracted

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:10.770 align:middle line:90%
by this image.

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:13.170 align:middle line:84%
It's akin to when
a person is having

00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:15.870 align:middle line:84%
sexual relations with someone
and starts fantasizing

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:16.745 align:middle line:90%
about another person.

00:22:16.745 --> 00:22:17.545 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:22:17.545 --> 00:22:19.140 align:middle line:84%
Kind of a hopped-up
desire happening.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:20.220 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: All right.

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And so these women would
end up having astral sex

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:25.740 align:middle line:90%
with the image--

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:28.500 align:middle line:84%
in other words,
with the Watcher.

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And the telltale sign
of this, and the fact

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:34.920 align:middle line:84%
that the pregnancy had come
from the Watcher and not

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:37.530 align:middle line:84%
the husband, is
that the children

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:42.210 align:middle line:84%
would be the Nephilim,
who were tall as giants.

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:45.910 align:middle line:84%
So that's how these Nephilim
literally got onto the planet

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:46.710 align:middle line:90%
then.

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:49.252 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it wasn't
by physical congress?

00:22:49.252 --> 00:22:50.960 align:middle line:10%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Not with
those particular--

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.377 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It was through this
projected energetic imprint,

00:22:53.377 --> 00:22:55.500 align:middle line:10%
which was a very
strong one, that

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.970 align:middle line:10%
actually affected the genetics?

00:22:57.970 --> 00:22:58.770 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yes.

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:02.640 align:middle line:84%
A holographic,
high-tech way of getting

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:03.780 align:middle line:90%
involved in the sex act.

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:06.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So did most of
these women die in birth?

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:06.900 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:07.980 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: No,
they were able to--

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:09.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How could--

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.650 align:middle line:90%
I never understood this part.

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:12.990 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
conflicting parts.

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:14.887 align:middle line:90%
To give birth to a giant as a--

00:23:14.887 --> 00:23:15.720 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Right.

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.550 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, what I'm
getting right now

00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:20.550 align:middle line:90%
is that it was still a baby.

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:22.410 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't a giant
till it grew up.

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:23.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:26.770 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't a larger
proportioned being as a baby?

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:27.570 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: No.

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:28.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: That's what
I'm being shown right now.

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:31.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:33.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
where the Nephilim--

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:34.320 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: That's where
the Nephilim come from.

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:34.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
your information

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:35.610 align:middle line:90%
on where it came from.

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:36.410 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah.

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And then these big
Nephilim would be walking

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:40.710 align:middle line:90%
around the planet like that.

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And in what
you've read and been shown,

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:48.810 align:middle line:84%
did they possess certain levels
of knowledge and abilities

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:50.760 align:middle line:84%
beyond the normal
human at that time?

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:51.760 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: The women?

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:52.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, the Nephilim.

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.410 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: The Nephilim.

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:54.478 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The offspring.

00:23:54.478 --> 00:23:55.770 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah, they would.

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:59.870 align:middle line:84%
They would possess the
information of the Watchers.

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:00.930 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:03.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, if though the
Watchers were negative,

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:10.303 align:middle line:84%
basically essentially doing an
unethical act in intermingling

00:24:10.303 --> 00:24:12.720 align:middle line:84%
with humans-- because there
were injunctions against this,

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.980 align:middle line:90%
as we know--

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:17.280 align:middle line:84%
the Nephilim were also
getting that energy frequency

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.660 align:middle line:90%
of those particular Watchers.

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:19.500 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:23.790 align:middle line:84%
So they were having both
elevated knowledge, and then

00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:25.795 align:middle line:90%
shady aspects.

00:24:25.795 --> 00:24:26.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, yeah.

00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:29.410 align:middle line:84%
They would have hybridized
bodies and hybridized knowledge

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:30.210 align:middle line:90%
bases.

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:30.870 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Exactly.

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:32.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they
would appear to be

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:35.970 align:middle line:84%
kind of those gods among
men on one level, which

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:40.230 align:middle line:84%
also had the detrimental effect
of dismantling the matriarchy.

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:41.220 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: It did.

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And there are-- so to
switch over specifically

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:48.690 align:middle line:84%
from talking about the
Nephilim to these other beings,

00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:55.920 align:middle line:84%
in the Greek tradition you have
Theseus, Perseus, and Heracles

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:59.100 align:middle line:84%
All were divinely born
through rape seductions

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:05.040 align:middle line:84%
by Zeus into their mothers'
divine birth rites.

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And so these sons of
the god were born.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And they had tremendous
powers, Theseus, Perseus--

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:16.800 align:middle line:84%
and also, we'll throw in there
a historical one, Alexander

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.450 align:middle line:90%
the Great.

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:22.350 align:middle line:84%
His mother Olympias
had sex with Zeus-Amun

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:25.740 align:middle line:84%
in his form of the
Egyptian serpent being.

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:26.820 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:29.460 align:middle line:10%
These beings would have
supernatural powers,

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:33.420 align:middle line:10%
because always, children
born in a divine sort of way

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:36.720 align:middle line:10%
would have elevated powers.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:42.780 align:middle line:84%
But if the condition of the
pregnancy and the condition

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:46.020 align:middle line:84%
of the male being doing it and
the condition of the female

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:48.720 align:middle line:84%
were not of the
highest-level vibration,

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:53.160 align:middle line:84%
as in the case was with
Mary, then the being,

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:56.910 align:middle line:84%
again, would be of an
ambiguous, ambivalent kind

00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:59.700 align:middle line:90%
of characterisation.

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And so you have Hercules,
who went about dismantling

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:07.380 align:middle line:90%
through all of his 12 labors--

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:12.810 align:middle line:84%
almost each one I write
about in Virgin Mother

00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:14.880 align:middle line:90%
Goddesses of Antiquity--

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:17.700 align:middle line:84%
was dismantling the
matriarchy, or women.

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:21.630 align:middle line:84%
Perseus was forced
to cut the head off

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:25.320 align:middle line:84%
of Medusa, who was a
virgin birth priestess.

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And Theseus seduced Helen,
and essentially abducted her

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:36.060 align:middle line:90%
before Paris ever even did.

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:40.840 align:middle line:84%
So there are many, many problems
with these beings coming on.

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:44.730 align:middle line:84%
So what was once a practice
to elevate humanity,

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:48.030 align:middle line:84%
get it back to its original
blueprint, of course,

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:51.510 align:middle line:84%
started getting
infiltrated and used desire

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:57.540 align:middle line:84%
to foment the very patriarchy
that the tradition was

00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:01.290 align:middle line:90%
originally started to address.

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And so then you have this
continuous development

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:09.180 align:middle line:84%
of patriarchy until the
divine birth priestesshoods

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:15.730 align:middle line:84%
just become nuns, without
even the technology

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:19.230 align:middle line:90%
knowledge of how to give birth.

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:24.640 align:middle line:84%
The vestal virgins,
their womb power

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:27.130 align:middle line:84%
becomes siphoned
off to fuel Rome.

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Their wombs and the fire of
Rome were the same thing.

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:31.240 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:34.420 align:middle line:84%
So their yoni power,
their holy womb power

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:40.480 align:middle line:84%
was being used to fuel the
whole reptilian Roman Empire.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.880 align:middle line:84%
In secret, which
is something I'm

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:45.580 align:middle line:84%
going to be that I write
about in "The Mystery

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:49.450 align:middle line:84%
Tradition of
Miraculous Conception,"

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:52.030 align:middle line:84%
they were having
sexual relations

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:54.690 align:middle line:84%
and giving birth
to other leaders.

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:55.490 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And we only know that through
two of the rogue emperors who

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:01.270 align:middle line:90%
let that slip.

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:04.690 align:middle line:84%
But that was a very,
very occult piece

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:06.850 align:middle line:84%
that they were doing
behind the scenes.

00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:09.340 align:middle line:84%
But then after that, you
get the Catholic nuns,

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:13.480 align:middle line:84%
who are completely cut
off from womb power.

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And they are strictly
virgins, bless their hearts.

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:17.530 align:middle line:90%
And this is not at all--

00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:19.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Dedicated
to their father.

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:20.697 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Dedicated
to their father.

00:28:20.697 --> 00:28:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And this is not to
insult nuns, who

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:25.960 align:middle line:84%
do many, many beautiful and
important things in the world.

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:29.170 align:middle line:84%
But it's just to
suggest that there

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:32.110 align:middle line:84%
has been a very
great disempowerment

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:33.970 align:middle line:90%
of their lineages.

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:35.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:37.960 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to
something that we

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:40.510 align:middle line:84%
were kind of touching
in when you were talking

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:44.110 align:middle line:84%
about Anne giving birth to Mary,
Mary giving birth to Jesus.

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:49.270 align:middle line:84%
And that is mother-daughter
twinning, which is interesting.

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And it even mentions
in some texts

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:57.350 align:middle line:84%
where Mary gave
birth to herself.

00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:58.150 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Oh.

00:28:58.150 --> 00:28:59.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's interesting.

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.390 align:middle line:90%
I can share that with you later.

00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:00.940 align:middle line:90%
But go ahead.

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:01.360 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah, cool.

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.152 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about this twinning

00:29:03.152 --> 00:29:05.290 align:middle line:84%
and this possibility
of using the mind

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:06.770 align:middle line:90%
to be able to replicate.

00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:07.570 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah.

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:11.290 align:middle line:84%
So this is the original
type of parthenogenesis,

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:15.640 align:middle line:84%
and some would say the original
type of reproduction of humans

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:17.080 align:middle line:90%
to begin with.

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:18.610 align:middle line:84%
That is a very
esoteric thing that

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:21.130 align:middle line:90%
probably goes back to Lamuria.

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:26.500 align:middle line:84%
How did we originate
reproduction?

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:29.260 align:middle line:84%
Were we a female-female-female
only line?

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:31.400 align:middle line:84%
There are teachers
who talk about there.

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There are some
esoteric ancient texts

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:36.640 align:middle line:90%
that say we were neither.

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:37.570 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Right.

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:39.195 align:middle line:84%
But it was a kind of
self-replication--

00:29:39.195 --> 00:29:40.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We were androgynous.

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:42.790 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO:
Self-replicating androgyny.

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And then once the
sex is split, it

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:49.160 align:middle line:84%
became a self-replicating
feminine twinning.

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:49.960 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:54.460 align:middle line:84%
So parthenogenesis,
female-wise--

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:58.000 align:middle line:84%
because a woman's eggs
are all individual--

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.580 align:middle line:84%
they're not an exact
replica of the mother--

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:03.220 align:middle line:90%


00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:05.320 align:middle line:84%
parthenogenesis of
one of those eggs

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:08.530 align:middle line:84%
is not an exact
twinning of the woman.

00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:13.930 align:middle line:84%
But it's energetically felt
as one, felt as a twinning.

00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:16.450 align:middle line:84%
So you have the Demeter
and Persephone story,

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:19.490 align:middle line:84%
where Persephone-- if we take
Zeus out of the equation,

00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:22.480 align:middle line:84%
which probably was the case
in the original story--

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:25.720 align:middle line:84%
Demeter is self-replicating
herself into Persephone.

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And Persephone was getting
ready to self-replicate herself

00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:31.690 align:middle line:84%
when Hades came into it
and raped her, you see?

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:34.060 align:middle line:90%
And then gave birth to Dionysus.

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:38.420 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about a
female-female-female line.

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And so with Anne, the mother
of Mary, as we find out

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:46.780 align:middle line:84%
in what's called "The
Infancy Gospel of James,"

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:50.190 align:middle line:84%
which is what I base
my book on, it's

00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:56.320 align:middle line:84%
a whole esoteric analysis
of that infancy gospel.

00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:00.250 align:middle line:84%
She would have been doing
that original practice

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:02.650 align:middle line:90%
of giving birth to herself.

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And it was coming
out as Mary, who

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:09.460 align:middle line:84%
is her own personality
but a replication

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:12.020 align:middle line:90%
of the great high Holy Sophia.

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:13.870 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:20.570 align:middle line:84%
That's where-- it's women
replicating the goddess energy.

00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now
we move to Mary.

00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:22.810 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:25.380 align:middle line:84%
And we'll spend our conversation
on Mary from this point

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:26.180 align:middle line:90%
forward.

00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:30.040 align:middle line:84%
So Mary, the way
you understand it,

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:34.270 align:middle line:84%
actually gave birth
to Jesus in a cave.

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah, that's
what that gospel tells us.

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:39.460 align:middle line:90%
Because they were in transit.

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:42.070 align:middle line:90%


00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:44.118 align:middle line:84%
She and Joseph were in
transit in the desert.

00:31:44.118 --> 00:31:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Apparently, there was
quite a few little challenges

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:47.680 align:middle line:90%
along the way in this journey.

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.120 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah, they
had a lot of different--

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:51.720 align:middle line:84%
we could spend forever on that,
but it will be in the book.

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right, right.

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:55.038 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: And they
went into a cave-- which

00:31:55.038 --> 00:31:58.090 align:middle line:84%
is, of course, the
original location of ritual

00:31:58.090 --> 00:32:01.840 align:middle line:84%
for humanity, for women, for
birthing rituals, for death

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:03.080 align:middle line:90%
rituals, and so forth.

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:05.980 align:middle line:90%
So yes, it was a cave.

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:07.060 align:middle line:90%
That's where it happened.

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And there were these
miraculous things

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:12.440 align:middle line:84%
that happened around a light
eminating from the cave,

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:16.640 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, and the witnessing
of two different midwives,

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.750 align:middle line:90%
and so forth, to the process.

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:20.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about--

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:24.200 align:middle line:84%
let's stick with Mary,
the vibration of the name

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:28.220 align:middle line:84%
Mary, and who Mary
was as a being,

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:32.270 align:middle line:90%
and her influence on her son.

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And let's just go into
the story of Mary.

00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:34.930 align:middle line:90%
Take it away.

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:36.080 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah.

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:40.280 align:middle line:84%
So Mary-- you know, one of
the very important teachings

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.650 align:middle line:84%
to have come in this
time in recent decades

00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:48.343 align:middle line:84%
is from Swami Sri Kaleshwar, who
is a now deceased Hindu saint.

00:32:48.343 --> 00:32:49.760 align:middle line:84%
But he brought
through information

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:53.030 align:middle line:84%
that was on the ancient palm
leaf manuscripts from India.

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And he also claimed to
have past life recall

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:59.090 align:middle line:90%
of being with the holy family.

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:01.250 align:middle line:84%
We also have information
coming through someone

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:03.680 align:middle line:84%
like Claire Heartsong,
where she channeled

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.020 align:middle line:84%
in her Anna, Grandmother
of Jesus book,

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:10.490 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, much, much
more about the holy family

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:13.140 align:middle line:84%
and who Mary was than
we have been given.

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:17.000 align:middle line:84%
I particularly like Sri
Kaleshwar's information,

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.720 align:middle line:84%
because it corresponds
with what I intuited

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:24.200 align:middle line:84%
from that gospel, the
infancy gospel of James,

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:26.990 align:middle line:84%
starting with her name,
the vibration of her name.

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:29.750 align:middle line:84%
It would have been
"Maryam" originally.

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:30.860 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And there is a scholar named
DM Murdoch who traces that

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:39.110 align:middle line:84%
to the word "meri" in
Egyptian, which basically

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:42.470 align:middle line:90%
meant love, divine love.

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:45.500 align:middle line:84%
So her name was all
about the beloved--

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:49.890 align:middle line:84%
the beloved one, the one who
loves, the one who is divine

00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:50.690 align:middle line:90%
love.

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:53.840 align:middle line:84%
So right off the bat,
we have that name,

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:56.510 align:middle line:90%
which became a priestess title.

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:59.320 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have all of
these Marys running around.

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:03.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, even in
Egyptian history, Meritaten,

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:04.560 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:05.360 align:middle line:90%
It runs throughout.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.277 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Exactly.

00:34:06.277 --> 00:34:08.449 align:middle line:84%
It was a title related
also to Isis, who was

00:34:08.449 --> 00:34:10.550 align:middle line:90%
a previous incarnation of Mary.

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:12.210 align:middle line:84%
Mary had many,
many incarnations.

00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:13.010 align:middle line:90%
That's the thing.

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:15.770 align:middle line:84%
Sri Kaleshwar said she had
millions of incarnations

00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:18.560 align:middle line:84%
before she was able to
perfect herself and go

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:23.420 align:middle line:84%
into the final lifetime that
she had for her ascension.

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:28.639 align:middle line:84%
And just as Jesus was able
to help people release

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:34.130 align:middle line:84%
a whole bunch of karma by
his sacrificial death, Mary,

00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:37.070 align:middle line:84%
through all of the processes
that she went through,

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:40.587 align:middle line:84%
is enabling people to
ascend much more quickly.

00:34:40.587 --> 00:34:42.170 align:middle line:84%
Now people are not
going to have to go

00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:44.750 align:middle line:84%
through a million lifetimes
like she did in order

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:47.690 align:middle line:84%
to experience their ascension--
or what I call their incension,

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:49.969 align:middle line:84%
because it's an
interior process.

00:34:49.969 --> 00:34:54.949 align:middle line:84%
So she was very learned
through lifetimes and lifetimes

00:34:54.949 --> 00:34:56.210 align:middle line:90%
of study.

00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And in this lifetime, the
one we know of her as Mary,

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:03.600 align:middle line:84%
Kaleshwar talks about--
and she had a protocol.

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.810 align:middle line:90%
She would sleep from 11 to 2 AM.

00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:08.060 align:middle line:84%
From 2 to 3, she
would be meditating.

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:10.670 align:middle line:84%
From 3 to 5, she would
be talking to the angels,

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:11.580 align:middle line:90%
channeling.

00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:12.380 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:14.210 align:middle line:90%
Every day of her life.

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And she was doing
these mantra practices.

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:20.330 align:middle line:84%
And she was working with
sacred symbols, yantras.

00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:21.530 align:middle line:90%
This was part of it.

00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:24.890 align:middle line:84%
It was a whole
program that she was

00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:27.530 align:middle line:84%
involved in in this
lifetime, which is also

00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:28.850 align:middle line:90%
available to women today.

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And I've been going
through that process.

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:33.140 align:middle line:84%
It's a mantra
purification process

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:34.610 align:middle line:90%
of your holy womb chakra.

00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:37.340 align:middle line:84%
So we're not just talking
about history here

00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:41.070 align:middle line:84%
and, oh, great for Mary, but
what about the rest of us?

00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:41.870 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:44.180 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that's applicable.

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And that is why
it's awakening now,

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:49.190 align:middle line:84%
because we are in this
very intense time where

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:52.040 align:middle line:84%
we're moving into fifth
dimensional consciousness.

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.990 align:middle line:90%
We have the capacity.

00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And we can start accelerating
very, very quickly.

00:35:57.690 --> 00:35:59.820 align:middle line:84%
So she was an extremely
learned woman.

00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:01.130 align:middle line:90%
She was a very open channel.

00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:01.950 align:middle line:90%
She was a prophet.

00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:03.050 align:middle line:90%
She was a healer.

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:04.190 align:middle line:90%
She was a teacher.

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:06.740 align:middle line:84%
She was the main teacher
of the whole Christed

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:09.480 align:middle line:84%
enterprise during Jesus's
life and afterward.

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:14.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you say she was
really his primary teacher

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:15.470 align:middle line:90%
was his mother.

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:16.270 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yes.

00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:17.640 align:middle line:90%
They were soulmates.

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:20.750 align:middle line:84%
Sri Kaleshwar uses, that
exact term, soulmates.

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And I find that so
beautiful, because a soulmate

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.520 align:middle line:90%
can be many different things.

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.850 align:middle line:84%
But it's just a deep,
deep soul connection.

00:36:28.850 --> 00:36:31.610 align:middle line:84%
They were not married
or having any kind

00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:33.350 align:middle line:90%
of relationship like that.

00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:35.060 align:middle line:90%
That was for Mary Magdalene, OK?

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:37.250 align:middle line:84%
He was also soulmated
with Mary Magdalene.

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you
also say that she was

00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:40.370 align:middle line:90%
a teacher to Mary Magdalene.

00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:41.440 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: She was a
teacher to Mary Magdalene.

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:43.023 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So talk
about that relation.

00:36:43.023 --> 00:36:44.060 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah.

00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:47.510 align:middle line:90%
In a book by Maximus--

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:48.635 align:middle line:90%
it's attributed to Maximus.

00:36:48.635 --> 00:36:50.177 align:middle line:84%
It's called "The
Life of the Virgin."

00:36:50.177 --> 00:36:51.344 align:middle line:90%
That's an apocryphal gospel.

00:36:51.344 --> 00:36:53.719 align:middle line:84%
These are all apocryphal,
meaning they've been thrown out

00:36:53.719 --> 00:36:54.920 align:middle line:90%
by the Catholic church.

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:58.940 align:middle line:84%
But we find out that she
was Magdalene's teacher.

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:02.660 align:middle line:84%
She helped mentor Magdalene
to become one of the Apostles

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:05.000 align:middle line:90%
to become equal to Peter.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:05.870 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:08.810 align:middle line:90%
And she was also--

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:11.850 align:middle line:84%
so it's very clear
or in the writings

00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:20.180 align:middle line:84%
there that Magdalene
was learning from her.

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:21.060 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And Magdalene was being the
wife of Jesus, by one storyline.

00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:32.300 align:middle line:84%
That means that Mary
was her mother-in-law.

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:33.180 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:34.380 align:middle line:90%
So that's another thing.

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:35.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Mother-in-law
and teacher.

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:38.045 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah,
mother-in-law and teacher.

00:37:38.045 --> 00:37:39.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
in Sunday school,

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:40.710 align:middle line:90%
Mary Magdalene is a whore.

00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:42.085 align:middle line:84%
Come on, let's
get this straight.

00:37:42.085 --> 00:37:43.830 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Well,
you know, OK, so--

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:46.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have
had the awakening

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:50.905 align:middle line:84%
to Mary Magdalene over the
last several decades with all

00:37:50.905 --> 00:37:52.530 align:middle line:84%
these books that have
been coming out--

00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:54.040 align:middle line:84%
"The Da Vinci
Code," and so forth.

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:55.770 align:middle line:90%
So now this is Mary's time.

00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:58.020 align:middle line:84%
With this work that
I'm bringing forth,

00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:00.990 align:middle line:84%
essentially, we are
coming to understand her

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:04.920 align:middle line:84%
in a whole different way by
understanding her divine birth

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:09.060 align:middle line:84%
in a real way that intelligent
people can get with that

00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:11.500 align:middle line:90%
is explainable suddenly.

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That has
historical precedent.

00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:15.030 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yes.

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:17.940 align:middle line:84%
It's part of something that
was going on worldwide.

00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And also, by looking at her
apocryphal gospels to see who

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:24.030 align:middle line:84%
she really was, and then
hearing from channelers

00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:27.177 align:middle line:90%
like Sri Kaleshwar.

00:38:27.177 --> 00:38:29.010 align:middle line:84%
He wouldn't identify
himself as a channeler,

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:31.680 align:middle line:84%
but he was a prophet,
and he was a teacher.

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Claire Heartsong, and so
forth, and all of us--

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:39.030 align:middle line:84%
and you and me, and anyone who
starts tuning into Mother Mary.

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:40.020 align:middle line:90%
She is available.

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:44.100 align:middle line:84%
She is here as a very
high, holy, divine being.

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:47.040 align:middle line:84%
Because of all of her
lifetimes of work,

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:49.830 align:middle line:84%
she has been able to
ascend to full godesshood

00:38:49.830 --> 00:38:51.820 align:middle line:90%
on the other side.

00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And so every individual
can access her at any time.

00:38:56.430 --> 00:38:57.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
choose to do this

00:38:57.990 --> 00:39:00.960 align:middle line:84%
upon occasion, because you
have this strong resonance

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:02.010 align:middle line:90%
with Mary.

00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:02.310 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yes.

00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:03.685 align:middle line:84%
And I never thought
that I would.

00:39:03.685 --> 00:39:04.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, OK.

00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:08.130 align:middle line:84%
So we've been talking
off camera about some

00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:10.110 align:middle line:84%
of the events that have
happened in your life

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:12.210 align:middle line:90%
by calling upon this energy.

00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And one of them, I said
you have to share this

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:18.550 align:middle line:84%
when we're on camera,
because it's so literal.

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:19.350 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy.

00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:20.290 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: It's so literal.

00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:21.373 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's so literal.

00:39:21.373 --> 00:39:24.200 align:middle line:84%
So here you say you've
been house hunting, OK?

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:25.000 align:middle line:90%
House hunting.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.260 align:middle line:84%
You've looked at probably
100 houses by now, right?

00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:30.870 align:middle line:84%
Finally it's like,
please, Mother Mary,

00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:33.600 align:middle line:84%
would you please help
me find my abode?

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:35.130 align:middle line:90%
Please, please, please?

00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:36.750 align:middle line:90%
I want to find my home.

00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:38.727 align:middle line:90%
So you go through this process.

00:39:38.727 --> 00:39:39.810 align:middle line:90%
So you pick this story up.

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: And
give me a sign.

00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:42.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And give me a sign.

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:43.490 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:46.230 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: I always feel
guilty saying give me a sign,

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:47.310 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:49.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't like to test the
deities that way, you know?

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:50.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:51.540 align:middle line:84%
You just wanted reassurance
and validation--

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:52.998 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: I
wanted reassurance.

00:39:52.998 --> 00:39:54.480 align:middle line:90%
And I said it in a nice way.

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that you weren't
buying the wrong house.

00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:57.113 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Right.

00:39:57.113 --> 00:39:58.845 align:middle line:84%
And this, mind you,
is the third miracle.

00:39:58.845 --> 00:40:01.530 align:middle line:84%
So if we have time, we can talk
about the other two miracles

00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:01.840 align:middle line:90%
that I've had.

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:02.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We'll have a little
bit of time to do that.

00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:03.460 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
this one for a bit.

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: This
is the third miracle

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:06.190 align:middle line:90%
that has recently happened.

00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:09.780 align:middle line:84%
So you know, me with my
little modest amount of money

00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:12.420 align:middle line:90%
that I can do this for--

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:17.730 align:middle line:84%
I go into this one house, and
it's cute right off the bat.

00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:20.190 align:middle line:84%
It's a fairy house
on top of it all.

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:22.860 align:middle line:84%
It looks like a
little fairy house.

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:26.490 align:middle line:84%
So I notice-- the
long story short

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:28.320 align:middle line:84%
is that the realtor
ends up taking me

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.630 align:middle line:90%
into the woman's office.

00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, there's
a shrine there to Mary.

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:35.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:36.660 align:middle line:84%
Now this is in the
house you're looking

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:38.820 align:middle line:84%
in the house, which they
weren't even listing really.

00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: They
weren't even listing it.

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:41.418 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they
were nice enough

00:40:41.418 --> 00:40:43.270 align:middle line:84%
to show you the house
next door for sale.

00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:44.380 align:middle line:84%
So there were anomalies
to begin with.

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:45.140 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Anomalies.

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:45.940 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And so I walk in, and
there's basically a shrine

00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:51.060 align:middle line:90%
to Jesus with the Sacred Heart.

00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:52.140 align:middle line:90%
The Pieta is there.

00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:53.220 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, well, OK.

00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:55.932 align:middle line:84%
I didn't first get it with
the Pieta, even though I--

00:40:55.932 --> 00:40:57.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it's
relatively common,

00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:58.590 align:middle line:90%
if you're a Catholic.

00:40:58.590 --> 00:40:59.390 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah.

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:00.940 align:middle line:90%
But what is there?

00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:06.030 align:middle line:84%
A laminated prayer card
with Jesus and Mary,

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:09.720 align:middle line:84%
with the Sacred Heart, the
exact one that I have--

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:14.430 align:middle line:84%
the exact one that is my
traveling altar prayer

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:17.520 align:middle line:84%
card for years now,
and the only one

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:19.020 align:middle line:84%
that I took with
me on my writing

00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:21.580 align:middle line:90%
sabbatical in the last year.

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:23.460 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, ah.

00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:25.210 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:27.120 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:29.350 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, oh my goodness.

00:41:29.350 --> 00:41:32.000 align:middle line:90%
She wants me to live here.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.150 align:middle line:84%
It was a little farther
out than I thought.

00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:35.850 align:middle line:84%
But she wants me to
live in this house.

00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:36.990 align:middle line:90%
That's my clear sign.

00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:39.030 align:middle line:90%
And there were other signs.

00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:40.500 align:middle line:90%
The seller's name is Mary.

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:42.960 align:middle line:90%
She has a devotion to Mary.

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:46.657 align:middle line:84%
We start talking, and she didn't
even show it to anyone else.

00:41:46.657 --> 00:41:47.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:48.420 align:middle line:90%
And you have your home.

00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:49.080 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: I have my home.

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your cute
little home that you

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:51.270 align:middle line:90%
get to pour your love into.

00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:52.190 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yes, absolutely.

00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's miracle
number three, as you say.

00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:54.780 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO:
Miracle number three.

00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:56.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So lets you talk about
miracles number one and two.

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:57.240 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah.

00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And it is important,
because what

00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:01.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm calling the
Resurrection of Mary--

00:42:01.410 --> 00:42:03.840 align:middle line:84%
we need to know that she's
a live, living presence.

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:06.630 align:middle line:84%
She's not this sort
of boring, sexless--

00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:09.062 align:middle line:84%
that's why I was
arm's length with her

00:42:09.062 --> 00:42:10.520 align:middle line:84%
for years, because
I thought, well,

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:12.790 align:middle line:84%
who wants to be associated
with that, right?

00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And everyone could get with
Mary Magdalene a lot easier,

00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:19.220 align:middle line:84%
because she's the
sexy one, right?

00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:21.410 align:middle line:90%
But now Mary is coming in.

00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:25.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, I had surgery on an
ovary a couple of years

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:28.550 align:middle line:90%
ago to have a cyst removed--

00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:30.380 align:middle line:90%
benign, thankfully.

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:37.430 align:middle line:84%
But when I woke up
in the recovery room,

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:40.490 align:middle line:84%
I had the overwhelming sense
of mother Mary being there

00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:43.080 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, oh
my gosh, she's real.

00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:43.880 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:45.865 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because she was
theoretical in a sense

00:42:45.865 --> 00:42:46.230 align:middle line:90%
before that.

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:48.855 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Very theoretical,
until you have an altered state

00:42:48.855 --> 00:42:51.860 align:middle line:84%
experience or a series of
synchronicities that start

00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:54.477 align:middle line:90%
getting really interesting.

00:42:54.477 --> 00:42:56.060 align:middle line:84%
So that was my first
one, my presence.

00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:57.200 align:middle line:90%
Feeling her.

00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:59.915 align:middle line:84%
The second was fast-forward
to a year and a half later.

00:42:59.915 --> 00:43:04.310 align:middle line:84%
Uh-oh, there's another lump
on my ovary, same ovary.

00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And they're palpitating
it and feeling it,

00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:08.330 align:middle line:90%
and I get my first ultrasound.

00:43:08.330 --> 00:43:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's there, and it
says finding significant.

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:16.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm completely freaking
out now at this point.

00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, what
do I need to do?

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:21.590 align:middle line:84%
So I decided, all
right, I've got

00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:24.650 align:middle line:84%
to start doing the holy
womb chakra practices.

00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:26.570 align:middle line:90%
I went into a meditation.

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And basically, I was
shown, well, you know,

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:32.000 align:middle line:84%
this is not about you're
going to get sick.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.040 align:middle line:84%
This is about you need
to start paying attention

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:36.320 align:middle line:84%
to your womb finally,
Miss Brainiac.

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:37.120 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:37.760 align:middle line:90%
So I will.

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:38.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Get out of your
head and into your body.

00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Get out of your
head and into your actual womb.

00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And so I started doing
these practices that I'm

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:44.750 align:middle line:90%
going to be teaching people.

00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And I did the main
mantra, the Moola mantra.

00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And I started envisioning
Mary's womb merging with mine.

00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And then I kind of forgot that
I had asked for a healing.

00:43:57.010 --> 00:44:01.190 align:middle line:84%
And I was going in for a
second ultrasound and all this.

00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:03.633 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor comes
in all flustered.

00:44:03.633 --> 00:44:05.300 align:middle line:84%
He's looking at the
papers saying, well,

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:08.450 align:middle line:90%
there's nothing on your ovary.

00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And of course, in that
moment, it all really

00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:13.460 align:middle line:90%
came together for me.

00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:15.860 align:middle line:90%
I thought, whoa, OK.

00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:16.700 align:middle line:90%
This stuff is real.

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:17.670 align:middle line:90%
She's real.

00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:19.890 align:middle line:84%
The holy womb chakra
practices are real.

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:22.250 align:middle line:84%
The visualization of--
she is serious business

00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:24.290 align:middle line:90%
here about women's wombs.

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:26.750 align:middle line:84%
I was meant to have
this miracle so

00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:29.600 align:middle line:84%
that I could speak with
authority about her

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:32.780 align:middle line:90%
and about these processes.

00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And then she, through grace,
helped me to find my home.

00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:40.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so these are
really visceral for you

00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:42.410 align:middle line:90%
and literal.

00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk now about
the ways in which people--

00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:50.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people are
free to access guides.

00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:51.470 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah.

00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:53.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Divine beings of
their choosing, in a sense.

00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:55.220 align:middle line:84%
If they relate
strongly, they can

00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:59.030 align:middle line:84%
call upon whomever it is
they strongly relate to.

00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:01.040 align:middle line:84%
But in this case
with Mary, let's

00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:03.470 align:middle line:84%
talk about just in
your own experience

00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:08.810 align:middle line:84%
perhaps the most grace-filled
way to interact with Mary

00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:12.720 align:middle line:84%
and to receive
information, wisdom healing

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:15.807 align:middle line:84%
if we want to go into a
relationship with Mother Mary.

00:45:15.807 --> 00:45:18.140 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Oh, that's just
such a wonderful question.

00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:21.660 align:middle line:90%


00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:26.510 align:middle line:84%
I would say that you
basically don't need anything

00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:30.320 align:middle line:84%
except an open heart,
at the simplest level.

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:33.500 align:middle line:84%
An open heart and
a clear request.

00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:35.720 align:middle line:84%
Mother Mary, I'm
curious about you.

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:40.640 align:middle line:84%
Could we begin or
deepen a relationship?

00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:41.810 align:middle line:90%
Keep asking that.

00:45:41.810 --> 00:45:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And then just be open
to the signs that

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:48.080 align:middle line:84%
start happening in your life,
and pay attention to anything

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:49.910 align:middle line:90%
having to do with her.

00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:51.210 align:middle line:90%
Go into meditation.

00:45:51.210 --> 00:45:54.300 align:middle line:84%
See if you're going
to speak with her.

00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:56.690 align:middle line:84%
Are there going to be
messages when you become

00:45:56.690 --> 00:45:59.090 align:middle line:90%
quiet that come through to you?

00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:03.410 align:middle line:84%
That would be the simplest
way that I would say.

00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:06.530 align:middle line:84%
You can go to shrines
and places where

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:07.880 align:middle line:90%
she is known to have come.

00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And even though there have
been overlays of some energies

00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:13.160 align:middle line:84%
that we might not be
so thrilled about,

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:15.020 align:middle line:84%
there are shrines
all over the world

00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:18.680 align:middle line:84%
where you can go and feel
that energy touch with her,

00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:20.530 align:middle line:84%
because she comes
through those places.

00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:21.950 align:middle line:90%
She really does.

00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:24.620 align:middle line:90%
She comes through churches.

00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:28.580 align:middle line:84%
Go to that beautiful Catholic
church, that Notre Dame,

00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:29.750 align:middle line:90%
that whatever.

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:33.170 align:middle line:90%
Sit and absorb her energy.

00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:35.270 align:middle line:90%
Educate yourself.

00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:39.950 align:middle line:84%
Because right brain goes
with left brain, right?

00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:42.210 align:middle line:84%
The more you do one, the
more you open to the other.

00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And then it's a figure
eight, and suddenly you're

00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:48.470 align:middle line:84%
getting far more inspirations
because you've been

00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:50.360 align:middle line:90%
looking at the information.

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And then when you're
meditating, you get far more--

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:58.910 align:middle line:84%
you can access the intellectual
information far more,

00:46:58.910 --> 00:47:00.890 align:middle line:90%
because you're open.

00:47:00.890 --> 00:47:02.680 align:middle line:84%
So that's the long
story about that.

00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:03.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And each one of us has
our own relationship

00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:06.800 align:middle line:90%
with the unseen realms.

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think most people
watching this right now

00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:10.800 align:middle line:90%
have their own relationships.

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:14.760 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of like having
another wonderful, beautiful

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:19.140 align:middle line:90%
entity tool in your own basket.

00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:23.040 align:middle line:84%
I have a couple that are
big tall blue beings, right?

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And so I just call them the
blue guys, the big blue guys.

00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:30.030 align:middle line:84%
But I have to say, the
biggest problem in my life

00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:32.950 align:middle line:90%
has been me, never the guidance.

00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:34.170 align:middle line:90%
The guidance is fabulous.

00:47:34.170 --> 00:47:37.060 align:middle line:84%
They make things happen that
are miraculous all the time.

00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:38.910 align:middle line:90%
However, I don't think to ask.

00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:40.720 align:middle line:90%
And this is a really big one.

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:44.280 align:middle line:84%
I think here, as human
beings, our left brain

00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:46.620 align:middle line:84%
has been so dominant
for so long.

00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:49.170 align:middle line:84%
We think it's up to us to
buck up and handle it and make

00:47:49.170 --> 00:47:53.470 align:middle line:84%
things happen with our
cognitive skills, and so forth.

00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're in a
period of such challenge now.

00:47:56.370 --> 00:47:58.440 align:middle line:84%
We really have to
start opening back

00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:02.580 align:middle line:84%
up with a sense of humility,
and also absolute knowledge

00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:07.350 align:middle line:84%
and faith that we are surrounded
by wonderful beings who

00:48:07.350 --> 00:48:08.570 align:middle line:90%
are here to help us.

00:48:08.570 --> 00:48:08.760 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Definitely.

00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:09.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Every one of us.

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:10.520 align:middle line:90%
We have our own.

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:11.370 align:middle line:90%
We have collectives.

00:48:11.370 --> 00:48:13.620 align:middle line:84%
We have great
overarching beings,

00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:16.500 align:middle line:84%
like Mary and others
that we can call upon.

00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:17.598 align:middle line:90%
All we have to do is ask.

00:48:17.598 --> 00:48:18.640 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Definitely.

00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And we forget to ask.

00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:21.023 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: We do.

00:48:21.023 --> 00:48:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like this
is an era in which we

00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:26.790 align:middle line:90%
are opening to Magdalene.

00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:29.140 align:middle line:84%
We are opening to Christ
in a different way.

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:30.910 align:middle line:84%
We are opening to Mary
in a different way.

00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:34.440 align:middle line:84%
We are reclaiming who
they are essentially,

00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:38.100 align:middle line:84%
aside from any programming
and control that has gone.

00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And she is an extremely
high-level being,

00:48:40.830 --> 00:48:43.720 align:middle line:84%
because she has done what so
many people are wanting to do,

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:47.610 align:middle line:84%
which is to ascend, to
become one with goddess.

00:48:47.610 --> 00:48:48.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:48.450 --> 00:48:49.992 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: And
so she's available.

00:48:49.992 --> 00:48:51.720 align:middle line:84%
She's available as
that goddess who

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:53.290 align:middle line:90%
has had many human lifetimes.

00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:54.780 align:middle line:90%
So she understands us.

00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And it really is
all about asking.

00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:58.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And even if we want to help
her fill the role of realtor.

00:49:02.130 --> 00:49:04.290 align:middle line:84%
If we're getting turfed
out of our homes,

00:49:04.290 --> 00:49:06.210 align:middle line:84%
we'll all need a
little Mother Mary help

00:49:06.210 --> 00:49:07.790 align:middle line:84%
in finding new
abodes these days.

00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:10.260 align:middle line:84%
Any final thoughts
before we say goodbye?

00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:13.020 align:middle line:10%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: I would
just say, she's available.

00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:13.960 align:middle line:10%
She's available.

00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:18.720 align:middle line:10%
And I think that it is
important to understand

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:19.980 align:middle line:10%
her divine birth--

00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:23.460 align:middle line:10%
that this was a
real thing, that it

00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:28.050 align:middle line:10%
was something that is possible
for women today as well.

00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:30.540 align:middle line:84%
Because as we start looking
backward and seeing, well,

00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:31.630 align:middle line:90%
what did they do?

00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:33.420 align:middle line:90%
What was this all about?

00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:37.350 align:middle line:84%
Then we start looking into,
how are women conceiving today?

00:49:37.350 --> 00:49:40.050 align:middle line:84%
What other kinds of high
practices can we bring in?

00:49:40.050 --> 00:49:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Because I think
we would all agree

00:49:41.490 --> 00:49:45.630 align:middle line:84%
that we could use a few good
avatars right now, correct?

00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:47.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think
oftentimes, people get

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:52.650 align:middle line:84%
tripped up thinking, well, if
she was such an illustrious

00:49:52.650 --> 00:49:54.070 align:middle line:90%
being, why did she incarnate?

00:49:54.070 --> 00:49:54.870 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:58.260 align:middle line:84%
First of all, it's interesting
in the hermetic studies

00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:04.380 align:middle line:84%
that they literally state that
the beings that we consider

00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:07.530 align:middle line:84%
to be the angelic
realm actually will

00:50:07.530 --> 00:50:10.200 align:middle line:84%
bow before a human for the
journey they've been through,

00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:12.790 align:middle line:84%
because it's so
much more difficult.

00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:16.140 align:middle line:84%
So much more resistance
coming through Earth life

00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:19.230 align:middle line:84%
to this place of
ascended consciousness.

00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:21.300 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
those other realms often

00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:23.130 align:middle line:90%
haven't experienced yet.

00:50:23.130 --> 00:50:25.090 align:middle line:90%
Some choose to, and some don't.

00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And those who choose
to are revered,

00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:29.160 align:middle line:90%
because that's the tough work.

00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:33.690 align:middle line:84%
We humans here, doing this
on Earth and at this time,

00:50:33.690 --> 00:50:35.110 align:middle line:90%
this is a hero's journey.

00:50:35.110 --> 00:50:35.910 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah.

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And I have at times
felt Mother Mary

00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:42.720 align:middle line:90%
in a way honoring me as well.

00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:45.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're doing
the hard work now.

00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:48.780 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: I have
sensed her honoring others.

00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:52.303 align:middle line:84%
It's really a remarkable
reciprocal situation.

00:50:52.303 --> 00:50:53.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
she's been through it,

00:50:53.970 --> 00:50:57.060 align:middle line:84%
and she knows how difficult
the Earth journey is compared

00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:59.250 align:middle line:84%
to being in finer
realms where you don't

00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:00.660 align:middle line:90%
have that kind of resistance.

00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:01.460 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yes.

00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And she knows that it's right
now mission on for everyone.

00:51:04.170 --> 00:51:05.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For everyone.

00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:06.720 align:middle line:90%
It's on for all of us.

00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:08.195 align:middle line:90%
Marguerite, thank you so much.

00:51:08.195 --> 00:51:09.570 align:middle line:84%
You're doing some
beautiful work.

00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for bringing
us this whole other vision

00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:15.038 align:middle line:84%
of this entity that
we can all call upon.

00:51:15.038 --> 00:51:16.080 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate that.

00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:17.790 align:middle line:84%
I appreciate the
work you've done.

00:51:17.790 --> 00:51:19.050 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Thank you.

00:51:19.050 --> 00:51:20.883 align:middle line:10%

bit more about her work,
