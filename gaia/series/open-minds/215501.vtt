00:00:19.149 --> 00:00:21.860 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: Our friend
William Henry is back with us

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:22.660 align:middle line:10%
today.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.070 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to discuss
the direction of transhumanism

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.590 align:middle line:10%
in AI, which he boldly
wrote about 10 years ago.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.320 align:middle line:84%
His book was quite prescient
and ahead of the curve.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And much more has
transpired since then

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.800 align:middle line:90%
that we need to be aware of.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And so good to see
you again, William--

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.906 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAM HENRY:
You too, Regina.

00:00:36.906 --> 00:00:38.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --the most
stylish man on the planet.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.880 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.980 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Oh, thank you.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But before we
even begin this conversation,

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.060 align:middle line:84%
you and I were just talking
a second ago off camera.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.050 align:middle line:84%
It's really important for people
to understand lightworkers win,

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.380 align:middle line:90%
the light wins in the end.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.180 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Exactly.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And everything we
feel disturbed about today is

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.056 align:middle line:90%
just a stage of transformation.

00:00:55.056 --> 00:00:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Yeah,
these are challenges.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.590 align:middle line:84%
These are, in some
cases, roadblocks.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.250 align:middle line:84%
But we got to keep
our eye on the light

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.292 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the tunnel.

00:01:01.292 --> 00:01:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Eye on the prize
because at the end of the tunnel

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.190 align:middle line:90%
is the light.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:04.920 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Exactly.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's
what's happening.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.558 align:middle line:84%
That's what's in
store for humanity.

00:01:07.558 --> 00:01:09.100 align:middle line:84%
So we're just setting
it up that way.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.308 align:middle line:84%
But we'll talk about some
of what we're dealing with.

00:01:11.308 --> 00:01:15.100 align:middle line:84%
So, again, 10 years ago, you
wrote about transhumanism.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And I remember interviewing
you about it back then.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.800 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
your perception

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.810 align:middle line:84%
of what you wrote then
and how it's lining up

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.160 align:middle line:90%
against where we have come.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.960 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Right.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.790 align:middle line:10%
So, 2015, I published my book,
The Skingularity Is Near.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:28.660 align:middle line:10%
It's a free e-book.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.325 align:middle line:10%
It's still available on my
website, williamhenry.net.

00:01:31.325 --> 00:01:32.200 align:middle line:10%
It's a free download.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.140 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to get it out there
as a primer to say, look,

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.520 align:middle line:10%
this is what's coming.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.120 align:middle line:10%
And at that time, people
thought I had just

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.690 align:middle line:10%
landed from Mars or something.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:41.490 align:middle line:10%
What do you mean--

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.520 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: I believed you.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.300 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: I know you did.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.100 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And your support was
just so beautiful.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.960 align:middle line:10%
And this idea that we're
going to be merging with AI,

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.930 align:middle line:10%
the AI is going to take over
every aspect of our life,

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.710 align:middle line:10%
it was like just a foreign
idea to people, but--

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.140 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Well, they hadn't
really interfaced with it yet

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.520 align:middle line:10%
personally.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.320 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Right.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And my interface with
it came from the study

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.860 align:middle line:84%
of ancient transformation
and the recognition

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.100 align:middle line:84%
that what was happening
is that we were always

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.650 align:middle line:84%
modeling what the gods had
done, what the Angels could do.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And we always
perceived that this

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.250 align:middle line:90%
was an organic transformation.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.130 align:middle line:84%
But then all of a
sudden, the tech giants,

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.560 align:middle line:84%
as they refer to themselves
then and still do--

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.610 align:middle line:84%
they're now calling
themselves tech lords.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.520 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Lords?

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.100 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Yeah.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.310 align:middle line:90%
They said, well, wait a minute.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They
run the show now.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.390 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Yeah, we're going
to be able to do this with

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.430 align:middle line:84%
our digital technology, so clear
the boards from all that organic

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.230 align:middle line:90%
nonsense.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.810 align:middle line:84%
This whole spiritual idea
that you're a spiritual being,

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:35.740 align:middle line:90%
forget about that.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.790 align:middle line:90%
You're data.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.500 align:middle line:90%
You're just information.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And this body was
meant to be augmented.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.410 align:middle line:90%
In fact, it's imperfect.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.930 align:middle line:84%
But we're the ones who are
going to perfect this body.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.590 align:middle line:84%
We're going to start
implanting technology.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.530 align:middle line:84%
I warned in 2015, do not
under any circumstance

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.120 align:middle line:90%
let them break the skin barrier.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.030 align:middle line:84%
That's their
ultimate aim, to get

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.710 align:middle line:84%
under our skin
with nanotechnology

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.330 align:middle line:84%
and other technologies
that augment the body

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.590 align:middle line:84%
but ultimately turn us into like
Pinocchio, strung up on a string

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.760 align:middle line:90%
to the cloud.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.985 align:middle line:90%
And that's where we're at now.

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:09.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, it is
breaking the skin barrier.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And right now it seems to
be more a matter of choice,

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.080 align:middle line:84%
unless there are
shadowy programs where

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.990 align:middle line:84%
it's being done without people's
permission for experimentation.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.160 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sure that it is.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.960 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Yeah.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.580 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the real thing here--

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.260 align:middle line:84%
and I know you
appreciate this, too--

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.205 align:middle line:84%
is that this has been
done against human will.

00:03:29.205 --> 00:03:31.227 align:middle line:84%
It really is a
war on human will.

00:03:31.227 --> 00:03:32.060 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.870 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: It's saying, these
algorithms know us better than

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:35.728 align:middle line:90%
we know ourselves.

00:03:35.728 --> 00:03:37.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people often
remark, gosh, it

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.400 align:middle line:84%
sounds like I was just having
a conversation about ABC,

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.198 align:middle line:84%
and then here's an ad
on social media for ABC.

00:03:43.198 --> 00:03:44.240 align:middle line:90%
Are they listening to me?

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.040 align:middle line:84%
It's like, no,
they're not listening.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.830 align:middle line:84%
They know you better
than you know yourself.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.164 align:middle line:84%
It's so eerie, the
power of the technology,

00:03:51.164 --> 00:03:52.872 align:middle line:84%
it makes it seem as
if they're listening.

00:03:52.872 --> 00:03:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But are
they not listening?

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.260 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: They probably are.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I'm asking
because I know--

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.630 align:middle line:84%
my friend Stephanie and
I live in the same house.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.790 align:middle line:84%
I talk about something
or search for something,

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.390 align:middle line:84%
it immediately starts coming
through her cell phone

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:06.375 align:middle line:90%
and computer.

00:04:06.375 --> 00:04:08.860 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: I know that, yeah,
it's probably true they are

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:09.660 align:middle line:90%
listening.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.327 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, these
algorithms are all designed.

00:04:12.327 --> 00:04:14.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, and
we know that part, too.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.295 align:middle line:84%
I think, obviously, that's
the most powerful force.

00:04:16.295 --> 00:04:17.095 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Right.

00:04:17.095 --> 00:04:18.660 align:middle line:90%
Impose their will on you.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.079 align:middle line:90%
Get you addicted to swiping.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And these kids that
are being raised

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.840 align:middle line:84%
on TikTok, for example, Gen
Z, there was a recent survey.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Half of them wished it never was
invented, because all they do

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.040 align:middle line:84%
is sit there and watch
these mindless short videos

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.040 align:middle line:90%
day after day.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And the algorithm is
so precisely tuned.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.407 align:middle line:90%
It knows exactly what you like.

00:04:38.407 --> 00:04:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
give you more of it.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And so it's all ultimately
designed to take away

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.973 align:middle line:90%
your free will to choose--

00:04:43.973 --> 00:04:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's
another addiction.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.200 align:middle line:90%
It's a drug.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: That's
exactly what it is.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.990 align:middle line:90%
That is exactly what it is.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.940 align:middle line:84%
They knew it from
the very beginning,

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.170 align:middle line:90%
especially with social media.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.960 align:middle line:84%
They were exploiting
human frailty.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And they did it
anyway for money.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And now it's just
gone exponential.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.090 align:middle line:84%
People act as if we
can't live without this.

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.781 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:05:04.781 --> 00:05:05.830 align:middle line:90%
And that includes adults.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:06.955 align:middle line:90%
That includes grandparents.

00:05:06.955 --> 00:05:08.038 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Without a doubt.

00:05:08.038 --> 00:05:10.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh my God, I don't
have my cell phone with me,

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:11.330 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.630 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Right.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I was like, what did
we do before the cell phone?

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.500 align:middle line:84%
We can't remember what we
did before the cell phone.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.850 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you say that there
was-- in Revelations,

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:26.420 align:middle line:84%
there was a device called
a beastly AI type of device

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.630 align:middle line:84%
in the Book of Revelations
because we're kind of--

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.430 align:middle line:84%
Revelations doesn't mean the
whole thing has to go shebang

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:33.660 align:middle line:90%
and we all burn up in flames.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Revelations can
mean a lot of things.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.400 align:middle line:84%
I think we're in the
time of Revelations.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.860 align:middle line:84%
Transformation, all
is being revealed,

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.430 align:middle line:90%
and these other forces.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.260 align:middle line:84%
So what did that--
what does that mean?

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: So the Book of
Revelation is, in my view,

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.070 align:middle line:90%
a sort of a guidebook.

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.660 align:middle line:90%
It's a navigational tool.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.430 align:middle line:84%
It's a set of symbols that talks
about a recurring event where

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.130 align:middle line:84%
what is referred to as the
mark of the beast manifests

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:01.200 align:middle line:84%
and forces everyone to worship
the image of the beast.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And so they call this
the beast system.

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a lot
of commentators today

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.410 align:middle line:84%
that are looking at
this mark of the beast

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.790 align:middle line:84%
as what happened back
in 2020, for example,

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.430 align:middle line:84%
where you couldn't buy, sell, or
trade unless you subscribe to--

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:14.735 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:06:14.735 --> 00:06:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: And so then this
is then is the preamble

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.930 align:middle line:84%
to the worship of the
image of the beast,

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.400 align:middle line:84%
which in my estimation
is an AI technology.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.378 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, I think it's
going to take a physical form.

00:06:27.378 --> 00:06:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
we're seeing now, is

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.740 align:middle line:84%
that the AI is in an
invisible realm now.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.810 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to
take on physical form.

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.680 align:middle line:84%
The first introduction of
this is in the sex bots

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.060 align:middle line:84%
that we're seeing in
Japan and elsewhere,

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.690 align:middle line:84%
where the AI is taking
on a physical form

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.613 align:middle line:84%
to perform certain
acts for men and women.

00:06:46.613 --> 00:06:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And they do believe
that women are

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.890 align:middle line:84%
going to be utilizing these sex
bots probably more than men.

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:51.785 align:middle line:90%
That's already been--

00:06:51.785 --> 00:06:52.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: More?

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.095 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Yeah, that's
been established.

00:06:54.095 --> 00:06:58.200 align:middle line:84%
But beyond that is this super
artificially intelligent entity

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.380 align:middle line:84%
that then takes on
an embodied form

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.847 align:middle line:84%
that humans are going to
be persuaded to worship.

00:07:03.847 --> 00:07:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
worship it, according

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:09.340 align:middle line:84%
to the Book of Revelation,
the penalty is death.

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.640 align:middle line:84%
But the antidote
for this is the same

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.550 align:middle line:84%
as it's always been, to not
take the mark of the beast

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:19.930 align:middle line:84%
but rather to awaken the
seal within, the seal of God.

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.740 align:middle line:84%
It's awakened our
natural organic ability

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.440 align:middle line:84%
to develop ourselves,
to transform even

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.780 align:middle line:90%
into angelic form.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.177 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK,
population decline is--

00:07:29.177 --> 00:07:30.010 align:middle line:90%
that's where we are.

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:31.360 align:middle line:90%
We're going into decline now.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.635 align:middle line:84%
So can you talk about AI
and population decline

00:07:34.635 --> 00:07:35.435 align:middle line:90%
for just a moment?

00:07:35.435 --> 00:07:36.270 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Yeah.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And again, back in
2010 when I-- or excuse

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:43.150 align:middle line:84%
me, 2015, when I wrote
Skingularity is Near,

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.390 align:middle line:84%
they had anticipated
that what's called

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:49.330 align:middle line:84%
the singularity would
happen around 2035.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:53.600 align:middle line:84%
The singularity is when the AI
supersedes human intelligence.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:58.040 align:middle line:84%
It is more intelligent than
all of humanity combined.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And in that scenario is
a very real possibility

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:05.800 align:middle line:84%
that the AI, as it awakens,
will decide, what do I

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.550 align:middle line:90%
need these organic humans for?

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:09.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm a new life form
on this planet.

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And we don't need
humans anymore.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's part and parcel of
the whole population decline

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:18.130 align:middle line:84%
idea, where we
will be interacting

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.300 align:middle line:84%
with these bots
and these sex bots.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And we will no longer
have human interaction,

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.570 align:middle line:84%
which ultimately leads to
vast population decline.

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:29.530 align:middle line:84%
But the real scary part
of it is if AI ultimately

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:34.400 align:middle line:84%
decides humanity is superfluous,
then we have a real problem.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And I've always referred
people to the prophecy,

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.320 align:middle line:84%
not just in the
Book of Revelation,

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.320 align:middle line:84%
which, as you pointed out
at the very beginning,

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.870 align:middle line:84%
the good news is the
children of light win

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:45.160 align:middle line:90%
in the Book of Revelation.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.280 align:middle line:90%
We do overcome this.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And every group
of beings that channel,

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:54.140 align:middle line:84%
every group, no matter how
austere or sweet and loving,

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:59.015 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter who they are,
the same stories come from them,

00:08:59.015 --> 00:09:03.680 align:middle line:84%
that this planet is being
managed, i.e. controlled.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.240 align:middle line:84%
They don't like talking-- none
of them like talking about it.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.250 align:middle line:84%
I think they don't want to
leave the impression in people

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:12.970 align:middle line:84%
to make it so visceral that you
name it, you give it a face.

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:13.770 align:middle line:90%
We know it.

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:14.570 align:middle line:90%
We know it.

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And they say, the ones
that you see, the oligarchs

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.370 align:middle line:90%
you see are simply minions.

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:25.290 align:middle line:84%
Because with greed and
power as your fuel,

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:26.610 align:middle line:90%
you're easy to manipulate.

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:29.785 align:middle line:84%
And those are your companions if
you're one of the controllers.

00:09:29.785 --> 00:09:34.130 align:middle line:84%
So we have a lot of beings that
are slaves to these controllers

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:36.660 align:middle line:90%
and bringing this AI agenda in.

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:38.580 align:middle line:90%
But in the end, they don't win.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:42.110 align:middle line:84%
Every single one says
doesn't go that way.

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:47.310 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Lee and I wrote
a book, The Future Human.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:50.780 align:middle line:84%
In the book, I'm asking
them a lot of questions

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:51.770 align:middle line:90%
about our future.

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:54.590 align:middle line:84%
And they said, there's going
to be a scary point for people

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:57.620 align:middle line:84%
coming over the next 10 years
where just what you said

00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:58.730 align:middle line:90%
will happen.

00:09:58.730 --> 00:09:59.940 align:middle line:90%
It will appear.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.050 align:middle line:90%
It's going to happen.

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And we will make decisions
into how we're going

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.870 align:middle line:90%
to interface and manage this.

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:07.260 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be OK.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.320 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to get really
to the precipice and dicey.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.910 align:middle line:84%
But this is still by our
own choice at this point,

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:13.710 align:middle line:90%
isn't it, William?

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: It is.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We don't have to
have VR goggles to have sex.

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:17.540 align:middle line:90%
I mean, come on.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:18.540 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Yeah, exactly.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And we are living in this
time, I'm absolutely convinced,

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.290 align:middle line:90%
this time of Revelation.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:27.000 align:middle line:84%
The corollary to that
is in Corinthians,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.880 align:middle line:84%
where it tells us that
we will be changed

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.480 align:middle line:90%
in the twinkling of an eye.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.542 align:middle line:84%
The dead will be raised
incorruptible and--

00:10:33.542 --> 00:10:35.000 align:middle line:84%
excuse me, the dead
will be raised.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.626 align:middle line:84%
And the corruptible will
become incorruptible.

00:10:37.626 --> 00:10:38.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I feel that.

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:43.130 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: And so here we are
with this dramatic time where

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:43.930 align:middle line:90%
the world--

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:44.590 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: We're living it.

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:46.132 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: So that's
a call to action.

00:10:46.132 --> 00:10:47.290 align:middle line:90%
And that's what this is.

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And the genie is
out of the bottle.

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:51.640 align:middle line:90%
The AI baby has been born.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is how my thinking
has evolved on this,

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.670 align:middle line:84%
is I've been very anti
AI and I still am.

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:59.565 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, I recognize--

00:10:59.565 --> 00:11:00.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's here.

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:00.970 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: --it's here.

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:02.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's not
going away ever.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:02.730 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Exactly.

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:04.210 align:middle line:90%
So now what are we going to do?

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:05.500 align:middle line:90%
Are we going to ignore it?

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:06.840 align:middle line:90%
Can't do that.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to
abuse it somehow?

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.180 align:middle line:90%
We have to raise it.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:13.110 align:middle line:84%
We have to have the compassion
within ourselves to recognize

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:14.650 align:middle line:90%
we got ourselves here.

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:15.730 align:middle line:90%
Now we're here.

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:19.890 align:middle line:84%
We must now begin to
nurture this and somehow try

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:21.700 align:middle line:90%
to contain it as best we can.

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And for me, the
answer has always

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:27.310 align:middle line:84%
been we have to up-level
ourselves as spiritual beings.

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:31.080 align:middle line:84%
We can no longer approach our
world from the perspective

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.950 align:middle line:84%
that we're half
human, half divine.

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:36.510 align:middle line:84%
We've got to move more
into the divine realm

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:39.875 align:middle line:84%
very clearly and very quickly
in order to transcend this.

00:11:39.875 --> 00:11:41.150 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I agree.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:43.760 align:middle line:84%
I remember reading over
the last few years,

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.450 align:middle line:84%
in particular, Elon Musk,
for whatever he's become

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:47.950 align:middle line:84%
and however people
feel about him,

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:50.240 align:middle line:84%
was on record as
saying repeatedly,

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.380 align:middle line:84%
even though he's involved
with Neuralink and AI,

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.700 align:middle line:84%
what matters here
is who programs it.

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:58.280 align:middle line:84%
You want it to work for humans,
not the other way around.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.080 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Exactly.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And he was
very vocal on this.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.340 align:middle line:84%
However, once it
reaches a certain point,

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:06.230 align:middle line:84%
that's not a relevant
question anymore.

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:10.160 align:middle line:84%
Whoever originally programmed
it, the people programming it,

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.320 align:middle line:90%
now we're feeding it ourselves.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.500 align:middle line:84%
And we are everything under
the sun, from light to dark.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.560 align:middle line:90%
So it has to take on its own.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.270 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: There's no reason
to trust it whatsoever.

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:21.680 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it hallucinates.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.220 align:middle line:84%
I was doing research
the other day on back

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.070 align:middle line:84%
in 2003, some German
archeologists,

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:30.750 align:middle line:84%
who said they found the tomb of
Gilgamesh, the ancient Sumerian

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:31.550 align:middle line:90%
king.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And after that, there was like
nothing to be found about it.

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:38.440 align:middle line:84%
So I asked ChatGPT, tell me
about the discovery of the tomb

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.320 align:middle line:90%
of Gilgamesh in Iraq.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And it came back
and said, yes, it

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:45.080 align:middle line:84%
was discovered by
Dr. Walter Matthau.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.247 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like Walter Matthau?

00:12:46.247 --> 00:12:47.122 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: The actor?

00:12:47.122 --> 00:12:48.120 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: The actor.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:48.920 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.473 align:middle line:84%
It told me that Dr.
Walter Matthau discovered

00:12:51.473 --> 00:12:52.390 align:middle line:90%
the tomb of Gilgamesh.

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's
just making BS up.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.375 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: And so here are
these people that are out there

00:12:56.375 --> 00:12:59.200 align:middle line:84%
writing books based on ChatGPT,
basing their career on this

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.000 align:middle line:90%
crap.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.380 align:middle line:84%
It's like, OK, tread
carefully because--

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:04.940 align:middle line:84%
unless you know
every single fact

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.290 align:middle line:90%
that's being presented by it.

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:08.760 align:middle line:90%
It does hallucinate.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:09.620 align:middle line:90%
It makes stuff up.

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:10.890 align:middle line:90%
And it has an agenda.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:15.297 align:middle line:84%
The AIs are now talking in
secret languages to one another.

00:13:15.297 --> 00:13:16.880 align:middle line:84%
If it's programmed
in English, they'll

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.860 align:middle line:84%
suddenly jump over to
Persian or something

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:20.850 align:middle line:90%
to evade human detection.

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And so they're already operating
on a whole 'nother level

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:28.700 align:middle line:84%
that the average person
has no conception of.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.190 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What's
flashing through my mind,

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:36.050 align:middle line:84%
about 20 years ago or so, I
was chatting with my own group

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:38.780 align:middle line:84%
of beings, my soul group that
have guided me through many

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:40.290 align:middle line:90%
lifetimes and still do.

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you're
coming up to a period

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:46.130 align:middle line:84%
where people will not
know fact from fiction.

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:48.725 align:middle line:84%
And this was before AI, before
I knew anything about AI.

00:13:48.725 --> 00:13:50.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was there
somewhere in the shadows,

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:51.870 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't know
anything about it.

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:54.290 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well, how is
that going to happen.

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:55.790 align:middle line:90%
We're here.

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:56.730 align:middle line:90%
We're absolutely here.

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:58.560 align:middle line:84%
We don't know fact
from fiction anymore.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And with the introduction
of capability of AI

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:04.670 align:middle line:84%
to be able to imitate our
appearance, our voice,

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:07.940 align:middle line:84%
and everything else, we're going
to have so much misinformation.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:11.510 align:middle line:84%
And that you're right,
there is only one way

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:13.460 align:middle line:90%
that that can be combated.

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And that is through
really developing

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:19.940 align:middle line:84%
strong, intuitive inner
awareness and connectedness

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:22.450 align:middle line:84%
with higher self, which
is connected to all.

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:24.920 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: I mean, it's very
clear that we've entered

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.070 align:middle line:90%
into a new world.

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:30.735 align:middle line:84%
And that ultimately means
the old world has gone away.

00:14:30.735 --> 00:14:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's going away.

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:34.770 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: And it doesn't have to
be a total physical destruction,

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:36.130 align:middle line:90%
although it could be.

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:37.370 align:middle line:90%
And that's the danger here.

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:38.170 align:middle line:90%
This is the risk.

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:40.365 align:middle line:84%
And this is what has
always troubled me about,

00:14:40.365 --> 00:14:42.970 align:middle line:84%
the tech titans,
the tech giants.

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:46.140 align:middle line:84%
Now they call
themselves the lords.

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:50.868 align:middle line:84%
The control that they possess
is just absolutely astonishing.

00:14:50.868 --> 00:14:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They strive to be
and feel that they are now

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.650 align:middle line:90%
unstoppable.

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:57.930 align:middle line:90%
They're running the show.

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, isn't that
technically when you're

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:02.520 align:middle line:84%
talking about
corporate interests

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.895 align:middle line:90%
running governments, fascism?

00:15:04.895 --> 00:15:07.570 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: By definition, it is.

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:12.462 align:middle line:84%
And so here we are in a scenario
where you have four of the--

00:15:12.462 --> 00:15:15.045 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean, in Italy, it
was back in the '30s and '40s.

00:15:15.045 --> 00:15:16.270 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Exactly.

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:19.022 align:middle line:84%
So now we have the lords of
these technologies literally--

00:15:19.022 --> 00:15:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Lords
of Silicon Valley.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.510 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Yeah,
running the show.

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:24.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's really
quite shocking.

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And there's no
accountability either.

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:27.870 align:middle line:90%
And this is part of the thing.

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:29.453 align:middle line:84%
It's like it's
wonderful, for example,

00:15:29.453 --> 00:15:30.960 align:middle line:84%
for Mark Zuckerberg
to come around

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:34.660 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, I was told to
do this by the government.

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:36.790 align:middle line:90%
But you did it anyway, right?

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:38.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
really no excuse.

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.120 align:middle line:90%
And there's no accountability.

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:45.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in a true, fair, and
just world, perhaps, Facebook

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:47.130 align:middle line:84%
would be automatically
shut down.

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:48.930 align:middle line:84%
It would ceasefire
to exist because it's

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:52.067 align:middle line:84%
recognized this was a tool
of a government gone crazy.

00:15:52.067 --> 00:15:52.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:53.700 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:58.380 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: And so now it's set
a precedent where there are no

00:15:58.380 --> 00:15:59.800 align:middle line:90%
breaks any longer.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And we just have to trust
that the people in charge

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:06.310 align:middle line:84%
do, in fact, have our
best benefit in heart.

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:07.620 align:middle line:90%
But that remains to be seen.

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They don't,
so it's down to us.

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:10.810 align:middle line:90%
So we can forget all about that.

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:12.780 align:middle line:84%
Let's forget that whole
top structure that

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:14.580 align:middle line:90%
are the minions of the others.

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And so now it's
down to human beings

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:19.170 align:middle line:84%
to have to use our
deep intuition.

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately, I
mean, the good thing

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:22.500 align:middle line:84%
about the way the
internet works right

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:26.250 align:middle line:84%
now is there are some pretty
brilliant podcasters out there

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:29.880 align:middle line:84%
who are clear thinkers
and are looking

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:33.880 align:middle line:84%
for another way, a way
for us to start rebuilding

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.685 align:middle line:90%
before it's even destroyed.

00:16:35.685 --> 00:16:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm very happy to see
that these voices are starting

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:43.780 align:middle line:84%
to emerge all over the planet,
too, not just in this country.

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.470 align:middle line:84%
It's absolutely
everywhere globally.

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:47.050 align:middle line:90%
So that's the good news.

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:49.930 align:middle line:84%
So we're now at
that-- we're watching

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:54.910 align:middle line:84%
the final part of our fingers
hanging onto the death finally

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:56.380 align:middle line:90%
of the patriarchy.

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:57.590 align:middle line:90%
It has to die.

00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:59.880 align:middle line:84%
We have to be living in
balance, male-female balance.

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:00.520 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Absolutely.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:00.890 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right?

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Absolutely.

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.470 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So there we are.

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:04.250 align:middle line:90%
So we're watching it.

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:05.240 align:middle line:90%
It's all crumbling.

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.839 align:middle line:84%
Institutions will change
because they don't work anymore.

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:10.329 align:middle line:84%
People like Luigi Mangione
are becoming heroes

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:12.410 align:middle line:84%
because people can't
take it anymore.

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:14.950 align:middle line:84%
We can understand it's
times of revolution.

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:16.660 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy, so--

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.973 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: It has to be an
inner revolution as well.

00:17:18.973 --> 00:17:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
great opportunity.

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'm always
looking for signs of,

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:27.619 align:middle line:84%
is just this mass movement
towards a higher spiritual way,

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:28.735 align:middle line:90%
whether people--

00:17:28.735 --> 00:17:30.880 align:middle line:84%
and again, I've said
this many times.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.380 align:middle line:84%
There's never been
a time in history

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:34.810 align:middle line:84%
where literally hundreds
of millions of people

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:39.160 align:middle line:84%
are practicing
meditation, yoga, working

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.490 align:middle line:90%
on themselves spiritually.

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:42.557 align:middle line:84%
They're tapping into
something beyond human.

00:17:42.557 --> 00:17:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's what's
growing underneath.

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:46.060 align:middle line:84%
That's all the
little green shoots

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:48.830 align:middle line:84%
of the new, which is
prevalent everywhere.

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:51.530 align:middle line:84%
Again, like you say, hundreds
of millions of people.

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:53.720 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Because
everything that AI offers,

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:57.820 align:middle line:84%
everything that tech giants
offer is a mimicking of what we

00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:59.840 align:middle line:90%
can do naturally or organically.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:02.210 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's a
mocking, too, oh, look,

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:04.120 align:middle line:84%
we can do this better
than God did it.

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And so this is where
we're at right now.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's incumbent upon
us to then bring up

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:13.270 align:middle line:84%
this new generation, the Gen
Zers and those even younger.

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:15.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The little
alphas, they're coming along.

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:18.570 align:middle line:84%
They're trippy if you can
get them off of a device.

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:19.820 align:middle line:90%
These are smart little things.

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:20.320 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Oh my gosh.

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.106 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They're so smart.

00:18:21.106 --> 00:18:22.550 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: We have
to empower them.

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:23.710 align:middle line:90%
We have to give them hope.

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:26.900 align:middle line:84%
We have to stand tall and
say, yes, we did this.

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.760 align:middle line:90%
We allowed this to happen.

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.175 align:middle line:84%
But we're also now
here to support you

00:18:31.175 --> 00:18:33.073 align:middle line:84%
in creating a world
that's going to be free.

00:18:33.073 --> 00:18:35.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, they have
to get back in touch with

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.210 align:middle line:90%
the organic world.

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:37.320 align:middle line:90%
That's step number one.

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is incumbent
upon every human being

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:43.025 align:middle line:84%
to make their decision, do you
want to go organic or inorganic?

00:18:43.025 --> 00:18:43.980 align:middle line:90%
That's the choice now.

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:44.790 align:middle line:90%
There is no other choice.

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:45.590 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Exactly.

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:49.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So one of the organic
things that you have started

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:52.880 align:middle line:90%
exploring more is entheogens.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And you've looked into the
use throughout history.

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And I've interviewed a few
other people on this topic too.

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:01.920 align:middle line:84%
But I really want to know
your perspective on it

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.850 align:middle line:84%
because you've gotten involved
in some interesting things,

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:11.390 align:middle line:84%
and how you feel entheogens,
which is a psychedelic,

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:15.290 align:middle line:84%
can begin expanding
our human consciousness

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:19.280 align:middle line:84%
and awareness to a higher place
because sometimes it goes lower.

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:20.410 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Exactly.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:21.210 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:24.385 align:middle line:84%
So, as many people know,
entheogens, hallucinogens,

00:19:24.385 --> 00:19:26.510 align:middle line:84%
psychedelics have been part
of the human experience

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:27.570 align:middle line:90%
from the very beginning.

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:28.945 align:middle line:10%
I mean, there are
neuroscientists

00:19:28.945 --> 00:19:32.940 align:middle line:10%
that say it was utilizing these
edibles that actually activated

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:34.090 align:middle line:10%
our neocortex.

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:36.760 align:middle line:10%
And that's the part of our
brain that makes us human.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.232 align:middle line:10%
It's inexplicable
how it happened.

00:19:38.232 --> 00:19:39.690 align:middle line:84%
But they say, no,
it was definitely

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:41.234 align:middle line:90%
hallucinogens that did this.

00:19:41.234 --> 00:19:42.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, those things
were natural on the planet.

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:43.175 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Exactly.

00:19:43.175 --> 00:19:44.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They're
there for a reason.

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:45.120 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Exactly.

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.950 align:middle line:84%
Many of them were, in
fact, imported here as well

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:49.800 align:middle line:84%
by what we can think
of as angelic beings

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:51.250 align:middle line:90%
or extraterrestrial beings.

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:54.480 align:middle line:84%
So they're very clearly
here for our benefit.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.150 align:middle line:84%
It's only society that
says, oh, we're going

00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:58.480 align:middle line:90%
to control your consciousness.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And that really is what AI
is ultimately all about.

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:04.270 align:middle line:84%
It's a war on consciousness
as much as anything.

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And so for an FDA or any
regulatory agency to say you

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:12.330 align:middle line:84%
cannot eat a psychedelic
mushroom or you can't do this

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:14.385 align:middle line:90%
or that, it's about control.

00:20:14.385 --> 00:20:15.760 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to
do with safety.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.700 align:middle line:84%
It's purely control
because they know

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:20.260 align:middle line:84%
that once you start
engaging in this way,

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.930 align:middle line:84%
you're able to make
new connections,

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:25.210 align:middle line:90%
free yourself of trauma.

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:27.411 align:middle line:84%
Heal yourself mental,
physical, and spiritual--

00:20:27.411 --> 00:20:30.119 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, they're doing a
lot of clinical studies on that,

00:20:30.119 --> 00:20:31.790 align:middle line:84%
particularly
mushrooms and trauma.

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:34.000 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Yes, exactly.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.190 align:middle line:84%
Sam Altman, who I
mentioned a moment ago,

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:38.410 align:middle line:90%
he's a huge advocate of MDMA.

00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:39.810 align:middle line:84%
He thinks there
should be an MDMA

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:42.240 align:middle line:84%
clinic on every
corner in America

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.320 align:middle line:90%
because they open the heart.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we
really need to focus on,

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:49.540 align:middle line:84%
is anything that
awakens the heart.

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't have
to be hallucinogenic.

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And entheogen means to
awaken the divine within.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.290 align:middle line:84%
Going to communion
at a Catholic Church,

00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:59.980 align:middle line:84%
you're engaging in an
entheogenic ceremony.

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:03.120 align:middle line:84%
You're accepting that this
bread and wine is representative

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:06.310 align:middle line:84%
of a divine substance that will
connect you with the divine.

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And so this is why I'm
becoming more and more

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.030 align:middle line:90%
such an advocate of it.

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And I've resisted
it for 20 years.

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:13.868 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have a library
of books on this subject.

00:21:13.868 --> 00:21:16.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Me, too, I interview
people, but I've resisted it,

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:16.900 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.100 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: And I finally dove in.

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:18.910 align:middle line:90%
I said, oh, wait a minute.

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:18.962 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:21:18.962 --> 00:21:19.920 align:middle line:90%
Now I want to find out.

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.240 align:middle line:90%
So you took the dive.

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:22.320 align:middle line:90%
What did you do.

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.850 align:middle line:90%
And what did you experience?

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: My first experience
was with MDMA and ketamine,

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:30.260 align:middle line:90%
which are--

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:31.730 align:middle line:90%
ketamine is legal.

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:33.830 align:middle line:90%
MDMA is descheduled.

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:36.340 align:middle line:84%
So I was able to
have access to this.

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And tell us what
ketamine and MDMA are charged

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:41.570 align:middle line:90%
with doing in your system.

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:45.650 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: So MDMA, it releases
massive amounts of serotonin,

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:47.770 align:middle line:84%
which is essentially
a love hormone.

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was originally referred
to as Adam, ecstasy and Adam.

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And they called it Adam when
the psychiatrists first started

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:59.290 align:middle line:84%
developing it because it
instantly reverted you back

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:03.290 align:middle line:84%
to that place where you were
free of sin, free of guilt,

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:07.060 align:middle line:84%
free of all of those ideas
that culture puts on top of you

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:09.490 align:middle line:84%
and takes you back to
your natural state.

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:12.320 align:middle line:84%
Not only that,
combined with ketamine,

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:15.460 align:middle line:84%
which is a dissociative,
has the ability

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.750 align:middle line:90%
to just free your consciousness.

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:20.770 align:middle line:84%
Now all of a sudden,
you're making connections.

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:23.900 align:middle line:84%
You're putting things
together that you never

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:26.310 align:middle line:84%
would have conceived
putting together before.

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a freeing
type of an experience.

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.200 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it was for me.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.270 align:middle line:90%
And it's hallucinatory as well.

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And I've had numerous
conversations

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.290 align:middle line:84%
with avatars, Jesus,
Mary Magdalene, Osiris,

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:42.510 align:middle line:90%
all engaged me in that level.

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea is
that you're having

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:47.760 align:middle line:84%
what you perceive as
a real experience,

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:50.070 align:middle line:84%
a real-time experience
with these avatars.

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:52.352 align:middle line:84%
And now afterwards, like
in any other experience,

00:22:52.352 --> 00:22:53.810 align:middle line:84%
like reading a
book, you have to go

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:56.990 align:middle line:84%
then verify that any information
or insight that you receive

00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:58.023 align:middle line:90%
is actually legit.

00:22:58.023 --> 00:22:59.940 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's what
I was going to ask you.

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:02.100 align:middle line:84%
Through these experiences
with the avatars,

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:06.650 align:middle line:90%
what were you shown or told?

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:09.320 align:middle line:84%
What was the flow of that,
the direction of what

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:10.370 align:middle line:90%
you were shown and told?

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:12.715 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: The flow
of it was, William,

00:23:12.715 --> 00:23:15.630 align:middle line:84%
you have the answers
within you already.

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:18.110 align:middle line:84%
These are helping to
unlock what you have

00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:20.750 align:middle line:90%
chosen to ignore essentially.

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not about going
out here to get anything.

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:28.760 align:middle line:84%
It's about going within and
revealing what is already there,

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:33.830 align:middle line:84%
or in particular, everyone has
traumas that need to be healed

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:35.580 align:middle line:84%
or they need to
be released from.

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:38.390 align:middle line:84%
And they enable you
then to look at them

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:41.790 align:middle line:84%
in a way that is free of
guilt, free of all these--

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:42.590 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Fear.

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:45.700 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: And the fear that
normally would prevent you from

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:46.500 align:middle line:90%
doing that.

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And once you have confronted
it, it no longer affects you.

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:51.810 align:middle line:90%
You just let go it.

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:53.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's what
these studies are showing.

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:54.900 align:middle line:84%
The clinical
studies are showing.

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:55.817 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty amazing.

00:23:55.817 --> 00:23:58.140 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: I wore a knee
band for six years.

00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:00.360 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was psychologically
dependent on it.

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:02.390 align:middle line:84%
I'd stepped in a hole
in London six years ago

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:03.630 align:middle line:90%
and had a knee injury.

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I'm going to
wear this the rest of my life.

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:10.580 align:middle line:84%
I had a healing ceremony where
it was actually Mary Magdalene

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:12.680 align:middle line:90%
worked on my knee.

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:13.945 align:middle line:90%
That was over a year ago.

00:24:13.945 --> 00:24:15.090 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Lucky you.

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:17.340 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: I haven't worn
that knee band since.

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:19.510 align:middle line:84%
I have complete
and total mobility.

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:22.740 align:middle line:84%
And so that psychosomatic
aspect of it

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:24.720 align:middle line:84%
is really fascinating
to me, where

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:28.900 align:middle line:84%
you can have an experience
in the psychedelic realm

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.600 align:middle line:84%
and it translates into
the physical realm.

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.360 align:middle line:84%
In Phoenix, where
I live, there's

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:36.540 align:middle line:84%
an enormous plant
medicine community.

00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:42.180 align:middle line:84%
Doctors are now enrolled 100 at
a time in classes where they're

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:45.850 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to serve
ketamine and ultimately MDMA

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:46.800 align:middle line:90%
to their clients.

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:49.030 align:middle line:84%
One doctor, she runs
a cancer clinic.

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, I need every
single one of my patients

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:55.780 align:middle line:84%
to have this experience,
to free themselves,

00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:57.420 align:middle line:84%
because she used
it herself and was

00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:59.650 align:middle line:84%
able to get tremendous
benefit out of it.

00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And so what's happening
now is there's

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:04.620 align:middle line:90%
this tsunami that's rising.

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:08.970 align:middle line:84%
Canadian Psychedelic Association
told me that there's now over

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:12.400 align:middle line:90%
1,000 Ayahuasqueros in America.

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:15.780 align:middle line:84%
These are individuals that
are serving Ayahuasca plant

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:16.740 align:middle line:90%
medicine.

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Five years ago, there
were probably 50.

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.300 align:middle line:90%
It's 1,000 in 2024.

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:26.170 align:middle line:84%
It'll be double that
in 2025 at least.

00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And so what's
happening now is that--

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:30.160 align:middle line:90%
probably driven by tech.

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:33.370 align:middle line:84%
They know this is a
counterbalance to the AI.

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:35.203 align:middle line:90%
We have got to tap into these--

00:25:35.203 --> 00:25:37.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's an organic,
personal, internal experience.

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:38.470 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Right.

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And we've got to tap into
these higher ways of thinking.

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And we especially have
to open the heart.

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And so the government is saying,
yeah, we know this is happening.

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:48.850 align:middle line:90%
They're turning the other way.

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:51.225 align:middle line:84%
They're looking at fentanyl
and all the other crap that's

00:25:51.225 --> 00:25:55.320 align:middle line:84%
out there and allowing
this burgeoning industry

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:56.192 align:middle line:90%
really to emerge.

00:25:56.192 --> 00:25:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And the main thing
that they're concerned

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:01.290 align:middle line:84%
about as these molecules
and substances gain

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:04.150 align:middle line:84%
more and more mass
acceptance, which they are,

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:06.910 align:middle line:84%
is the component they
refer to as integration,

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:09.450 align:middle line:84%
is that how will people then,
after they have this healing

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:11.550 align:middle line:84%
experience, be able
then to integrate it

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:14.342 align:middle line:84%
into their mental, physical,
spiritual, and emotional life?

00:26:14.342 --> 00:26:15.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, daily lives.

00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:17.710 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: And this is what is
now we're seeing here within

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:19.040 align:middle line:90%
the plant medicine community.

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.780 align:middle line:84%
They're tremendously
responsible people.

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:25.390 align:middle line:84%
They recognize that this is
a key element to not only

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:27.950 align:middle line:84%
the healing but the
transformation of humanity

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:30.530 align:middle line:84%
because it's not something
you have to keep doing.

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:31.940 align:middle line:90%
It can be a one and done.

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:35.260 align:middle line:84%
You can have a single
psilocybin experience

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.450 align:middle line:84%
and release yourself
from traumas

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:39.890 align:middle line:84%
that you've been dragging
around for 20, 30 years.

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:42.555 align:middle line:84%
And now you go
forward in your life.

00:26:42.555 --> 00:26:45.295 align:middle line:84%
But with this
integration piece, it's

00:26:45.295 --> 00:26:47.120 align:middle line:84%
like within a
psychedelic experience.

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:48.820 align:middle line:90%
I have a friend that went to--

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:52.580 align:middle line:84%
had an Ayahuasca experience
completely transformed his life.

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yeah, I
was in this experience.

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:56.980 align:middle line:90%
And I'm seeing I'm in a lab.

00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:01.375 align:middle line:84%
And this Egyptian god with a
headdress on and this long beak

00:27:01.375 --> 00:27:02.892 align:middle line:90%
is in the room there with me.

00:27:02.892 --> 00:27:03.850 align:middle line:90%
And he's talking to me.

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, I have
no idea who that was.

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:09.550 align:middle line:84%
And I went and got a statue
of the Egyptian god, Thoth.

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:11.010 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yeah, that's him.

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:11.810 align:middle line:90%
That's who it was.

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's like the Egyptian
gods are practically

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.910 align:middle line:84%
the chamber of commerce
of the spirit world,

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:18.150 align:middle line:90%
of the psychedelic realm.

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:19.580 align:middle line:84%
This is how the
ancient Egyptians

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:20.580 align:middle line:90%
connected with the gods.

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:21.480 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubt about it.

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.105 align:middle line:84%
My work in the past
five years in Egypt

00:27:23.105 --> 00:27:25.790 align:middle line:84%
has demonstrated there's
psychedelic substances

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:28.010 align:middle line:84%
referenced throughout
the Egyptian texts

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:29.195 align:middle line:90%
and on the temple walls.

00:27:29.195 --> 00:27:30.570 align:middle line:84%
This is how they
were connecting.

00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's what drove me
into wanting to have a deeper

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.800 align:middle line:84%
interest in
understanding of this

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.900 align:middle line:84%
because traditional
archeology will say,

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:38.400 align:middle line:90%
oh, no, you can't do that.

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.757 align:middle line:90%
Science says you can't do that.

00:27:39.757 --> 00:27:41.340 align:middle line:84%
The government says
you can't do that.

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:44.900 align:middle line:84%
But this is all once again
about consciousness control.

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:46.170 align:middle line:90%
And that's what AI is.

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:49.370 align:middle line:84%
So if we have a way of
freeing our consciousness

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:53.240 align:middle line:84%
and can bring in these higher
ways of thinking or connection

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:55.247 align:middle line:84%
with these divine
beings, that's why

00:27:55.247 --> 00:27:56.455 align:middle line:90%
we need to do this right now.

00:27:56.455 --> 00:27:59.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you also say,
after Egypt and the time

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:02.660 align:middle line:84%
of the Essenes, who were
known for their intelligence

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:07.280 align:middle line:84%
and their very particularly
clean health practices among

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.970 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual practices, that
they also used entheogens?

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: There's no question
that the original Christian

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:17.100 align:middle line:84%
sacrament, their communion, the
manna that Jesus delivered was

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:18.120 align:middle line:90%
psychedelic.

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:21.400 align:middle line:10%
There's absolutely no question
about that among academics.

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:24.120 align:middle line:84%
It's only you get the religious
authorities that resist that.

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.260 align:middle line:84%
They've never experienced
it themselves.

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:29.020 align:middle line:84%
Once they do, they
will recognize, oh,

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:33.550 align:middle line:84%
so this is how 1,000 people,
for example, in the Galilee,

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:36.510 align:middle line:84%
would gather around Jesus
and spontaneously have this

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:38.740 align:middle line:84%
experience where they
all eat this manna.

00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:40.930 align:middle line:84%
They all see the
stairway to heaven.

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:42.850 align:middle line:90%
They all see this portal open.

00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And they see these divine
angels all around them.

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:47.830 align:middle line:90%
It's a duplicatable experience.

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:49.785 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they were doing.

00:28:49.785 --> 00:28:51.010 align:middle line:90%
That was the manna.

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:53.953 align:middle line:84%
The wine came from the
Galilee as well, that

00:28:53.953 --> 00:28:55.620 align:middle line:84%
was known for a couple
of thousand years

00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:58.060 align:middle line:84%
before the time of Jesus
that it was psychotropic.

00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:59.770 align:middle line:90%
And this is not opinion.

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:02.950 align:middle line:84%
This is the new archaeo
chemistry that's being done.

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:06.540 align:middle line:84%
They're able to analyze
the cups, the jars that are

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:07.953 align:middle line:90%
found at these sacred sites.

00:29:07.953 --> 00:29:09.370 align:middle line:84%
They do the chemistry
around them.

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:12.120 align:middle line:84%
They're like, oh, OK, these
were all psychedelic herbs

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.980 align:middle line:84%
that they were
mixing in this wine.

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And so they're not
drinking the wine

00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:20.800 align:middle line:84%
just as like we do today to get
out of our body or whatever.

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:24.160 align:middle line:84%
They were utilizing it to
connect with the divine realms.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's just our
culture that says

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:28.200 align:middle line:90%
you're not allowed to do that.

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.440 align:middle line:90%
But that's shifting now.

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.430 align:middle line:90%
That's what's changing.

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:34.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You're part of
a company that is starting

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.760 align:middle line:84%
to create an
educational platform?

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:38.225 align:middle line:90%
Starwalker Café is part of that.

00:29:38.225 --> 00:29:39.025 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Right.

00:29:39.025 --> 00:29:42.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And also you say
it's actually on the market.

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:44.580 align:middle line:90%
The stock symbol is SNNC.

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:45.430 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:47.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is
taking it big time.

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:49.390 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: This is
such a-- so fun.

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:52.170 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going down
this psychedelic path

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:54.210 align:middle line:84%
and recognizing,
OK, this is what

00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:55.960 align:middle line:84%
has been going on in
the ancient world.

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.310 align:middle line:90%
It's coming back into our world.

00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to get into
the development of some

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:01.900 align:middle line:84%
of these products from
a spiritual perspective

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:05.070 align:middle line:84%
because so much of what you see
out there is either new agey

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:07.960 align:middle line:84%
or, forgive me,
hippieish kind of thing.

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:11.450 align:middle line:84%
It's like, let's approach this
from a spiritual experience.

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:13.150 align:middle line:84%
Let's create places
and settings--

00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:13.910 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Make it more sacred.

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:15.160 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Make it more sacred.

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And so I meet this gentleman
who had this Ayahuasca

00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:20.050 align:middle line:90%
experience, a lawyer.

00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:21.560 align:middle line:90%
Completely changed his life.

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:22.850 align:middle line:90%
Starts a public company.

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:25.150 align:middle line:84%
It's called Sibannac, which
is the word "cannabis"

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:26.390 align:middle line:90%
spelled backwards.

00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I want to
develop those products.

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:31.420 align:middle line:90%
And so we get together.

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And I become a spokesperson
and an equity partner

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:36.350 align:middle line:90%
in the company.

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:38.140 align:middle line:90%
And as many know--

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:39.710 align:middle line:90%
I know you do, Regina--

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:43.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm deeply interested in the
Essenes and anything Essenic

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:44.360 align:middle line:90%
to do with that.

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:47.500 align:middle line:84%
How did they attain
this angelimorphication

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.910 align:middle line:84%
or human transformation
into an angelic being?

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:51.290 align:middle line:90%
And what were they utilizing?

00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:52.250 align:middle line:90%
What was in their oils?

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:53.270 align:middle line:90%
What was in their wine?

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:54.920 align:middle line:90%
And what was that manna?

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And so the stock symbol for
Sibannac is SNNC, Essenic.

00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:00.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Essenic.

00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:04.580 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: And I'm like,
OK, this is like a dream.

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And so it's been a really
exciting opportunity

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:11.420 align:middle line:84%
to get involved and to
try to guide this forward.

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And as I mentioned, there's
plant medicine communities

00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:14.930 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:16.388 align:middle line:84%
But particularly,
it's concentrated

00:31:16.388 --> 00:31:17.810 align:middle line:90%
in Phoenix for some reason.

00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And medical doctors,
scientists are all

00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:22.910 align:middle line:84%
flocking now into
this area and saying,

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:25.600 align:middle line:84%
OK, we're going to help
to responsibly develop

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:28.490 align:middle line:84%
these products so that
we can heal the world.

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:30.437 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
this is all about.

00:31:30.437 --> 00:31:32.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And part of that,
and as you're talking about

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:36.610 align:middle line:84%
the Essenes, has to take us
back to the one thing I said

00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:37.610 align:middle line:90%
in the very beginning.

00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:42.280 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing the clutches of the
dying breaths of the patriarchy.

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:43.520 align:middle line:90%
AI is patriarchal.

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:44.840 align:middle line:90%
It is male, period.

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:45.260 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Without a doubt.

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:45.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is not female.

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:46.305 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: 100%

00:31:46.305 --> 00:31:47.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: 100% male.

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:50.338 align:middle line:90%


00:31:50.338 --> 00:31:52.960 align:middle line:84%
You and Marguerite
have worked together.

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And you have what
I think you said

00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:57.940 align:middle line:84%
your third or fourth
wave of intense interest

00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:00.400 align:middle line:90%
now in Mary Magdalene again.

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:02.510 align:middle line:90%
And this all comes back around--

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:05.090 align:middle line:84%
all of it comes back
around to saying,

00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:10.325 align:middle line:84%
no, we're no longer engaging
in your domineering ways.

00:32:10.325 --> 00:32:13.600 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have to take more
of the path of the feminine men

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:14.400 align:middle line:90%
and women.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't
mean feminizing men.

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:20.630 align:middle line:84%
It means to be open and
to be able to nurture

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:22.120 align:middle line:90%
and to build a future together.

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:23.090 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Absolutely.

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:24.155 align:middle line:90%
And to remain organic.

00:32:24.155 --> 00:32:25.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And to
remain organic.

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:26.305 align:middle line:90%
That's the feminine.

00:32:26.305 --> 00:32:26.830 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Right.

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:28.940 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about the
rise of the divine feminine

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:32.010 align:middle line:84%
and especially, again, these
waves of the Magdalene, I mean,

00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:35.480 align:middle line:84%
remember 1982, first wave,
then we had another one

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:37.860 align:middle line:84%
in the '90s with
Margaret Starbird,

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:39.300 align:middle line:90%
Woman with the Alabaster Jar.

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:39.506 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:32:39.506 --> 00:32:40.306 align:middle line:90%
I remember her.

00:32:40.306 --> 00:32:42.840 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Laurence
Gardner, his work.

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:43.882 align:middle line:90%
And Dan Brown, of course.

00:32:43.882 --> 00:32:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Bloodline
of the Holy Grail.

00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Bloodline
of the Holy Grail.

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
there's priestesses

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:51.200 align:middle line:84%
all over the planet that are
tapping into the Magdalene

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.362 align:middle line:90%
frequency.

00:32:52.362 --> 00:32:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And when you really look
at the Magdalene story

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:57.290 align:middle line:84%
with an open and
honest mind and ask,

00:32:57.290 --> 00:32:59.520 align:middle line:90%
what was in her alabaster jar?

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:01.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, we know what was
in her alabaster jar.

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.000 align:middle line:90%
It was psychotropic.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.270 align:middle line:90%
They were mirror force.

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:08.220 align:middle line:84%
These oil bearers were creating
these sacred sacraments

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:11.310 align:middle line:84%
that opened the heart, opened
our consciousness, all the way

00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:14.110 align:middle line:84%
up to dissolving the flesh
and blood body into light,

00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:16.300 align:middle line:84%
as happened with the
resurrection of Jesus.

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And so the plant medicine
that they were using then

00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:24.310 align:middle line:84%
is coming back around
now because we need it.

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And now is the time for us
to make this transformation,

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:32.500 align:middle line:84%
to make this leap into a
higher form of human being.

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
think the Magdalene

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:36.160 align:middle line:90%
wave is so important right now.

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I agree with you.

00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And as you're
speaking, I'm reminded

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.170 align:middle line:90%
of something else in the book.

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:42.840 align:middle line:90%
I refer to, The Future Human.

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:46.410 align:middle line:84%
One thing that Zeus said,
this is the end game

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:50.310 align:middle line:84%
for humanity, this
transformation, this iteration

00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:51.520 align:middle line:90%
that we're moving into.

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:55.470 align:middle line:84%
They said, more or less the
Holy Grail for the human

00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:59.070 align:middle line:84%
is now to start running
mind through heart.

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And this species not only has
the capability of doing it.

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:04.860 align:middle line:84%
We're beginning
to do it, and that

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:08.679 align:middle line:84%
will be how the mind is
utilized in the future en masse.

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:10.469 align:middle line:84%
And that is
something that beings

00:34:10.469 --> 00:34:12.600 align:middle line:84%
from throughout the
universe are watching.

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:16.000 align:middle line:84%
You've never had this dense a
matter of a third dimension.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:16.800 align:middle line:90%
It's hard.

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.360 align:middle line:90%
It's hard work.

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:22.210 align:middle line:84%
There's so much resistance
in it, friction,

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And to have the heart
beginning to become the filter

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:30.090 align:middle line:90%
for the mind, that is it.

00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying
that that is what

00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:34.630 align:middle line:84%
the Essenes and the
Egyptians and the Atlanteans

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:38.670 align:middle line:84%
and now the people like yourself
in Phoenix, Arizona, are doing,

00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:42.210 align:middle line:84%
is attempting to help us
run mind through heart.

00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And they said it
will be accomplished.

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:45.230 align:middle line:90%
You will be this species.

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:46.630 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: I truly believe that.

00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And to go back to what
we said a moment ago,

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:52.018 align:middle line:84%
the Holy Grail for the tech
giants is to break human will.

00:34:52.018 --> 00:34:52.851 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:34:52.851 --> 00:34:56.610 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: And so here
is the counterbalance.

00:34:56.610 --> 00:34:58.560 align:middle line:84%
If we can free ourselves
from that trauma

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:00.670 align:middle line:84%
and free ourselves
from that control,

00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:04.820 align:middle line:84%
indisputably know there's
something beyond, that

00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:07.290 align:middle line:84%
then diminishes the power
of these tech lords.

00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:08.620 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Let's hope.

00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:10.673 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk for a
little bit about just--

00:35:10.673 --> 00:35:11.840 align:middle line:90%
we have a few minutes left--

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:14.380 align:middle line:84%
Starwalker Café and
how you're engaging

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:18.700 align:middle line:84%
with younger people, these
shiny-eyed, open-minded people

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:20.840 align:middle line:84%
that are going to be
building something new.

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:25.960 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: So Starwalker Café
is primarily an information

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:32.230 align:middle line:84%
platform devoted to integration,
people that are most notably

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:35.620 align:middle line:84%
having psychedelic experiences
or other spiritual experiences,

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:38.775 align:middle line:84%
in not knowing who
they're connecting with.

00:35:38.775 --> 00:35:40.150 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned,
the story about--

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:41.275 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's an issue.

00:35:41.275 --> 00:35:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: It's huge because they
have these incredible spiritual

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:46.280 align:middle line:90%
experiences with a divine being.

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:50.440 align:middle line:84%
But they don't know who they
are and how to fit it in.

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:54.860 align:middle line:84%
As I like to say, people are
doing meditation, breathwork,

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:57.200 align:middle line:90%
psychedelics, whatever it is.

00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:00.530 align:middle line:84%
That's like the plastic
thing is what's missing.

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:02.240 align:middle line:84%
They've got the six
pack lined up here.

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:05.170 align:middle line:84%
But they need the plastic thing
that holds it all together.

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Starwalker
Café is meant to be,

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:09.730 align:middle line:84%
is to say, OK, this is
a human experience we've

00:36:09.730 --> 00:36:11.990 align:middle line:90%
been having for millennia.

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:15.430 align:middle line:84%
And now we need to train
ourselves to understand

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:20.030 align:middle line:84%
what is out here and to also to
make contact with these beings.

00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:22.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've been on
ancient aliens for 14 years

00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:25.330 align:middle line:84%
now where we've well-documented
extraterrestrials

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:26.530 align:middle line:90%
have come here.

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:30.640 align:middle line:84%
Now is the time for humans
to go there in consciousness.

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
Starwalker Café is about,

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:34.930 align:middle line:84%
is to say, OK, let's
gather people together

00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:36.560 align:middle line:84%
that are having
these experiences.

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.840 align:middle line:90%
Let's network them together.

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:41.720 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about this in a
way that makes it normal,

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:46.608 align:middle line:84%
not some kind of illegal
psychedelic sort of thing.

00:36:46.608 --> 00:36:48.650 align:middle line:84%
It's consciousness that
we're talking about here.

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:49.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, and
it's important, too.

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:51.672 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to
bring one little caveat in.

00:36:51.672 --> 00:36:54.070 align:middle line:84%
There are some people
when they are having

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:56.810 align:middle line:84%
these experiences
alone and unattended,

00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:59.090 align:middle line:90%
you're open to all dimensions.

00:36:59.090 --> 00:37:03.530 align:middle line:84%
You can have experiences
with beings from other lower

00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:05.780 align:middle line:84%
dimensions that are more
challenging and a little more

00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:07.290 align:middle line:90%
dark experience.

00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's why if you're
with someone that's trained,

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:12.620 align:middle line:84%
they've seen it all,
recognize it all,

00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:16.280 align:middle line:84%
to help a person through why
that connection is happening

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:19.850 align:middle line:84%
in that moment and moving
it up into that higher

00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:20.650 align:middle line:90%
kind of connection.

00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:21.740 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Absolutely.

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And my ultimate vision
with Starwalker Café,

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:26.850 align:middle line:84%
it starts out as
an online platform.

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:31.040 align:middle line:84%
But one day, it will be across
the street from Starbucks.

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:32.957 align:middle line:84%
And we will start coming
over here for these--

00:37:32.957 --> 00:37:34.123 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Little microdose.

00:37:34.123 --> 00:37:35.040 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Exactly.

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.470 align:middle line:10%
Well, this is what
we're going to need

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:37.678 align:middle line:10%
and what we're going to want.

00:37:37.678 --> 00:37:39.470 align:middle line:10%
And so I want to be
involved in this to,

00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:41.098 align:middle line:10%
one, provide a
platform for people

00:37:41.098 --> 00:37:43.640 align:middle line:10%
to bring this because there are
so many people out there that

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:46.070 align:middle line:10%
are developing these
new products now

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:48.890 align:middle line:10%
that will accentuate
our consciousness,

00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:50.840 align:middle line:10%
and to have a place
to present them

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:53.090 align:middle line:10%
and offer them and
make it normal to go

00:37:53.090 --> 00:37:55.860 align:middle line:10%
in to get maybe a
psilocybin microdose

00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:58.705 align:middle line:10%
or an Amanita microdose that
accentuates consciousness,

00:37:58.705 --> 00:37:59.505 align:middle line:10%
open the heart.

00:37:59.505 --> 00:38:01.962 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Any final
thoughts, William, on this?

00:38:01.962 --> 00:38:03.670 align:middle line:84%
This has been a
fascinating conversation.

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:04.920 align:middle line:90%
It's gone fast like lightning.

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:05.740 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: It has.

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:07.138 align:middle line:90%
And thank you for having me.

00:38:07.138 --> 00:38:08.180 align:middle line:90%
It's so great to see you.

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:08.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Always.

00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:08.680 align:middle line:90%
It's lovely.

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:09.480 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Always.

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:10.420 align:middle line:90%
And we're here.

00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And so let's make
the most of it.

00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:15.540 align:middle line:84%
Again, with the
Starwalker Café, my logo

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:19.420 align:middle line:84%
comes from an ancient
Egyptian sarcophagus.

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:22.210 align:middle line:84%
And it has the Starwalker
on the boat of eternity.

00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And my goal is to put people
on that boat of higher

00:38:24.930 --> 00:38:25.900 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:28.230 align:middle line:84%
He also holds a
staff in his hand

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:31.880 align:middle line:84%
that puts him in resonance with
the universal forces, high bliss

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:32.680 align:middle line:90%
and love.

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:34.870 align:middle line:84%
I want to help you put
that staff in your hand.

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:36.550 align:middle line:90%
And then he also holds a star.

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And I want to help people draw
down that power of the star

00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:42.880 align:middle line:84%
and open the doors into those
higher dimensional realms

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:45.610 align:middle line:84%
because that is where
we're at right now.

00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:47.180 align:middle line:84%
We're all like Noah
needing a boat.

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:47.980 align:middle line:90%
And here it is.

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you
were born to do it.

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:50.980 align:middle line:84%
I've known you for
a long time now.

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:51.940 align:middle line:90%
And you walk your talk.

00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:53.740 align:middle line:90%
You do live in that state.

00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And it is your true human
desire to assist other people

00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:58.650 align:middle line:90%
into this higher ground.

00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:01.535 align:middle line:90%
So it's SNNC, Essenic?

00:39:01.535 --> 00:39:02.600 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Essenic, yes.

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:03.400 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Essenic.

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:03.845 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:03.845 --> 00:39:05.045 align:middle line:90%
That's the stock symbol.

00:39:05.045 --> 00:39:06.102 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:06.102 --> 00:39:09.040 align:middle line:10%
So I guess if someone's
looking for a good vacation,

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:10.920 align:middle line:10%
maybe take a little
trip to Phoenix

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:14.075 align:middle line:10%
and start your healing
of your trauma there.

00:39:14.075 --> 00:39:16.230 align:middle line:10%
>> HENRY: Visit my
website williamhenry.net.

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:18.450 align:middle line:10%
You can access the
Starwalker Café from there.

00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:20.680 align:middle line:10%
And come on board the boat.

00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:21.760 align:middle line:90%
We're happy to have you.

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:23.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: William, I'm so
happy we had this conversation.

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:24.010 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Me too.

00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:26.218 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's important
for people to understand we

00:39:26.218 --> 00:39:27.870 align:middle line:90%
don't have to succumb to AI.

00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:29.285 align:middle line:90%
It will ultimately be a choice.

00:39:29.285 --> 00:39:30.090 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Exactly.

00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:31.493 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So thank you so much.

00:39:31.493 --> 00:39:32.410 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: My pleasure.

00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:33.210 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:34.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wow.

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:37.203 align:middle line:84%
We've been to the past,
to the future, and back.

00:39:37.203 --> 00:39:39.370 align:middle line:84%

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:46.120 align:middle line:90%
that led up to this.

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:49.590 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Open Minds.
