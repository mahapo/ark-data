>>REGINA MEREDITH: The
hurtful experiences we all

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.270 align:middle line:10%
go through or not done
and over with just

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.920 align:middle line:10%
because we think we've
processed the emotions.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.010 align:middle line:10%
Those traumas remain hidden in
our body and nervous system,

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.800 align:middle line:10%
ultimately becoming embedded
in our subconscious mind.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.030 align:middle line:10%
That is, if we don't release it.

David Berceli has been
assisting returning

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.870 align:middle line:10%
soldiers to everyday
people release

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.690 align:middle line:10%
their trauma through his
highly effective trauma release

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:50.830 align:middle line:10%
process.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:51.856 align:middle line:90%
This is big.

00:00:51.856 --> 00:00:53.570 align:middle line:90%
This is a big deal this.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.720 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID BERCELI: What
really is true about trauma

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.220 align:middle line:10%
is that every living species on
the planet experiences trauma.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.320 align:middle line:84%
So that could be plants going
through droughts or floods,

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.310 align:middle line:84%
animals going through all
sorts of types of traumas.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.170 align:middle line:10%
And humans go through traumas.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.170 align:middle line:10%
But I think we have had
it speed up, particularly

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.690 align:middle line:10%
to the human species.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.730 align:middle line:84%
Because the intensity
with which we

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.070 align:middle line:84%
live life now and the
intensity of communications

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.880 align:middle line:84%
that we have-- so that we
are vicariously experiencing

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.150 align:middle line:84%
traumas all over the world, by
the plane crashes we just had,

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.710 align:middle line:84%
earthquakes,
tsunamis that we see.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.540 align:middle line:84%
We are vicariously experiencing
it through the television.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.765 align:middle line:84%
And so, you have to accept
that our species has

00:01:36.765 --> 00:01:40.510 align:middle line:84%
a larger than
previously experienced

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.404 align:middle line:84%
trauma experience
in their lives.

00:01:42.404 --> 00:01:44.070 align:middle line:84%
So then, the question
becomes, how do we

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.340 align:middle line:90%
deal with this in reality?

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
and not only that.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're responsible
for exposing ourselves

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.452 align:middle line:90%
to a lot of it.

00:01:51.452 --> 00:01:52.535 align:middle line:90%
That's our responsibility.

00:01:52.535 --> 00:01:52.880 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Right.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And in
fact, yesterday I

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.390 align:middle line:84%
was having this conversation
about having access

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.170 align:middle line:90%
to online programming.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.720 align:middle line:84%
People are now more
binge watching.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And we tend to be addicted
to the really dramatic types

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.650 align:middle line:84%
of programs that have a lot
of trauma embedded in them.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:09.358 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Right.

00:02:09.358 --> 00:02:12.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so, you get
done dosing yourself on four

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.207 align:middle line:84%
episodes of something really
traumatic, like, "Homeland"

00:02:15.207 --> 00:02:15.790 align:middle line:90%
or something--

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.498 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: Addiction
is the perfect word.

00:02:17.498 --> 00:02:19.210 align:middle line:90%
Because we keep seeking it.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.990 align:middle line:84%
Because it gives
us an adrenal rush.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.825 align:middle line:84%
And that make us feel alive
and excited and more excited

00:02:24.825 --> 00:02:25.880 align:middle line:90%
and more alive.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.210 align:middle line:84%
But then, we actually
have an adrenal overload,

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.220 align:middle line:84%
where we become so
addicted that we

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.130 align:middle line:84%
can't stop watching these things
that cause us to be highly

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.360 align:middle line:90%
aroused in our nervous systems.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And so, we are in
fact a species that is

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.720 align:middle line:90%
capable of traumatizing itself.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.050 align:middle line:84%
Different from animals
that only experience

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.094 align:middle line:84%
trauma when another
animal is chasing them.

00:02:46.094 --> 00:02:47.760 align:middle line:84%
Other than that, they
lay around and eat

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.730 align:middle line:90%
and feel happy and glad.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.430 align:middle line:84%
We actually seek out
trauma-inducing behaviors.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.214 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's so unhealthy!

00:02:56.214 --> 00:02:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: Well,
we hear about it.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.300 align:middle line:90%
I get an adrenaline rush!

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.140 align:middle line:90%
It feels great!

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.840 align:middle line:90%
It makes me feel alive!

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.550 align:middle line:84%
The question is, why
can't we feel alive

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.706 align:middle line:90%
without a high adrenaline rush?

00:03:06.706 --> 00:03:08.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is a
very good question.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.205 align:middle line:84%
I hope we're going to
get the answer to that.

00:03:10.205 --> 00:03:11.740 align:middle line:84%
But first, I want
to start with you

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.230 align:middle line:84%
and just getting
into your background.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.896 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Sure.

00:03:13.896 --> 00:03:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
you've lived, you

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.160 align:middle line:90%
have worked all over the world.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.060 align:middle line:90%
And just give us a background.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Palestine,
Lebanon, Northern Ireland--

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.970 align:middle line:84%
you went into all the
really war torn areas

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.664 align:middle line:84%
with extremely high
levels of trauma.

00:03:25.664 --> 00:03:26.330 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Yeah.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.340 align:middle line:84%
I happened to be working with
a nonprofit organization, which

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.350 align:middle line:90%
was Maryknoll.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.120 align:middle line:84%
It was a Catholic
relief foundation

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.850 align:middle line:90%
that I was working with.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And my job was to be in the
Middle East at the time.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.460 align:middle line:90%
I studied Arabic.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm fluent in it still.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.607 align:middle line:84%
And I was to study
the Arab culture

00:03:42.607 --> 00:03:44.190 align:middle line:84%
and figure out, how
do you live in it?

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.000 align:middle line:90%
How do you dialogue with Islam?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.720 align:middle line:90%
--and all that sort of thing.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.200 align:middle line:84%
In that process, I lived in
countries that were at war.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And there was tremendous
amount of violence there.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And after I left
those countries,

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:57.980 align:middle line:84%
I ended up in other
countries that

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.250 align:middle line:84%
also had a tremendous amount
of either violence, poverty,

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:07.020 align:middle line:84%
or some type of traumatic
experience in these countries.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And so, I saw millions
of traumatized people.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And that shattered, if
you will, my paradigm of,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.579 align:middle line:84%
how does somebody
recover from trauma?

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:18.829 align:middle line:90%
What is trauma?

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.920 align:middle line:84%
How do we deal with it as a
large population of people?

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.290 align:middle line:84%
--rather than just an
individual being traumatized

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.280 align:middle line:90%
and doing personal counseling.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So did you notice
that cultures-- I mean,

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.950 align:middle line:84%
I just find this fascinating
on a personal level--

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.390 align:middle line:84%
that each culture
deals with their trauma

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:36.620 align:middle line:90%
in a different way?

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And can you tell
us what that looks

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.110 align:middle line:84%
like in the Middle East compared
to, say, Northern Ireland

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.630 align:middle line:90%
or America?

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.470 align:middle line:84%
Give us some examples of how we
each deal with it collectively.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: Well,
collectively-- there

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.100 align:middle line:84%
is such a thing as
cultural trauma,

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.510 align:middle line:84%
trans-generational
trauma, societal trauma.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.650 align:middle line:84%
When we hear of a
school shooting here

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.670 align:middle line:84%
in the United States, that
can be a societal trauma.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.990 align:middle line:84%
We hear too many of
them and our society

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.170 align:middle line:84%
feels like it's fracturing
and getting bad,

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.080 align:middle line:84%
and we're having
difficult times.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.550 align:middle line:84%
So that's societal, cultural,
and trans-generational trauma.

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.030 align:middle line:84%
Even in Europe, from
the Second World War,

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.200 align:middle line:84%
you see children who are still
traumatized from their parents

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.410 align:middle line:90%
being traumatized.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:16.910 align:middle line:90%
So here's what happens.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.780 align:middle line:84%
The trauma expression itself
manifests itself through,

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.350 align:middle line:84%
usually, culturally
acceptable ways.

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.940 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, you have a tremendous
amount of aggressive energy,

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.410 align:middle line:90%
which is what the trauma does.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.140 align:middle line:84%
It builds up an
energetic charge.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.450 align:middle line:84%
But you're not allowed
to socially express it

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.040 align:middle line:90%
by beating people up.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.320 align:middle line:84%
So you'll get it
through societal means

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.520 align:middle line:84%
of some sort of domestic
violence or family abuse.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.260 align:middle line:84%
But the domestic violence
may look culturally different

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.190 align:middle line:90%
in each country.

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.570 align:middle line:84%
One country may use manipulation
and control of the children.

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.890 align:middle line:84%
Another country will use
beating of the children.

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.760 align:middle line:84%
Another country will
use distancing the child

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.070 align:middle line:90%
from the family.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:01.150 align:middle line:84%
So we all find a way to
express that built-up energy.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.780 align:middle line:84%
But it gets fed
through the culture.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.430 align:middle line:84%
Because you wouldn't
find in Asia,

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.280 align:middle line:84%
as an example, a
lot of people that

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.370 align:middle line:84%
would be expressing some of
their traumas aggressively.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.910 align:middle line:84%
Because they have more of
a social consciousness.

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.180 align:middle line:84%
But they may binge drink
and, then, become alcoholic

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.230 align:middle line:90%
and be drunk every night.

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.752 align:middle line:84%
Then, family violence comes
through the drunkenness.

00:06:20.752 --> 00:06:22.960 align:middle line:84%
But what they've done is
they've turned that behavior

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:23.880 align:middle line:90%
in on themselves.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.860 align:middle line:90%
Soldiers do that a lot too.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.470 align:middle line:84%
They feel traumatized
when they come back

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.050 align:middle line:90%
from Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.810 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to express
that trauma to their family

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.070 align:middle line:90%
members or their spouses.

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And so, what they'll do
is they'll turn it inward.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And then, they withdraw
from the family.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:45.065 align:middle line:84%
Then, when the family member
tries to pull them back in,

00:06:45.065 --> 00:06:46.690 align:middle line:84%
the only way they
can be pulled back in

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:48.539 align:middle line:90%
is with violent expression.

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:50.580 align:middle line:84%
So they're either violently
expressing themselves

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.190 align:middle line:90%
or completely withdrawn.

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's a terrible
cycle to be stuck in.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It seems like Russia
has had an issue for quite

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.460 align:middle line:84%
a long time because
of whatever trauma

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.270 align:middle line:84%
they went through,
through the wars

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:05.570 align:middle line:84%
and also through the
political system itself.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.959 align:middle line:84%
So drinking seemed to be
prominent there and in some

00:07:07.959 --> 00:07:09.000 align:middle line:90%
of the northern climates.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Exactly right.

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:11.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about
in the Arabic nations

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.330 align:middle line:84%
where drinking is
actually even discouraged?

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:14.581 align:middle line:90%
How does it show itself there?

00:07:14.581 --> 00:07:16.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: Well
then, you can see it

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.850 align:middle line:84%
through repression of
children, repression

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:20.150 align:middle line:90%
of women, strict rules.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:24.625 align:middle line:84%
Religion is a really
difficult area to deal with.

00:07:24.625 --> 00:07:25.875 align:middle line:90%
And this isn't just for Islam.

00:07:25.875 --> 00:07:27.310 align:middle line:90%
It's for every religion.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:30.120 align:middle line:84%
But traumatized people
will take religion,

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.090 align:middle line:84%
because it's
culturally acceptable.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And they'll express aggression
through religious "legalities,"

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:37.257 align:middle line:90%
in a sense.

00:07:37.257 --> 00:07:38.340 align:middle line:90%
And so, you can find this.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.620 align:middle line:84%
We saw this in the Catholic
Church all the time.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And you can find it in a lot
of the Protestant churches,

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:49.010 align:middle line:84%
non-denominational groups
that really have violence

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:52.180 align:middle line:84%
as an expression of,
quote, "the love of God."

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.500 align:middle line:90%
And that's a confusion.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And you have to ask,
why is that confused?

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:59.870 align:middle line:84%
When someone can say,
Jesus hates you--

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.630 align:middle line:84%
as an example-- well,
there's a conflict in that.

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:04.440 align:middle line:84%
Because the message
of Jesus is love

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.090 align:middle line:84%
and acceptance and tolerance
and all that sort of stuff.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.390 align:middle line:84%
But to say Jesus
would hate somebody

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:11.930 align:middle line:84%
is a suggestion that there's
something else that's

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:13.450 align:middle line:90%
going on underneath that.

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's some type
of violent expression

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.910 align:middle line:84%
that the person
can't socially feel

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:20.840 align:middle line:90%
comfortable to directly say it.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.120 align:middle line:84%
So they need somebody
on their side

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.200 align:middle line:84%
to justify that
expression of hatred.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.745 align:middle line:90%
And they'll use their religion.

00:08:27.745 --> 00:08:29.565 align:middle line:84%
This is very common
around the world.

00:08:29.565 --> 00:08:32.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so I'm just
taking it regionally.

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:34.140 align:middle line:84%
What about South American
and Latin countries,

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:37.419 align:middle line:84%
where people are known to have
more expressive personalities

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:38.610 align:middle line:90%
or tempers?

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:39.909 align:middle line:90%
How does it show there?

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:41.789 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: Yeah,
or they can have

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:45.230 align:middle line:84%
a lot of social
violence going on there.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:46.820 align:middle line:84%
So let's take Brazil
as an example.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:47.750 align:middle line:90%
I was just there last month.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was just
thinking of that, yeah.

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: So you've got a
lot of expressive people,

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:53.580 align:middle line:90%
beautiful culture, wonderful.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:56.480 align:middle line:84%
Tremendous, tremendous
poverty there.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And great diversity between the
extremely wealthy and extremely

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.109 align:middle line:84%
poor, and very
small middle class--

00:09:03.109 --> 00:09:05.650 align:middle line:84%
much like you see happening in
the rest of the world as well.

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:09.180 align:middle line:84%
But you have this tremendous
violence that goes on

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:14.380 align:middle line:84%
and drug use that goes on inside
of these poverty-driven areas.

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And then, you have this
completely wealthy group

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.110 align:middle line:84%
that stay distant
from themselves

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.120 align:middle line:84%
and have no social
connection to that.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.850 align:middle line:84%
So you see, right
in the society,

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:26.010 align:middle line:84%
violence will manifest
itself through finances

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:28.740 align:middle line:84%
or social structures, those
sorts of things-- inequities.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.960 align:middle line:84%
It almost always manifests
in some form of inequity,

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:36.410 align:middle line:84%
whether it's men dominating
women, or rich dominating poor,

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:40.420 align:middle line:84%
or politicians
dominating the economics.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:45.230 align:middle line:84%
Those are all expressions of
traumatic unresolved behavior

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:46.050 align:middle line:90%
patterns.

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:47.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's take the US.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.424 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: Yeah, we have
a perfect example of that.

00:09:49.424 --> 00:09:52.280 align:middle line:84%
We see our split also happening
between rich and poor.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:55.620 align:middle line:84%
Middle classes is really
distancing itself.

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And then, we see
all this violence

00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:00.000 align:middle line:84%
that's going on in the
school systems and--

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Bizarre types--

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:01.875 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Absolutely.

00:10:01.875 --> 00:10:02.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --of expressions.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.783 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: And so you see
these bizarre expression

00:10:04.783 --> 00:10:05.780 align:middle line:90%
starting to pop out.

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:08.520 align:middle line:84%
But when you have a whole
population that's already

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.765 align:middle line:84%
so hyperactive,
one expression will

00:10:12.765 --> 00:10:14.140 align:middle line:84%
give birth to
another expression,

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:15.610 align:middle line:90%
and another, and another.

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Because the culture is rich
for that to begin happening.

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:21.615 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I see
happening all the time too--

00:10:21.615 --> 00:10:24.090 align:middle line:84%
and we're seeing it a lot
and I feel sad about it--

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:28.700 align:middle line:84%
but the whole question
about police violence

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.580 align:middle line:90%
among the general population.

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.230 align:middle line:84%
We already know--
this is unquestioned--

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:36.810 align:middle line:84%
that the police are a
traumatized population as well.

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:38.260 align:middle line:90%
And they can't help but be.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying
they're bad people.

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:41.740 align:middle line:84%
I believe they're
really good people.

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:45.260 align:middle line:84%
But they're put in circumstances
where, basically, they're

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.240 align:middle line:84%
saying, here, we're
going to put you

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.100 align:middle line:90%
in a traumatizing profession.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:51.380 align:middle line:84%
We guarantee it's going
to traumatize you.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.070 align:middle line:84%
But we're not going
to give you any help

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.440 align:middle line:84%
to actually work through
that in a healthy manner.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.140 align:middle line:84%
So police departments,
fire departments,

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:01.240 align:middle line:84%
emergency medical
teams are being

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:04.070 align:middle line:90%
traumatized professionally.

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we still don't
insert consciously

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.990 align:middle line:84%
some way of helping them to
deal with these traumatic

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:11.207 align:middle line:90%
experiences they're having.

00:11:11.207 --> 00:11:12.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's true.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:16.820 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend who
was a beat cop.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And his partner was
shot and died in his arm

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.570 align:middle line:84%
while they were
chasing someone down.

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:25.250 align:middle line:84%
His girlfriend--
who was also a cop--

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:27.840 align:middle line:84%
died just before
that in a car chase.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.770 align:middle line:90%
And her car crashed.

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And this person
was so traumatized.

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:36.580 align:middle line:90%
And at the time, I thought, wow!

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:37.340 align:middle line:90%
What a disconnect.

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:38.214 align:middle line:90%
But it really wasn't.

00:11:38.214 --> 00:11:41.794 align:middle line:84%
His self-medication was he would
take raspberry bubble baths.

00:11:41.794 --> 00:11:43.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: Well,
that's wonderful.

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:43.736 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's healthy.

00:11:43.736 --> 00:11:46.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, raspberry
bubble baths and eat sushi--

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.080 align:middle line:84%
and had this, just, very
delicate personal life trying

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.150 align:middle line:90%
to offset the trauma of--

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:51.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Exactly right.

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --going
to work every day.

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:53.839 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: And that works too.

00:11:53.839 --> 00:11:55.620 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a way
of balancing it out.

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.910 align:middle line:84%
Our problem is that
we're not supporting it.

00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And not only do we not support
policemen, firemen, EMTs,

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:04.880 align:middle line:84%
soldiers, et cetera, they
actually get a check mark.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.800 align:middle line:84%
That if they said, I think
I'm traumatized, I need help

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.750 align:middle line:84%
or I need counseling
or whatever,

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:12.260 align:middle line:90%
that could be seen as bad.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore,
they don't report it.

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.250 align:middle line:84%
Because then, they might not
get their next promotion.

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:20.020 align:middle line:84%
So not only do we traumatize
them and not help them,

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:21.800 align:middle line:84%
we actually build
in an impediment

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.230 align:middle line:84%
to ensure they don't
seek the help they need.

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:27.330 align:middle line:84%
So we are the result of why
our police department is

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.000 align:middle line:84%
being traumatized and
acting out violently

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.330 align:middle line:84%
and why black populations are
traumatized and acting out

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.319 align:middle line:84%
violently, even
white populations.

00:12:35.319 --> 00:12:36.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It makes sense.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.964 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: The whole thing
is a trauma-driven culture.

00:12:38.964 --> 00:12:39.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:41.549 align:middle line:84%
Now OK, we haven't
gotten to the Canadians.

00:12:41.549 --> 00:12:42.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm assuming, what?

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.270 align:middle line:90%
Molson?

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:44.827 align:middle line:90%
Is Molson the trauma control?

00:12:44.827 --> 00:12:45.535 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Right.

00:12:45.535 --> 00:12:49.940 align:middle line:84%
But see, it's literally
all over the world.

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And so, we could say that we
could see expressions of this

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:54.420 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:57.630 align:middle line:84%
If you understand
the primary thing,

00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:00.240 align:middle line:84%
why would someone
act out in a behavior

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:04.160 align:middle line:84%
that would be violent
against the society itself?

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.730 align:middle line:84%
There has to be something
that's inducing that behavior.

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And when it does it
on a societal level

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:14.050 align:middle line:84%
or mass cultural level--
bombings of schools

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:16.560 align:middle line:84%
and hospitals or
whatever we're bombing--

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.040 align:middle line:84%
you have to ask yourself,
what's giving rise

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:23.320 align:middle line:84%
to the human species being
so violent towards itself?

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And that has to be some type
of trauma-induced behavior

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:30.705 align:middle line:84%
that's expressing itself
through social structures.

00:13:30.705 --> 00:13:31.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And so, get before we get
further into your story--

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.420 align:middle line:84%
because I love your
story personally.

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:37.520 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you were a monk.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.057 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about the
notion of medicating oneself

00:13:41.057 --> 00:13:41.890 align:middle line:90%
through video games.

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:44.020 align:middle line:84%
Because this is now
a global phenomena.

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of those games
are just ratcheting

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.682 align:middle line:84%
up the same chemicals
in the brain further.

00:13:48.682 --> 00:13:49.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Right.

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:49.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:51.408 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: Yeah,
what's happening--

00:13:51.408 --> 00:13:54.280 align:middle line:84%
and obviously, they don't
want a lot of research

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.900 align:middle line:90%
on this to really talk about it.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.600 align:middle line:84%
But yes, there's
clear evidence already

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.630 align:middle line:84%
that suggests all these violent
games, these video games

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:06.510 align:middle line:84%
that children grow up playing,
actually begin to hyperarouse

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:07.860 align:middle line:90%
their nervous system.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.830 align:middle line:90%
And so, they live in that state.

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:11.680 align:middle line:84%
At a certain point,
what it does is

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.720 align:middle line:84%
it drives them into a state
of what we call dissociation.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:16.610 align:middle line:90%
Desensitization, yeah.

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:18.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: Desensitization,
exactly right.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.660 align:middle line:84%
And so then, they go
from being desensitized

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:24.960 align:middle line:84%
to being highly aroused,
to being desensitized

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.070 align:middle line:90%
to being highly aroused.

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And they've actually
lost almost any place

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.730 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of where
they just sit calmly,

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:33.630 align:middle line:84%
they can enjoy
relaxing and breathing.

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:36.220 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the things that
we keep seeing in our culture.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.020 align:middle line:84%
Now what we see,
people are now saying,

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:40.650 align:middle line:84%
I want to go back to
living closer to the land,

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:43.690 align:middle line:84%
living closer to a
natural lifestyle.

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:45.230 align:middle line:90%
I want to get off the grid.

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:47.000 align:middle line:90%
What's that an expression of?

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.570 align:middle line:84%
It's an expression of,
I'm either desensitized

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:52.020 align:middle line:90%
or highly charged.

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing
that can calm us down

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.560 align:middle line:84%
is to get rid of all of that
stimulating information that's

00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:58.550 align:middle line:90%
being given to us.

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And then, people say, wow, I
feel so much more in myself.

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:04.532 align:middle line:90%
It's actually true, they do.

00:15:04.532 --> 00:15:05.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.640 align:middle line:84%
Did you suffer or
experience around you

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:09.854 align:middle line:90%
people suffering from trauma?

00:15:09.854 --> 00:15:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Were you intrigued at that
when you were very young?

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:14.353 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: Well, I didn't
even know it when I was young.

00:15:14.353 --> 00:15:16.290 align:middle line:90%
My father was in the Korean War.

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:17.900 align:middle line:84%
And he was a
traumatized soldier.

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And trauma at the time
of my father's age

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.135 align:middle line:84%
wasn't even well-known
within the society

00:15:22.135 --> 00:15:23.920 align:middle line:90%
and the medical community.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.320 align:middle line:84%
So my father was
traumatized and demonstrated

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.900 align:middle line:90%
all the perfect examples.

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:31.130 align:middle line:84%
He would drink as a way
of calming himself down.

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:34.790 align:middle line:84%
Or he'd be really highly
aggressive towards us

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:35.580 align:middle line:90%
as children.

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:36.625 align:middle line:90%
Or he'd be distant.

00:15:36.625 --> 00:15:40.040 align:middle line:84%
He used to go out into his
garden or he'd go fix his car.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.310 align:middle line:84%
But it was his way
of distancing himself

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:45.130 align:middle line:84%
when family involvement
and family relationship

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:47.400 align:middle line:84%
got too intense and
he couldn't handle it.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.860 align:middle line:90%
So I basically had a father.

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:51.260 align:middle line:84%
But my entire
generation had fathers

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.790 align:middle line:84%
like that that only knew
how to either be distant

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:57.760 align:middle line:84%
with the families or
maybe use alcohol-- that

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.910 align:middle line:84%
was the drug of choice at the
time-- to actually anaesthetize

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:04.610 align:middle line:84%
themselves from these high,
emotional experiences that they

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:05.260 align:middle line:90%
would have.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:09.370 align:middle line:84%
So I grew up with that and never
knew it until I left my home.

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:11.180 align:middle line:84%
But I realized, much
of my childhood--

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:15.230 align:middle line:84%
I grew up mildly dissociated
from relationship.

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:17.050 align:middle line:84%
Because relationships
were dangerous.

00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:17.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:21.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: See-- and my mother--
typical mother at that time--

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:24.260 align:middle line:84%
protected the children
from the father.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.210 align:middle line:84%
She did everything
mothers should do.

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:28.850 align:middle line:84%
But yet, she lived in
a highly nervous state.

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:29.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because she was
nervous about your dad too.

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:30.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: Because she
was always frightened.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:32.030 align:middle line:90%
What's he going to do?

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:33.260 align:middle line:90%
And are the children safe?

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.470 align:middle line:84%
How do I help the
family stay together?

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:36.250 align:middle line:90%
All those things.

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:38.810 align:middle line:84%
So we had both of
those problems.

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:41.376 align:middle line:84%
But that entire generation
had that problem.

00:16:41.376 --> 00:16:42.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:44.140 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and that was just
following World War II.

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:44.270 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:45.040 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Right.

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And so, you could see how we
are generationally traumatized

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:49.450 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:51.630 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in a
frightening environment,

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:54.457 align:middle line:84%
with parents who didn't know
how to handle their emotions.

00:16:54.457 --> 00:16:56.540 align:middle line:84%
Because they didn't even
know anything about them.

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:58.930 align:middle line:84%
And so then, my
generation passes it

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:00.250 align:middle line:90%
on to the next generation.

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:01.064 align:middle line:90%
It's very common.

00:17:01.064 --> 00:17:01.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:05.270 align:middle line:84%
So why did you ultimately
choose a path as a monk

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:08.099 align:middle line:84%
and then, move on from
there into the work

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:09.140 align:middle line:90%
as a social worker?

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:10.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: Well, it's
kind of interesting.

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:13.819 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I actually was
in the Air Force for six years.

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:17.010 align:middle line:84%
When I was in the Air Force,
I lived in Okinawa, Japan.

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:20.549 align:middle line:84%
And it was my first experience
of living in another country.

00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:22.230 align:middle line:90%
And I loved it.

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:23.930 align:middle line:90%
I loved everything about it.

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:25.020 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't believe it.

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:28.670 align:middle line:84%
Language and culture and food--
I thought it was amazing.

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:30.600 align:middle line:84%
I didn't like the
military culture.

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.460 align:middle line:90%
It just didn't fit me.

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:34.540 align:middle line:90%
But I did like living overseas.

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And so, I was actually
talking to the priest in Japan

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.410 align:middle line:90%
and telling him this thing.

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well you
should join this community.

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:42.470 align:middle line:90%
Because they only work overseas.

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:46.650 align:middle line:84%
So if you join them, you'll be
guaranteed to live overseas.

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't real
interested at the time.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.540 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, I
ended up joining

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:53.360 align:middle line:84%
this religious community
called Maryknoll Missionaries.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.440 align:middle line:90%
And they sent me overseas.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.590 align:middle line:90%
Now, I really liked it.

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:58.590 align:middle line:90%
Because I was living culturally.

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And even, I was
studying the language.

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And I went to the university
to study the culture.

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And the richness-- it
was fascinating to me.

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And it just happened
to be the Middle East.

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:11.140 align:middle line:84%
I could have gone to many
countries around the world.

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And so when I was
working there, I

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:19.840 align:middle line:84%
realized I love trying
to understand people.

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:24.170 align:middle line:84%
Because this cultural exchange
was making me curious.

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:25.405 align:middle line:90%
Why did they think this way?

00:18:25.405 --> 00:18:26.280 align:middle line:90%
Why do they say that?

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.530 align:middle line:90%
And why do they do this?

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:31.414 align:middle line:84%
And that led me into, sort
of, social work background.

00:18:31.414 --> 00:18:33.080 align:middle line:84%
Because I didn't have
that until after I

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:37.750 align:middle line:84%
had gotten my degree in
theology, and I was studying,

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:39.240 align:middle line:90%
how do we believe spiritually?

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.890 align:middle line:84%
Because I was basically
studying Islam and Christianity

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:42.960 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.470 align:middle line:84%
But then I realized--
when we were traumatized,

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:47.780 align:middle line:90%
I thought, wow.

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:50.840 align:middle line:84%
Trauma affected
our belief system.

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.450 align:middle line:84%
Trauma affected our
psycho-emotional state.

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:57.430 align:middle line:90%
And trauma affected our bodies.

00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:01.900 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to see all
three of those distinctly.

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:05.620 align:middle line:90%
So this is an interesting thing.

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:08.870 align:middle line:84%
When I came back from the
Middle East-- and I was really

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:09.780 align:middle line:90%
traumatized.

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:12.110 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize how
traumatized I was.

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:16.150 align:middle line:84%
But my religious community said,
what would you like to do next?

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:18.380 align:middle line:84%
Because I said, I can't go
back to the Middle East.

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:19.970 align:middle line:84%
It's too disturbing
for me right now.

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:21.060 align:middle line:90%
I need to go somewhere else.

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.809 align:middle line:84%
And they said, where
would you like to go?

00:19:22.809 --> 00:19:24.700 align:middle line:84%
I said, I need to
go to a hermitage.

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.570 align:middle line:90%
I need to live alone.

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And they were
gracious enough, they

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:31.300 align:middle line:84%
let me live in a
hermitage for six months.

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:32.290 align:middle line:90%
And it was fascinating.

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:33.331 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Where was this?

00:19:33.331 --> 00:19:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: This was in
the Camaldolese Hermitage

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:36.502 align:middle line:90%
in Big Sur, California.

00:19:36.502 --> 00:19:37.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh yes, OK.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:37.880 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: OK?

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:38.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: So I lived there for
six months-- wonderful group

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:41.120 align:middle line:90%
of people.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:44.360 align:middle line:84%
But what I discovered
was the intensity

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:47.010 align:middle line:84%
of involvement and
activity that I

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:49.960 align:middle line:84%
was engaged in while I was
living in Beirut, Lebanon

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.110 align:middle line:90%
during the war.

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:53.180 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that
could balance that

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:56.110 align:middle line:84%
was the intensity of
solitude and silence.

00:19:56.110 --> 00:20:00.567 align:middle line:84%
They actually, in a sense,
complemented my human growth.

00:20:00.567 --> 00:20:01.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, that makes sense.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:02.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Yes.

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:03.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's the pendulum
swinging into balance.

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: That's
exactly what it was.

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And so, when I balanced it out
and went into that solitude

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:10.790 align:middle line:84%
and silence, then I
was able come back out

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:14.540 align:middle line:84%
and start putting together
pieces of, what happened to me?

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And how would I help people
restore themselves who've

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:20.340 align:middle line:90%
been in those same situations?

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:22.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you were there
during shellings and so forth.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:22.630 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:23.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were
in the thick of it.

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:25.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: Oh yeah, I lived
right in the middle of a lot

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:27.194 align:middle line:90%
of bombings and shootings and--

00:20:27.194 --> 00:20:29.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What is that like
every day as a civilian?

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.901 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: Well,
what was interesting

00:20:30.901 --> 00:20:33.550 align:middle line:84%
about it was that,
although I thought

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:35.634 align:middle line:84%
I was dealing with it
daily-- and I thought, OK,

00:20:35.634 --> 00:20:37.050 align:middle line:84%
another bombing,
another shooting.

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:37.970 align:middle line:90%
Duck.

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:39.200 align:middle line:90%
Run underneath something.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:39.760 align:middle line:90%
Hide.

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.400 align:middle line:90%
That sort of stuff.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.530 align:middle line:84%
What I didn't realize
was I basically

00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:48.020 align:middle line:84%
was living with that in my
head in the way of surviving.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:51.650 align:middle line:84%
But I completely split off
any emotional connection

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:52.452 align:middle line:90%
to that at all.

00:20:52.452 --> 00:20:54.160 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we
would call clinically--

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.935 align:middle line:84%
I disassociated from any
emotional state in my body.

00:20:57.935 --> 00:20:59.791 align:middle line:90%
And I basically was in my head.

00:20:59.791 --> 00:21:00.290 align:middle line:90%
I said, yes.

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:01.040 align:middle line:90%
There's a bombing.

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:01.800 align:middle line:90%
Here's what I do.

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.300 align:middle line:90%
This is what I know how to do.

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:06.980 align:middle line:84%
Once the bombings over, we sweep
things up or clean things up.

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And we sit around and
wait for the next bombing

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.390 align:middle line:90%
and hope we're not killed in it.

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:11.260 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.640 align:middle line:84%
It was sort of stupid
when you think about it.

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.660 align:middle line:84%
But it seemed to be
real life at the time.

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:17.000 align:middle line:90%
Everybody was doing it.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.470 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't realize till
afterwards all the emotions

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:22.570 align:middle line:84%
that started to
surface from that,

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:26.180 align:middle line:84%
the terror, the rage, the
hatred, all that sort of thing.

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:29.100 align:middle line:84%
Its sadness and
fear all came out

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:33.250 align:middle line:84%
after I left Lebanon and was
back in the United States.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:35.550 align:middle line:84%
That's when I had to
go into the Hermitage

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:38.230 align:middle line:84%
to process what
it had done to me.

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:39.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what's
interesting is

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:42.670 align:middle line:84%
where you have
heavy trauma, that's

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:45.240 align:middle line:84%
where social engineering
really comes in handy.

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:45.680 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Yeah, very much so.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.852 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's when people
are highly programmable--

00:21:47.852 --> 00:21:48.210 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Yes.

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:49.835 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --when
they're not integrated

00:21:49.835 --> 00:21:51.120 align:middle line:90%
and they're fractured inside.

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:51.828 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Right.

00:21:51.828 --> 00:21:54.300 align:middle line:84%
That's when it's easiest
to gather a group.

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:56.730 align:middle line:84%
So if you're
traumatized by somebody

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:59.290 align:middle line:84%
and your family has been
violated or victimized

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:01.330 align:middle line:84%
in some way, it's
easy to get you

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:03.490 align:middle line:90%
to fight against another group.

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:05.570 align:middle line:84%
That's the best time
to catch you doing it.

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:09.190 align:middle line:84%
Or it's easy to convince you
to follow me, to take my pill,

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:10.460 align:middle line:90%
or to take my method or--

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:11.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly,
indoctrination

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:12.148 align:middle line:90%
into something radical.

00:22:12.148 --> 00:22:13.260 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Exactly right.

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:13.920 align:middle line:90%
Exactly right.

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.090 align:middle line:84%
Extreme religions will
do that all the time.

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:19.180 align:middle line:84%
That's how they
seek out followers.

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:20.889 align:middle line:84%
Find the people who
are traumatized who

00:22:20.889 --> 00:22:22.430 align:middle line:84%
are looking for
somebody to give them

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:26.580 align:middle line:84%
guidance, safety, leadership,
and I'll follow you.

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And they'll commit
themselves fully to that.

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so, you
were at Maryknoll, right?

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:32.148 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Right.

00:22:32.148 --> 00:22:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is,
reportedly, kind of a CIA front

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:35.900 align:middle line:90%
around the world too, OK?

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:36.899 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: [LAUGHS] Yes.

00:22:36.899 --> 00:22:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so, did you have
any interface with any of that?

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:41.960 align:middle line:90%
I mean, were you recruited?

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:46.821 align:middle line:84%
Or did you help-- were your
services ever requested?

00:22:46.821 --> 00:22:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: You know,
it's kind of comical.

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:51.400 align:middle line:84%
Because actually, while
I was in Maryknoll

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:54.460 align:middle line:84%
is when I first heard about
the CIA could be looking

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:56.725 align:middle line:90%
for recruiting Maryknollers.

00:22:56.725 --> 00:22:58.500 align:middle line:90%
And this was really interesting.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.590 align:middle line:84%
Because we were at such
a grassroots level,

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:04.050 align:middle line:84%
we actually knew what was
going on in the culture better

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:04.914 align:middle line:90%
than the CIA did.

00:23:04.914 --> 00:23:07.330 align:middle line:84%
Because we were really connected
to the culture of people.

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which makes
sense why it would

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.090 align:middle line:90%
be a great place to recruit.

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:11.006 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Absolutely.

00:23:11.006 --> 00:23:14.190 align:middle line:84%
So I had friends,
colleagues of mine,

00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:18.280 align:middle line:84%
in Maryknoll who said
that they felt they were

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.230 align:middle line:90%
being recruited by CIA people.

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:23.520 align:middle line:84%
Or CIA people were kind
of hanging around them

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.550 align:middle line:90%
asking certain questions.

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:27.430 align:middle line:90%
I never had that happen to me.

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:30.070 align:middle line:84%
But the point about
it is that Maryknoll

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:32.850 align:middle line:84%
had such a deep
social conscious,

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:36.660 align:middle line:84%
and we were so truly
dedicated to helping

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:39.830 align:middle line:84%
the poverty-stricken or
poor people of the countries

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:42.550 align:middle line:84%
or the disenfranchised
people that we

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:46.890 align:middle line:84%
had no investment at
all in helping the US

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:48.510 align:middle line:90%
government in any way.

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:51.240 align:middle line:84%
Because usually we
already knew it--

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:54.490 align:middle line:84%
they were the ones
that were facilitating

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:59.050 align:middle line:84%
either the bad
regime or the poverty

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:00.910 align:middle line:84%
or the economic imbalance
in the countries.

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:02.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you guys
were aware of that.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.499 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: We were
very aware of it.

00:24:03.499 --> 00:24:08.030 align:middle line:90%
We knew what US policies were.

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:10.810 align:middle line:84%
And so, we knew the US
policies were actually

00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:12.950 align:middle line:84%
the policies that were
causing the problems

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:14.430 align:middle line:90%
in the countries themselves.

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:17.550 align:middle line:84%
Because we were both Americans
and well-educated Americans

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:19.400 align:middle line:84%
and quite informed,
but we were also

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:23.570 align:middle line:84%
very well-informed of the
poverty and the violence

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:25.780 align:middle line:84%
that the people were living
in in these countries

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:26.560 align:middle line:90%
we worked in.

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.970 align:middle line:84%
So we had, actually,
information from both sides.

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And once you had
that, it's very easy

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:32.460 align:middle line:90%
to choose who were the victims.

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And so, we chose to
help the victims.

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:37.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So your
particular area

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:40.370 align:middle line:84%
wasn't necessarily fertile
ground for recruiting assets

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:40.990 align:middle line:90%
or agents.

00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:41.906 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: No, no, no.

00:24:41.906 --> 00:24:43.070 align:middle line:90%
We weren't actually.

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:44.410 align:middle line:90%
Now, they tried.

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:46.820 align:middle line:84%
But it was very clear
that it was unsuccessful.

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:49.960 align:middle line:84%
Because we really knew--
well, Maryknollers

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:53.162 align:middle line:84%
are very well-educated and
very well-informed people.

00:24:53.162 --> 00:24:54.370 align:middle line:90%
So we knew what was going on.

00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:55.810 align:middle line:90%
We knew the reality of things.

00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:58.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm, so now in
the midst of all of this--

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:00.690 align:middle line:84%
we're going to
get to the methods

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:04.540 align:middle line:84%
that you use in a little
bit-- but since this

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:06.290 align:middle line:84%
is going into the
subconscious, since this

00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:10.100 align:middle line:84%
is in the nervous system, in the
body itself, in the musculature

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:13.110 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, is there a
place for psychotherapy

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:14.350 align:middle line:90%
within all of this?

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Yeah.

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Let me just summarize very
quickly-- whenever a person is

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.720 align:middle line:84%
traumatized, from
what I can see,

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.030 align:middle line:84%
it has actually three
different effects on them.

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:28.300 align:middle line:84%
It affects their
psycho-emotional state.

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And so, that would
affect relationship.

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:32.724 align:middle line:84%
But it also affects
them physically.

00:25:32.724 --> 00:25:33.890 align:middle line:90%
And we can talk about that--

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:34.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're going to, yes.

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:35.806 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: --a little
bit more later on.

00:25:35.806 --> 00:25:38.410 align:middle line:84%
So now, we're talking about
psycho-emotional, the body,

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:42.030 align:middle line:84%
and-- this seems to be
really primary-- it actually

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:43.205 align:middle line:90%
affects their belief system.

00:25:43.205 --> 00:25:45.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't use the word
religion or spirituality.

00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Explain
this a little bit.

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:48.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:51.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: Belief
system is you understand

00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:54.450 align:middle line:84%
your way of being on this planet
in whatever way makes sense

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:55.690 align:middle line:90%
to you, OK?

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:57.250 align:middle line:90%
So that could be a religion.

00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:59.090 align:middle line:84%
That could be a
general spirituality.

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:00.700 align:middle line:84%
I believe in the
cosmos, or I believe

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:03.950 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, or a higher
consciousness, et cetera.

00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:05.740 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not a Catholic,
or a Protestant,

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:08.750 align:middle line:84%
or Buddhist, or
Muslim, whatever.

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:10.140 align:middle line:90%
That would be religion.

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:13.400 align:middle line:84%
A belief system includes
atheists and agnostics.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.590 align:middle line:84%
Because I have been
in many situations

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:17.460 align:middle line:84%
where I have people
from many religions,

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:20.550 align:middle line:84%
many belief systems, and
atheists and agnostics

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:21.810 align:middle line:90%
traumatized.

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's astonishing
how our brain

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:30.050 align:middle line:84%
has to try to figure out how to
make sense again of something

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:31.910 align:middle line:90%
that was completely senseless.

00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:35.160 align:middle line:84%
We have to put pieces
back together that

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:40.900 align:middle line:84%
restore some sense of
solidity for us to say, OK.

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:42.630 align:middle line:90%
I've made sense of it.

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:45.550 align:middle line:84%
Even if it means--
and this is very often

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:49.100 align:middle line:84%
the case-- people who are
very religious or spiritual

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:51.539 align:middle line:90%
leave and say, I'm an atheist.

00:26:51.539 --> 00:26:53.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe in
God, and da-da-da.

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:55.124 align:middle line:84%
But that new belief
system now helps

00:26:55.124 --> 00:26:57.290 align:middle line:84%
them make sense of the
experience they went through.

00:26:57.290 --> 00:26:58.414 align:middle line:90%
The opposite could be true.

00:26:58.414 --> 00:27:00.940 align:middle line:84%
Atheists and agnostics
could all of a sudden say,

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:02.080 align:middle line:90%
I believe in God now.

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:05.500 align:middle line:84%
I pray every day in church or
synagogue or wherever I pray.

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:07.230 align:middle line:84%
Because they made
this radical shift.

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:08.890 align:middle line:90%
But it was the trauma--

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:11.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It could be something
like, why was my life spared

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:12.681 align:middle line:90%
and all my buddies were killed?

00:27:12.681 --> 00:27:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: Exactly
right, survivor guilt.

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:16.460 align:middle line:84%
So it fractures
the belief system

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:18.380 align:middle line:90%
they had before the trauma.

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered that a
lot of suicidal ideation

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:26.220 align:middle line:84%
occurs when they can't
rebuild a new belief system.

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:29.360 align:middle line:84%
They can't make sense of
what's going on on the planet.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's so confusing and
disturbing that it actually

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:33.890 align:middle line:90%
drives them out of their mind.

00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:35.940 align:middle line:90%
So here's what I think happens.

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:40.280 align:middle line:84%
In some way, every human
being who recovers from trauma

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.590 align:middle line:90%
hits all three of those points.

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:44.810 align:middle line:84%
They may do
psycho-emotional stuff,

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:47.300 align:middle line:84%
but they might do it with
their spouse or their partner

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.990 align:middle line:84%
in a relationship, not
necessarily go to a therapist.

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:54.700 align:middle line:84%
They may go to a gym, or go
to spas, or start taking yoga.

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:58.140 align:middle line:84%
But they're finding some way
to address the disturbance

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:00.040 align:middle line:90%
in the body, physiologically.

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.527 align:middle line:84%
And then, they do
something about talking

00:28:02.527 --> 00:28:04.860 align:middle line:84%
with their buddies or their
friends or their colleagues,

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:06.890 align:middle line:90%
asking, why am I still alive?

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:08.040 align:middle line:90%
Why did this happen?

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's questioning
the belief system again.

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:14.460 align:middle line:84%
And so, every human person I've
ever seen all over the world

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:18.160 align:middle line:84%
will try to restore all three
of those sections of being

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:22.110 align:middle line:84%
human as a way of recovering
from the traumatic experience.

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:23.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
notion of resistance, OK?

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:31.962 align:middle line:84%
Because this factors pretty
big time into your work.

00:28:31.962 --> 00:28:32.670 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Right.

00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:34.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you're
saying, essentially,

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:35.320 align:middle line:90%
resistance is futile.

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.171 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Mm-hmm, right.

00:28:37.171 --> 00:28:37.670 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:40.364 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So talk about it
in a more holistic level

00:28:40.364 --> 00:28:41.280 align:middle line:90%
than what I just said.

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:41.630 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Right.

00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:43.004 align:middle line:84%
OK, so just think
of it this way.

00:28:43.004 --> 00:28:45.259 align:middle line:84%
Resistance-- which
I truly respect.

00:28:45.259 --> 00:28:47.050 align:middle line:84%
Whether I'm doing
counseling with somebody,

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:49.700 align:middle line:84%
or body work with them, or
even spiritual direction,

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:52.480 align:middle line:84%
and I see that we hit a place
of resistance-- they can't

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.500 align:middle line:84%
go there, they don't want
to open that up, they

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:58.060 align:middle line:84%
don't want to talk about it or
feel it-- I truly respect it.

00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:01.330 align:middle line:84%
Because what they're saying
is, I'm not safe enough.

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:03.820 align:middle line:84%
Resistance just means,
I'm not feeling safe.

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:05.860 align:middle line:90%
Trauma destroyed the safety.

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:08.390 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of helping
the individual to recover,

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:12.100 align:middle line:84%
I can only go as fast
as they possibly can go.

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And each individual is
different about that.

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:16.100 align:middle line:84%
Some people can go
psycho-emotionally

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:19.110 align:middle line:84%
faster than they can go
physically or spiritually,

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:20.240 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:23.410 align:middle line:84%
So resistance is, basically,
the individual saying,

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:24.780 align:middle line:90%
I can't go deeper.

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:26.110 align:middle line:90%
I can't go faster.

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:27.080 align:middle line:90%
It terrifies me.

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:29.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to do
it, and I won't.

00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:32.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's great for me,
in the sense of saying,

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:34.350 align:middle line:90%
OK, there's the boundary.

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:36.491 align:middle line:84%
And I'll look at and
say, OK, there it is.

00:29:36.491 --> 00:29:37.990 align:middle line:84%
That's the boundary
and that's fine.

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And you hold onto that
as long as you need to.

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:44.880 align:middle line:84%
However, be careful that
your resistance doesn't

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:49.770 align:middle line:84%
begin to try to manifest
itself in disturbing ways,

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:51.250 align:middle line:90%
like violent manners.

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:52.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm resistant.

00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:54.140 align:middle line:90%
I won't believe in God!

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:55.970 align:middle line:90%
Or I won't let go of my faith!

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:57.814 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
pray the way I pray!

00:29:57.814 --> 00:30:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And you have to believe in my
god the way I believe in it,

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:02.240 align:middle line:90%
or you're going to go to hell!

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:05.830 align:middle line:84%
That is the manifestation
of a resistance that's

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:08.090 align:middle line:90%
seeking expression in some way.

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:10.320 align:middle line:84%
But it's not the person
being able to let go

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:14.810 align:middle line:84%
and giving in to-- in a
sense-- rebuilding themselves

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:16.160 align:middle line:90%
into a healthy state.

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I
think all of us can

00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:20.694 align:middle line:84%
relate to knowing where we have
our own resistance in life.

00:30:20.694 --> 00:30:21.360 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Yeah.

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And maybe give
us a couple of examples

00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:27.790 align:middle line:84%
that are interesting or
startling, in terms of the way

00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:32.840 align:middle line:84%
the resistance actually started
subverting their own lives

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.590 align:middle line:84%
and expressing itself
in, maybe, strange ways.

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:36.590 align:middle line:90%
In a couple of examples.

00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:38.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: Well, we see
resistance in relationships,

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:40.320 align:middle line:90%
in families, all the time.

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:42.160 align:middle line:84%
So the husband and
wife-- one of them

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.130 align:middle line:84%
will meet resistance
about growth

00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:46.270 align:middle line:84%
that the other one
insists they must do.

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:46.910 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:49.320 align:middle line:10%
And so, what that
generally does is

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:52.420 align:middle line:10%
it causes a split in the
relationship that then gets

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:54.110 align:middle line:10%
taken out with the children.

00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:56.280 align:middle line:84%
So the mother will try to
get the children to like

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:56.990 align:middle line:90%
her better.

00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:58.700 align:middle line:84%
Or the father will
try to get the--

00:30:58.700 --> 00:30:59.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Manipulation.

00:30:59.010 --> 00:30:59.801 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Exactly.

00:30:59.801 --> 00:31:02.275 align:middle line:84%
They'll manipulate the
family dynamics as a way

00:31:02.275 --> 00:31:04.150 align:middle line:84%
of-- in a sense, if
you're resistant,

00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:06.490 align:middle line:84%
you're going to try to gather
people who are going to be

00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:08.135 align:middle line:84%
like-minded to you
and say, therefore--

00:31:08.135 --> 00:31:08.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To support you, yeah.

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:10.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: --my
resistance is right.

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:13.080 align:middle line:84%
Look, these other 10 people
believe in my resistance.

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:15.730 align:middle line:84%
So resistance in family
happens all the time

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:17.560 align:middle line:90%
in the growth process, see.

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And children know how
to do this real well.

00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:22.310 align:middle line:84%
See, teenagers
will resist growth,

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:24.430 align:middle line:84%
which is part of
their teenage process.

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:28.020 align:middle line:84%
But then, they'll manipulate
the parents against each other.

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:30.590 align:middle line:84%
So we have that all the
time in family structure

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:32.050 align:middle line:90%
in our society.

00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:33.770 align:middle line:84%
It usually manifests
in manipulation

00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:35.400 align:middle line:90%
of one form or another.

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:38.744 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about in the natural world.

00:31:38.744 --> 00:31:40.910 align:middle line:84%
If we weren't being
conditioned, if we weren't being

00:31:40.910 --> 00:31:43.130 align:middle line:84%
macho and proud and
all these other things

00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:48.970 align:middle line:84%
and trying to cowboy it up,
what does trauma look like raw?

00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:51.780 align:middle line:84%
--in terms of our
natural instincts

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:53.350 align:middle line:90%
to allow it to start healing.

00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:54.100 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Mm-hmm.

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:58.170 align:middle line:84%
If we were in a
comfortable world

00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:00.700 align:middle line:84%
and we were traumatized--
as an example--

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:04.010 align:middle line:84%
there would be a whole
social structure available.

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:07.380 align:middle line:84%
People would allow the
traumatized individuals to move

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:10.070 align:middle line:84%
and flow in and out of
the social structure

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:11.860 align:middle line:90%
and in and out of relationship.

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'd see this in villages
a lot when I worked in Sudan.

00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:15.638 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tell us about that.

00:32:15.638 --> 00:32:18.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: When we were able
to identify the children that

00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:21.090 align:middle line:84%
had been severely traumatized
because their parents were

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:23.220 align:middle line:84%
killed in the last bombing
or something like that--

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:26.320 align:middle line:84%
but when the whole village
of 150 people knew it,

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:29.280 align:middle line:84%
those children were allowed
to go from family to family,

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:32.800 align:middle line:84%
from children to children,
from mother to mother.

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:35.720 align:middle line:84%
So they actually became,
in a sense, inherited

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:38.530 align:middle line:90%
by the entire social structure.

00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And that allowed the child to
be resistant to one woman who

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:44.780 align:middle line:84%
was acting as their mother
and go to another woman

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:46.260 align:middle line:90%
and, then, go to another woman.

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And so then, it allowed them to
play back and forth until they

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:52.710 align:middle line:84%
could realize the new
social structure was safe,

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:55.530 align:middle line:84%
and they could let go of feeling
unsafe because they had just

00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:56.890 align:middle line:90%
lost their parents.

00:32:56.890 --> 00:32:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing
how well it works.

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:02.690 align:middle line:84%
My first time to see
this was in Ethiopia.

00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:05.340 align:middle line:84%
And there was this severe
bombing that had just happened.

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And I was wondering, how
are the Ethiopians going

00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:08.500 align:middle line:90%
to deal with this?

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:11.720 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't have
psychotherapy in their culture,

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:12.610 align:middle line:90%
in general.

00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:16.304 align:middle line:84%
And so one day-- it was the
next morning after the bombing--

00:33:16.304 --> 00:33:17.220 align:middle line:90%
we were sitting there.

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:18.720 align:middle line:90%
And the women all came out.

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:22.794 align:middle line:84%
And they were making the
fire to make the coffee.

00:33:22.794 --> 00:33:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Because they have
coffee in the morning.

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:26.600 align:middle line:84%
But it's about a
two-hour process.

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:28.730 align:middle line:84%
Good coffee, but it
takes a while to get it.

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:31.800 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, I'm ready
for it in 30 seconds.

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, they're
making the fire.

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.570 align:middle line:90%
They're cooking the thing.

00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:36.950 align:middle line:84%
But while they're
doing this, the women

00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:39.150 align:middle line:90%
are just casually talking.

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:41.370 align:middle line:84%
Did you hear what
happened to so-and-so?

00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:42.940 align:middle line:90%
Their child was killed.

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.630 align:middle line:84%
Or the husband was killed,
and now those poor children

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:46.780 align:middle line:90%
don't have a father.

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:48.280 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
to do something.

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:50.540 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to
bake this thing.

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:51.760 align:middle line:90%
And I want you to do that.

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to have
to take the children away.

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And somebody's going to
go talk to the mother.

00:33:56.020 --> 00:34:00.370 align:middle line:84%
They were actually doing a
socialized, psychotherapeutic

00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:02.720 align:middle line:90%
intervention for this family.

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.350 align:middle line:84%
But they weren't
calling it that.

00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:07.940 align:middle line:84%
It was just a natural human
relationship of saying,

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:09.989 align:middle line:84%
how are we going to care
for this family that

00:34:09.989 --> 00:34:11.400 align:middle line:90%
was just injured?

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:12.639 align:middle line:90%
And it was beautiful.

00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:13.770 align:middle line:90%
And it dawned on me.

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:16.780 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh my god,
we know psychotherapy.

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:19.170 align:middle line:84%
We know psychosocial
interventions.

00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:21.060 align:middle line:90%
By our nature, we know them.

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:23.750 align:middle line:84%
We've made it a profession
in the Western world.

00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:27.030 align:middle line:84%
But in Ethiopia, it
was just normal life.

00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:29.364 align:middle line:84%
And that was completely
beautiful to me.

00:34:29.364 --> 00:34:30.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is beautiful.

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:32.570 align:middle line:90%
Now, what about with children?

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:34.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: Children
will usually withdraw.

00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:36.609 align:middle line:84%
Because trauma makes
us feel unsafe.

00:34:36.609 --> 00:34:38.150 align:middle line:84%
So it's the first
thing that happens.

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:39.590 align:middle line:90%
I don't feel safe.

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:41.389 align:middle line:84%
And depending on
what the trauma is--

00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:43.500 align:middle line:84%
whether it was
physical abuse or it

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:45.830 align:middle line:84%
was the parents were
killed in a car accident,

00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:47.460 align:middle line:90%
those are two different things.

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.310 align:middle line:84%
However, the child
will still withdraw.

00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:53.820 align:middle line:84%
Because their whole world has
just, basically, collapsed.

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And so, they deal with
trauma mostly by withdrawing.

00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And then, the
withdrawing actually

00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:01.760 align:middle line:84%
becomes an aggressive
behavior of some sort.

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:04.830 align:middle line:84%
So they'll either
withdraw very deeply

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:08.200 align:middle line:84%
and then go into music
or art or some type

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:11.630 align:middle line:84%
of expression that allows them
to give expression to something

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:13.680 align:middle line:84%
they're doing,
depending on their age.

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:17.920 align:middle line:84%
Or you may see them start acting
out in aggressive manners.

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:21.710 align:middle line:84%
The acting out is an attempt
to restore relationship.

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:23.650 align:middle line:84%
But it's like, I want
to restore relationship

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:25.120 align:middle line:90%
but I don't feel safe.

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:27.630 align:middle line:84%
So they both push you away
and pull you towards them

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:29.120 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:32.520 align:middle line:84%
It's a really complicated thing
for children to deal with.

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:35.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now, I remember
when we spoke years ago.

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And then, also, it's
just trickling in.

00:35:37.810 --> 00:35:40.030 align:middle line:84%
I think it's when I
interviewed Lee Gerdes.

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:41.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Mm-hmm.

00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:43.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He was
telling me a story.

00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:46.220 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was about
his son Peter, who

00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:49.139 align:middle line:84%
had been threatened in a bar
fight and what happened to him.

00:35:49.139 --> 00:35:50.805 align:middle line:84%
Now, this starts
getting a little closer

00:35:50.805 --> 00:35:51.960 align:middle line:90%
to the bone of your work.

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:52.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Right.

00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:52.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about this.

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:53.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: OK.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:56.650 align:middle line:84%
All right, so let me tell you
a little story before that.

00:35:56.650 --> 00:35:57.566 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, please.

00:35:57.566 --> 00:35:59.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: And then,
we'll tap right into that.

00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:02.750 align:middle line:84%
People ask me all the time,
how do you define trauma?

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:04.705 align:middle line:84%
And I don't define it
in the clinical terms.

00:36:04.705 --> 00:36:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying
they're wrong.

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:09.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying I think there's a
much more primitive, basic way

00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:11.910 align:middle line:84%
to define if you're
experiencing trauma.

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And that allows it to be
individualized to everybody.

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:19.420 align:middle line:84%
When we have a
experience of trauma

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:22.370 align:middle line:84%
or even stress, what happens
to the human organism,

00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:25.530 align:middle line:84%
the only thing it can do
to protect itself is it

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:27.055 align:middle line:90%
begins to squeeze.

00:36:27.055 --> 00:36:28.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm, contract.

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:28.971 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Exactly.

00:36:28.971 --> 00:36:30.200 align:middle line:90%
It contracts itself.

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's no different than a
turtle going into its shell.

00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:36.190 align:middle line:84%
Our body contracts when
it feels under threat.

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And you'll know that
mostly by if you

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:40.880 align:middle line:84%
had a tough day at the office,
and you come back and you say,

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:41.880 align:middle line:90%
my neck is tight.

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:43.100 align:middle line:90%
My shoulders are tight.

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:44.460 align:middle line:90%
I can't breathe deep.

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:45.940 align:middle line:90%
My diaphragm's tight.

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:46.800 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:49.950 align:middle line:84%
The human organism contracts
when it feels under threat,

00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:52.910 align:middle line:84%
whether that's mild
stress or severe trauma.

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:55.950 align:middle line:84%
What should happen
after the threat is over

00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:58.960 align:middle line:84%
is the human organism should
go back into its relaxed state

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:02.160 align:middle line:84%
and start pulsating again,
breathing, and feeling relaxed

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.430 align:middle line:90%
and shoulders dropped.

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:04.950 align:middle line:90%
But that doesn't happen.

00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:07.490 align:middle line:84%
We stay in this
contracted state even

00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:09.480 align:middle line:84%
after the traumatic
experience is over.

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And then, we end
up living in it.

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:14.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the
things that I teach

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:17.060 align:middle line:84%
and one of the things I
discovered quite by accident--

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:21.650 align:middle line:84%
again, living in Beirut-- was
that after the traumatic event

00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:24.580 align:middle line:84%
is over-- and you see
this all over the world,

00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:26.450 align:middle line:90%
every human organism does it.

00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:30.750 align:middle line:84%
After a person is traumatized,
they'll end up shaking.

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And their jaw might shake or
even their face might shake.

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:36.241 align:middle line:90%
And their hands are shaking.

00:37:36.241 --> 00:37:37.240 align:middle line:90%
And they say, oh my god.

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:38.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm so nervous, I'm shaking.

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:40.170 align:middle line:90%
I have to sit down.

00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And the shaking is the
nervous system's response

00:37:44.110 --> 00:37:45.480 align:middle line:90%
to the contraction.

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:47.150 align:middle line:90%
So it squeezes like this.

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And the way it gets itself
out of that contracted state

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:52.560 align:middle line:90%
is it truly shakes itself.

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.770 align:middle line:84%
So I developed a
method where you

00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:58.330 align:middle line:84%
could do exercises to
actually activate the shaking

00:37:58.330 --> 00:38:01.020 align:middle line:84%
mechanism in the nervous system
which is very easy to do,

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:05.900 align:middle line:84%
to actually, finally, bring
to completion the contraction

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:09.090 align:middle line:84%
that the body never let go
of after the traumatic event.

00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:10.264 align:middle line:90%
So now, we go back to Peter.

00:38:10.264 --> 00:38:11.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Peter, yeah.

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:12.346 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Peter's in a bar.

00:38:12.346 --> 00:38:14.480 align:middle line:84%
I was teaching Peter
these exercises.

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:15.760 align:middle line:90%
And he's a big man.

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:17.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A handsome young man.

00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: Handsome, massive,
broad shoulders, tall guy.

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And I was teaching
him these exercises

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:24.650 align:middle line:84%
and explaining to
him, the next time

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:26.780 align:middle line:84%
you're in trauma or
any type of threat,

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:28.360 align:middle line:90%
your body is going to squeeze.

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:31.170 align:middle line:84%
But immediately afterwards, it's
going to start to shake itself.

00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to be
a healthy up and down

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:35.030 align:middle line:90%
of the nervous system.

00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:36.580 align:middle line:90%
So he says yes, yes, yes.

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:40.270 align:middle line:84%
And about a month later after
I was teaching him this stuff--

00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:43.180 align:middle line:84%
and he had been doing the
exercises quite regularly--

00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:44.660 align:middle line:90%
he goes to a bar.

00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:46.330 align:middle line:90%
He's with his girlfriend.

00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And some guy comes and
either tries to hit on her

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:53.630 align:middle line:84%
or-- he gets into some sort
of brawl with this guy.

00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And the guy's a short
guy, and Peter's huge.

00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And he said, the guy's
shouting at Peter.

00:38:58.700 --> 00:38:59.740 align:middle line:90%
Peter's shouting back.

00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And Peter said, all of a sudden,
my whole body started to shake.

00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:06.829 align:middle line:84%
He said, and the guy got
scared because I was shaking

00:39:06.829 --> 00:39:08.370 align:middle line:84%
and he didn't know
what was going on.

00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:09.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He thought he was
having a seizure or something.

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:12.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: And he said, it
just completely undid me.

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:15.530 align:middle line:84%
He said, because I wanted to
be this strong, masculine guy.

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:17.630 align:middle line:84%
I said, you were a
strong masculine guy.

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:18.530 align:middle line:90%
You stayed healthy.

00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:21.800 align:middle line:84%
Look, after that was over, you
came out of there feeling good.

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:24.070 align:middle line:84%
He went out of
their staying mad.

00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:25.060 align:middle line:90%
But Peter didn't.

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Peter was able to release
it and move on with life.

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:29.585 align:middle line:90%
It was just an episode of life.

00:39:29.585 --> 00:39:30.252 align:middle line:90%
So it was great.

00:39:30.252 --> 00:39:32.543 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] It's
interesting though because most

00:39:32.543 --> 00:39:33.830 align:middle line:90%
guys would not allow that to--

00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:34.285 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Oh they hate that!

00:39:34.285 --> 00:39:35.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --express itself.

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:36.740 align:middle line:84%
Had he not been doing
the exercises, right?

00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:37.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Exactly.

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:39.298 align:middle line:84%
But that's the funny
thing with soldiers.

00:39:39.298 --> 00:39:43.650 align:middle line:84%
I work with a lot of Special
Forces, Delta people, Navy

00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:45.600 align:middle line:90%
Seals, Marines.

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:48.410 align:middle line:84%
I was just talking to one
before I came here to see you.

00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And they think this is the
wildest, weirdest thing

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:53.960 align:middle line:90%
they've ever done.

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:56.130 align:middle line:84%
But they love it
because it works.

00:39:56.130 --> 00:39:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And the reason they love it--
because this is their challenge

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:02.170 align:middle line:84%
all the time to me-- you
make something happen

00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:03.890 align:middle line:90%
in me that I can't control.

00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:04.920 align:middle line:90%
That's their big thing.

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:06.090 align:middle line:84%
Because their
whole thing is they

00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:07.490 align:middle line:84%
spend their whole
professional learning

00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:08.465 align:middle line:90%
how to control themselves.

00:40:08.465 --> 00:40:08.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:10.319 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: And this
tremor mechanism

00:40:10.319 --> 00:40:12.785 align:middle line:84%
is pretty easy to activate
which they don't know.

00:40:12.785 --> 00:40:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And if I can override them
and actually get their body

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:19.110 align:middle line:84%
to do something that they
don't have control over,

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:20.360 align:middle line:90%
they're hooked on it.

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:23.270 align:middle line:84%
Because they're intrigued
by it, first of all,

00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:25.280 align:middle line:90%
but it immediately relaxes them.

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.870 align:middle line:90%
They fall asleep that night.

00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:28.560 align:middle line:90%
They sleep really deeply.

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:31.600 align:middle line:84%
Because I took these
contracted states and in 15,

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:34.984 align:middle line:84%
20 minutes got really deep,
internal relaxation to occur.

00:40:34.984 --> 00:40:37.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, you used to
deal with whole groups of them,

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:37.720 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:37.950 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:39.575 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When they'd
get off the plane

00:40:39.575 --> 00:40:44.000 align:middle line:84%
and they were being
reestablished into culture,

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.700 align:middle line:84%
they dealt with
you first, right?

00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:47.819 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: Yes, a lot of
places-- and now, it's

00:40:47.819 --> 00:40:48.610 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:50.420 align:middle line:84%
I work with military
all over the world.

00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:52.990 align:middle line:84%
Even in Austria,
they have five people

00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:55.020 align:middle line:84%
in the upper echelon,
colonels, being

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:57.727 align:middle line:84%
trained to teach this to all
of their military personnel.

00:40:57.727 --> 00:40:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow, yeah.

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:00.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: Because they
found it so useful for them.

00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:04.700 align:middle line:84%
So anyways, what happens is
when the soldiers come back--

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:07.660 align:middle line:84%
it's usually between
four to six weeks.

00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Because when they first come
back, they hug their family.

00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:12.260 align:middle line:90%
They relax.

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:14.960 align:middle line:84%
They go to barbecues,
have beers, and come back

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:16.000 align:middle line:90%
into society.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.830 align:middle line:84%
But once they start
to let go, that's

00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:21.970 align:middle line:84%
when the unresolved nervous
system says, oh this

00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:22.560 align:middle line:90%
is wonderful.

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:23.740 align:middle line:90%
We're safe.

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:25.710 align:middle line:84%
Let me express all
this stuff I've

00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:27.410 align:middle line:90%
been holding in for two years.

00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:27.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And so it--

00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:28.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: So this
starts to come out.

00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:29.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --comes out in all
these different, odd ways.

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:30.991 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Exactly right.

00:41:30.991 --> 00:41:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And if I can get
them at that moment

00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:36.130 align:middle line:84%
when it really starts to surface
and teach them how to do this,

00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:39.550 align:middle line:84%
they can let it seep out
little by little by little

00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:41.170 align:middle line:84%
until the whole
nervous system learns

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:42.600 align:middle line:90%
how to re-regulate itself.

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:44.060 align:middle line:90%
And it truly is unconscious.

00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:47.000 align:middle line:84%
I have them do it while they
watch a football game on TV.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.040 align:middle line:84%
Because I just want
them to not even

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:51.870 align:middle line:84%
pay attention to the shaking
that the body is doing.

00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:53.210 align:middle line:90%
Just lay on the floor.

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:54.150 align:middle line:90%
Let the body shake.

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:55.820 align:middle line:84%
It's your autonomic
nervous system.

00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:57.600 align:middle line:90%
You don't control it anyways.

00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.100 align:middle line:90%
Watch a football game.

00:41:59.100 --> 00:41:59.840 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy it.

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:03.602 align:middle line:84%
And that drives them into
really deep, relaxed state.

00:42:03.602 --> 00:42:05.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is there
some mental resistance

00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:06.720 align:middle line:90%
because they're out of control?

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:07.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Oh absolutely.

00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:08.870 align:middle line:90%
And I love it though.

00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:10.870 align:middle line:84%
Because I joke and
I play with it.

00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:14.660 align:middle line:84%
If I can get them to see, OK
look, you guys understand,

00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:17.870 align:middle line:84%
when you come back and you
clean your weapons-- right?--

00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:18.820 align:middle line:90%
you're done.

00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:21.305 align:middle line:84%
You make sure that weapon
is completely clean.

00:42:21.305 --> 00:42:23.180 align:middle line:84%
Because you're going to
be preparing yourself

00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:24.679 align:middle line:84%
for the next time
you need to do it.

00:42:24.679 --> 00:42:25.880 align:middle line:90%
Well, what about your body?

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:29.270 align:middle line:84%
That's as much a weapon
as your gun may be

00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:30.740 align:middle line:90%
or your rifle may be.

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to completely
clean that thing out and make

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:36.100 align:middle line:84%
sure that you are
able to go back

00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:38.430 align:middle line:84%
into another
situation of violence.

00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:40.060 align:middle line:84%
And I said, if you
don't clean it out--

00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:42.040 align:middle line:84%
and this is what's
happening to soldiers--

00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:45.270 align:middle line:84%
is you just build on top
and on top and on top

00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:47.800 align:middle line:84%
until, now, you start
wearing the system down.

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:51.990 align:middle line:84%
Because resiliency-- which is
a big word in the military--

00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:56.120 align:middle line:84%
isn't that I can contract up
and be strong when I need to be.

00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:59.820 align:middle line:84%
Resiliency is I can contract up
and be strong and then let go

00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:02.470 align:middle line:84%
and be relaxed and sleep
at night; and then,

00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:04.500 align:middle line:84%
the next day contract
up again; and then,

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:05.840 align:middle line:90%
go home and sleep at night.

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:08.290 align:middle line:84%
But we're not building
resiliency in soldiers.

00:43:08.290 --> 00:43:10.370 align:middle line:84%
We're actually
destroying it in a sense.

00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:13.460 align:middle line:84%
We're teaching them how to
stay built up so they're not

00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:14.410 align:middle line:90%
sleeping at night.

00:43:14.410 --> 00:43:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And they need sleep
to renew themselves.

00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:17.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thus very
high suicide rates too.

00:43:17.370 --> 00:43:18.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: So we're
burning them out.

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:19.490 align:middle line:90%
Exactly right.

00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:20.380 align:middle line:90%
Exactly right.

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:22.400 align:middle line:90%
So we taught them to do this.

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't teach them to
do this as part of resiliency,

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:27.710 align:middle line:90%
as the full cycle of resiliency.

00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:31.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so we're going
to take a look at a video that

00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:32.480 align:middle line:90%
shows the process.

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And is there anything
you want to do

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:38.149 align:middle line:84%
by way of setting this
up before we show this?

00:43:38.149 --> 00:43:40.440 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a few
minutes-- five, six minutes--

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:41.150 align:middle line:90%
and show the process.

00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:41.540 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:41.865 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Right.

00:43:41.865 --> 00:43:42.365 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:42.365 --> 00:43:44.470 align:middle line:90%
So here's what happens.

00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:46.390 align:middle line:84%
When we're working with
traumatized people,

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:50.000 align:middle line:84%
we have to do very simple,
gentle exercises with them.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And the exercises are only
designed to stretch the muscles

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:54.850 align:middle line:90%
and slightly fatigue them.

00:43:54.850 --> 00:43:55.640 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:58.510 align:middle line:84%
It's not about building muscle,
bulk, or anything like that

00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:00.290 align:middle line:90%
and no heavy-duty workout.

00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:03.100 align:middle line:84%
Because all I'm trying to
do is take the person out

00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:07.000 align:middle line:84%
of their commonly rigid
stance and starting

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.700 align:middle line:90%
to flex it a little bit.

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:11.010 align:middle line:84%
Because that's all it needs
for that nervous system

00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:12.465 align:middle line:84%
to activate the
shaking mechanism.

00:44:12.465 --> 00:44:14.860 align:middle line:84%
It has to come out
of its rigidity.

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:18.240 align:middle line:84%
So the exercises are very simple
to get it out of the rigidity.

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:21.340 align:middle line:84%
So once that happens, then
they can lay on the floor.

00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And in the last exercise, they
activate the nervous system.

00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:29.320 align:middle line:84%
All it does is cause
muscle to pulsate, see?

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And the pulsating is
a real rapid response.

00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And so, it becomes
like twitching

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:35.150 align:middle line:90%
or tremoring or shaking.

00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:36.462 align:middle line:90%
That's how they experience it.

00:44:36.462 --> 00:44:37.420 align:middle line:90%
And there's a conflict.

00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:40.014 align:middle line:84%
They feel it both pleasurable
and weird at the same time.

00:44:40.014 --> 00:44:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.921 align:middle line:84%
And is that what
you're going to show?

00:44:42.921 --> 00:44:43.920 align:middle line:90%
We're going to see that?

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:44.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Yeah.

00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:44.921 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:44:44.921 --> 00:44:45.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: OK.

00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And so, the thing about
that, what's really cool,

00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:50.860 align:middle line:84%
is that once it
activates, they don't

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:53.514 align:middle line:84%
have to consciously
reflect on it at all.

All this activated in an
intentional and controlled

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:36.780 align:middle line:90%
manner.

00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:39.530 align:middle line:84%
As seen in the animal
kingdom, mammals

00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:43.820 align:middle line:84%
employ a tremor-like shaking
reflex to quickly calm down

00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:46.050 align:middle line:84%

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:53.010 align:middle line:10%
Many of us have
seen dogs or felt

00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:54.600 align:middle line:10%
dog shaking to calm themselves.

00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Much like a
pressure-release valve,

00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:09.510 align:middle line:84%
this same tension-releasing
mechanism exists in humans.

00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:13.532 align:middle line:84%
But culturally, we have
learned to suppress or override

00:46:13.532 --> 00:46:14.115 align:middle line:90%
this response.

00:46:14.115 --> 00:46:17.970 align:middle line:90%


00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:21.260 align:middle line:84%
Until now, it has not
been well-studied or

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:23.680 align:middle line:90%
well-understood.

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:28.090 align:middle line:10%
Dr. David Berceli, while working
in trauma and stress recovery

00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:31.970 align:middle line:10%
in war-torn areas, recognized
the healing potential

00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:37.550 align:middle line:10%
of this reflex for relieving
traumatic and chronic stress.

00:46:37.550 --> 00:46:43.070 align:middle line:10%
He developed TRE as a reliable
series of simple exercises

00:46:43.070 --> 00:46:46.700 align:middle line:10%
to help individuals activate
this reflex response

00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:50.180 align:middle line:10%
and to sustain it comfortably.

00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:54.220 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Berceli understood
an important paradox.

00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:57.360 align:middle line:84%
This tremor-like or
shaking reflex-- although

00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:02.240 align:middle line:84%
of an involuntary origin--
can be activated deliberately

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:06.140 align:middle line:84%
to unwind muscle tension,
while calming and balancing

00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:09.220 align:middle line:90%
the nervous system.

00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:12.890 align:middle line:84%
When initiated in a safe
and controlled environment,

00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:17.220 align:middle line:84%
reflexive muscle vibration,
shaking, or tremoring

00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:22.860 align:middle line:84%
can feel remarkably effortless,
pleasant, and soothing.

00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:26.990 align:middle line:10%
Many people report feelings of
relief from deep-rooted stress

00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:30.510 align:middle line:10%
and tension that sometimes
cannot be achieved through

00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:34.800 align:middle line:10%
other methods such as
physical exercise, meditation,

00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:35.810 align:middle line:10%
or talk therapy.

00:47:35.810 --> 00:47:39.340 align:middle line:90%


00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Initially, simple
gentle exercises

00:47:42.490 --> 00:47:45.530 align:middle line:84%
will stretch specific
core muscles.

00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And then, a natural
tension-releasing reflex

00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:52.820 align:middle line:90%
can be intentionally initiated.

00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:57.160 align:middle line:10%
This mechanism creates
therapeutic muscle tremors

00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:59.590 align:middle line:10%
that can relieve tension
and be self-soothing.

00:47:59.590 --> 00:48:03.990 align:middle line:90%


00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:07.090 align:middle line:10%
With practice, these
therapeutic tremors

00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:09.610 align:middle line:10%
can be activated easily
and almost spontaneously.

00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:13.880 align:middle line:90%


00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:17.320 align:middle line:10%
With practice and
periodic use, most people

00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:21.990 align:middle line:10%
report that TRE helps release
deep-rooted tension, stress,

00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:23.550 align:middle line:10%
and trauma.

00:48:23.550 --> 00:48:26.450 align:middle line:10%
In many cases, they
have experienced results

00:48:26.450 --> 00:48:28.175 align:middle line:10%
that are often quite profound.

00:48:28.175 --> 00:48:34.470 align:middle line:90%


00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:37.200 align:middle line:84%
By simply adjusting
the leg positions,

00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:40.340 align:middle line:84%
the progression can easily
be paced and controlled.

00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:50.260 align:middle line:90%


00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:54.160 align:middle line:10%
Although TRE can look
strange, the reflex mechanism

00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:58.120 align:middle line:10%
allows the body to unwind
trapped muscle tension

00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:01.220 align:middle line:10%
and to calm itself
naturally, without words

00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:02.350 align:middle line:10%
or conscious effort.

00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:06.760 align:middle line:90%


00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:09.950 align:middle line:84%

Our ability to shake
off stress, including

00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:28.300 align:middle line:10%
unconscious traumatic stress,
may be hardwired in our brain.

00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:32.720 align:middle line:10%
Our capacity to be calmed by
rhythmic motion or vibration

00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:36.360 align:middle line:10%
can be observed even from birth.

00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:38.640 align:middle line:10%
Without any prompting,
parents seem

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:42.620 align:middle line:10%
to know intuitively that
a gentle, bouncing motion

00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:46.220 align:middle line:10%
before rocking will lull an
infant into a calmer, relaxed

00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:46.720 align:middle line:10%
state.

00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:52.820 align:middle line:90%

A few of the reported
benefits are better sleep

levels of stress and anxiety,

00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:08.360 align:middle line:10%
reduced muscle tension and back
pain, reduced levels of worry

00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:11.470 align:middle line:10%
when burdened by
chronic illness,

00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:16.280 align:middle line:10%
reduced anger and reduced
over-reactivity, better

Animals don't have the

it automatically

And that's actually the
nervous system trying

to calm down the organism.

00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:51.360 align:middle line:84%

00:53:10.576 --> 00:53:11.492 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:53:11.492 --> 00:53:13.759 align:middle line:84%
Because they're too tied
to the human species.

00:53:13.759 --> 00:53:14.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Exactly right.

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:16.990 align:middle line:84%
Exactly right,
and we limit them.

00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:22.030 align:middle line:84%
But in our natural
state, the nervous system

00:53:22.030 --> 00:53:24.240 align:middle line:84%
would become aroused
during the traumatic event.

00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:25.740 align:middle line:84%
After the traumatic
event is over,

00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:27.530 align:middle line:84%
the body begins
to tremor itself.

00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:30.660 align:middle line:84%
It brings yourself back into
a para-sympathetic response,

00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:31.640 align:middle line:90%
and it's over.

00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:34.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're seeing it
as it should be in nature.

00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:34.790 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Mm-hmm.

00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:36.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, particularly
vulnerable groups--

00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:40.470 align:middle line:84%
aside from people coming
back from war situations--

00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:41.452 align:middle line:90%
are women and children.

00:53:41.452 --> 00:53:42.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Right.

00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:43.632 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
true globally.

00:53:43.632 --> 00:53:44.840 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Right, absolutely.

00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:45.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:47.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I do--
which is really great.

00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And this is women and children
just in life in general,

00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:51.780 align:middle line:90%
in our society actually.

00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And mothers in particular
who are single mothers that

00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:59.640 align:middle line:84%
have several children--
they're highly stressed lives.

00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:03.470 align:middle line:84%
I teach mothers all the time
how to do this for themselves

00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:04.090 align:middle line:90%
first.

00:54:04.090 --> 00:54:07.510 align:middle line:84%
Because every child is
regulating, unconsciously,

00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:09.280 align:middle line:90%
to the mother's nervous system.

00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:12.860 align:middle line:84%
All the children from very
young aged into teenage

00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:15.010 align:middle line:90%
know when the mother is upset.

00:54:15.010 --> 00:54:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's not the face
or the eyes or anything.

00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:19.510 align:middle line:84%
It's picking up on
the nervous system.

00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:21.280 align:middle line:84%
Because all our nervous
systems generally

00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:22.780 align:middle line:90%
regulate towards each other.

00:54:22.780 --> 00:54:24.470 align:middle line:84%
It's a safety thing
that happens to us

00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:26.740 align:middle line:84%
unconsciously to test
out whether there's

00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:28.300 align:middle line:90%
safety or danger here.

00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And so, mothers need to calm
down first and get themselves

00:54:32.090 --> 00:54:34.780 align:middle line:84%
in a state of homeostasis
or more calmness.

00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:37.506 align:middle line:84%
And the children will
automatically follow them, see?

00:54:37.506 --> 00:54:38.382 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:54:38.382 --> 00:54:40.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: But then the
mothers, they're great.

00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:42.589 align:middle line:84%
If they have a good relationship
with their children--

00:54:42.589 --> 00:54:45.260 align:middle line:84%
I teach this to mothers all the
time-- they lay on the floor.

00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:47.430 align:middle line:90%
They play with the children.

00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:49.570 align:middle line:84%
They do shake
together all the time.

00:54:49.570 --> 00:54:51.200 align:middle line:90%
The children laugh and giggle.

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:52.944 align:middle line:90%
And it becomes a playful event.

00:54:52.944 --> 00:54:54.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
what a wonderful--

00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:55.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: And the
children love it.

00:54:55.090 --> 00:54:56.280 align:middle line:90%
It makes them feel better.

00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:58.056 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:54:58.056 --> 00:54:59.430 align:middle line:84%
We just have a
minute or so left.

00:54:59.430 --> 00:55:01.670 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about forgiveness
and how forgiveness

00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:02.757 align:middle line:90%
plays into all of this.

00:55:02.757 --> 00:55:03.340 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: OK.

00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:05.450 align:middle line:84%
Forgiveness is a very
complicated thing.

00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:09.470 align:middle line:84%
Because some traumas
are vindictive.

00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:11.740 align:middle line:84%
If somebody beats you
up, different from you're

00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:16.160 align:middle line:84%
in an earthquake where it's
from God or whatever, nature,

00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:17.030 align:middle line:90%
that sort of thing.

00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:19.704 align:middle line:84%
And so, that plays
a role in about how

00:55:19.704 --> 00:55:20.620 align:middle line:90%
we're able to forgive.

00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:21.700 align:middle line:90%
Do I have to forgive God?

00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:22.970 align:middle line:90%
Or do I have to forgive you?

00:55:22.970 --> 00:55:25.760 align:middle line:84%
Or do I have to
forgive my spouse?

00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:27.220 align:middle line:90%
--or et cetera.

00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:31.220 align:middle line:10%
Forgiveness, at its deepest
level-- I truly believe,

00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:33.180 align:middle line:10%
when people have
gone through trauma

00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:35.340 align:middle line:10%
and really tried
to resolve it-- is

00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:40.700 align:middle line:10%
we end up forgiving us
that we are this way.

00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:43.070 align:middle line:84%
It's not a vindictive
directed thing.

00:55:43.070 --> 00:55:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's not, you
have to forgive me.

00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:46.140 align:middle line:90%
Or I have to forgive you.

00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:49.390 align:middle line:84%
We have to experience
that we as a human species

00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:53.070 align:middle line:84%
have to forgive ourselves
for being the way we are.

00:55:53.070 --> 00:55:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And that is the most
profound level of forgiveness

00:55:56.030 --> 00:55:57.010 align:middle line:90%
I think I've ever seen.

00:55:57.010 --> 00:55:57.885 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:55:57.885 --> 00:56:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And finally, is it
advisable then--

00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:02.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it sounds
like it for, really,

00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:05.010 align:middle line:84%
pretty much anybody that's
living in the modern world.

00:56:05.010 --> 00:56:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Because we are being conditioned
towards stress and trauma

00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:11.110 align:middle line:84%
all the time, subconsciously,
and as you said,

00:56:11.110 --> 00:56:12.590 align:middle line:90%
we're doing it to ourselves.

00:56:12.590 --> 00:56:14.680 align:middle line:84%
Aside from removing
ourselves and going back

00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:17.470 align:middle line:84%
to the land and such-- which
people are doing-- turning off

00:56:17.470 --> 00:56:21.590 align:middle line:84%
the TV, et cetera, is it
good for us in general

00:56:21.590 --> 00:56:24.135 align:middle line:84%
to start doing the TRE exercises
together or alone even?

00:56:24.135 --> 00:56:26.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: I think it's
absolutely essential,

00:56:26.010 --> 00:56:26.640 align:middle line:90%
personally.

00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I say that
is because if it's still

00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:30.780 align:middle line:84%
built into our
nervous system, then

00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:32.950 align:middle line:84%
as part of our
evolutionary process,

00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:34.590 align:middle line:84%
our nervous system
must still think we

00:56:34.590 --> 00:56:36.570 align:middle line:90%
need that to actually survive.

00:56:36.570 --> 00:56:38.720 align:middle line:10%
So I think every
human person, just

00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:40.620 align:middle line:10%
as they know how to
tense themselves,

00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:43.805 align:middle line:10%
should know how to release that
tension through this tremor

00:56:43.805 --> 00:56:44.305 align:middle line:10%
mechanism.

00:56:44.305 --> 00:56:46.760 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's actually
organic in the human body.

00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know one
guy who does the method

00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:51.364 align:middle line:90%
before going out on dates.

00:56:51.364 --> 00:56:52.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Yeah!

00:56:52.030 --> 00:56:52.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because he has
a little fear built up--

00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:53.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: There you go!

00:56:53.070 --> 00:56:53.653 align:middle line:90%
Exactly right.

00:56:53.653 --> 00:56:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --over rejections
of the past and tensing

00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:58.470 align:middle line:84%
up and who knows what's
going to play out.

00:56:58.470 --> 00:57:00.489 align:middle line:84%
And that's how he
relaxes himself--

00:57:00.489 --> 00:57:01.280 align:middle line:90%
>>BERCELI: Perfect.

00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:03.277 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --to be a good
companion on a date.

00:57:03.277 --> 00:57:04.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BERCELI: Yeah, I
think it's perfect.

00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:06.740 align:middle line:90%
And it's probably helping him.

00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:08.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It definitely is.

00:57:08.090 --> 00:57:09.550 align:middle line:90%
David, fabulous work.
