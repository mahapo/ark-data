>>REGINA MEREDITH:
This book that you've

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.190 align:middle line:84%
written, it does a beautiful
job of how we have come,

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.150 align:middle line:84%
as governments and citizens,
to view and embrace and react

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.523 align:middle line:90%
to this whole phenomena.

>>PAOLA HARRIS: "Close
Encounters of the Third Kind"

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.480 align:middle line:84%
came out, and Francois
Truffaut played Jacques Vallee.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Jacques Vallee.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.470 align:middle line:84%
>>JACQUES VALLEE: The secret
was kept by the government,

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.622 align:middle line:84%
and the secret was
kept by the witnesses.

00:00:30.622 --> 00:00:33.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These little kids
would come and get an ice cream

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.900 align:middle line:84%
cone, not knowing that
these men with briefcases

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.970 align:middle line:84%
were people like
Oppenheimer, and they

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.480 align:middle line:84%
weren't even worthy of
warning that this blast was

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.800 align:middle line:90%
going to take place.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.370 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: And that
lasted 70 years.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.790 align:middle line:84%
The bomb turned out to be four
times more powerful than all

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.620 align:middle line:90%
the calculations they had made.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: There were no
flying saucer magazines.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.930 align:middle line:84%
Kenneth Arnold hadn't come
out with that word yet.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.550 align:middle line:84%
There was no context to
what they were looking at,

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.310 align:middle line:90%
and it was not a flying saucer.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.620 align:middle line:90%
It was an avocado-shaped craft.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:04.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.888 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: I am not
a whistleblower.

00:01:05.888 --> 00:01:07.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm a very
disciplined scientist.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.420 align:middle line:90%
That's why I'm--

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes. you're not
a conspiracy theorist.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.826 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:10.826 --> 00:01:13.730 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: It strikes me
that all the attention

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.500 align:middle line:84%
is, what is the government
going to reveal to us.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: My approach, I
don't think you should wait

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.135 align:middle line:90%
for the government--

00:01:20.135 --> 00:01:20.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I--

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.087 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: --to tell
you what's going on.

00:01:22.087 --> 00:01:25.300 align:middle line:90%


00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The 20th anniversary
of the Disclosure Project

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.930 align:middle line:90%
passed recently.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And as UFO researchers and
enthusiasts looked back

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.450 align:middle line:84%
on how the subject
is being handled,

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.550 align:middle line:84%
we realized not
much has changed.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.950 align:middle line:84%
By that, I mean that the US
government has done little

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.490 align:middle line:84%
to inform the public about
UFOs and potential contact.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.930 align:middle line:90%
But it's starting.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.290 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're going back
to 1945 and a case that

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.240 align:middle line:84%
should have been as
well known as Roswell,

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.880 align:middle line:84%
but is just now
being fully revealed.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.980 align:middle line:84%
It shows the mystery
and challenge

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.920 align:middle line:90%
in deconstructing the UFO story.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And we have a very
special guest with us,

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Jacques Vallee, and
Paola Harris, who

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.320 align:middle line:90%
have come together as a team.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.362 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say this
for our audience, Jacques.

00:02:05.362 --> 00:02:06.670 align:middle line:90%
You're a bit like a unicorn.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.039 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has heard of
you, but nobody ever

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.660 align:middle line:84%
gets to nail you down in a seat
and talk to you personally.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.460 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: Right.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.407 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:13.407 --> 00:02:14.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.390 align:middle line:84%
So let me just inform
everybody of a little bit

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.490 align:middle line:84%
of your background that
they may not know about.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Besides the researching
aspect in UFOs,

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.970 align:middle line:90%
you're an academic, hard core.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.790 align:middle line:84%
Mathematics, astrophysics,
first to use computer modeling

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:28.960 align:middle line:90%
to map Mars.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm doing this
quickly just to say, look,

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.670 align:middle line:90%
this is who he is.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And an early developer
in AI in Silicon Valley.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.720 align:middle line:84%
You continue to this day
to work in Silicon Valley

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.450 align:middle line:84%
technologically, and then
as a venture capitalist.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.960 align:middle line:84%
But that's the one
side of your life.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.460 align:middle line:90%
That's your day job.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.020 align:middle line:84%
The other side of your life
is you, as a young one,

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.490 align:middle line:84%
had your own experiences
and began a deep curiosity,

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.810 align:middle line:84%
looking from an academic
lens at the UFO phenomena.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.720 align:middle line:84%
Because of Jacques's
incredible background,

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.320 align:middle line:84%
you've had access to entities,
such as governmental agencies

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.060 align:middle line:84%
and such most people in this
field never get access to.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.380 align:middle line:84%
So I consider you to have
a very unique perspective

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.240 align:middle line:90%
on this phenomena, in general.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And we-- of course,
everybody knows Paola.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.590 align:middle line:84%
Paola has been
with us, and she's

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.690 align:middle line:84%
the backbone of so
many of the contacts

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.610 align:middle line:84%
that we have here
at Gaia that are now

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.500 align:middle line:84%
coming out into the public
eye, or through you,

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.300 align:middle line:90%
or through Paola.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.450 align:middle line:84%
So I love the fact
that the two of you,

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.360 align:middle line:84%
with your unique ways
of approaching life,

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.910 align:middle line:84%
have come together to
do this, because it

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.060 align:middle line:84%
really rings to something
larger in terms of ways

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.130 align:middle line:90%
to analyze information and data.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.840 align:middle line:90%
So I've laid it out.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.800 align:middle line:90%
Here everybody is.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.730 align:middle line:10%
We're all together.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.140 align:middle line:10%
Your lives intersected with
a man named Allen Hynek,

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.370 align:middle line:10%
in terms of both having contact
early on in the days that

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.460 align:middle line:10%
were now put onto
fictional renditions

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.590 align:middle line:10%
on History Channel in
"Project Blue Book."

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.060 align:middle line:90%
Anybody can go watch that.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.627 align:middle line:90%
This is a real person.

00:04:02.627 --> 00:04:04.210 align:middle line:84%
You're a real person
who was with him.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:05.800 align:middle line:10%
You're a real person
who was with him.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.530 align:middle line:10%
I want to ask each
of you, let's go back

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.890 align:middle line:10%
into the days of the
'60s with Allen Hynek.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And how you were involved
with them and then

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.029 align:middle line:84%
how you were involved
with them, and why this

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:19.209 align:middle line:90%
is important to this story.

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.190 align:middle line:10%
>>VALLEE: I-- some of my
education was in France.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.070 align:middle line:10%
I was recruited by
Paris Observatory,

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.000 align:middle line:10%
in the first team that
did satellite tracking

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.670 align:middle line:10%
in French science.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:40.470 align:middle line:10%
I quickly realized that UFOs
were an unsolved problem.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.410 align:middle line:84%
Actually, unsolved
and unresearched,

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.710 align:middle line:84%
because everybody
was afraid of rocking

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.850 align:middle line:84%
the boat about the
theories that existed.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And I became aware of the work
that had been done in the US.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.160 align:middle line:84%
Of course, American science is
a model for European science,

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.300 align:middle line:90%
in many ways.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:09.840 align:middle line:84%
And I was recruited to work
at the University of Texas,

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.450 align:middle line:90%
where I had access to records.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.530 align:middle line:84%
I had access to a computer,
in a much more open way

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.330 align:middle line:84%
than I did in France, to study
UFOs alongside the astronomical

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.620 align:middle line:90%
work I was doing.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And then, through that
work, I met Dr. Hynek

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.510 align:middle line:84%
and moved to Northwestern
University in Chicago.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And worked, actually, with
him pretty much day to day

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.022 align:middle line:90%
for about five years, and--

00:05:38.022 --> 00:05:39.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
was while he was

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.250 align:middle line:84%
doing his research for the
US military and intelligence

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.090 align:middle line:90%
agencies, right?

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.200 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: Well, he was
the scientific consultant

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:55.038 align:middle line:84%
to Project Blue Book, which
was the Air Force project

00:05:55.038 --> 00:05:57.840 align:middle line:84%
to study reports
from the public.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.280 align:middle line:84%
Mostly from the public, but
also from the armed forces.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And try to see if there
was a scientific value

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.830 align:middle line:90%
to those observations.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:09.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.060 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: And I was
bringing the databases

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.820 align:middle line:84%
from the European
side that I had

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:20.370 align:middle line:84%
been studying for many years,
and starting to apply computer

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.800 align:middle line:90%
science research to this.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.010 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think
that, in my case,

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:30.280 align:middle line:84%
you can say that I have these
two sides, the serious side

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.253 align:middle line:90%
and then the UFO.

00:06:31.253 --> 00:06:32.295 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're merged.

00:06:32.295 --> 00:06:36.210 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: And Silicon
Valley does many things.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.080 align:middle line:84%
One of my friends is
Federico Faggin, a physicist,

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.160 align:middle line:84%
an Italian physicist
in Silicon Valley,

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.810 align:middle line:84%
who was very instrumental
in semiconductor research.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.960 align:middle line:84%
Actually, he invented
the first chip,

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.590 align:middle line:90%
if you want to call it that way.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.390 align:middle line:90%
And we had that discussion.

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And he said, when we
stop looking at things

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.560 align:middle line:84%
we don't understand,
like UFOs, we

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.680 align:middle line:84%
might as well sell Silicon
Valley to the Japanese

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.800 align:middle line:90%
or to some other nation.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is so true.

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:07.730 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: This is what we do.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:08.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.230 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: It's not
today's technology.

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:12.270 align:middle line:84%
It's, what are the
challenges that

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:15.985 align:middle line:84%
will get us to stay at the
frontier of technology.

00:07:15.985 --> 00:07:16.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.210 align:middle line:10%
And I was doing an interview
with someone recently,

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:23.430 align:middle line:10%
and they were talking about
the world of settled science.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:27.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, you don't go on beyond the
parameters of settled science.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.980 align:middle line:90%
And I said, are you kidding me?

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.530 align:middle line:84%
The one thing science
should never be is settled.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.870 align:middle line:84%
Science is constant
inquiry and growing.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that you
say, this is really

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:39.150 align:middle line:84%
what Silicon Valley is about,
for all the good it brings

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:41.310 align:middle line:84%
and all the
challenges it brings.

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: Early in
the 20th century,

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:48.000 align:middle line:84%
some philosophers said that
essentially, all of science

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.860 align:middle line:90%
had been discovered.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And that the future
generation of scientists,

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:58.410 align:middle line:84%
which add the next decimal
point, the next decimal place,

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:00.453 align:middle line:84%
to the constants that
had been measured--

00:08:00.453 --> 00:08:01.411 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How arrogant.

00:08:01.411 --> 00:08:01.480 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.350 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: The speed of light,
all those things were known.

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:04.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just
another decimal point.

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:07.350 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: That you just needed
a little bit more precision.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And then after that, there
was quantum mechanics,

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:10.835 align:middle line:84%
there was relativity,
there was--

00:08:10.835 --> 00:08:12.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And on
and on to today.

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:13.530 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: Everything else, yes.

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:16.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you, dealing
with AI, know some--

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.820 align:middle line:84%
that would be another,
entirely different interview

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:19.620 align:middle line:90%
to look at--

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.078 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to talk
to you, separately

00:08:21.078 --> 00:08:24.250 align:middle line:84%
from this story one day, about
AI and where you see it going,

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:25.050 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:26.758 align:middle line:84%
But we're not going
to do that right now.

00:08:26.758 --> 00:08:30.700 align:middle line:10%
So you became involved with
Allen during this period.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And I highly recommend
anybody, just for kicks,

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:35.640 align:middle line:90%
go watch the fictitious version.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.409 align:middle line:90%
Go watch "Project Blue Book."

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:40.890 align:middle line:84%
Because his son, Paul Hynek,
was actually a consultant to it.

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:43.230 align:middle line:84%
There are some real-- they're
dealing with real cases.

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:45.750 align:middle line:84%
They just put little spins on
it and have sexy Russian spies

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:46.020 align:middle line:90%
and things.

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.180 align:middle line:84%
But it gives you an idea
of what he was up to

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:49.410 align:middle line:90%
and how it gets spun.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:52.260 align:middle line:84%
So Paola, now, how did
you initially end up

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:53.730 align:middle line:90%
with Allen Hynek?

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:57.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, I was teaching
high school here in Colorado.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And they gave me a class
called Science Fiction.

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.280 align:middle line:84%
I have a master's in
education, and I've

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.420 align:middle line:90%
taught English for 40 years.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And so "Close Encounters of
the Third Kind" came out,

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.090 align:middle line:90%
and Jacques came on.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:09.930 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:16.200 align:middle line:84%
It was around the character
of the French scientist.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.508 align:middle line:84%
Francois Truffaut
played Jacques Vallee.

00:09:18.508 --> 00:09:19.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Jacques Vallee.

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:22.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: The irony is, I
never met Jacques Vallee.

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:25.490 align:middle line:84%
What I decided to do
was go to the Center

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:27.950 align:middle line:84%
for UFO Studies in
Evanston, Illinois.

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:31.430 align:middle line:10%
And that was the
time that Allen began

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:36.050 align:middle line:10%
his own group, which was
Center of UFO Studies, CUFOS,

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:39.440 align:middle line:10%
and I walked into the
offices to see if what

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.950 align:middle line:10%
I had seen on screen was real.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:45.740 align:middle line:84%
And the secretary
knew I spoke Italian.

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I'd never see
Dr. Hynek in a million years.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:51.800 align:middle line:84%
But sure enough, from
around the corner

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:56.780 align:middle line:84%
came this man with a
white goatee and a pipe.

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And he came over
and he said, oh.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.890 align:middle line:90%
He said, you speak Italian?

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:02.690 align:middle line:90%
You're visiting?

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:03.500 align:middle line:90%
And I said yes.

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And he said, would you be
willing to work with me?

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:09.650 align:middle line:84%
He said, because I have
boxes of Italian sightings.

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:14.150 align:middle line:10%
I have all kinds of work
that needs to be done.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And he came to Boulder
several times to visit me.

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:19.220 align:middle line:84%
But mostly, he sent
me all the sightings

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.420 align:middle line:90%
and bought me a typewriter.

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:21.470 align:middle line:84%
In those days, we
had typewriters.

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:22.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You had typewriters.

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:22.470 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: Yes.

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:22.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:23.670 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:24.740 align:middle line:90%
Note to self.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:28.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: But I never knew
Jacques, in my wildest dreams.

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:31.110 align:middle line:84%
I knew that he was a
venture capitalist.

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:33.530 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't until
four years ago

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:37.820 align:middle line:84%
that he was working on a case,
and I was working on a case,

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.410 align:middle line:90%
and we came together to do this.

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:44.580 align:middle line:84%
But all the time, that film
really affected me emotionally,

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:45.470 align:middle line:90%
especially--

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:46.303 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Everybody.

00:10:46.303 --> 00:10:49.340 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: --at the very end,
when Francois Truffaut has

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.870 align:middle line:90%
the encounter with the beings.

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:52.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:53.540 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And how do you say
"meant to be" in French?

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:58.465 align:middle line:84%
When something
something's meant to be?

00:10:58.465 --> 00:10:59.590 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:10:59.590 --> 00:10:59.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.160 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: It was written--

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:01.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is written.

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:02.470 align:middle line:90%
It is written.

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:03.045 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: --in the universe.

00:11:03.045 --> 00:11:03.935 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It's
written in the stars.

00:11:03.935 --> 00:11:04.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was
written in the--

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:05.990 align:middle line:84%
so it was written
in the stars for you

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:07.880 align:middle line:84%
to be there at that
moment to run into Allen.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And the reality is that
the Italian military and

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:13.430 align:middle line:84%
intelligence communities
have always taken this

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:16.940 align:middle line:84%
more seriously and have been a
little more forthcoming than we

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:17.870 align:middle line:90%
have in the US.

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:20.330 align:middle line:84%
So I can see where that
would have added greatly

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.820 align:middle line:84%
to the body of knowledge
he was studying.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:24.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes, and in the--

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:27.380 align:middle line:84%
we must add,
though, that there's

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:30.650 align:middle line:84%
more of a vested interest
in keeping it secret here,

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:31.520 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.320 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I think that
all over the world--

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:39.590 align:middle line:84%
when Jacques was younger,
they were interested in France

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:40.400 align:middle line:90%
in this.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And in Italy, we were
always interested.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:44.570 align:middle line:90%
I lived there for many years.

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And the conversation,
I think one

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:47.930 align:middle line:84%
of the things that
brings us together

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:49.880 align:middle line:90%
is that we're both European.

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:53.733 align:middle line:84%
And we have a lot of
conversations about the world

00:11:53.733 --> 00:11:54.650 align:middle line:90%
view, the world view--

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:56.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:56.920 align:middle line:90%
And that's what--

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:57.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: On UFOs.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I have to say,
this book you've written,

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.050 align:middle line:84%
"Trinity-- the Best-Kept
Secret," it really

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:07.070 align:middle line:84%
does a beautiful job
of your articulation

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:10.250 align:middle line:84%
of how we have come as
governments and citizens

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:13.940 align:middle line:84%
to view and embrace and react
to this whole phenomena.

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's so elegantly
written, I have to say.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.000 align:middle line:90%
People need to read this book.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.340 align:middle line:90%
It's very well done.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.740 align:middle line:84%
Because we're still not
looking at the big picture.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.620 align:middle line:84%
Everybody writes their little
books about their piece,

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:28.460 align:middle line:84%
but they're not looking
at the overview of it.

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:31.640 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: What strikes
me in the current debate,

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.740 align:middle line:84%
which is becoming more and
more active, and of course,

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:39.350 align:middle line:84%
there may be a report from
the government, from the Navy,

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:43.440 align:middle line:84%
about the current state of
the phenomenon and government

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.240 align:middle line:90%
reaction to it--

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.115 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Supposedly.

00:12:45.115 --> 00:12:47.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: What strikes me
is that all the attention,

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.640 align:middle line:84%
everything you see
on TV and so on,

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:52.650 align:middle line:84%
is what is the government
going to reveal to us.

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:53.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Now, my
approach isn't that.

00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:00.440 align:middle line:84%
I think-- I don't think you
should wait for the government

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.725 align:middle line:90%
to tell you what's going on.

00:13:01.725 --> 00:13:02.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hallelujah.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.267 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Your neighbors
have seen UFOs.

00:13:04.267 --> 00:13:05.420 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:09.000 align:middle line:84%
In this case, I have
a colleague who says,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.590 align:middle line:84%
well, you had some clearances
along the way when you worked

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:15.330 align:middle line:90%
on space projects and so on.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.450 align:middle line:84%
But you'll never
have the clearances

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:22.670 align:middle line:84%
it takes to know what's really
going on in a case like this,

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:23.730 align:middle line:90%
in the Manhattan Project.

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:24.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:27.530 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: And my response is,
I don't need the clearances.

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:29.070 align:middle line:90%
I have the witnesses.

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:29.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:31.970 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: These two
little kids were there.

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:33.800 align:middle line:90%
The government wasn't there.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:37.370 align:middle line:84%
These two little kids
were there on the spot

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:39.050 align:middle line:90%
when the thing crashed.

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:40.310 align:middle line:90%
It actually didn't crash.

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:41.840 align:middle line:90%
It crash landed.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.940 align:middle line:90%
It was under power.

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.890 align:middle line:90%
It didn't break apart.

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And the entire
thing was recovered.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.090 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:53.465 align:middle line:84%
So Lamar and Paola
had been researching

00:13:53.465 --> 00:13:54.632 align:middle line:90%
this for four or five years.

00:13:54.632 --> 00:13:56.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, well, you're in
your 12th year or something

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:57.200 align:middle line:90%
by now.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:57.980 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: For four
or five years before.

00:13:57.980 --> 00:13:58.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:01.100 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: Now, I came in because
I had been looking at other

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.310 align:middle line:90%
cases in New Mexico, and--

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:04.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sorocco and--

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:08.075 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: A friend
of mine knew one

00:14:08.075 --> 00:14:14.150 align:middle line:84%
of the witnesses, who by then
was in his late 70s and 80s,

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:16.550 align:middle line:84%
and wanting to
introduce me to him.

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And then I discovered that
Paola had already done research

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.360 align:middle line:84%
with that witness,
so we combined

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.250 align:middle line:90%
the information we had.

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And then we went back to the
site, and that was the story.

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:29.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And Paola-- I mean,
Paola hears something.

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:34.410 align:middle line:90%
She says, I'm on my way.

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:36.810 align:middle line:84%
She's just like Indiana
Jones when it comes to--

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:36.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Well--

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:38.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When there's field
research and people who are

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.270 align:middle line:84%
ready to talk, or there's
evidence somewhere--

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:41.130 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I have to get there--

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:42.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have to
get there immediately.

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.967 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: --because
even with this case,

00:14:43.967 --> 00:14:46.170 align:middle line:10%
Jacques, what had
happened is that I got

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:48.420 align:middle line:10%
to the six-year-old, Reme Baca.

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Thank God I got to
interview him in Washington,

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:52.210 align:middle line:90%
because he passed away.

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:53.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:57.270 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: And we needed to get
the two sides of the story.

00:14:57.270 --> 00:15:01.200 align:middle line:10%
Jacques read Reme's book, so
he was able to get Reme's.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.140 align:middle line:84%
But when he was doing the book,
he needed the other witness.

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:05.310 align:middle line:90%
He needed the six-year-old.

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:06.490 align:middle line:90%
We had the nine-year-old.

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:07.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:09.327 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: And I realized that--

00:15:09.327 --> 00:15:11.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He had become seven
by the time this happened, yeah.

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:14.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And what had happened
is that we need both sides.

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:14.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:16.373 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: And even
though they weren't

00:15:16.373 --> 00:15:18.960 align:middle line:10%
living in the same
place, field research--

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.510 align:middle line:10%
and I've enjoyed
doing it with Jacques,

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:22.890 align:middle line:10%
because we keep
going down there.

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:25.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't enjoy the snakes,
and I don't enjoy--

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:26.550 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:27.360 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.620 align:middle line:84%
He likes Mexican food
better than I do.

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:31.050 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: But--

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:32.475 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you're
hanging out in some-- well,

00:15:32.475 --> 00:15:34.290 align:middle line:84%
there aren't a lot of
options when you're out there

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:35.050 align:middle line:90%
in New Mexico in the desert.

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:35.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Well, no.

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:37.320 align:middle line:90%
This is desert, high desert.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And then we even
went to Ground Zero.

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:42.960 align:middle line:84%
Because ironically--
you might want

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.760 align:middle line:90%
to talk about the impression.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:48.510 align:middle line:10%
We went to Ground Zero where the
actual bomb was exploded, but--

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:50.260 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: We are going
to talk about that.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:51.060 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:53.830 align:middle line:90%
It does do something to you.

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:55.035 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:15:55.035 --> 00:15:59.290 align:middle line:84%
It shows the background of
what these little boys lived

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:00.090 align:middle line:90%
through.

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:03.960 align:middle line:84%
But you mentioned my way
of dealing with life.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.870 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I'm a field researcher.

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:09.506 align:middle line:84%
I don't sit at home, take a
telephone, talk to people.

00:16:09.506 --> 00:16:10.306 align:middle line:90%
I have to go there.

00:16:10.306 --> 00:16:10.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You've got to go.

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:11.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I have to go there.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:12.180 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:13.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You and I have
been on our own adventures.

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:15.225 align:middle line:84%
We went to Sardinia
and so forth.

00:16:15.225 --> 00:16:15.540 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so I
know how you work.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.500 align:middle line:84%
You get out there, you roll
your sleeves up, and you dig in.

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.667 align:middle line:84%
You dig in to wherever the
evidence and research is,

00:16:21.667 --> 00:16:24.390 align:middle line:84%
and I totally admire
that about you.

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'd like
to do now is now

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.632 align:middle line:90%
we're getting into the book, OK?

00:16:28.632 --> 00:16:30.090 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get
into this story,

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:32.400 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to go
back to that fateful day

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.490 align:middle line:84%
when the world changed, when the
first atomic blast took place

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:38.160 align:middle line:84%
in New Mexico,
this Trinity site.

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And the thing-- there
are a few things

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:41.670 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to say to set this up.

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:43.365 align:middle line:84%
The Native people
who lived there,

00:16:43.365 --> 00:16:45.240 align:middle line:84%
these families who lived
in these small towns

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.960 align:middle line:90%
surrounding it, are--

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:52.290 align:middle line:84%
They're intermarried between
the Native American population

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:54.870 align:middle line:84%
and the Spanish and
Mexican population.

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And you have people
who are mostly

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:58.140 align:middle line:90%
living close to the land.

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:00.150 align:middle line:90%
Farmers, shepherds and so forth.

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:03.100 align:middle line:90%
And the US government--

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:04.680 align:middle line:90%
the famous bar.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:05.722 align:middle line:90%
What is it, the Owl Cafe?

00:17:05.722 --> 00:17:06.522 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: The bar.

00:17:06.522 --> 00:17:08.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These little
kids would come and go,

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:11.369 align:middle line:84%
and they get an ice cream
cone or some pop or something,

00:17:11.369 --> 00:17:13.680 align:middle line:84%
not knowing that these
men with briefcases

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.359 align:middle line:90%
were people like Oppenheimer.

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:17.220 align:middle line:84%
They were just the
background of life.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:18.810 align:middle line:90%
No one paid attention to them.

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:20.790 align:middle line:90%
They served you.

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't even worthy
of warning that this blast was

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:25.859 align:middle line:90%
going to take place.

00:17:25.859 --> 00:17:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And I get upset when
I think about this.

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:32.170 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: And that
lasted 70 years.

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And the reason the
subtitle of Trinity

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:37.740 align:middle line:84%
is "The Best-Kept Secret"
is that the secret

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:42.900 align:middle line:84%
was kept by the government,
by whoever in the Pentagon

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:44.580 align:middle line:90%
was running this.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And the secret was
kept by the witnesses.

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:48.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:50.140 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: And that is unique.

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:51.300 align:middle line:90%
We know about Roswell.

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.780 align:middle line:84%
We know about other cases,
other crashes in New Mexico

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:57.030 align:middle line:90%
that I've researched and so on.

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:59.550 align:middle line:90%
I knew nothing about this.

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And the UFO community,
so vaguely aware

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.310 align:middle line:84%
that there had been
something there, but it

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:07.450 align:middle line:90%
wasn't terribly important.

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And there were a few
people who filmed the site,

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:13.500 align:middle line:90%
and then they went on.

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.570 align:middle line:84%
They went on to
Roswell, because Roswell

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:21.990 align:middle line:84%
had much more documentation and
witnesses who spoke and so on.

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:26.820 align:middle line:84%
What I couldn't understand when
I first was exposed to this is,

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:30.870 align:middle line:84%
where were the witnesses
during all that time?

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:33.930 align:middle line:84%
How come they didn't
show up anywhere?

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:40.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you reconstruct the
history of what happened there,

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:44.670 align:middle line:84%
the first atomic bomb in the
history of mankind, history

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:45.970 align:middle line:90%
changed.

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And that entire area
was a secret area,

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.380 align:middle line:90%
and people were afraid.

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:55.510 align:middle line:84%
They knew that you don't
talk about what you see.

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:57.510 align:middle line:84%
You don't talk about
what you've done.

00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:00.900 align:middle line:84%
Even the people, their
fathers, their uncles

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:06.410 align:middle line:84%
were hired as carpenters to work
on some of the structures that

00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:07.210 align:middle line:90%
held the bomb.

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:07.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.360 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: But you go home,
you don't talk about that.

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they never told
the people that they were going

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.740 align:middle line:84%
to detonate this thing, and
what it could do to them

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:14.040 align:middle line:90%
physically--

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:14.340 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: That's right.

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:15.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --which
it did to them.

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:15.990 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: That's right.

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:18.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it affected
generations of them.

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:23.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: There were very heavy
decisions that were made there,

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:25.410 align:middle line:90%
that people regretted before--

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:29.430 align:middle line:90%
regretted after the explosion.

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:32.250 align:middle line:84%
But they just didn't
have the science.

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:35.700 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know how powerful
the bomb was going to be.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:39.120 align:middle line:84%
The bomb turned out to be four
times more powerful than all

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.110 align:middle line:90%
the calculations they had made.

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:43.140 align:middle line:84%
They didn't even know
if a bomb would work.

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:46.090 align:middle line:84%
Many experts said, this
bomb will never work.

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:48.740 align:middle line:90%
You can't do it.

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:53.720 align:middle line:90%
So part of what I try to do--

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.990 align:middle line:84%
many people do this research
by, you rush to the scene,

00:19:56.990 --> 00:20:00.410 align:middle line:84%
you record what the witnesses
have said, and then you go home

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:01.820 align:middle line:90%
and you write something.

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:03.410 align:middle line:90%
And that's fine.

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:05.480 align:middle line:84%
At least it gets
into the literature.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.940 align:middle line:84%
If you want to do
a good job, you

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:10.860 align:middle line:84%
should know what happened
before the sighting, what

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:11.660 align:middle line:90%
happened after.

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:12.535 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:20:12.535 --> 00:20:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: Why did the
witness behave this way?

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:16.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:18.320 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: Why did they use
certain words rather than

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.170 align:middle line:90%
certain other words?

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:20.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why did this
craft show up one week

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:21.930 align:middle line:84%
after that atomic
blast in that area?

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:22.520 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: Yes.

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:23.895 align:middle line:84%
What does the
landscape tell you?

00:20:23.895 --> 00:20:25.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What were
they looking for?

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:31.220 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: So I spent some
time, every time we went there,

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:38.290 align:middle line:84%
alone, walking around,
letting the landscape tell me

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:40.970 align:middle line:90%
what the history was there.

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:45.800 align:middle line:84%
Both the geological history,
which is amazing in New Mexico,

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:46.640 align:middle line:90%
of course.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:49.680 align:middle line:90%
But also, the tribes.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:54.320 align:middle line:84%
Which is why on the cover, we
didn't want to put Enrico Fermi

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.310 align:middle line:90%
and Oppenheimer.

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:56.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:58.298 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: We wanted to
put the local people.

00:20:58.298 --> 00:21:00.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These are the ones
who experienced all of it.

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:02.810 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: The young
kid with his horse.

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:03.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love that picture.

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:04.640 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: And Mama
Grande, who is

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:09.830 align:middle line:84%
grandmother who was a leader
of the Apache in the area.

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:12.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, those were the
people who were there.

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:15.110 align:middle line:84%
Yes, the scientists were
there for four years,

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:17.060 align:middle line:84%
and then they went
back to Chicago.

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:18.530 align:middle line:90%
They went back to teaching.

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:20.210 align:middle line:90%
Or they went to Los Alamos.

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:22.370 align:middle line:90%
But what about the local people?

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:24.438 align:middle line:84%
What did they see and
what did they experience?

00:21:24.438 --> 00:21:25.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And that was really--

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:28.242 align:middle line:84%
you wrote so
beautifully in this book

00:21:28.242 --> 00:21:29.450 align:middle line:90%
about what happened that day.

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that you and Paola
did go back to Ground Zero,

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:36.290 align:middle line:84%
in this horrid, eerie
feeling, in this plaque

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:38.840 align:middle line:84%
at the entrance of
it, which Oppenheimer

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:42.530 align:middle line:90%
is on video saying himself.

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:44.513 align:middle line:84%
This is really critical,
because as I-- it

00:21:44.513 --> 00:21:46.430 align:middle line:84%
breaks my heart every
time I go back and watch

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:50.030 align:middle line:84%
that piece on YouTube of
what he had to say afterward.

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:52.340 align:middle line:90%
"I am now the destructor of--

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:53.900 align:middle line:90%
the destroyer of worlds."

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And it appears he's crying
when he's saying it.

00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:01.100 align:middle line:84%
There was so much, I think,
regret and shame around what

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:03.830 align:middle line:90%
we had unleashed on humankind.

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And other cultures from other
places or other dimensions

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.310 align:middle line:84%
have every reason
to be concerned,

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:13.640 align:middle line:84%
because we can shoot that
stuff out there, too.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And so they began coming
to military installations

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:18.780 align:middle line:90%
in droves.

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:22.540 align:middle line:84%
These events, these
sightings, these crashes.

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:23.670 align:middle line:90%
So let's go back to Reme.

00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:25.470 align:middle line:84%
Let's just pick it up there,
unless you have something

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:27.240 align:middle line:84%
you want to say about
Ground Zero first

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.517 align:middle line:90%
and how it felt being there.

00:22:29.517 --> 00:22:30.600 align:middle line:10%
>>VALLEE: Well, that was--

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.090 align:middle line:10%
there were a few
funny coincidences,

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:37.560 align:middle line:10%
if you want to call them
coincidences in this research.

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:39.000 align:middle line:90%
I was having breakfast.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.440 align:middle line:90%
I had gotten up early.

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:44.160 align:middle line:84%
I was waiting for Paola
and another researcher who

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.540 align:middle line:90%
came with her.

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:48.720 align:middle line:90%
And there was a newspaper there.

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And I pick up the
newspaper and it

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:52.740 align:middle line:84%
says there is going
to be a demonstration

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:54.810 align:middle line:90%
on the way to Ground Zero.

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, these
people are crazy.

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:59.070 align:middle line:84%
They want to do a
political demonstration

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:01.260 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of a desert.

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:03.030 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's going to bother.

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:04.740 align:middle line:84%
They are by the side
of an expressway.

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:06.810 align:middle line:90%
Nobody-- who is going to stop?

00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:10.830 align:middle line:84%
Except that that was the one
time when the base was open.

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:16.710 align:middle line:84%
The Ground Zero is
open twice a year,

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:18.270 align:middle line:90%
where visitors can come in.

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And there are
thousands of cars that

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:22.860 align:middle line:90%
are going to take that turn.

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:25.753 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Including unmarked
black cars, dignitaries,

00:23:25.753 --> 00:23:28.170 align:middle line:84%
as I recall when I read--
that's what I read in your book,

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:29.060 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:29.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:34.210 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: So we decided, instead
of going to the site that day,

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:41.920 align:middle line:84%
we were going to visit the
place where the explosion had

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.510 align:middle line:90%
been detonated.

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:48.431 align:middle line:84%
And there are
several things that--

00:23:48.431 --> 00:23:51.070 align:middle line:90%


00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:53.350 align:middle line:84%
if you pay attention,
there are several things

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:59.350 align:middle line:84%
that begin to take over
your consciousness.

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:04.330 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is a loaded word,
but you can't-- you're driving

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:08.650 align:middle line:84%
10 or 12 miles after you've
passed the turn point,

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:11.680 align:middle line:90%
all the way to the gate itself.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And you realize after
a while that the desert

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:15.700 align:middle line:90%
isn't the way it should be.

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:16.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:17.702 align:middle line:90%
It's like a wasteland.

00:24:17.702 --> 00:24:20.150 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: The plants
are very, very small.

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:21.970 align:middle line:90%
They are, in fact, dying.

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:26.380 align:middle line:84%
This is how many years
since the explosion?

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:29.740 align:middle line:84%
You can tell that the
Earth has been damaged

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:32.050 align:middle line:84%
by what happened
there, and that it

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:33.350 align:middle line:90%
has retained the memory of it.

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:34.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:36.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: And of
course, the people.

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:39.160 align:middle line:84%
They-- because it
had to be so secret.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's easy to
blame the scientists.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.370 align:middle line:90%
It's easy to blame the army.

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:49.160 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know what
was going to happen.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.190 align:middle line:84%
This was a revolution
in science.

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:52.910 align:middle line:84%
Many people didn't
think it would work.

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:53.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:54.627 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: It did work.

00:24:54.627 --> 00:24:55.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:01.850 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: They arguably--
the thing was, we need

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:03.920 align:middle line:90%
to stop the war in the Pacific.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.020 align:middle line:84%
We need to stop
the war in Japan.

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:12.590 align:middle line:84%
The war in Europe had come to
an end with Germany and so on.

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:17.090 align:middle line:84%
The war in Japan was
at a very high point,

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:20.930 align:middle line:84%
where the estimates were that
over a million people would

00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:22.610 align:middle line:90%
die in a few months.

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:24.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, a million more.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And just to add
this in, Jacques.

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:27.560 align:middle line:84%
As a little boy,
you were exposed

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:28.820 align:middle line:90%
to World War II and death.

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:30.510 align:middle line:84%
You didn't have to
see it close up,

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:32.690 align:middle line:84%
but you saw the bombs
dropping, the people fleeing,

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:37.860 align:middle line:84%
everyone hiding, and living in
a very challenging condition

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:38.660 align:middle line:90%
during that war.

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:39.973 align:middle line:90%
So you knew the impact of war.

00:25:39.973 --> 00:25:42.140 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: Well, but the
little town where I was born

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:47.510 align:middle line:84%
happened to be a lock on
the main road between Paris

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:48.530 align:middle line:90%
and Normandy.

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:50.360 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine
that everybody

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.350 align:middle line:84%
wanted to use that
road and the railroads.

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:53.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:56.720 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: The Germans first,
to reinforce Normandy.

00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And then the Allies, America
and Great Britain, essentially,

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:04.310 align:middle line:90%
needed to destroy those bridges.

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:05.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:08.780 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: And the town
was bombed 18 times

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:09.650 align:middle line:90%
when I was there.

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:10.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:12.027 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: And by the
time you're four or five,

00:26:12.027 --> 00:26:13.460 align:middle line:90%
you understand what's going on.

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:14.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: And--

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:17.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the horrors of war
were imprinted upon you very

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:19.340 align:middle line:90%
deeply from a very early age.

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:19.940 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: I was in the middle--

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:22.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you could
resonate in all of that.

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: --of the war.

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:24.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:24.950 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:28.140 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: But there was no
atomic bomb in Europe, ever.

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:28.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:29.930 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: OK?

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:33.320 align:middle line:84%
There were two atomic
bombs in Japan.

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:35.960 align:middle line:84%
But the bomb that
exploded at Ground Zero

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:39.230 align:middle line:84%
in New Mexico did
more damage, was

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:43.230 align:middle line:84%
more powerful than the bomb
that destroyed Nagasaki.

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:44.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:48.350 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: The reason is
that they blew up the bomb,

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:50.000 align:middle line:90%
and they call it a test.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.650 align:middle line:84%
In physics, a test is
you take a little vial

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:57.560 align:middle line:84%
and you do-- you
mix and you verify

00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.810 align:middle line:90%
the equation and the thing.

00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And then if it works,
you go up in scale.

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:05.750 align:middle line:90%
You go to an industrial process.

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:08.660 align:middle line:84%
Here, they started
from a full-scale bomb.

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:10.130 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a test.

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:11.840 align:middle line:84%
It was a test in
the sense that it

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:13.250 align:middle line:90%
was the first time they did it.

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:14.208 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:27:14.208 --> 00:27:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: But it was
equivalent in power

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:21.380 align:middle line:84%
to the Nagasaki plutonium
bomb, and they exploded it

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:22.430 align:middle line:90%
at Ground Zero.

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:23.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:27.170 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: And in Nagasaki--

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:31.280 align:middle line:84%
once I realized the damage that
they had done to New Mexico,

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:32.330 align:middle line:90%
in Nagasaki.

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:34.680 align:middle line:84%
They reset the bomb so
that it would explode--

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Higher.

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:35.825 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: --higher.

00:27:35.825 --> 00:27:36.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:38.450 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: So that there
wouldn't be so much

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:39.972 align:middle line:90%
radioactivity at ground level.

00:27:39.972 --> 00:27:40.805 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How awful.

00:27:40.805 --> 00:27:40.850 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:43.520 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: Those are the
things that I learned in doing

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:43.865 align:middle line:90%
the research--

00:27:43.865 --> 00:27:44.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:45.050 align:middle line:90%
It's like--

00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:45.770 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: --with Paola.

00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:46.692 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:27:46.692 --> 00:27:48.650 align:middle line:84%
I guess you could say
that was a silver lining.

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:50.060 align:middle line:90%
It could have even been worse.

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:54.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: But in a way, I wanted
to add that this book, yes it

00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:56.030 align:middle line:90%
has a UFO in it.

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:57.742 align:middle line:90%
But it is a historical book.

00:27:57.742 --> 00:27:58.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, it's an--

00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:00.780 align:middle line:84%
I highly recommend
people read this for a--

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:03.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It really needs
to be in libraries--

00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:04.388 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does, yes.

00:28:04.388 --> 00:28:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: --that have
social studies and history.

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:10.910 align:middle line:84%
Because the incredible
research that Jacques did,

00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:14.300 align:middle line:84%
it starts out with the
diary of Laura Fermi.

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:17.510 align:middle line:84%
Her husband, Enrico
Fermi, was there and was--

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:18.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And-- but the fact
that we had a historical event,

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:28.070 align:middle line:84%
and a UFO come in
a month later--

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:29.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not coincidentally.

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:31.040 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: It's not coincidence.

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:31.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:32.020 align:middle line:90%
And excuse me.

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:34.410 align:middle line:90%
I think I said a week earlier.

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:35.450 align:middle line:90%
A month later, yes.

00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:35.936 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, a month later.

00:28:35.936 --> 00:28:36.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So let's talk--

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:37.150 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:39.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's get to the
story and the boys.

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:40.430 align:middle line:90%
So the family.

00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:42.530 align:middle line:84%
A, they were affected
by the blast.

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:44.960 align:middle line:84%
The mother went
blind in one eye.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.640 align:middle line:10%
One of them went
blind temporarily,

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.140 align:middle line:10%
had bleeding out of the ears.

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:51.077 align:middle line:84%
They did have future
defects in their children.

00:28:51.077 --> 00:28:52.910 align:middle line:84%
So they were never
warned by the government.

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:55.130 align:middle line:84%
They were affected by the
radiation of that blast,

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:57.260 align:middle line:84%
and by the sheer
light of the blast.

00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:59.010 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's a month later.

00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:01.010 align:middle line:84%
The kids are out
riding the fences,

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:02.780 align:middle line:90%
because they're cattle ranchers.

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:04.640 align:middle line:84%
And they have
binoculars with them,

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:07.130 align:middle line:84%
because you've got to be
able to read the brands

00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:09.170 align:middle line:90%
on the cattle along the fences.

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:12.560 align:middle line:84%
So they might only be seven
and nine years old, but great

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:14.840 align:middle line:84%
powers of observation,
because that's their job

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:16.465 align:middle line:84%
and they'll get in
trouble by their dad

00:29:16.465 --> 00:29:17.555 align:middle line:90%
if they don't do it right.

00:29:17.555 --> 00:29:17.900 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:18.965 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: And they
knew the territory.

00:29:18.965 --> 00:29:20.548 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
knew the territory.

00:29:20.548 --> 00:29:22.880 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: And they
were on horseback,

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.740 align:middle line:84%
so they could quickly
go to any place.

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:28.550 align:middle line:84%
They also drove the truck,
because all the adults

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:29.420 align:middle line:90%
were at war.

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:30.108 align:middle line:90%
The kids had to take over.

00:29:30.108 --> 00:29:30.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You might
have been short,

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:33.080 align:middle line:84%
but if you could see out the
window, that's all you need.

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:34.008 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: Yes, that's right.

00:29:34.008 --> 00:29:34.936 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:34.936 --> 00:29:35.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Little Jose.

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:37.220 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: So that
case is incredible,

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:42.860 align:middle line:84%
because as opposed to Roswell,
as opposed to many other cases,

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:47.400 align:middle line:84%
the kids were there
before the UFO came in.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:51.530 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: They saw it come
over their head and crash.

00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:57.980 align:middle line:84%
It bumped into a communication
tower, bent part of the tower.

00:29:57.980 --> 00:29:59.340 align:middle line:90%
It didn't explode.

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:02.940 align:middle line:84%
An airplane would have blown
into pieces at that point.

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:05.280 align:middle line:90%
The craft kept its integrity.

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:08.490 align:middle line:84%
There was one panel
that was ejected,

00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:11.400 align:middle line:84%
and they found the
material later.

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:14.407 align:middle line:84%
And they kept it, which to a
physicist, is very interesting.

00:30:14.407 --> 00:30:15.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going
to get into this

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:17.910 align:middle line:84%
and all-- we're going to get
into all kinds of fun stuff.

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:18.266 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: But they saw it--

00:30:18.266 --> 00:30:19.141 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Angel hair.

00:30:19.141 --> 00:30:20.205 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:20.205 --> 00:30:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: And then
they had access

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:25.120 align:middle line:84%
to-- they saw what the army did
when they came in eventually.

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:25.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: For nine days,
the kids were there.

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:28.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They were sneaky
and they were short,

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:30.840 align:middle line:84%
and they could go in
and they knew the brush.

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.040 align:middle line:90%
They knew where they could hide.

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.180 align:middle line:90%
They could watch everything.

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And when they went home
at the end of the day,

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:36.820 align:middle line:84%
they would sneak down
there and get stuff.

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:39.180 align:middle line:90%
So this is an amazing story.

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:41.580 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's talk
about what they had

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:45.575 align:middle line:84%
to say about the experience
of-- after it crashed,

00:30:45.575 --> 00:30:47.200 align:middle line:84%
there were a couple
of things going on.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.710 align:middle line:84%
They saw little
funny-looking occupants.

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And I don't remember the Spanish
name for the cricket head

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:52.660 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:53.310 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:54.518 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [SPEAKING SPANISH].

00:30:54.518 --> 00:30:56.160 align:middle line:90%
They were explaining insects.

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:56.430 align:middle line:90%
They had--

00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:56.820 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: Little men.

00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:59.195 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Little men with kind
of insect-y looking heads.

00:30:59.195 --> 00:31:02.610 align:middle line:10%
>>VALLEE: Well, I had
the privilege of working,

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:05.430 align:middle line:10%
when I started
reconstructing the story

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:09.750 align:middle line:10%
and doing working on the book,
of working from the transcripts

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:13.480 align:middle line:10%
that Paola had already
done with both witnesses,

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:17.160 align:middle line:10%
including the one
who had passed away.

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:23.100 align:middle line:84%
What fascinated me was looking
at every word and every comma.

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:25.530 align:middle line:90%
You could see their emotions.

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:29.190 align:middle line:84%
You could see when
things changed.

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:31.980 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they call them men.

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:34.012 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they call
them little men.

00:31:34.012 --> 00:31:35.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Little men, uh-huh.

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:38.910 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: Sometimes
they talk about them

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:42.150 align:middle line:84%
as if they were
insects, or they were--

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:43.410 align:middle line:90%
so Paola can describe it.

00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:44.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They did have very--

00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:44.910 align:middle line:90%
yes.

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:47.285 align:middle line:84%
Paola, tell us how they saw
their faces, because it was--

00:31:47.285 --> 00:31:48.327 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Well, I think--

00:31:48.327 --> 00:31:50.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: From the
binoculars, by the way,

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:51.515 align:middle line:84%
from a couple
hundred yards away.

00:31:51.515 --> 00:31:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Let's add by saying
that there were no flying

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:55.740 align:middle line:90%
saucer magazines.

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:58.440 align:middle line:84%
Kenneth Arnold hadn't come
out with that word yet.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.030 align:middle line:90%
There was no television.

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:00.973 align:middle line:90%
There was no YouTube.

00:32:00.973 --> 00:32:01.890 align:middle line:90%
So these kids had no--

00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:02.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There was no context.

00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:04.320 align:middle line:90%
There was no context to what

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:07.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: They were looking at,
and it was not a flying saucer.

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:09.150 align:middle line:90%
It was an avocado-shaped craft.

00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:09.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:14.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And so when the
little kids went up to see it,

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:17.200 align:middle line:84%
and they could see the beings
that were floating back

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.000 align:middle line:90%
and forth--

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.958 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, this is
key what you just said.

00:32:19.958 --> 00:32:21.030 align:middle line:90%
They weren't walking.

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:22.700 align:middle line:84%
They appeared to be kind of
just moving and floating.

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:24.533 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: They were
floating back and forth.

00:32:24.533 --> 00:32:26.040 align:middle line:90%
And they heard the sounds.

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Jose in particular,
the older boy,

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:30.480 align:middle line:84%
thought that they
were in trouble,

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:31.890 align:middle line:90%
that they had been hurt.

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:34.920 align:middle line:84%
So his feelings, they
had-- and Jacques

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:37.080 align:middle line:84%
had mentioned the
psychic connection

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:39.660 align:middle line:84%
between-- because they
watched them for over an hour

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:40.920 align:middle line:90%
with the binoculars.

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:43.290 align:middle line:84%
So the psych-- the
connection they had.

00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And Jose's wanting to
go in and help them,

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:47.220 align:middle line:90%
because they were hurt.

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And they were making
this high-pitched sound,

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.300 align:middle line:90%
which is so unusual.

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:55.290 align:middle line:84%
And then Reme being the younger
one, and was started to cry.

00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:57.720 align:middle line:84%
But you can understand,
because it was a lot of smoke,

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:01.620 align:middle line:84%
and the mesquite was all
burning, and he was scared.

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:04.177 align:middle line:90%
And this contact--

00:33:04.177 --> 00:33:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This
emotion, though, thing.

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:09.450 align:middle line:84%
When I started reading about
the emotion part of it,

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:13.020 align:middle line:84%
my mind flashback to Clifford
Stone, when Clifford Stone was

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:17.370 align:middle line:84%
initially going on
his investigations

00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:18.637 align:middle line:90%
on behalf of the military--

00:33:18.637 --> 00:33:19.845 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: The recovery, yeah.

00:33:19.845 --> 00:33:20.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The recovery.

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:23.160 align:middle line:90%
He said he would become over--

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:25.860 align:middle line:84%
throughout his life, overwhelmed
with emotions of what

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:27.700 align:middle line:90%
these creatures that he saw--

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: They were
able to transmit--

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:29.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --were
trying to say to him.

00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:29.700 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: They're transmitting--

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:30.825 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're in trouble.

00:33:30.825 --> 00:33:31.675 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:33:31.675 --> 00:33:32.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're in trouble.

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:35.175 align:middle line:84%
And this is the same thing
the boys were going away with,

00:33:35.175 --> 00:33:38.650 align:middle line:84%
is this feeling of empathy and
sympathy and great emotion,

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:40.442 align:middle line:84%
which we don't hear in
these stories often.

00:33:40.442 --> 00:33:42.234 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, which
is not done verbally.

00:33:42.234 --> 00:33:43.600 align:middle line:90%
It's done from the contact--

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:44.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:45.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: --from these--

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:46.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: More telepathically.

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:46.890 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:51.480 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, and you know when
you're talking to little kids,

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:54.000 align:middle line:10%
because there's so many
different stories where

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.150 align:middle line:10%
little children, like the
African case and so forth,

00:33:57.150 --> 00:34:00.600 align:middle line:10%
have had contact with beings,
that the little kids aren't

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:01.690 align:middle line:10%
making this up.

00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:02.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:05.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: They're reliving it.

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:06.840 align:middle line:90%
They're very honest.

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And in the case of
Jose, maybe Jacques

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:11.500 align:middle line:90%
would like to talk about this.

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:12.708 align:middle line:90%
He has a photographic memory.

00:34:12.708 --> 00:34:13.508 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:13.508 --> 00:34:16.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: He'll tell you the
day that this happened, right?

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:17.450 align:middle line:90%
He was an amazing witness.

00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:18.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:20.400 align:middle line:10%
>>VALLEE: Well,
we would come up,

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:26.699 align:middle line:10%
and you can see that
in your transcripts,

00:34:26.699 --> 00:34:29.940 align:middle line:10%
when was the tower taken out?

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:37.380 align:middle line:10%
And he will go '45,
'48, '54, and '86.

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:38.940 align:middle line:90%
It was taken out in '86.

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:40.470 align:middle line:90%
His mind goes like a computer.

00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:41.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:42.239 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: Clack, clack,
clack, clack, clack.

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:44.447 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was a perfect
job to be riding the rails

00:34:44.447 --> 00:34:48.134 align:middle line:84%
and looking at brands and
counting, counting cattle head.

00:34:48.134 --> 00:34:50.070 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: Well, some of it--

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:51.690 align:middle line:84%
it's almost
unbelievable from where

00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:53.109 align:middle line:90%
we stand of what they did.

00:34:53.109 --> 00:34:53.909 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:57.570 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: And then you have
to remember, we asked--

00:34:57.570 --> 00:34:59.400 align:middle line:84%
they were talking about
getting a souvenir.

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:00.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:00.580 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: OK.

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:01.380 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:03.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's appropriate.

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:04.690 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: Getting a souvenir.

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:07.090 align:middle line:90%
And then they--

00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:09.010 align:middle line:84%
I think it was
Reme who explained

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:13.960 align:middle line:84%
to Paola that in those days,
your father might not come back

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:14.870 align:middle line:90%
from the front.

00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:15.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:17.087 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: You might
lose an uncle.

00:35:17.087 --> 00:35:18.430 align:middle line:90%
You might lose a relative.

00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:21.700 align:middle line:84%
You might-- so
souvenirs for families

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:26.170 align:middle line:84%
were very important you would
save things that reminded you

00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:27.320 align:middle line:90%
of that person.

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:30.310 align:middle line:90%
So this was the end of the war.

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:31.880 align:middle line:90%
Many people did not come back.

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:32.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:37.450 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: And so
to them, you have

00:35:37.450 --> 00:35:39.310 align:middle line:84%
to go back to that
context, which

00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:43.280 align:middle line:84%
is relatively easy for me,
because I remember World War

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:44.080 align:middle line:90%
II.

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:44.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:44.350 --> 00:35:45.190 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: OK?

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:47.542 align:middle line:84%
Which was, of
course, an intense--

00:35:47.542 --> 00:35:50.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You would have been
going for souvenirs yourself.

00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:52.780 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: We didn't
have any souvenirs,

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:57.410 align:middle line:84%
because the first house where
my parents had all their books

00:35:57.410 --> 00:35:59.010 align:middle line:84%
and so on burned
down completely.

00:35:59.010 --> 00:35:59.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: So they
restarted, essentially,

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:05.210 align:middle line:84%
with furniture that was
borrowed from relatives.

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:06.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:07.360 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: That's how I grew up.

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.836 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so that's how
these boys were living, yeah.

00:36:08.836 --> 00:36:10.169 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: So I could understand.

00:36:10.169 --> 00:36:13.760 align:middle line:84%
I could relate to what
these people were saying.

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:14.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So--

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:18.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So that's
why people say, well,

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.770 align:middle line:84%
how did that little
boy go in and--

00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:23.440 align:middle line:84%
which is Jose--
go in and borrow--

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:25.160 align:middle line:84%
he keeps saying, I
didn't steal anything.

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:25.960 align:middle line:90%
I didn't.

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:26.290 align:middle line:90%
That was--

00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:27.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
he had something.

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:27.670 align:middle line:90%
What did he call it?

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:28.330 align:middle line:90%
A crowbar, basically.

00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:30.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: He had a crowbar,
because he couldn't pull it

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:30.840 align:middle line:90%
off--

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.503 align:middle line:84%
the bracket inside
was on a plaque.

00:36:32.503 --> 00:36:34.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Inside is this
smooth, curved walls.

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:35.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:38.890 align:middle line:84%
It was on a plaque that
had a copper circle.

00:36:38.890 --> 00:36:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And this piece
was in the middle.

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:44.200 align:middle line:90%
And we still don't know--

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:47.230 align:middle line:84%
this is Jacques's job as a
scientist to go into the piece.

00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:51.550 align:middle line:84%
But to pull it off, he had to
get a crowbar to pull it off.

00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And then the pin fell on
the ground and he took it.

00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And they went and they had
to hide it, because there

00:36:56.890 --> 00:36:58.270 align:middle line:90%
was inventory taken.

00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And when that piece from the
inside of the craft is missing,

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:04.898 align:middle line:90%
the army is not happy.

00:37:04.898 --> 00:37:06.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because we have
to re-establish, again,

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:10.805 align:middle line:84%
that the army did not come and
take that away for what was it,

00:37:10.805 --> 00:37:11.605 align:middle line:90%
nine days?

00:37:11.605 --> 00:37:11.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:14.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the boys knew
where it was and had access.

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:15.265 align:middle line:90%
His father knew where it was.

00:37:15.265 --> 00:37:16.065 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Mm-hmm.

00:37:16.065 --> 00:37:18.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Another one
of the town constables

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:19.060 align:middle line:90%
knew where it was.

00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:20.620 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: So three people--

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:23.980 align:middle line:84%
that's another thing that's
unique about-- out of the 10

00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:27.730 align:middle line:84%
things that we've listed that
are unique about this case,

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:33.130 align:middle line:84%
in all of UFO history,
there are three people who

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:35.320 align:middle line:90%
actually went into the craft.

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:37.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: On the second day,
or actually, the third day,

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:41.935 align:middle line:90%
the father--

00:37:41.935 --> 00:37:43.810 align:middle line:84%
the kids reported to
their family right away.

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
it was his father.

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:48.010 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: They still
thought that it was probably

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:49.600 align:middle line:90%
some aircraft.

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:52.192 align:middle line:84%
There were lots of aircraft
that were damaged, so--

00:37:52.192 --> 00:37:54.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Experimental stuff
going on out there, too.

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.350 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: Experimental
things, also.

00:37:56.350 --> 00:38:02.050 align:middle line:84%
So they-- the father and a
policemen, a state policemen--

00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:05.785 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, Sheriff
Apodaca went inside together.

00:38:05.785 --> 00:38:06.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:08.800 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: And then
on the last day,

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:13.360 align:middle line:84%
when the soldiers were relaxed,
because the thing was loaded

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:19.120 align:middle line:84%
on the truck, ready to
go back to White Sands,

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:23.080 align:middle line:90%
they decided to go in.

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And Jose Padilla went in
and looked for a souvenir.

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:29.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:30.820 align:middle line:90%
I love that he had the--

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:31.430 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: So it's
an incredible story.

00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:32.516 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I just,
I love this story.

00:38:32.516 --> 00:38:33.460 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: There is no
other case like it.

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:34.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, there isn't.

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:34.652 align:middle line:90%
This is an incredible--

00:38:34.652 --> 00:38:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: This is
not an abduction, OK?

00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:36.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:37.592 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: They walked
into the craft.

00:38:37.592 --> 00:38:38.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, absolutely.

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:40.250 align:middle line:90%
OK, so they went in.

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:41.590 align:middle line:90%
So now we have this.

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:44.263 align:middle line:84%
And it's something where
the local people knew,

00:38:44.263 --> 00:38:46.180 align:middle line:84%
you don't tangle too
much with the government.

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:48.010 align:middle line:84%
Don't give them too
much information.

00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:49.180 align:middle line:90%
They're living their lives.

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:50.347 align:middle line:90%
You're trying to live yours.

00:38:50.347 --> 00:38:54.190 align:middle line:84%
So there's another piece of this
that I found just absolutely

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:58.480 align:middle line:84%
fascinating, and kind of
a fun way of phenomena.

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:00.670 align:middle line:10%
And that was, was it
a cousin of theirs?

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:03.220 align:middle line:84%
So the name of the souvenir--
souvenir in Spanish

00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:04.220 align:middle line:90%
is "tesoro," right?

00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:04.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, "tesoro."

00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:05.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So they had the--

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:06.610 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: "Tesoro"
means treasure.

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:06.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Treasure.

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:07.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:09.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They had their
treasure, their "tesoro"

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:10.843 align:middle line:90%
that they had hidden away.

00:39:10.843 --> 00:39:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And they're wily enough
to know, military

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:15.130 align:middle line:84%
were coming around
asking questions.

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:17.060 align:middle line:84%
They put it under the
floorboard of a shed.

00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:19.150 align:middle line:90%
Now, refresh my memory.

00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:21.850 align:middle line:84%
There is a cousin, I think
it was, who was a shepherd.

00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:24.190 align:middle line:90%
And I think he was in that shed.

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:26.530 align:middle line:84%
Was he sleeping in that
shed when three little--

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:26.920 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Oh.

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:27.310 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:27.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Three little--

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:28.968 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: It wasn't a cousin.

00:39:28.968 --> 00:39:31.757 align:middle line:84%
It was a man they hired to
take care of the cattle--

00:39:31.757 --> 00:39:32.590 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: The sheep.

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:33.673 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The sheep, yeah.

00:39:33.673 --> 00:39:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: --when it
was going to be sold.

00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:36.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:37.690 align:middle line:90%
So this man's in there.

00:39:37.690 --> 00:39:38.490 align:middle line:90%
And in your book--

00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:40.060 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: He's an employee.

00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:42.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He was-- it
scared the bejesus out him--

00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:42.931 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: OK, that's--

00:39:42.931 --> 00:39:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that
three little beings

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:46.090 align:middle line:84%
seemed to show up in his
room asking for the "tesoro."

00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:47.632 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: They came
through the wall.

00:39:47.632 --> 00:39:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And actually, he went to-- he
was hired by the Baca family.

00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And he came over and he said,
I think I have to leave here,

00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:58.480 align:middle line:84%
because three little men
came in through the--

00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:59.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Came through my walls.

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:00.568 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Looking
for the "tesoro."

00:40:00.568 --> 00:40:02.410 align:middle line:84%
Which presents a
problem for Jacques

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:05.137 align:middle line:84%
and me, because we both,
I think, thought it was--

00:40:05.137 --> 00:40:06.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He didn't
know about the "tesoro."

00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:08.345 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah,
but we thought it

00:40:08.345 --> 00:40:10.540 align:middle line:90%
was terrestrial, the bracket.

00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:12.590 align:middle line:90%
We tend to believe that.

00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:14.701 align:middle line:84%
So if that's the case,
and this is really true--

00:40:14.701 --> 00:40:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're just putting
it all out there, Paola.

00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:18.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: If this is true,
this is terrestrial piece,

00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:23.710 align:middle line:84%
then why is the testimony of
the sheepherder saying that

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:25.675 align:middle line:84%
the beings are coming
in looking for that--

00:40:25.675 --> 00:40:26.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For the "tesoro."

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:27.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Why wouldn't there--

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:29.077 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Using their
language telepathically.

00:40:29.077 --> 00:40:30.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes, yeah.

00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:30.550 align:middle line:90%
Why--

00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:31.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We'll let that
may remain a mystery,

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:32.170 align:middle line:90%
because it's--

00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:32.925 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Because
that is a mystery.

00:40:32.925 --> 00:40:33.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:36.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: If it
belongs to the army,

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:40.010 align:middle line:84%
and we tended to believe
that was the case,

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:43.942 align:middle line:84%
then why did this
testimony say this?

00:40:43.942 --> 00:40:44.900 align:middle line:90%
And he's not making it.

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:45.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:46.870 align:middle line:90%
I have an idea for you both.

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:50.740 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was the ET's "tesoro"
that they'd picked up on a trip

00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:52.276 align:middle line:84%
and hammered into
their own walls.

00:40:52.276 --> 00:40:53.076 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:53.076 --> 00:40:54.368 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you stole their "tesoro."

00:40:54.368 --> 00:40:55.960 align:middle line:90%
It was ours to put on the walls.

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:57.460 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: Sometimes
I think it would

00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:00.280 align:middle line:84%
be an interesting day in
court if the government wanted

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:01.180 align:middle line:90%
to claim it.

00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:03.370 align:middle line:90%
Because I have it now, OK?

00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And we're studying it,
with my colleagues.

00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:08.685 align:middle line:90%
It's not in my house, but--

00:41:08.685 --> 00:41:11.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So don't go looking
for your address, anybody.

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: We're going to pass
it out to different teams.

00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:14.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:14.350 --> 00:41:16.870 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: Metallurgists,
space people, and so on.

00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:21.760 align:middle line:84%
It looks like a perfectly
ordinary piece of a bracket

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:30.310 align:middle line:84%
you might have in a rotating
machine on a farm or--

00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:34.148 align:middle line:84%
except that it's all
in metric system.

00:41:34.148 --> 00:41:35.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which we didn't have.

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.148 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: Who was
using the metric system

00:41:37.148 --> 00:41:38.570 align:middle line:90%
in New Mexico in 1945?

00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:39.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No one.

00:41:39.370 --> 00:41:40.720 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: OK.

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:42.190 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have a brand.

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:44.350 align:middle line:84%
It's something-- it's
pretty crude, something

00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:47.140 align:middle line:84%
that you might
mold it in college

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:50.110 align:middle line:84%
in the lab for
particular experiments.

00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:53.260 align:middle line:84%
So you wouldn't bother
to put a brand on it.

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:58.180 align:middle line:84%
So it looks like an
industrial part, but it isn't.

00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:00.460 align:middle line:90%
What was it doing inside a UFO?

00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:02.860 align:middle line:90%
So my theory, and I'm--

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:06.730 align:middle line:84%
we get into heated
arguments in Silicon Valley.

00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:09.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it hasn't been
settled as science quite yet,

00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:10.540 align:middle line:90%
maybe?

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:12.160 align:middle line:90%
It's still being examined?

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:14.860 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: Well,
my feeling is, it

00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:17.710 align:middle line:84%
looks like an ordinary
bracket that you

00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:20.240 align:middle line:90%
could get from farm equipment.

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:22.700 align:middle line:90%
So maybe the army improvised.

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:25.935 align:middle line:84%
You remember, they are a
long way from electricity,

00:42:25.935 --> 00:42:26.990 align:middle line:90%
a long way from power.

00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:27.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:31.090 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: They may generate
the power on the Jeeps

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:34.510 align:middle line:84%
or on the trucks, and then
use it to do whatever they

00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:37.510 align:middle line:90%
need to do inside this object.

00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:38.770 align:middle line:90%
So they need power.

00:42:38.770 --> 00:42:42.820 align:middle line:84%
They bring a cable, and you need
something to wrap up the cable.

00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:45.460 align:middle line:84%
This would be perfect to wrap up
a cable or do something that--

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:46.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what
about the fact it

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:49.870 align:middle line:84%
was on this copper plate
inside, fixed to the wall,

00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:51.910 align:middle line:84%
and everything fit
perfectly, and metrics?

00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:53.530 align:middle line:90%
How do--

00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:55.645 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: Well, but that's
the only thing inside.

00:42:55.645 --> 00:42:56.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:56.050 --> 00:42:58.592 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: It's something that
the army could have improvised,

00:42:58.592 --> 00:42:59.990 align:middle line:90%
could have done there.

00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:01.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Done something with.

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:03.220 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: The engineers so that
the army could have done that.

00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:04.887 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
your hypothesis now.

00:43:04.887 --> 00:43:07.360 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: That was my
initial working hypothesis,

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:09.460 align:middle line:90%
because it looks human.

00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:10.480 align:middle line:90%
It looks very crude.

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:12.782 align:middle line:84%
It looks like an industrial
part you could buy.

00:43:12.782 --> 00:43:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right.
it is very simple.

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:17.675 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: You get on eBay,
you can buy things like that.

00:43:17.675 --> 00:43:19.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now,
Paola-- and you guys

00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:21.385 align:middle line:84%
have been in heated
arguments over this, right?

00:43:21.385 --> 00:43:22.260 align:middle line:90%
Because you want to--

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:22.494 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: Well--

00:43:22.494 --> 00:43:23.294 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No, no.

00:43:23.294 --> 00:43:25.310 align:middle line:84%
We tend to agree
that it could be.

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:26.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:28.152 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: But then these
things keep cropping up,

00:43:28.152 --> 00:43:31.390 align:middle line:84%
like the metric system,
and the beings coming

00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:34.120 align:middle line:84%
through the wall looking for
it, and other things that

00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:36.010 align:middle line:84%
are cropping up in
the-- and so we have

00:43:36.010 --> 00:43:37.660 align:middle line:90%
to keep changing our minds.

00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you
just have to stay open.

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:39.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: And the army
coming back, looking for it.

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:40.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The army came back.

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:41.060 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: Twice.

00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:41.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:41.740 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:44.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're going to--
because we have so much more

00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:46.700 align:middle line:84%
to talk about, we could just
talk about this piece all day,

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:47.500 align:middle line:90%
this bracket.

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:49.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's talk about
the other things

00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:51.520 align:middle line:84%
that were found, because
the boys were very, very

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:54.310 align:middle line:84%
resourceful and filled up
a gunny sack full of what

00:43:54.310 --> 00:43:55.660 align:middle line:90%
they call "angel hair."

00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:58.720 align:middle line:84%
Which becomes very interesting
when the third witness later,

00:43:58.720 --> 00:43:59.530 align:middle line:90%
in years later--

00:43:59.530 --> 00:44:00.613 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Sabrina Padilla.

00:44:00.613 --> 00:44:02.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sabrina Padilla
is playing with it.

00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:06.365 align:middle line:84%
So they get this translucent
stuff that's very--

00:44:06.365 --> 00:44:07.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: That's all
lit up, in colors.

00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:09.073 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's all lit up.

00:44:09.073 --> 00:44:09.950 align:middle line:90%
It shines at night.

00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:10.750 align:middle line:90%
It's very pretty.

00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:13.237 align:middle line:84%
And the boys give it to people
to put on Christmas trees

00:44:13.237 --> 00:44:14.320 align:middle line:90%
and in their windows and--

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:15.130 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: Of course.

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:15.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's pretty.

00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:15.250 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:15.250 --> 00:44:16.625 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: That's
what you do when

00:44:16.625 --> 00:44:19.240 align:middle line:90%
a UFO crashes in your backyard.

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:20.290 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:20.545 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Get the pretty stuff.

00:44:20.545 --> 00:44:22.018 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: You take
the angel hair

00:44:22.018 --> 00:44:23.560 align:middle line:84%
and you put it on
the Christmas tree.

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:24.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course you do.

00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:26.140 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: But that's what
anybody would do, right?

00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:26.940 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:28.060 align:middle line:90%


00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:29.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I can see
a movie of this book.

00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:30.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This
has to be a movie.

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:32.283 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And I can
see that it starts

00:44:32.283 --> 00:44:34.480 align:middle line:84%
with these kids
decorating a Christmas

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:35.620 align:middle line:90%
tree with fiber optics.

00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:36.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:38.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Thinking-- because
they don't know what it is.

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:39.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I've
got the other scene.

00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:42.190 align:middle line:84%
Then you have the cousin
testifying later, saying, yeah,

00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:43.240 align:middle line:90%
we used to play.

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:44.920 align:middle line:90%
And it bit me.

00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:46.915 align:middle line:90%
It hurt my hand and bit me.

00:44:46.915 --> 00:44:48.970 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: We should
stop them on the cousin,

00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:51.650 align:middle line:84%
because we were ready
to publish the book.

00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:52.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: We announced it
on the internet and so on.

00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:58.045 align:middle line:90%
And then Paola found Sabrina.

00:44:58.045 --> 00:44:59.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: And Sabrina
comes in at right angle

00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:05.400 align:middle line:84%
to every other-- she's
there several years later.

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:06.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Later.

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:07.295 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: She's
a seven-year-old.

00:45:07.295 --> 00:45:08.095 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:08.095 --> 00:45:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: She essentially
comes to live with the family,

00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:16.350 align:middle line:84%
because that's the only
family she has at that point.

00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And she is there with her
eyes of a young child,

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:23.480 align:middle line:90%
discovering all this.

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And she is the one who
tells that story, including

00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:31.083 align:middle line:84%
some things that even
the first two witnesses--

00:45:31.083 --> 00:45:32.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Didn't know.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.200 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: --by
then, had moved on.

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
they never mentioned

00:45:34.010 --> 00:45:35.760 align:middle line:84%
that it was giving
like electrical shocks.

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:36.887 align:middle line:90%
It was my biting them.

00:45:36.887 --> 00:45:38.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And they never
mentioned the foil.

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:39.560 align:middle line:90%
I think that because--

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:41.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're going to get
to the foil after angel hair.

00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:42.312 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, because--

00:45:42.312 --> 00:45:45.525 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: So we stopped and
we restarted the research.

00:45:45.525 --> 00:45:46.325 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:46.325 --> 00:45:47.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Mm-hmm.

00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:49.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: Paola started--
restarted the research

00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:54.950 align:middle line:84%
with Sabrina, and that added
the cherry on the cake,

00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:57.290 align:middle line:84%
essentially, at
the end of nailing

00:45:57.290 --> 00:45:59.510 align:middle line:84%
all of the previous
testimony together.

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:00.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:00.740 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: And then--

00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:01.948 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it was fascin--

00:46:01.948 --> 00:46:03.920 align:middle line:90%
her testimony was so innocent.

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:05.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, she
was tell-- and Jacques,

00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:08.060 align:middle line:84%
the first thing he said is,
we've got to go and meet her.

00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:08.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:09.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So he
flew to Los Angeles.

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:11.030 align:middle line:90%
She lives in Los Angeles.

00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And we sat in front of her, and
Jacques said, this is amazing.

00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:16.860 align:middle line:90%
It's because these are children.

00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:17.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:20.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And these are
their direct recollections.

00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:23.325 align:middle line:84%
We have artifacts, then
we can talk about foil.

00:46:23.325 --> 00:46:24.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's
talk about the foil

00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:26.325 align:middle line:84%
now, because this
is fascinating.

00:46:26.325 --> 00:46:27.125 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:46:27.125 --> 00:46:28.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So she said, oh, yeah.

00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:31.340 align:middle line:84%
They had this little piece
of foil that the boys got.

00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:33.080 align:middle line:90%
And they mentioned it, too.

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:35.880 align:middle line:84%
It was-- one piece of foil
was used to fix, I think,

00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:36.680 align:middle line:90%
a windmill--

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:37.490 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: A windmill.

00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:38.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --at one point.

00:46:38.330 --> 00:46:39.500 align:middle line:90%
But you use what you've got.

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:41.810 align:middle line:84%
But she was saying,
she used to play

00:46:41.810 --> 00:46:45.450 align:middle line:84%
with this foil, which was very
thin and very, very light,

00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:46.250 align:middle line:90%
like a feather.

00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:47.050 align:middle line:90%
No weight.

00:46:47.050 --> 00:46:49.040 align:middle line:84%
And she would scrunch
it up in her hand.

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And she thought
it was trick foil.

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:52.370 align:middle line:90%
It was a joke foil.

00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Because when she'd open her
hand, it would pop back out

00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:56.385 align:middle line:90%
and be smooth again.

00:46:56.385 --> 00:46:57.185 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:46:57.185 --> 00:46:57.500 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:46:57.500 --> 00:46:58.580 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: Yes.

00:46:58.580 --> 00:46:59.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about that.

00:46:59.510 --> 00:47:01.220 align:middle line:84%
That would be called
memory metal today.

00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:01.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:02.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Something
like that, right?

00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:04.823 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: And it was
speculated-- of course,

00:47:04.823 --> 00:47:08.790 align:middle line:84%
it showed up at Roswell
later, two years later.

00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And so the argument could
be said that people were

00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:17.240 align:middle line:90%
researching that kind of thing.

00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:19.760 align:middle line:84%
Battelle Memorial
Institute in Ohio

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:22.850 align:middle line:84%
was a leader in
metallurgy, and they

00:47:22.850 --> 00:47:25.040 align:middle line:84%
were researching
that kind of metal

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:26.890 align:middle line:90%
for aerospace applications.

00:47:26.890 --> 00:47:27.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: Aviation
and later, for space.

00:47:31.110 --> 00:47:34.790 align:middle line:84%
Battelle comes up again and
again in this whole history.

00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:38.450 align:middle line:84%
They would be certainly one of
the places where there would

00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:44.220 align:middle line:84%
have been greater awareness
of the entire UFO recovery

00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:45.020 align:middle line:90%
history.

00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:45.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Are you saying "Dell"?

00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:46.200 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Battelle.

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:46.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Battelle.

00:47:46.610 --> 00:47:47.020 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: Battelle.

00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:47.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Battelle.

00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:47.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Battelle.

00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:49.160 align:middle line:84%
I just, I thought
I misheard you.

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:49.670 align:middle line:90%
Battelle, yeah.

00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:50.465 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: Battelle
is very interesting

00:47:50.465 --> 00:47:50.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Battelle.

00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:51.420 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they are.

00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: --scientific
institution.

00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:52.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:53.887 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: Still today.

00:47:53.887 --> 00:47:55.940 align:middle line:84%
Very active in
metallurgy applied

00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:59.450 align:middle line:84%
to space and high-powered
flight and everything else.

00:47:59.450 --> 00:48:00.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:03.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: But in 1947,
you could say, well,

00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:08.480 align:middle line:84%
there were prototypes of
strange metals, new alloys.

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:10.550 align:middle line:84%
There was all that
research going on.

00:48:10.550 --> 00:48:14.840 align:middle line:84%
1945, well, maybe
in a lab somewhere.

00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:16.215 align:middle line:84%
But you wouldn't
expect to have--

00:48:16.215 --> 00:48:17.757 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Lying
around in the desert,

00:48:17.757 --> 00:48:19.400 align:middle line:90%
next to an avocado-shaped craft.

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:21.920 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: Yeah, to
shower the landscape

00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:24.947 align:middle line:90%
with this extraordinary metal.

00:48:24.947 --> 00:48:26.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was it thought
that it was molten,

00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:27.950 align:middle line:90%
because there was high heat?

00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:29.658 align:middle line:84%
That it might have
been in a molten state

00:48:29.658 --> 00:48:32.362 align:middle line:84%
initially and settled
into this veneer?

00:48:32.362 --> 00:48:33.320 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No, I think--

00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:34.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or did it come--

00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:34.820 align:middle line:90%
was it that way?

00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:36.195 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: I think
what happened--

00:48:36.195 --> 00:48:39.380 align:middle line:10%
and this is amazing, because
Jose did not know that there

00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:41.210 align:middle line:10%
were long strips of this metal.

00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:45.350 align:middle line:84%
Because all they found was
a little square that they

00:48:45.350 --> 00:48:47.040 align:middle line:90%
fixed the windmill with.

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:47.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:51.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So Jose didn't know
the testimony of Sabrina.

00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:52.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: He was shocked because
that means the father went

00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:55.417 align:middle line:90%
back there on his own.

00:48:55.417 --> 00:48:56.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And he got some.

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:58.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And he went and
got some stuff that he never

00:48:58.940 --> 00:48:59.965 align:middle line:90%
told his son about.

00:48:59.965 --> 00:49:00.765 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:00.765 --> 00:49:02.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So the father,
who was riding the horse,

00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:04.280 align:middle line:90%
found these strips of metal.

00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:06.560 align:middle line:84%
Never told the son,
never told Jose.

00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:09.670 align:middle line:84%
But then Jose had left for the
Korean War at the age of 17.

00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:10.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:14.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So Sabrina is
playing with other materials

00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:15.903 align:middle line:84%
that the father
went back to get.

00:49:15.903 --> 00:49:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if
you noticed, but she

00:49:17.570 --> 00:49:19.760 align:middle line:84%
kept telling us that
the soldiers kept

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:23.450 align:middle line:84%
coming back to their
farmhouse, in the back door.

00:49:23.450 --> 00:49:24.620 align:middle line:90%
And the father said--

00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:25.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, that's
important to point out.

00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:26.264 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: The army
would come back.

00:49:26.264 --> 00:49:27.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This
happened on their land.

00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:28.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:49:28.070 --> 00:49:29.903 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The military
had to get permission

00:49:29.903 --> 00:49:32.490 align:middle line:84%
to build a road and gate on
their land to come and retrieve

00:49:32.490 --> 00:49:33.290 align:middle line:90%
this thing.

00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:33.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:34.340 align:middle line:90%
The weather balloon.

00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:34.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:34.910 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: The weather balloon.

00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:35.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The "weather balloon."

00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: The weather balloon.

00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:37.100 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:38.720 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: The 10-ton
weather balloon.

00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:40.055 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, the
10-ton weather balloon.

00:49:40.055 --> 00:49:40.340 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:42.673 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: The weather balloon
that they couldn't get out

00:49:42.673 --> 00:49:43.760 align:middle line:90%
of the gate there.

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And the irony is, and
Jacques and I laugh over

00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:49.650 align:middle line:84%
a lot of this stuff, the
father was very honest.

00:49:49.650 --> 00:49:51.280 align:middle line:84%
He said, you want
the weather balloons

00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:52.420 align:middle line:90%
that we picked up already?

00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:53.510 align:middle line:90%
Do you want them back?

00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:55.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Do you want the
weather balloons back?

00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:57.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because they had
had the weather balloon

00:49:57.890 --> 00:49:59.150 align:middle line:90%
debris around.

00:49:59.150 --> 00:49:59.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:49:59.390 --> 00:50:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, actual
weather ball-- not this.

00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:02.128 align:middle line:90%
Actual weather balloon.

00:50:02.128 --> 00:50:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: Well, the
property's 80,000 acres.

00:50:04.530 --> 00:50:05.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:50:05.330 --> 00:50:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: So how many
weather balloons--

00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:08.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:12.446 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: The army was launching
weather balloons all day long

00:50:12.446 --> 00:50:13.670 align:middle line:90%
because of White Sands.

00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:14.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:15.680 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: And--

00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:17.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they had
little pieces of that.

00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:18.500 align:middle line:84%
They go, we'll give
them back to you.

00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:20.917 align:middle line:84%
But that's nothing to do with
the avocado in our backyard.

00:50:20.917 --> 00:50:22.090 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:22.090 --> 00:50:22.890 align:middle line:90%


00:50:22.890 --> 00:50:25.670 align:middle line:84%
So the kids are going,
the father's going.

00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:27.380 align:middle line:84%
This comes in at
the last minute.

00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:28.970 align:middle line:84%
Sabrina comes in
at the last minute,

00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:30.428 align:middle line:84%
before you finish
the book, which--

00:50:30.428 --> 00:50:31.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: In the 1950s.

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:32.502 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:50:32.502 --> 00:50:33.335 align:middle line:90%
This was incredible.

00:50:33.335 --> 00:50:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: The 1950s, right?

00:50:34.070 --> 00:50:34.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:36.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
what do you think

00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:41.720 align:middle line:84%
that this pinkish, luminescent,
angel hair, spaghetti

00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:44.150 align:middle line:84%
stuff that they put on
their Christmas trees

00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:45.860 align:middle line:84%
and that stung when
she touched it,

00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:47.658 align:middle line:84%
bit her when she
touched it, what do

00:50:47.658 --> 00:50:48.950 align:middle line:90%
you think that might have been?

00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:51.970 align:middle line:90%


00:50:51.970 --> 00:50:53.270 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: We don't know.

00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:56.470 align:middle line:84%
But one of the most
interesting things

00:50:56.470 --> 00:51:03.520 align:middle line:84%
is that she talks about the heat
being transmitted through that.

00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:07.210 align:middle line:84%
So that you could apply it
to your skin when it was hot.

00:51:07.210 --> 00:51:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And I can testify,
it gets really

00:51:09.730 --> 00:51:12.220 align:middle line:84%
hot in New Mexico in
the middle of August,

00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:13.480 align:middle line:90%
because I've been there.

00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:17.303 align:middle line:84%
And you could put it to your
skin and it would stay cool.

00:51:17.303 --> 00:51:18.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That metal,
that memory metal.

00:51:18.970 --> 00:51:19.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it didn't--

00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:20.850 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: The metal
would not warm up.

00:51:20.850 --> 00:51:21.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:51:21.370 --> 00:51:21.870 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: OK?

00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:22.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:51:22.090 --> 00:51:23.530 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: So my
physicist friends--

00:51:23.530 --> 00:51:24.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So she'd
put it on her cheeks,

00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:26.905 align:middle line:84%
because it felt cool in
the middle of the summer.

00:51:26.905 --> 00:51:27.760 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: Yes.

00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:31.375 align:middle line:84%
My physics friends are very,
very interested in that.

00:51:31.375 --> 00:51:32.770 align:middle line:90%
How can you do that?

00:51:32.770 --> 00:51:36.130 align:middle line:84%
Why would they
transmit heat that way,

00:51:36.130 --> 00:51:38.260 align:middle line:84%
rather than warming
up the metal?

00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:39.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:41.770 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: And what
is the structure?

00:51:41.770 --> 00:51:46.600 align:middle line:84%
What is the fine structure
of that substance?

00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:49.640 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: But you were, I think,
referring to the fiber optics,

00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:50.440 align:middle line:10%
the--

00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:50.950 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:53.080 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for the metals,
because we needed that part,

00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:53.275 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:51:53.275 --> 00:51:53.470 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:51:53.470 --> 00:51:54.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, the--

00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:55.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The angel hair.

00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:56.258 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: It might be--

00:51:56.258 --> 00:51:59.650 align:middle line:84%
the angel hair might
be fiber optics.

00:51:59.650 --> 00:52:01.870 align:middle line:84%
It might be a type
of fiber optic.

00:52:01.870 --> 00:52:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And whatever it was, they
collected 10-pound bag of it.

00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:07.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:09.580 align:middle line:90%
OK, now let's move forward.

00:52:09.580 --> 00:52:13.780 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're
talking about fiber optics,

00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:16.300 align:middle line:90%
according to Philip Corso--

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:17.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Corso, yes.

00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:17.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:19.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The same thing
comes into play here.

00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:19.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And in
this story, there's

00:52:21.070 --> 00:52:23.650 align:middle line:84%
another metal filing cabinet
in the military where stuff

00:52:23.650 --> 00:52:27.400 align:middle line:84%
is unpacked and looked at with
the intention of examining

00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:29.140 align:middle line:90%
and perhaps reverse engineering.

00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:31.660 align:middle line:84%
So I want to get to that
part of the story now.

00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:35.170 align:middle line:84%
So with all of this, and there's
so much more-- and Paola,

00:52:35.170 --> 00:52:36.970 align:middle line:84%
you did such a
good job out there,

00:52:36.970 --> 00:52:40.210 align:middle line:84%
because you were treating
them with such respect

00:52:40.210 --> 00:52:42.820 align:middle line:84%
and what they
deserved, rather than

00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:45.530 align:middle line:84%
the military coming around and
bullying them and overlooking

00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:46.330 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:52:46.330 --> 00:52:47.130 align:middle line:90%
Calling them out.

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:48.920 align:middle line:84%
They're just a couple
Indian kids there.

00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:49.720 align:middle line:90%
Who cares?

00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:50.762 align:middle line:90%
They didn't see anything.

00:52:50.762 --> 00:52:53.300 align:middle line:84%
They're not-- they didn't
matter to anyone's life.

00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out, they
mattered the most.

00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:57.430 align:middle line:90%
So now we're past that part.

00:52:57.430 --> 00:53:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And I really recommend people
pick it up and read it.

00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:01.340 align:middle line:90%
I love this story.

00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:02.590 align:middle line:90%
I was glued to it.

00:53:02.590 --> 00:53:05.050 align:middle line:84%
Now let's go to your
feelings on the implications.

00:53:05.050 --> 00:53:07.870 align:middle line:90%
They took this away.

00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:10.180 align:middle line:84%
They took some of
probably the angel hair

00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:11.890 align:middle line:90%
and the metals and such away.

00:53:11.890 --> 00:53:13.540 align:middle line:90%
You have the bracket.

00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:14.570 align:middle line:90%
You got it from Reme.

00:53:14.570 --> 00:53:15.520 align:middle line:90%
You've got it now.

00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's somewhere else, so
don't go looking in your homes.

00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:22.120 align:middle line:84%
What do you think the state
of military back engineering

00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:25.210 align:middle line:84%
of this kind of
captured technology--

00:53:25.210 --> 00:53:26.950 align:middle line:90%
what state is it really in?

00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:31.810 align:middle line:84%
How much do you think has really
come of it through the years?

00:53:31.810 --> 00:53:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: I'm glad you asked
that, because that's really

00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:36.280 align:middle line:90%
the key question.

00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:40.690 align:middle line:84%
If Congress really wants to
ask a question, which I'm not

00:53:40.690 --> 00:53:45.010 align:middle line:84%
sure they do, but if they
want to ask a question,

00:53:45.010 --> 00:53:48.790 align:middle line:84%
the key question is, how
much longer are we going

00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:51.500 align:middle line:90%
to keep this beyond top secret?

00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:52.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:53.860 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: Beyond.

00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:57.050 align:middle line:84%
And I've worked
along in my career,

00:53:57.050 --> 00:54:00.625 align:middle line:84%
both in science and
in venture capital

00:54:00.625 --> 00:54:03.850 align:middle line:84%
and so on with people
who had high clearances.

00:54:03.850 --> 00:54:05.600 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know
anything about this.

00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:06.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:07.300 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: Why?

00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:10.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, because they had
the wrong clearances.

00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:13.840 align:middle line:84%
There are three different
systems of clearances

00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:15.970 align:middle line:90%
in the US government.

00:54:15.970 --> 00:54:19.630 align:middle line:84%
One system goes to
the president through

00:54:19.630 --> 00:54:22.480 align:middle line:90%
the appropriate agencies.

00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:25.600 align:middle line:84%
One system is
foreign intelligence,

00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:29.350 align:middle line:84%
which only goes to
the State Department

00:54:29.350 --> 00:54:34.480 align:middle line:84%
and to the diplomatic services,
and gets properly reported,

00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:38.390 align:middle line:84%
if there is a need to, to
the level of the executive.

00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:39.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:42.610 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: And then there
are the atomic clearances,

00:54:42.610 --> 00:54:43.997 align:middle line:90%
which are completely separate.

00:54:43.997 --> 00:54:46.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Those are the highest
clearances, aren't they?

00:54:46.330 --> 00:54:46.450 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:54:46.450 --> 00:54:48.680 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: No, there are
very high clearances

00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:48.970 align:middle line:90%
in all three systems.

00:54:48.970 --> 00:54:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I guess
you would be at all levels.

00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:51.082 align:middle line:90%
Sure, yeah.

00:54:51.082 --> 00:54:52.540 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: There
are clearances that

00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:58.690 align:middle line:84%
are so exquisite that only a few
people have the right to know.

00:54:58.690 --> 00:55:00.550 align:middle line:84%
Because having a
clearance doesn't give you

00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:02.920 align:middle line:84%
the right to know, so
you have to have both.

00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:05.440 align:middle line:84%
You have to carry the
card, and then somebody

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:08.080 align:middle line:84%
has to decide that
you should know

00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:10.880 align:middle line:84%
about this particular
secret that you're already

00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:11.680 align:middle line:90%
cleared for.

00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:12.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: You have
the ticket, OK?

00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:15.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.050 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: But they won't
necessarily tell you.

00:55:17.050 --> 00:55:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And you might not-- the
code word might not be open,

00:55:20.020 --> 00:55:22.570 align:middle line:90%
might not be available.

00:55:22.570 --> 00:55:26.890 align:middle line:84%
On the atomic side,
which this is,

00:55:26.890 --> 00:55:30.790 align:middle line:84%
there are clearances
called R, P, and Q.

00:55:30.790 --> 00:55:32.620 align:middle line:84%
You know minding
your P's and Q's?

00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:34.858 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:55:34.858 --> 00:55:36.770 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: That are
the atomic secrets.

00:55:36.770 --> 00:55:37.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:55:37.570 --> 00:55:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: And those
would be the secrets

00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:43.870 align:middle line:84%
that people had at Los Alamos,
the secrets that are still

00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:46.930 align:middle line:84%
in existence about the
atomic bomb and about

00:55:46.930 --> 00:55:49.870 align:middle line:90%
the nuclear developments.

00:55:49.870 --> 00:55:53.290 align:middle line:84%
Those go through a
completely separate channel,

00:55:53.290 --> 00:55:56.080 align:middle line:84%
and they don't go to the
White House, unless there

00:55:56.080 --> 00:56:01.510 align:middle line:84%
is a need at that particular
point in current affairs

00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:09.040 align:middle line:84%
or in history for that to be
presented to the executive.

00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:10.810 align:middle line:90%
Because otherwise, you cannot--

00:56:10.810 --> 00:56:14.170 align:middle line:84%
number, one you cannot have a
lot of people knowing about it.

00:56:14.170 --> 00:56:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And also, the people
would not know

00:56:17.290 --> 00:56:20.350 align:middle line:84%
under what circumstances
this should

00:56:20.350 --> 00:56:25.700 align:middle line:84%
get the attention of the White
House and of the executive.

00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:28.870 align:middle line:84%
So there are-- all those
things are appropriate,

00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:33.260 align:middle line:84%
appropriate, boundaries
to the secret.

00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:34.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:35.870 align:middle line:84%
I was going to try
to find, in fact,

00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:38.717 align:middle line:84%
a quote on exactly this,
that you put in the book.

00:56:38.717 --> 00:56:41.050 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I had written
the page down, but I hadn't.

00:56:41.050 --> 00:56:43.720 align:middle line:84%
But I remember,
basically, what it says.

00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And it says, you
have to remember

00:56:45.490 --> 00:56:50.860 align:middle line:84%
that these same documents are
going to be analyzed and taken

00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:53.620 align:middle line:84%
to the same people who have
covered this up for the last 75

00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:53.980 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:56:53.980 --> 00:56:55.595 align:middle line:84%
And they can spin it
any way they want.

00:56:55.595 --> 00:56:56.395 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: Yes.

00:56:56.395 --> 00:56:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Same dossiers go to
the same agencies, and it's--

00:56:59.350 --> 00:57:00.343 align:middle line:90%
when does this end?

00:57:00.343 --> 00:57:01.510 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: And I don't have--

00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:03.200 align:middle line:90%
I am not a whistleblower.

00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:04.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm not.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:05.842 align:middle line:84%
I'm a very
disciplined scientist.

00:57:05.842 --> 00:57:06.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, you are.

00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:08.050 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: People
will tell you I am.

00:57:08.050 --> 00:57:08.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:57:08.190 --> 00:57:09.815 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you're not a
conspiracy theorist.

00:57:09.815 --> 00:57:10.760 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:11.310 align:middle line:90%


00:57:11.310 --> 00:57:13.060 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: That's why
I'm in Silicon Valley

00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:14.245 align:middle line:90%
and I work with teams.

00:57:14.245 --> 00:57:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:16.240 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: I love to
be a team member.

00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:19.990 align:middle line:84%
I know what I can bring, and
I know what I don't know.

00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:22.510 align:middle line:90%
But the problem with--

00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:25.390 align:middle line:84%
and the secrecy
probably was appropriate

00:57:25.390 --> 00:57:27.550 align:middle line:90%
during the Cold War, OK?

00:57:27.550 --> 00:57:30.340 align:middle line:84%
It had to be in somebody's
basement in some out-of-the-way

00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:32.500 align:middle line:90%
place nobody talks about it.

00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:35.740 align:middle line:90%
But we've emerged from that.

00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:38.230 align:middle line:90%
We're in a different era now.

00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:41.920 align:middle line:84%
We're in an era
of where the Earth

00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:45.740 align:middle line:84%
itself is in trouble,
all over the place.

00:57:45.740 --> 00:57:50.110 align:middle line:84%
We need cooperation, and we need
to get the scientific community

00:57:50.110 --> 00:57:50.910 align:middle line:90%
involved.

00:57:50.910 --> 00:57:53.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We need clean,
effective technology and energy

00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:54.430 align:middle line:90%
production, just to start.

00:57:54.430 --> 00:57:56.440 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: Well, with
secret technology,

00:57:56.440 --> 00:58:01.630 align:middle line:84%
if you find, say, a prototype
from China somewhere,

00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:05.350 align:middle line:84%
suppose that Tic Tacs are
from China and we get one.

00:58:05.350 --> 00:58:08.050 align:middle line:90%
We catch one.

00:58:08.050 --> 00:58:10.660 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
taken apart, and it's

00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:14.005 align:middle line:84%
going to be given to different
teams and different companies.

00:58:14.005 --> 00:58:14.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:58:14.890 --> 00:58:18.100 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: Lucky, Boeing, and IT.

00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:20.560 align:middle line:84%
IBM will look at
different things.

00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:22.450 align:middle line:84%
The people looking
at the control system

00:58:22.450 --> 00:58:25.450 align:middle line:84%
are not the people who are
going to look at the propulsion.

00:58:25.450 --> 00:58:26.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:30.710 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: And they may not
know that the other labs exist,

00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:33.880 align:middle line:84%
and that's the way it has to
be to preserve the secrets.

00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:35.708 align:middle line:84%
It's compartmentalization
is and--

00:58:35.708 --> 00:58:37.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But when is it ready?

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:40.110 align:middle line:84%
When does it no longer
need to be secret?

00:58:40.110 --> 00:58:41.860 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: But you're
not going to find out

00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:44.660 align:middle line:84%
what it does until these
people can talk to each other.

00:58:44.660 --> 00:58:45.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:58:45.460 --> 00:58:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: But there are--
it's illegal for them

00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:48.840 align:middle line:90%
to talk to each other.

00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:49.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [SIGHS]

00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:49.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: [LAUGHS]

00:58:49.690 --> 00:58:50.750 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: We need to stop that.

00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:51.958 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We need to stop it.

00:58:51.958 --> 00:58:55.040 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: Somebody in Washington
needs to say, enough of that.

00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:55.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:58.870 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: The scientific
community knows.

00:58:58.870 --> 00:59:00.970 align:middle line:84%
We think scientists
are skeptics and so on.

00:59:00.970 --> 00:59:03.622 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:59:03.622 --> 00:59:05.440 align:middle line:84%
If you go to the
right level, you'll

00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:08.540 align:middle line:84%
have a very interesting
conversation about UFOs.

00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:09.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:09.730 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: OK?

00:59:09.730 --> 00:59:10.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:59:10.530 --> 00:59:13.240 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: And you'll find that
people have educated themselves

00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:15.940 align:middle line:84%
about it, and that they have
the same questions we're

00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:18.620 align:middle line:90%
discussing here, between us.

00:59:18.620 --> 00:59:22.510 align:middle line:10%
And have no problem in Silicon
Valley recruiting people

00:59:22.510 --> 00:59:23.885 align:middle line:10%
to come look at
this bracket, OK?

00:59:23.885 --> 00:59:24.685 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:59:24.685 --> 00:59:25.720 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:26.410 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to see the bracket.

00:59:26.410 --> 00:59:27.370 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: When you
put it on the table,

00:59:27.370 --> 00:59:29.260 align:middle line:84%
and everybody has a
different opinion.

00:59:29.260 --> 00:59:30.800 align:middle line:90%
And that's where we start from.

00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:31.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:34.970 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: Again, Federico Faggin
saying, if we stop doing this,

00:59:34.970 --> 00:59:37.097 align:middle line:84%
we might as well
disband Silicon Valley.

00:59:37.097 --> 00:59:37.930 align:middle line:90%
Everybody goes home.

00:59:37.930 --> 00:59:38.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:59:38.410 --> 00:59:40.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, you two have done
such a beautiful job

00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:41.830 align:middle line:90%
constructing this.

00:59:41.830 --> 00:59:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And as we say, the science
may not be settled.

00:59:44.530 --> 00:59:45.700 align:middle line:90%
It may be continuing.

00:59:45.700 --> 00:59:47.740 align:middle line:84%
The exploration is
going to continue.

00:59:47.740 --> 00:59:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And what you said, is
absolutely critical.

00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:53.380 align:middle line:10%
That if we can't start
allowing these entities to talk

00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:55.480 align:middle line:10%
to one another, and to
reveal what we really have,

00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:57.580 align:middle line:10%
and what the potential
for humanity,

00:59:57.580 --> 01:00:00.130 align:middle line:10%
for our Earth is,
then what's the point?

01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:01.780 align:middle line:84%
It's getting-- to
this point, it's

01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:04.720 align:middle line:84%
becoming gratuitous to
keep it a secret anymore.

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just so grateful
that you two came together

01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:10.540 align:middle line:84%
to do this, because there's
so much heart and warmth.

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And I have to tell you, for a
techie scientist kind of guy,

01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:15.830 align:middle line:84%
what an elegant,
beautiful writer you are.

01:00:15.830 --> 01:00:16.630 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: He is.

01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:17.050 align:middle line:90%
He is.

01:00:17.050 --> 01:00:17.625 align:middle line:90%
He actually--

01:00:17.625 --> 01:00:18.792 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A stunning writer.

01:00:18.792 --> 01:00:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is your
second language.

01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:20.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes!

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:21.122 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:21.122 --> 01:00:21.524 align:middle line:90%
This is--

01:00:21.524 --> 01:00:22.435 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I am so impressed.

01:00:22.435 --> 01:00:24.010 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I highly
recommend it.

01:00:24.010 --> 01:00:24.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

01:00:24.250 --> 01:00:25.375 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A quick question.

01:00:25.375 --> 01:00:28.360 align:middle line:84%
First of all, did you like
the treatment of yourself

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:30.652 align:middle line:84%
as a character in "Close
Encounters of the Third Kind"?

01:00:30.652 --> 01:00:31.452 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: Well--

01:00:31.452 --> 01:00:32.997 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Were you OK with it?

01:00:32.997 --> 01:00:33.991 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: Um--

01:00:33.991 --> 01:00:35.440 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:37.065 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sorry to
put you on the spot.

01:00:37.065 --> 01:00:40.780 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: It was-- I have a lot
of respect for Mr. Spielberg

01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:41.680 align:middle line:90%
and what he did.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:46.630 align:middle line:84%
He's the only-- really,
the only one in Hollywood

01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:51.293 align:middle line:84%
who understood the
human aspect of this.

01:00:51.293 --> 01:00:52.335 align:middle line:90%
It's not just technology.

01:00:52.335 --> 01:00:53.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it's human.

01:00:53.110 --> 01:00:54.318 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: Something shows up.

01:00:54.318 --> 01:00:55.420 align:middle line:90%
We get afraid.

01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:57.370 align:middle line:90%
We start shooting it.

01:00:57.370 --> 01:01:01.390 align:middle line:84%
The usual shoot
'em up alien film.

01:01:01.390 --> 01:01:03.130 align:middle line:84%
He understood what
was behind it.

01:01:03.130 --> 01:01:06.527 align:middle line:84%
And the idea of getting
Francois Truffaut was--

01:01:06.527 --> 01:01:07.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:08.330 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: --was--

01:01:08.330 --> 01:01:08.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was--

01:01:08.830 --> 01:01:09.460 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:10.877 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: I have
a lot of respect,

01:01:10.877 --> 01:01:13.367 align:middle line:84%
coming from France,
for his movies.

01:01:13.367 --> 01:01:14.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:15.700 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was wonderful.

01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:17.367 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: And there
is a sense of humor.

01:01:17.367 --> 01:01:23.650 align:middle line:84%
One thing I'm very proud of
is that the sequence where

01:01:23.650 --> 01:01:28.390 align:middle line:84%
they steal the globe
from the-- well,

01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:31.030 align:middle line:84%
that that's something that's
an anecdote that I told

01:01:31.030 --> 01:01:36.340 align:middle line:84%
Spielberg when we had lunch
one day, about something

01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:38.720 align:middle line:84%
that happened when
Sputnik was launched.

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:42.280 align:middle line:84%
There was-- nobody had a
computer program in the US

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:45.050 align:middle line:84%
to compute an orbit of a
satellite of the Earth.

01:01:45.050 --> 01:01:45.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

01:01:45.850 --> 01:01:47.350 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: You could
compute an orbit

01:01:47.350 --> 01:01:50.350 align:middle line:84%
of the satellite of
Jupiter or something

01:01:50.350 --> 01:01:52.270 align:middle line:90%
like that, but not of the Earth.

01:01:52.270 --> 01:01:56.710 align:middle line:84%
So they had to take a globe
and put a piece of string

01:01:56.710 --> 01:02:00.310 align:middle line:84%
around the globe to
see where the Sputnik

01:02:00.310 --> 01:02:01.930 align:middle line:90%
1 was going to go next.

01:02:01.930 --> 01:02:03.537 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Hynek was
involved in that.

01:02:03.537 --> 01:02:04.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

01:02:04.370 --> 01:02:05.745 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: And he
had the picture.

01:02:05.745 --> 01:02:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And I told that
story to Spielberg.

01:02:07.450 --> 01:02:09.050 align:middle line:90%
And he said, that's it.

01:02:09.050 --> 01:02:09.850 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

01:02:09.850 --> 01:02:12.530 align:middle line:84%
They say, we've got a billion
dollars worth of technology

01:02:12.530 --> 01:02:13.330 align:middle line:90%
here.

01:02:13.330 --> 01:02:14.170 align:middle line:90%
It's all secret.

01:02:14.170 --> 01:02:15.490 align:middle line:90%
It's all classified.

01:02:15.490 --> 01:02:19.160 align:middle line:90%
And nobody has a map of Wyoming?

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:19.960 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:21.700 align:middle line:90%
And get me a map of Wyoming.

01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:23.820 align:middle line:90%
And they steal that globe.

01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:26.828 align:middle line:10%
That whole thing was one of the
funny parts in the movie, so--

01:02:26.828 --> 01:02:28.870 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Oh, thank you
for sharing that with us.

01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:29.110 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: So that was funny.

01:02:29.110 --> 01:02:29.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:29.635 align:middle line:90%
Well--

01:02:29.635 --> 01:02:30.850 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: I never
got paid for that.

01:02:30.850 --> 01:02:31.650 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:31.650 --> 01:02:32.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, that's OK.

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:34.320 align:middle line:90%
You got paid in other ways, OK?

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:34.675 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: Yeah, but--

01:02:34.675 --> 01:02:35.475 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:35.475 --> 01:02:37.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You get
to live with that.

01:02:37.130 --> 01:02:38.630 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: No, that
was a lot of fun.

01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:39.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I love it.

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:40.280 align:middle line:90%
And--

01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:42.155 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: And there is
a fun element in that.

01:02:42.155 --> 01:02:44.270 align:middle line:84%
There is a fun
element in learning.

01:02:44.270 --> 01:02:46.850 align:middle line:90%
And I'm still learning.

01:02:46.850 --> 01:02:48.350 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know much
about the history

01:02:48.350 --> 01:02:50.970 align:middle line:90%
of World War II in the Pacific.

01:02:50.970 --> 01:02:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And I knew the
history in Europe.

01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:54.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:56.355 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: I didn't know
the history in the Pacific,

01:02:56.355 --> 01:02:59.270 align:middle line:84%
and there are some
incredible, incredible things.

01:02:59.270 --> 01:03:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And they are not
teaching in schools.

01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:01.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not talked about.

01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:02.360 align:middle line:90%
No, they're not.

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:05.100 align:middle line:10%
>>VALLEE: About the war,
the end of the war in Japan.

01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:05.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: And what
it did to Japan.

01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:07.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

01:03:07.850 --> 01:03:08.650 align:middle line:90%
Another show.

01:03:08.650 --> 01:03:09.772 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: And what it was.

01:03:09.772 --> 01:03:10.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Another show.

01:03:10.730 --> 01:03:11.540 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And kudos to you for
continuing to learn every day,

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:16.490 align:middle line:90%
every breath of your life.

01:03:16.490 --> 01:03:19.530 align:middle line:84%
I very much have a
deep respect for that.

01:03:19.530 --> 01:03:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And same for you,
Paola, to go out

01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:24.320 align:middle line:84%
with such passion and heart,
and go out and get these stories

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:25.220 align:middle line:90%
and bring them to us.

01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:27.282 align:middle line:84%
And bringing people
together like this.

01:03:27.282 --> 01:03:29.740 align:middle line:84%
Anything final you would like
to say before we say goodbye?

01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:30.590 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

01:03:30.590 --> 01:03:34.820 align:middle line:84%
In the collaboration idea,
this is the first time

01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:37.170 align:middle line:90%
I've collaborated on anything.

01:03:37.170 --> 01:03:39.300 align:middle line:10%
And it's been a pleasure
collaborating with Jacques

01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:40.100 align:middle line:10%
on it.

01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And I learned so much, too,
because my job is basically

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:44.360 align:middle line:90%
to get the witness testimony.

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:48.380 align:middle line:10%
And his job is to call me and
ask me about an 18-wheeler.

01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:49.200 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:50.510 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going, OK.

01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:52.070 align:middle line:90%
Well, why do I have to do this?

01:03:52.070 --> 01:03:53.750 align:middle line:10%
And he goes, because
I have to calculate

01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:54.833 align:middle line:10%
how heavy that object was.

01:03:54.833 --> 01:03:55.633 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

01:03:55.633 --> 01:03:58.460 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: And so I learned a
lot from the collaboration.

01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And may I encourage
the other researchers

01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:06.755 align:middle line:84%
out there that do field research
to collaborate on cases.

01:04:06.755 --> 01:04:07.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: With one another.

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:08.660 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: With one another.

01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:09.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's like,
just as you say,

01:04:09.650 --> 01:04:11.155 align:middle line:84%
in the military
industrial complex

01:04:11.155 --> 01:04:13.530 align:middle line:84%
with all these technologies,
they need to start speaking.

01:04:13.530 --> 01:04:14.380 align:middle line:90%
So do you guys.

01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:17.870 align:middle line:84%
The UFO community needs
to start speaking and not

01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:21.150 align:middle line:84%
ridiculously guarding their
one little piece of the story.

01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:22.790 align:middle line:90%
It's not appropriate anymore.

01:04:22.790 --> 01:04:25.430 align:middle line:10%
>>VALLEE: Well, one thing
I learned along the way,

01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:29.960 align:middle line:10%
talking to the right people, is
that most reverse engineering

01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:31.450 align:middle line:10%
doesn't work.

01:04:31.450 --> 01:04:32.250 align:middle line:10%
Maybe 80% of it.

01:04:32.250 --> 01:04:32.360 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:33.740 align:middle line:10%
That's why I asked
you that earlier.

01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:35.157 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: We can't
figure out what

01:04:35.157 --> 01:04:38.630 align:middle line:84%
that is, that the Russians
did, or the Chinese did.

You get a piece of something
that fell from the sky,

01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:44.330 align:middle line:10%
and you find some gadget inside.

01:04:44.330 --> 01:04:45.830 align:middle line:84%
You don't know what
that thing does.

01:04:45.830 --> 01:04:47.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And maybe
it's intended that way.

01:04:47.210 --> 01:04:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was not-- it
was done in such a way

01:04:49.310 --> 01:04:51.477 align:middle line:84%
that there was no way, at
this point in our history,

01:04:51.477 --> 01:04:54.170 align:middle line:84%
until we get a little smarter,
wiser, and more collaborative,

01:04:54.170 --> 01:04:55.190 align:middle line:90%
to have it engineered.

01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:56.862 align:middle line:90%
So I can live with that mystery.

01:04:56.862 --> 01:04:58.070 align:middle line:90%
And I want to thank you both.

01:04:58.070 --> 01:04:59.690 align:middle line:90%
This has been just delightful.

01:04:59.690 --> 01:05:03.260 align:middle line:84%
I've so been looking forward
to it, and I so loved the book.

01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:04.790 align:middle line:90%
I was reading it like a novel.

01:05:04.790 --> 01:05:05.590 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

01:05:05.590 --> 01:05:08.420 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: Well, obviously
you did your homework.

01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:09.868 align:middle line:90%
Your questions were right on.

01:05:09.868 --> 01:05:10.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why, thank you.

01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:11.480 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:13.790 align:middle line:84%
And I hope to see you both
again in the studio one

01:05:13.790 --> 01:05:15.060 align:middle line:90%
day, as is appropriate.

01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:15.860 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: Any time.

01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Me, too.

01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:16.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:17.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Thank you.

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:18.200 align:middle line:90%
>>VALLEE: Thanks.

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:20.117 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again, the
book is titled "Trinity--

01:05:20.117 --> 01:05:22.340 align:middle line:84%
The Best-Kept Secret," which
you can find through all

01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:23.330 align:middle line:90%
the normal booksellers.

01:05:23.330 --> 01:05:26.270 align:middle line:84%
It's a fascinating,
beautifully-written, reflective

01:05:26.270 --> 01:05:29.270 align:middle line:84%
study of where we are as a
species in our connection

01:05:29.270 --> 01:05:31.070 align:middle line:90%
with the UFO and ET phenomena.

01:05:31.070 --> 01:05:33.050 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

01:05:33.050 --> 01:05:34.220 align:middle line:90%
on "Open Minds."

01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:36.670 align:middle line:90%
