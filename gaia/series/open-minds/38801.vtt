>> Regina Meredith: Remote
viewing, time travel,

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:28.895 align:middle line:84%
telekinesis, these are all
abilities that were accessible

00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:32.632 align:middle line:84%
to today's guest, Andrew
Bassagio, from a very young age.

00:00:32.632 --> 00:00:35.034 align:middle line:84%
Because of his father's
professional position Andrew

00:00:35.034 --> 00:00:36.536 align:middle line:90%
became the focus of attention,

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:39.072 align:middle line:84%
his abilities tapped
for military use.

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:42.776 align:middle line:84%
What he has seen is far beyond
the imagination of most of us.

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:45.245 align:middle line:84%
Yet he sees the beauty
in all of it.

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:47.213 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so happy to
finally meet you.

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:49.783 align:middle line:84%
I first heard of your
work about seven years ago

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:51.551 align:middle line:90%
through a mutual contact.

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:53.253 align:middle line:90%
And here we are finally.

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:55.121 align:middle line:84%
It takes a while to
manifest sometimes,

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:57.390 align:middle line:84%
although theoretically I guess
you could have jumped right

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.293 align:middle line:84%
to it or I could
have jumped back.

00:01:00.293 --> 00:01:01.828 align:middle line:84%
>> Andrew Bassagio: It's
good to be with you, Regina.

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:03.196 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:06.433 align:middle line:84%
Let's just, with your story
because we have only an hour,

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:10.703 align:middle line:84%
and this really could take hours
to tell, let's start with you

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:15.241 align:middle line:84%
from a very young age, and then
move into the very early years

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:18.111 align:middle line:84%
by the age of six of your
participation in some

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:20.413 align:middle line:90%
of these now known experiments.

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:23.917 align:middle line:84%
So they were very deeply
hidden until recently.

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:28.455 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: Well, as a young
child I certainly had a sense

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:31.958 align:middle line:84%
of having been reincarnated
from previous lives.

00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:35.495 align:middle line:84%
I certainly remembered a
number of my past lives.

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:38.932 align:middle line:84%
I was demonstrating
special abilities.

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:41.234 align:middle line:84%
For example, at our
home in Morris Plains,

00:01:41.234 --> 00:01:45.572 align:middle line:84%
New Jersey my father had
witnessed me levitating some

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:49.809 align:middle line:84%
of my small toys in one incident
before I entered kindergarten

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:53.112 align:middle line:84%
at age four at a local
elementary school.

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:56.749 align:middle line:84%
I was often going down to
our cellar at our house

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:59.486 align:middle line:84%
in Morris Plains where my
dad had a carpentry shop

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:02.255 align:middle line:90%
and completing his thoughts.

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:06.126 align:middle line:84%
So I had I would say
some expanded awareness.

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:09.996 align:middle line:84%
And I also was not aware of
things that I couldn't do.

00:02:09.996 --> 00:02:13.299 align:middle line:84%
In other words I had the
ability to achieve some things

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:18.271 align:middle line:84%
such as read somebody's thoughts
or cause small objects to hover

00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:20.874 align:middle line:84%
above the floor simply
because I had the intent

00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:22.408 align:middle line:84%
and the understanding
that I could do so.

00:02:22.408 --> 00:02:24.410 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't putting
limits on myself.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.081 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's one of the
reasons why I was selected

00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:32.352 align:middle line:84%
for DARPA's Project Pegasus
beginning in the fall of 1969

00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:34.954 align:middle line:84%
when I was entering
the third grade.

00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:38.525 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Let's talk
about the training of you

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:41.594 align:middle line:84%
and the other very young
people that were there.

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:44.731 align:middle line:84%
And let's start out with some
of the really simple things

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:46.232 align:middle line:90%
like the card games and such,

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:48.301 align:middle line:84%
just start identifying
who was who.

00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:50.303 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: Well, we know
under Project Talent beginning

00:02:50.303 --> 00:02:54.741 align:middle line:84%
in the late 1950s when Admiral
Rickover essentially set

00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:58.478 align:middle line:84%
as a national goal
identifying young Americans

00:02:58.478 --> 00:03:04.183 align:middle line:84%
of exceptional intellectual,
psychic and leadership ability.

00:03:04.183 --> 00:03:08.087 align:middle line:84%
That there was really a national
screening process going on.

00:03:08.087 --> 00:03:11.424 align:middle line:84%
In fact, many of your viewers
will remember that five

00:03:11.424 --> 00:03:13.426 align:middle line:84%
and a half days of
testing, we were even coming

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:16.796 align:middle line:84%
in on Saturday mornings to
complete that national exam.

00:03:16.796 --> 00:03:20.700 align:middle line:84%
That was the result of
Project Talent trying

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.570 align:middle line:84%
to find young people that they
could work with, for example,

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.972 align:middle line:84%
on secret defense and
intelligence projects.

00:03:26.972 --> 00:03:28.975 align:middle line:90%
I was one of them identified.

00:03:28.975 --> 00:03:32.145 align:middle line:84%
And so in the fall of
1969, a couple months

00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:35.847 align:middle line:84%
after the lunar landing
of July 1969, I was placed

00:03:35.847 --> 00:03:38.885 align:middle line:84%
in a learning lab at
my elementary school

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:42.355 align:middle line:84%
which was Mountview Road School
in Morris Plains, New Jersey.

00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:48.161 align:middle line:84%
And we were immediately involved
in a set of academic exercises

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:51.230 align:middle line:84%
in speed learning
and different things

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.032 align:middle line:84%
that the intelligence
community would identify

00:03:53.032 --> 00:03:55.535 align:middle line:90%
as alpha intelligence training,

00:03:55.535 --> 00:03:59.272 align:middle line:84%
the ability to acquire
information very rapidly,

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:02.408 align:middle line:84%
to understand what we were
perceiving, to memorize it,

00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:05.211 align:middle line:84%
to report it back to
other team members.

00:04:05.211 --> 00:04:08.314 align:middle line:84%
And that was going on right
from the very beginning

00:04:08.314 --> 00:04:10.617 align:middle line:84%
with psychic training
where the children

00:04:10.617 --> 00:04:11.951 align:middle line:90%
who were performing well

00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:14.686 align:middle line:84%
in the psychic games we were
playing were being retained

00:04:14.686 --> 00:04:15.655 align:middle line:90%
in the program.

00:04:15.655 --> 00:04:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And those who were
not performing

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.759 align:middle line:84%
so well were being dismissed
from the learning lab.

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.027 align:middle line:90%
So I remember the first game

00:04:21.027 --> 00:04:24.197 align:middle line:84%
that we were playing was a
game called concentration

00:04:24.197 --> 00:04:28.101 align:middle line:84%
where the special educator in
the learning lab would select 1

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:31.337 align:middle line:84%
out of 52 standard playing
cards and look at it

00:04:31.337 --> 00:04:35.541 align:middle line:84%
and understand what card it was,
and place it to her forehead

00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:39.846 align:middle line:84%
and begin concentrating
on what card it was.

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:43.016 align:middle line:84%
And she would go round robin
for let's say 90 minutes or so

00:04:43.016 --> 00:04:46.052 align:middle line:84%
with four or five of the
children in the project.

00:04:46.052 --> 00:04:50.023 align:middle line:84%
And I remember guessing the card
correctly with 1 out of 52 odds

00:04:50.023 --> 00:04:51.457 align:middle line:90%
for the whole session.

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:52.825 align:middle line:90%
Maybe getting one guess wrong.

00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:56.596 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I would guess five of
hearts versus five of diamonds.

00:04:56.596 --> 00:05:00.033 align:middle line:84%
So in addition to what I believe
my father probably reported

00:05:00.033 --> 00:05:01.768 align:middle line:90%
to the Department of Defense

00:05:01.768 --> 00:05:06.539 align:middle line:84%
that I was demonstrating special
abilities like levitation

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:09.342 align:middle line:84%
and clairvoyance, I
think I was identified

00:05:09.342 --> 00:05:12.745 align:middle line:84%
as a pretty advanced psychic
at that time in the beginning

00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:15.148 align:middle line:90%
of that third grade school year.

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:16.249 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to say that
the children

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:17.817 align:middle line:84%
that were ultimately
selected for time travel

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:21.154 align:middle line:84%
under Project Pegasus were
small mediums at large.

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:22.622 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: That's cute.

00:05:22.622 --> 00:05:24.457 align:middle line:90%
>> Bassagio: That very fall --

00:05:24.457 --> 00:05:25.525 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Small
mediums at large.

00:05:25.525 --> 00:05:26.392 align:middle line:90%
That's very cute.

00:05:26.392 --> 00:05:27.593 align:middle line:90%
But let's talk about your dad.

00:05:27.593 --> 00:05:28.795 align:middle line:90%
Now, what was your dad --

00:05:28.795 --> 00:05:32.398 align:middle line:84%
which defense contracting
firm was he working for?

00:05:32.398 --> 00:05:33.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: My late
father, Raymond F. Bassagio,

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.903 align:middle line:84%
was a special projects engineer
educated at LeHigh University

00:05:37.903 --> 00:05:40.606 align:middle line:84%
with a bachelor of science
in electrical engineering

00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:44.110 align:middle line:84%
who was then employed for the
Ralph M. Parsons Company during

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.578 align:middle line:90%
those years of New York City.

00:05:45.578 --> 00:05:48.514 align:middle line:84%
And Parsons, of course, later
moved to Pasadena, California.

00:05:48.514 --> 00:05:51.384 align:middle line:84%
Parsons is every year
arguably either the first

00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:55.321 align:middle line:84%
or second largest process
engineering company often vying

00:05:55.321 --> 00:05:58.391 align:middle line:84%
with Bechtel Corporation
for that honor

00:05:58.391 --> 00:06:01.327 align:middle line:84%
and remains a leading
defense contractor.

00:06:01.327 --> 00:06:03.129 align:middle line:84%
It's just done some amazing
things around the world.

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:07.033 align:middle line:84%
They built an entire city
called Yanbu in Saudi Arabia.

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:09.102 align:middle line:90%
They were the defense contractor

00:06:09.102 --> 00:06:11.838 align:middle line:84%
that implemented the
MX missile system.

00:06:11.838 --> 00:06:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And what the public has not
been told, it's something

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.808 align:middle line:90%
that was actually hinted

00:06:15.808 --> 00:06:18.444 align:middle line:84%
at on the Ralph M.
Parsons Company website

00:06:18.444 --> 00:06:21.080 align:middle line:84%
until fairly recently
when I began talking

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.518 align:middle line:84%
about my experiences as the
son of a Parsons' engineer,

00:06:25.518 --> 00:06:28.621 align:middle line:84%
which is that the Ralph M.
Parsons Company gave the United

00:06:28.621 --> 00:06:30.289 align:middle line:90%
States government time travel.

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:33.726 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: A few
questions would arise here.

00:06:33.726 --> 00:06:36.195 align:middle line:84%
One of them is was
the technology

00:06:36.195 --> 00:06:39.365 align:middle line:84%
that they were using
developed by them,

00:06:39.365 --> 00:06:41.367 align:middle line:84%
or was it maybe reverse
engineered

00:06:41.367 --> 00:06:45.037 align:middle line:84%
from off planet cultures'
technologies?

00:06:45.037 --> 00:06:46.139 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: It was
all of the above.

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:48.641 align:middle line:90%
DARPA working with Parsons

00:06:48.641 --> 00:06:52.445 align:middle line:84%
and the CIA created an
intelligence funnel sometime I

00:06:52.445 --> 00:06:54.814 align:middle line:90%
believe in the mid 1960s.

00:06:54.814 --> 00:06:56.849 align:middle line:84%
Because they had
several leading forms

00:06:56.849 --> 00:06:59.252 align:middle line:84%
of time travel including
teleportation

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:03.489 align:middle line:84%
and chronovision fully
operational by 1970.

00:07:03.489 --> 00:07:06.659 align:middle line:84%
We also know from an encounter
between my father and I

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:09.929 align:middle line:84%
at the Lincoln speech site
in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:14.801 align:middle line:84%
on November 19th of 1863 that
he had been time traveling

00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:16.369 align:middle line:90%
for several years before I began

00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:18.438 align:middle line:84%
to even be trained
in the program.

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:22.508 align:middle line:84%
And so into that intelligence
funnel DARPA was placing all

00:07:22.508 --> 00:07:23.643 align:middle line:90%
of the above, everything

00:07:23.643 --> 00:07:25.578 align:middle line:84%
that would give the U.S.
government a time space

00:07:25.578 --> 00:07:27.413 align:middle line:90%
travel capability.

00:07:27.413 --> 00:07:31.784 align:middle line:84%
Those would include information
from ancient civilizations

00:07:31.784 --> 00:07:33.586 align:middle line:84%
on earth, the Babylonian,
Egyptian

00:07:33.586 --> 00:07:36.455 align:middle line:84%
and Sumerian experiments
with time travel;

00:07:36.455 --> 00:07:42.762 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial sources
from both downed UFO craft

00:07:42.762 --> 00:07:48.601 align:middle line:84%
and as a result of ET human
liaison which was actually part

00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:51.804 align:middle line:84%
of Project Pegasus; and then,
of course, the information

00:07:51.804 --> 00:07:53.406 align:middle line:84%
from foreign intelligence
sources

00:07:53.406 --> 00:07:54.841 align:middle line:84%
which would include
the Nazi German

00:07:54.841 --> 00:07:58.311 align:middle line:84%
and Soviet Russian
work in time travel.

00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:01.214 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the work
of contemporary geniuses

00:08:01.214 --> 00:08:04.951 align:middle line:84%
like Nikola Tesla,
Fathers Ernetti and Gemelli

00:08:04.951 --> 00:08:06.519 align:middle line:90%
who were the Benedictine priests

00:08:06.519 --> 00:08:09.856 align:middle line:84%
that accidentally discovered
chronovision and then joined

00:08:09.856 --> 00:08:12.425 align:middle line:84%
with Enrico Fermi
in perfecting it.

00:08:12.425 --> 00:08:14.727 align:middle line:84%
So it was really a
kind of a catch plot

00:08:14.727 --> 00:08:16.229 align:middle line:84%
into which they were
throwing anything

00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:18.197 align:middle line:84%
that would enable
the U.S. government

00:08:18.197 --> 00:08:21.234 align:middle line:84%
to send people non-locally
in time space

00:08:21.234 --> 00:08:25.137 align:middle line:84%
or to propagate holograms
of past and future events.

00:08:25.137 --> 00:08:27.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Let's talk about
the actual experience then.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:32.778 align:middle line:84%
The first time you made a jump
so to speak from one time frame

00:08:32.778 --> 00:08:34.880 align:middle line:84%
to another you were
with your father.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.249 align:middle line:90%
>> Bassagio: Correct.

00:08:36.249 --> 00:08:37.716 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Which I would think
that there was some strategy

00:08:37.716 --> 00:08:39.352 align:middle line:84%
in that, there's a
certain comfort in that.

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:40.753 align:middle line:90%
>> Bassagio: Right.

00:08:40.753 --> 00:08:42.889 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And your father had
already been before you, right?

00:08:42.889 --> 00:08:44.023 align:middle line:90%
>> Bassagio: Right.

00:08:44.023 --> 00:08:45.424 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to create a
cadre of young Americans

00:08:45.424 --> 00:08:48.861 align:middle line:84%
who would feel comfortable time
traveling in adulthood just

00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:53.065 align:middle line:84%
like a child that you involve
in scuba considers moving

00:08:53.065 --> 00:08:55.301 align:middle line:84%
between the terrestrial
and the aquatic environment

00:08:55.301 --> 00:08:57.103 align:middle line:90%
as just a part of everyday life.

00:08:57.103 --> 00:08:59.705 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to enable
us to be able to go

00:08:59.705 --> 00:09:02.708 align:middle line:84%
from the present timeline
that we're on to a past

00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:05.978 align:middle line:84%
or future timeline effortlessly
without any anxiety,

00:09:05.978 --> 00:09:09.248 align:middle line:84%
without any sense of something
extraordinary going on.

00:09:09.248 --> 00:09:11.684 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that that
was one of the motives

00:09:11.684 --> 00:09:15.521 align:middle line:84%
for my father beginning
to involve me

00:09:15.521 --> 00:09:18.457 align:middle line:90%
in teleportation at age six.

00:09:18.457 --> 00:09:22.662 align:middle line:84%
What happened is we left
our home in Morris Plains,

00:09:22.662 --> 00:09:25.965 align:middle line:84%
my dad shouting to my mom in the
house that, hon, I'm taking Andy

00:09:25.965 --> 00:09:29.135 align:middle line:84%
to the hardware store which was
not in Wood-Ridge, New Jersey.

00:09:29.135 --> 00:09:31.337 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: That's a code.

00:09:31.337 --> 00:09:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: Yeah, which was
in Florham Park, New Jersey.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.311 align:middle line:84%
And instead we drove up to the
Curtiss-Wright Aeronautical

00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:41.147 align:middle line:84%
Company facility in Wood-Ridge,
New Jersey, which also was

00:09:41.147 --> 00:09:43.349 align:middle line:90%
about 15 minutes from the house.

00:09:43.349 --> 00:09:47.153 align:middle line:84%
And we were cleared through
security there into building 68.

00:09:47.153 --> 00:09:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And in a small laboratory in
building 68 there was a device

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:52.925 align:middle line:90%
in the front of the room.

00:09:52.925 --> 00:09:56.028 align:middle line:84%
It basically consisted of
two parenthesis shaped booms

00:09:56.028 --> 00:09:59.498 align:middle line:84%
that were about eight feet
high, maybe about ten feet apart

00:09:59.498 --> 00:10:00.599 align:middle line:90%
from each other on the floor.

00:10:00.599 --> 00:10:02.868 align:middle line:84%
And there was a technician
sitting

00:10:02.868 --> 00:10:05.504 align:middle line:84%
at a rudimentary
computer keyboard

00:10:05.504 --> 00:10:08.941 align:middle line:84%
and screen controlling the
device setting the time

00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:10.643 align:middle line:90%
space coordinates.

00:10:10.643 --> 00:10:11.944 align:middle line:90%
And then on the right side

00:10:11.944 --> 00:10:14.280 align:middle line:84%
of the machine there was a
power cord that was plugged

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.516 align:middle line:84%
into the wall that really wasn't
much larger than you would use

00:10:17.516 --> 00:10:19.652 align:middle line:84%
to power a small
industrial device,

00:10:19.652 --> 00:10:22.321 align:middle line:84%
let's say an industrial
lathe or drill press.

00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:26.025 align:middle line:84%
And my dad explained that
when the technician turned

00:10:26.025 --> 00:10:31.497 align:middle line:84%
on the device we would
see a field of energy

00:10:31.497 --> 00:10:34.233 align:middle line:84%
that when we then just took
a run at that field of energy

00:10:34.233 --> 00:10:37.603 align:middle line:84%
and jumped through that
energy we would find ourselves

00:10:37.603 --> 00:10:39.972 align:middle line:90%
in a tunnel for several seconds.

00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:42.508 align:middle line:84%
The tunnel would close, and
then we would find ourselves

00:10:42.508 --> 00:10:44.877 align:middle line:90%
elsewhere in the country,

00:10:44.877 --> 00:10:48.080 align:middle line:84%
he said on a hilly area
somewhere else in the country.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.950 align:middle line:84%
So what the energy that
was being broadcast

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:52.585 align:middle line:84%
between the two armatures
of the device,

00:10:52.585 --> 00:10:55.988 align:middle line:84%
these two parenthesis shaped
booms, was a form of energy

00:10:55.988 --> 00:11:00.226 align:middle line:84%
that Nikola Tesla discovered
that he called radiant energy

00:11:00.226 --> 00:11:03.496 align:middle line:84%
which is a form of energy
that is latent and pervasive

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:07.967 align:middle line:84%
in the physical universe and
has among its attributes the

00:11:07.967 --> 00:11:11.037 align:middle line:84%
capacity to bend the
fabric of time space.

00:11:11.037 --> 00:11:13.139 align:middle line:84%
And so when the technician
turned on the device

00:11:13.139 --> 00:11:16.475 align:middle line:90%
at my dad's request, what I saw

00:11:16.475 --> 00:11:20.980 align:middle line:84%
between the two booms now
was energy being broadcast

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:22.581 align:middle line:84%
between the two booms
that looked sort

00:11:22.581 --> 00:11:25.684 align:middle line:84%
of like water falling in
a public water sculpture.

00:11:25.684 --> 00:11:30.689 align:middle line:84%
And then when my dad had me
approach the energy field it

00:11:30.689 --> 00:11:33.893 align:middle line:84%
looked like raster on a
TV set, you know the black

00:11:33.893 --> 00:11:36.295 align:middle line:84%
and white snow pattern
on a TV set.

00:11:36.295 --> 00:11:38.364 align:middle line:84%
And I could see that at three
inch intervals there were little

00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:42.134 align:middle line:84%
squiggles of greenish-blue light
that were moving back and forth

00:11:42.134 --> 00:11:46.572 align:middle line:84%
across the field of raster
or radiant energy as it was

00:11:46.572 --> 00:11:48.808 align:middle line:90%
in opposite directions.

00:11:48.808 --> 00:11:51.343 align:middle line:84%
So there were literally
there was radiant energy,

00:11:51.343 --> 00:11:53.979 align:middle line:84%
and there was something
that was affecting

00:11:53.979 --> 00:11:55.881 align:middle line:90%
that field of radiant energy.

00:11:55.881 --> 00:11:57.216 align:middle line:84%
And we did a couple
of rehearsals.

00:11:57.216 --> 00:11:59.085 align:middle line:84%
And my dad grabbed my
hand, and on the count

00:11:59.085 --> 00:12:01.020 align:middle line:90%
of three I essentially leapt

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.655 align:middle line:84%
into the U.S. time
space program.

00:12:02.655 --> 00:12:06.258 align:middle line:84%
Because when we did
so I found us moving

00:12:06.258 --> 00:12:10.629 align:middle line:84%
and then seemingly not moving
at all within the vortal tunnel

00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:13.532 align:middle line:84%
that the radiant energy
produced when it was punched

00:12:13.532 --> 00:12:15.668 align:middle line:84%
into a tunnel as a
result of the inertia

00:12:15.668 --> 00:12:18.637 align:middle line:84%
of us physically jumping
toward the field of energy.

00:12:18.637 --> 00:12:21.574 align:middle line:84%
It looked kind of like
the bluish-white tunnel

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:24.243 align:middle line:84%
that people describe in
the near death experience.

00:12:24.243 --> 00:12:26.345 align:middle line:84%
But I noticed that when I turned
my head rapidly to the left

00:12:26.345 --> 00:12:28.681 align:middle line:90%
or right I could see holograms

00:12:28.681 --> 00:12:30.916 align:middle line:84%
of intervening events
on other time lines.

00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:31.684 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh, interesting.

00:12:31.684 --> 00:12:32.251 align:middle line:90%
>> Bassagio: Flashing by.

00:12:32.251 --> 00:12:33.319 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:12:33.319 --> 00:12:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: So it
was sort of like being

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.021 align:middle line:84%
in an amusement park ride
where you had the sensation

00:12:36.021 --> 00:12:37.223 align:middle line:90%
of movement in the tunnel.

00:12:37.223 --> 00:12:38.824 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And you had
no sensation of fear

00:12:38.824 --> 00:12:40.593 align:middle line:84%
because this was
something your dad was there

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:42.895 align:middle line:90%
and it was just a game almost?

00:12:42.895 --> 00:12:44.697 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: Well, actually,
he said I looked terrified.

00:12:44.697 --> 00:12:45.965 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Really?

00:12:45.965 --> 00:12:46.665 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: He later described
that I looked terrified.

00:12:46.665 --> 00:12:47.833 align:middle line:90%
I was always kind of --

00:12:47.833 --> 00:12:48.968 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Do you
remember feeling terrified?

00:12:48.968 --> 00:12:50.569 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: I was
always kind of stiffening

00:12:50.569 --> 00:12:53.739 align:middle line:84%
up like a young Harry Truman
would in his photographs.

00:12:53.739 --> 00:12:56.008 align:middle line:84%
I was never really
comfortable with the experience

00:12:56.008 --> 00:12:57.376 align:middle line:90%
of going through the tunnel.

00:12:57.376 --> 00:12:59.612 align:middle line:84%
Because the strange thing is
that we were going very rapidly

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:01.247 align:middle line:90%
but also seemingly not at all.

00:13:01.247 --> 00:13:03.282 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So let me
ask you what it felt

00:13:03.282 --> 00:13:04.984 align:middle line:90%
like in your physical body.

00:13:04.984 --> 00:13:08.821 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: It felt like
non-movement movement.

00:13:08.821 --> 00:13:10.222 align:middle line:90%
It was paradoxical.

00:13:10.222 --> 00:13:13.959 align:middle line:84%
I sensed that -- I didn't feel
anything besides a slight sort

00:13:13.959 --> 00:13:16.095 align:middle line:90%
of electromagnetic stimulation.

00:13:16.095 --> 00:13:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And on the first jump I could
see my father's hair kind

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.533 align:middle line:90%
of floating around as a result

00:13:20.533 --> 00:13:22.635 align:middle line:84%
of that electrostatic
energy being

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:26.138 align:middle line:84%
in the tunnel affecting
something that could move,

00:13:26.138 --> 00:13:27.439 align:middle line:84%
something that could
be magnetized

00:13:27.439 --> 00:13:29.842 align:middle line:90%
and then it was free to move.

00:13:29.842 --> 00:13:31.409 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't bring
magnetic metals

00:13:31.409 --> 00:13:33.779 align:middle line:84%
in because they would
also discharge as a result

00:13:33.779 --> 00:13:36.315 align:middle line:84%
of the electrostatic
energy in the tunnel.

00:13:36.315 --> 00:13:37.716 align:middle line:90%
But it was just rather strange.

00:13:37.716 --> 00:13:42.021 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes when I would look
down at the black glassy floor-

00:13:42.021 --> 00:13:44.890 align:middle line:84%
like bottom that was almost like
there was nothing beneath us.

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:47.426 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Dr. Robert Beckwith
was calling this form

00:13:47.426 --> 00:13:50.262 align:middle line:84%
of teleportation
levitated teleportation.

00:13:50.262 --> 00:13:52.264 align:middle line:84%
Because you were
essentially hovering

00:13:52.264 --> 00:13:57.169 align:middle line:84%
in a time space tunnel moving
elsewhere to another point

00:13:57.169 --> 00:13:59.071 align:middle line:90%
on the face of our planet.

00:13:59.071 --> 00:14:01.307 align:middle line:84%
But also essentially what
was going on is the rest

00:14:01.307 --> 00:14:03.509 align:middle line:84%
of the universe was being
wrapped around your ears.

00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:06.679 align:middle line:84%
I mean we were going, but
as a result of the theory

00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:10.149 align:middle line:84%
of relativity, the
performance of that premise,

00:14:10.149 --> 00:14:14.053 align:middle line:84%
that natural trait of
the physical universe,

00:14:14.053 --> 00:14:16.755 align:middle line:84%
we were really going nowhere and
hovering there in the laboratory

00:14:16.755 --> 00:14:20.192 align:middle line:84%
and being readjusted in time
space on the face of our planet

00:14:20.192 --> 00:14:23.362 align:middle line:84%
as a result of the rest of the
universe rushing past our heads.

00:14:23.362 --> 00:14:25.664 align:middle line:84%
So it was kind of like --
I've described how it was kind

00:14:25.664 --> 00:14:28.200 align:middle line:84%
of like going through the
Lincoln Tunnel without a car

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.069 align:middle line:90%
at 10,000 miles per hour.

00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:31.637 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay, that's
a good description.

00:14:31.637 --> 00:14:32.638 align:middle line:90%
So what happened?

00:14:32.638 --> 00:14:34.039 align:middle line:84%
Where did you land
on the other side?

00:14:34.039 --> 00:14:35.908 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: Well, what would
happen is we would see a small

00:14:35.908 --> 00:14:38.911 align:middle line:84%
little pinprick of
light in the distance,

00:14:38.911 --> 00:14:41.247 align:middle line:84%
and that would suddenly
get much larger,

00:14:41.247 --> 00:14:43.782 align:middle line:84%
and that was the tunnel
basically closing.

00:14:43.782 --> 00:14:45.951 align:middle line:84%
So we were seeing a little bit
of sunlight at the destination

00:14:45.951 --> 00:14:49.321 align:middle line:84%
which was always the State
Capital grounds of New Mexico

00:14:49.321 --> 00:14:51.323 align:middle line:90%
in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

00:14:51.323 --> 00:14:54.793 align:middle line:84%
And so the tunnel closed and
I found footfall in this sort

00:14:54.793 --> 00:14:57.863 align:middle line:84%
of hilly city that
my dad described.

00:14:57.863 --> 00:15:00.399 align:middle line:84%
You know the Santa Fe
State Capital ground

00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:02.601 align:middle line:84%
where you have kind of a
hodgepodge of elevations,

00:15:02.601 --> 00:15:05.204 align:middle line:84%
different eras of
buildings and so forth.

00:15:05.204 --> 00:15:08.474 align:middle line:84%
I later learned that they used
Santa Fe in a public arrival

00:15:08.474 --> 00:15:11.477 align:middle line:84%
like that because they
didn't want to inform anybody

00:15:11.477 --> 00:15:13.178 align:middle line:90%
at the Los Alamos National Labs

00:15:13.178 --> 00:15:14.647 align:middle line:84%
where there was a
Soviet spy ring

00:15:14.647 --> 00:15:17.549 align:middle line:84%
that we had achieved
physical teleportation.

00:15:17.549 --> 00:15:20.986 align:middle line:84%
And also they didn't want it
to become a military secret by,

00:15:20.986 --> 00:15:23.622 align:middle line:84%
for example, having us
arrive military bases.

00:15:23.622 --> 00:15:27.793 align:middle line:84%
So they had literally selected
a kind of a secluded area

00:15:27.793 --> 00:15:30.296 align:middle line:84%
of the State Capital complex
there in Santa Fe for us

00:15:30.296 --> 00:15:31.697 align:middle line:90%
to just pop into view.

00:15:31.697 --> 00:15:33.799 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So you and your dad
popped in, and I assume others,

00:15:33.799 --> 00:15:35.801 align:middle line:84%
but for the sake of
this conversation you

00:15:35.801 --> 00:15:38.370 align:middle line:84%
and your dad popped into
view in a public place

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:40.272 align:middle line:90%
in front of a public building?

00:15:40.272 --> 00:15:41.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Bassagio: Yes.

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.575 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, not only was my
arrival just suddenly popped

00:15:43.575 --> 00:15:47.346 align:middle line:84%
into view were sometimes not
only witnessed, but when I went

00:15:47.346 --> 00:15:51.784 align:middle line:84%
on my first of three major fact
finding trips to New Mexico

00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:53.085 align:middle line:90%
to retrace my experiences

00:15:53.085 --> 00:15:57.790 align:middle line:84%
in Project Pegasus
I asked a waitress

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:01.560 align:middle line:84%
at the Mine Shaft Tavern
Restaurant in Madrid,

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.563 align:middle line:84%
New Mexico, and I said did
you ever hear any stories

00:16:04.563 --> 00:16:08.300 align:middle line:84%
when you were growing up here
of children suddenly popping

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:11.303 align:middle line:84%
into view up at the
State Capital complex.

00:16:11.303 --> 00:16:15.474 align:middle line:84%
And she described that she had
been born in Santa Fe and grown

00:16:15.474 --> 00:16:20.012 align:middle line:84%
up in Madrid, but that when she
entered kindergarten in Santa Fe

00:16:20.012 --> 00:16:23.682 align:middle line:84%
at age five in 1974 which
was literally two years

00:16:23.682 --> 00:16:26.985 align:middle line:84%
after I left Project Pegasus
that she heard the stories

00:16:26.985 --> 00:16:29.355 align:middle line:84%
of children suddenly appearing
in the State Capital complex.

00:16:29.355 --> 00:16:31.523 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to say I
was one of those kids.

00:16:31.523 --> 00:16:33.992 align:middle line:84%
We were in a teleportation
project under DARPA,

00:16:33.992 --> 00:16:35.260 align:middle line:90%
and we were physically arriving.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.329 align:middle line:84%
And there was nothing
extraordinary --

00:16:37.329 --> 00:16:38.697 align:middle line:84%
well, there is something
extraordinary about it,

00:16:38.697 --> 00:16:41.200 align:middle line:84%
but it wasn't magic,
it was high technology.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.735 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So you
were actually jumping

00:16:42.735 --> 00:16:44.236 align:middle line:90%
in location but not in time.

00:16:44.236 --> 00:16:47.673 align:middle line:84%
You were jumping into
the same time frame?

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:50.275 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: Initially we
were arriving in real time.

00:16:50.275 --> 00:16:52.244 align:middle line:84%
So if we jumped through the
Tesla device in Wood-Ridge,

00:16:52.244 --> 00:16:55.114 align:middle line:84%
New Jersey at 10
a.m. and got there

00:16:55.114 --> 00:16:57.483 align:middle line:84%
in several seconds it
was 8 a.m. in Santa Fe.

00:16:57.483 --> 00:16:59.985 align:middle line:84%
You could see state office
workers coming to work

00:16:59.985 --> 00:17:01.453 align:middle line:90%
in the morning and so forth.

00:17:01.453 --> 00:17:05.390 align:middle line:84%
However, after doing many jumps
with my classmates who were

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:11.563 align:middle line:84%
in the project in the summer of
1970, by fall of 1970 we noticed

00:17:11.563 --> 00:17:13.499 align:middle line:84%
that we would spend the
whole day in New Mexico

00:17:13.499 --> 00:17:16.534 align:middle line:84%
until night fell, but then
when we would arrive back

00:17:16.534 --> 00:17:18.771 align:middle line:84%
on the tarmac at
Curtiss-Wright in Wood-Ridge,

00:17:18.771 --> 00:17:22.975 align:middle line:84%
New Jersey it would be, let's
say, 10:30 in the morning

00:17:22.975 --> 00:17:26.345 align:middle line:84%
so that they were adjusting the
device to bring us back in time,

00:17:26.345 --> 00:17:29.448 align:middle line:84%
basically time travel to
the past when we arrived

00:17:29.448 --> 00:17:32.918 align:middle line:84%
on the east coast right back
at our point of embarkation

00:17:32.918 --> 00:17:34.887 align:middle line:90%
by Tesla teleportation.

00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:36.789 align:middle line:84%
So we asked some of
the facilitators there

00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:38.957 align:middle line:84%
at Curtiss-Wright are you
putting us back in time?

00:17:38.957 --> 00:17:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And they acknowledged
that they were.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:44.163 align:middle line:84%
And so we said there in
fall of 70 how far back

00:17:44.163 --> 00:17:45.798 align:middle line:90%
in the past can you send us?

00:17:45.798 --> 00:17:51.203 align:middle line:84%
And they said at this point
we're only sending you back 12

00:17:51.203 --> 00:17:55.707 align:middle line:84%
hours because you have
to jump back to the past

00:17:55.707 --> 00:17:57.476 align:middle line:90%
and still arrive at a time

00:17:57.476 --> 00:17:59.578 align:middle line:84%
after the development
of teleportation.

00:17:59.578 --> 00:18:02.414 align:middle line:84%
Because as we begin to do
this regularly we don't want

00:18:02.414 --> 00:18:03.916 align:middle line:90%
to strand you in the past.

00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:05.918 align:middle line:90%
And that was a limitation

00:18:05.918 --> 00:18:08.554 align:middle line:84%
of physical teleportation
via that device.

00:18:08.554 --> 00:18:10.722 align:middle line:84%
So another thing that
was occurring to control

00:18:10.722 --> 00:18:13.859 align:middle line:84%
for that displacement problem
was they were developing

00:18:13.859 --> 00:18:16.628 align:middle line:84%
chronovisors that would
propagate holograms of past

00:18:16.628 --> 00:18:20.099 align:middle line:84%
and future events where when the
hologram collapsed we were back

00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:21.700 align:middle line:84%
on the stage of the
device in real time.

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.669 align:middle line:84%
And they were also
developing other forms

00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:26.405 align:middle line:84%
of physical time travel
which I was involved

00:18:26.405 --> 00:18:29.374 align:middle line:84%
in including a technology
called plasma confinement.

00:18:29.374 --> 00:18:30.642 align:middle line:90%
Where you were imbedded

00:18:30.642 --> 00:18:33.445 align:middle line:84%
in usually a past event
rather than a future one.

00:18:33.445 --> 00:18:35.614 align:middle line:84%
And with the future, of
course, you can jump back

00:18:35.614 --> 00:18:37.850 align:middle line:84%
through a stargate, through
a teleporter and come home

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:40.919 align:middle line:84%
because time travel
technology defines the technical

00:18:40.919 --> 00:18:42.087 align:middle line:90%
infrastructure of the future.

00:18:42.087 --> 00:18:43.489 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: The future, yes, yes.

00:18:43.489 --> 00:18:44.857 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: But in the case of
all the time travel to the past

00:18:44.857 --> 00:18:48.260 align:middle line:84%
that we were doing they were
actively developing technologies

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.096 align:middle line:84%
where you were essentially
imbedded in a past event,

00:18:51.096 --> 00:18:55.334 align:middle line:84%
and when that localized quantum
field effect wore off you then

00:18:55.334 --> 00:18:56.902 align:middle line:84%
spontaneously found
yourself back

00:18:56.902 --> 00:18:59.505 align:middle line:90%
in the laboratory in real time.

00:18:59.505 --> 00:19:00.939 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You went
both directions.

00:19:00.939 --> 00:19:02.174 align:middle line:90%
>> Bassagio: Correct.

00:19:02.174 --> 00:19:04.042 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay, let's first
talk about before we go

00:19:04.042 --> 00:19:07.146 align:middle line:84%
into the plasma confinement
center and all that that brings

00:19:07.146 --> 00:19:09.781 align:middle line:90%
to the story, jump forward.

00:19:09.781 --> 00:19:11.683 align:middle line:84%
What you would have been
used for, for example,

00:19:11.683 --> 00:19:14.086 align:middle line:90%
in a jump forward in time.

00:19:14.086 --> 00:19:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: Well, in
a jump forward in time

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.322 align:middle line:84%
when I was taking the stargate
from Sirius,

00:19:17.322 --> 00:19:24.062 align:middle line:84%
New Mexico in 1972 to a Project
Pegasus intelligence base

00:19:24.062 --> 00:19:25.464 align:middle line:90%
in the year 2045.

00:19:25.464 --> 00:19:27.399 align:middle line:90%
I was being used as an errand.

00:19:27.399 --> 00:19:30.202 align:middle line:84%
And people always ask me,
well, what was 2045 like?

00:19:30.202 --> 00:19:35.807 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, it was about
taking a stargate to the plaza

00:19:35.807 --> 00:19:40.145 align:middle line:84%
of an industrial park, walking
into a beautiful emerald green

00:19:40.145 --> 00:19:42.814 align:middle line:84%
and tungsten steel building
that was all white inside

00:19:42.814 --> 00:19:45.384 align:middle line:84%
with all these houseplants,
meeting with several people

00:19:45.384 --> 00:19:47.586 align:middle line:84%
from the project
who were the age

00:19:47.586 --> 00:19:50.255 align:middle line:84%
that my great grandchildren
will be

00:19:50.255 --> 00:19:55.093 align:middle line:84%
or essentially the next couple
generations forward in time.

00:19:55.093 --> 00:19:59.865 align:middle line:84%
Meeting with them, being given
a little canister with microfilm

00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:02.935 align:middle line:84%
in it that contained
historical summaries of events

00:20:02.935 --> 00:20:05.737 align:middle line:84%
that will take place on our
time line between the 1970s

00:20:05.737 --> 00:20:09.541 align:middle line:84%
and the 2040s, being directed
to a teleportation unit

00:20:09.541 --> 00:20:13.211 align:middle line:84%
that was recessed invisibly into
the wall of a conference room,

00:20:13.211 --> 00:20:16.381 align:middle line:84%
and again taking a vortal
tunnel back to my point

00:20:16.381 --> 00:20:18.617 align:middle line:84%
of embarkation in
the past in 1972.

00:20:18.617 --> 00:20:21.987 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we were
arriving in the vicinity

00:20:21.987 --> 00:20:29.194 align:middle line:84%
of the microwave tower array
near the continental divide

00:20:29.194 --> 00:20:30.996 align:middle line:84%
north of Pagosa Springs,
Colorado,

00:20:30.996 --> 00:20:33.799 align:middle line:84%
the so called Lobo Overlook
site where there's an array

00:20:33.799 --> 00:20:37.603 align:middle line:84%
of microwave towers that are
now called basically Montauk

00:20:37.603 --> 00:20:41.440 align:middle line:84%
Southwest by individuals like
myself and the time travel team.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.076 align:middle line:84%
Because now it's
100 antennae, not 5.

00:20:44.076 --> 00:20:48.480 align:middle line:84%
But what we were told that those
microwave towers were doing was

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:52.250 align:middle line:84%
pinging microwave
into the cosmos

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:54.886 align:middle line:84%
so that the project personnel
in the future could identify

00:20:54.886 --> 00:20:58.056 align:middle line:84%
where the past was that we
needed to be teleported back to.

00:20:58.056 --> 00:20:59.324 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Interesting,
like a marker.

00:20:59.324 --> 00:21:01.994 align:middle line:84%
Okay, I'd be remiss if I
didn't ask you were you privy

00:21:01.994 --> 00:21:06.331 align:middle line:84%
to the information that was
transferred via the microfilm

00:21:06.331 --> 00:21:09.201 align:middle line:84%
or whatnot of events
to transpire

00:21:09.201 --> 00:21:11.403 align:middle line:90%
between that time and 2045?

00:21:11.403 --> 00:21:12.704 align:middle line:90%
>> Bassagio: No.

00:21:12.704 --> 00:21:14.206 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Project Pegasus was
primarily an intelligence

00:21:14.206 --> 00:21:17.209 align:middle line:90%
gathering project to enable --

00:21:17.209 --> 00:21:19.544 align:middle line:84%
as a result of the U.S.
government acquiring better

00:21:19.544 --> 00:21:23.782 align:middle line:84%
information about past events
and future events they hoped

00:21:23.782 --> 00:21:26.218 align:middle line:84%
to be able to perform
better contingency planning

00:21:26.218 --> 00:21:28.186 align:middle line:90%
for present and future events.

00:21:28.186 --> 00:21:30.956 align:middle line:84%
And so because it was
an intelligence project

00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:33.725 align:middle line:84%
under CIA ultimately, certain
intelligence reports were being

00:21:33.725 --> 00:21:37.329 align:middle line:84%
promulgated about what the U.S.
chrononaut corps was reporting

00:21:37.329 --> 00:21:39.097 align:middle line:84%
about the past and
future event scenarios

00:21:39.097 --> 00:21:40.565 align:middle line:90%
that they were sent to.

00:21:40.565 --> 00:21:43.635 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have a need to know
what was on that microfilm.

00:21:43.635 --> 00:21:44.903 align:middle line:84%
We were shown during
out training

00:21:44.903 --> 00:21:47.873 align:middle line:84%
that those tiny little
ChapStick sized canisters had

00:21:47.873 --> 00:21:51.043 align:middle line:84%
about 600 feet of
microwave in them.

00:21:51.043 --> 00:21:56.081 align:middle line:84%
And that trainer basically took
that 600 feet out and dropped it

00:21:56.081 --> 00:21:58.383 align:middle line:84%
at his feet and showed us how
much information we were taking

00:21:58.383 --> 00:21:59.851 align:middle line:90%
back to the present.

00:21:59.851 --> 00:22:01.753 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: What were
you able to glean just

00:22:01.753 --> 00:22:04.256 align:middle line:84%
from your surroundings
and you were able

00:22:04.256 --> 00:22:05.991 align:middle line:90%
to observe of that time?

00:22:05.991 --> 00:22:07.726 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: Well, because
I was my father's son,

00:22:07.726 --> 00:22:10.462 align:middle line:84%
and he was essentially quantum
displaced for eight years

00:22:10.462 --> 00:22:13.932 align:middle line:84%
in New Mexico, so that when he
died chronologically at age 66

00:22:13.932 --> 00:22:17.102 align:middle line:84%
in 1990 he was actually
74 biologically,

00:22:17.102 --> 00:22:19.738 align:middle line:84%
where they were jumping him to
New Mexico, he was living there

00:22:19.738 --> 00:22:22.140 align:middle line:84%
for days, weeks,
months and even years

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:23.208 align:middle line:90%
and then being jumped back--

00:22:23.208 --> 00:22:25.777 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Did he
disappear from your life

00:22:25.777 --> 00:22:27.012 align:middle line:90%
for those periods of time?

00:22:27.012 --> 00:22:28.146 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: No, no because
they were just like --

00:22:28.146 --> 00:22:29.348 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It was time
collapse, I mean yeah.

00:22:29.348 --> 00:22:30.849 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: They were
collapsing the time loops

00:22:30.849 --> 00:22:32.317 align:middle line:90%
by having us stay in New Mexico,

00:22:32.317 --> 00:22:35.754 align:middle line:84%
and then they would jump us
back not just to New Jersey

00:22:35.754 --> 00:22:38.356 align:middle line:84%
but New Jersey on the day
we had originally jumped.

00:22:38.356 --> 00:22:40.258 align:middle line:84%
So that we were all
basically participating

00:22:40.258 --> 00:22:43.662 align:middle line:84%
in these secret time loops that
were actually being collapsed.

00:22:43.662 --> 00:22:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So let's
talk about 2045

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:46.898 align:middle line:90%
for a second before we move on.

00:22:46.898 --> 00:22:48.800 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us about
what you --

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.269 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: Well, 2045,
I mean there is a 2045.

00:22:51.269 --> 00:22:52.437 align:middle line:84%
The world is not
destroyed by then.

00:22:52.437 --> 00:22:53.972 align:middle line:90%
And in that location

00:22:53.972 --> 00:22:58.844 align:middle line:84%
in the American Southwest
the people looked healthy.

00:22:58.844 --> 00:23:00.746 align:middle line:84%
The young people looked
taller and thinner.

00:23:00.746 --> 00:23:02.681 align:middle line:84%
I think we're actually
seeing that in society.

00:23:02.681 --> 00:23:04.416 align:middle line:84%
Some of today's young
people look

00:23:04.416 --> 00:23:08.553 align:middle line:84%
at lot more spindly
physiologically

00:23:08.553 --> 00:23:10.088 align:middle line:90%
than previous generations.

00:23:10.088 --> 00:23:11.256 align:middle line:90%
There's a different look.

00:23:11.256 --> 00:23:14.659 align:middle line:84%
I call it the avatar
effect of better prenatal

00:23:14.659 --> 00:23:18.029 align:middle line:84%
and neonatal care, better
nutrition, the elimination

00:23:18.029 --> 00:23:20.699 align:middle line:84%
of toxic substances
from our environment,

00:23:20.699 --> 00:23:23.935 align:middle line:84%
the use of positive
energies to promote wellness

00:23:23.935 --> 00:23:25.237 align:middle line:90%
in the next generation.

00:23:25.237 --> 00:23:27.973 align:middle line:84%
Our grandchildren's general
is going to be healthier.

00:23:27.973 --> 00:23:30.342 align:middle line:84%
The environment looked
a little wetter

00:23:30.342 --> 00:23:31.476 align:middle line:90%
in the American Southwest.

00:23:31.476 --> 00:23:33.211 align:middle line:84%
We were never told where
they were sending us.

00:23:33.211 --> 00:23:37.315 align:middle line:84%
But if we were to presuppose it
was some relatively uninhabited

00:23:37.315 --> 00:23:42.554 align:middle line:84%
area outside of a city in the
southwest, a Santa Fe, a Tucson,

00:23:42.554 --> 00:23:45.791 align:middle line:84%
a Flagstaff, it seemed a
little bit more temperate

00:23:45.791 --> 00:23:48.560 align:middle line:84%
than I had encountered in
the American Southwest.

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.328 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Interesting because
it certainly has been wetter

00:23:50.328 --> 00:23:52.864 align:middle line:84%
in the last couple of
years interestingly.

00:23:52.864 --> 00:23:54.266 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: Yeah, it
seemed a little bit closer

00:23:54.266 --> 00:23:56.301 align:middle line:84%
to the New Jersey I had grown up
in, a little bit more temperate

00:23:56.301 --> 00:23:58.937 align:middle line:90%
and a little bit more rain.

00:23:58.937 --> 00:24:02.274 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of bringing
that information back I know

00:24:02.274 --> 00:24:04.676 align:middle line:84%
that Project Pegasus was
furnishing the U.S. Department

00:24:04.676 --> 00:24:07.579 align:middle line:84%
of Defense with a
history of the future.

00:24:07.579 --> 00:24:09.681 align:middle line:84%
But I only learned about what
some of those events were

00:24:09.681 --> 00:24:12.884 align:middle line:84%
that they knew of as a result
of the time space program,

00:24:12.884 --> 00:24:16.488 align:middle line:84%
as a result of being my father's
son and spending so much time

00:24:16.488 --> 00:24:19.324 align:middle line:84%
with him in New Mexico
before jumping back.

00:24:19.324 --> 00:24:21.226 align:middle line:84%
And also going so far
down the rabbit hole

00:24:21.226 --> 00:24:22.761 align:middle line:84%
that there would even
be a reason for me

00:24:22.761 --> 00:24:26.264 align:middle line:84%
to be quantum displaced in New
Mexico and in my dad's company.

00:24:26.264 --> 00:24:30.902 align:middle line:84%
Where I frequently went to lunch
and dinner with his colleagues,

00:24:30.902 --> 00:24:34.105 align:middle line:84%
typically at the La Hacienda
or La Placita Restaurants

00:24:34.105 --> 00:24:37.943 align:middle line:84%
which were then and to some
extent still are the most

00:24:37.943 --> 00:24:40.312 align:middle line:84%
favorite Mexican restaurants
in all of New Mexico.

00:24:40.312 --> 00:24:41.913 align:middle line:84%
So if there were
distinguished officials there

00:24:41.913 --> 00:24:45.784 align:middle line:84%
from Washington frequently we
would have these group dinners

00:24:45.784 --> 00:24:48.119 align:middle line:84%
at those restaurants in
Old Town Albuquerque.

00:24:48.119 --> 00:24:50.021 align:middle line:84%
And what I learned is
that they were aware

00:24:50.021 --> 00:24:52.490 align:middle line:84%
of specific events
and conditions.

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:55.393 align:middle line:84%
They included, let's see from
memory here that I can recall,

00:24:55.393 --> 00:24:58.530 align:middle line:84%
they knew about the
resignation of President Nixon

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:00.298 align:middle line:90%
in a scandal called Watergate.

00:25:00.298 --> 00:25:03.068 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And this was a
few years prior to the event.

00:25:03.068 --> 00:25:04.236 align:middle line:90%
>> Bassagio: Yes.

00:25:04.236 --> 00:25:06.504 align:middle line:84%
They knew about the
emergence of the internet.

00:25:06.504 --> 00:25:10.175 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I listened to John
McCone, a former director

00:25:10.175 --> 00:25:11.810 align:middle line:84%
of the Central Intelligence
Agency at one

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:15.547 align:middle line:84%
of those restaurants, describe
to my father what the internet.

00:25:15.547 --> 00:25:18.049 align:middle line:84%
I remember how he
said, well Ray,

00:25:18.049 --> 00:25:19.284 align:middle line:90%
the internet is the fulfillment

00:25:19.284 --> 00:25:21.453 align:middle line:84%
of Vannevar Bush's
primary fundamental.

00:25:21.453 --> 00:25:24.289 align:middle line:84%
It's a global information
network.

00:25:24.289 --> 00:25:27.325 align:middle line:84%
And the individual
communicating on that network

00:25:27.325 --> 00:25:31.763 align:middle line:84%
of people throughout the world
that they want to communicate

00:25:31.763 --> 00:25:34.499 align:middle line:84%
with sits at a keyboard
like the rudimentary ones

00:25:34.499 --> 00:25:37.502 align:middle line:84%
that have already emerged in
our electronic typewriters,

00:25:37.502 --> 00:25:41.239 align:middle line:84%
and they look at a simple
video display terminal.

00:25:41.239 --> 00:25:45.343 align:middle line:84%
And by doing so they can
communicate with anybody

00:25:45.343 --> 00:25:47.145 align:middle line:84%
in the world who is on
the system at that time.

00:25:47.145 --> 00:25:50.782 align:middle line:84%
And then they started talking
about the stems, the suffixes

00:25:50.782 --> 00:25:54.152 align:middle line:84%
and the destinations,
dot com, dot net,

00:25:54.152 --> 00:25:56.054 align:middle line:90%
dot info, dot edu and so forth.

00:25:56.054 --> 00:26:00.191 align:middle line:84%
And my dad asked John McCone who
literally had been the director

00:26:00.191 --> 00:26:02.394 align:middle line:84%
of Central Intelligence for
four years of the early 60s,

00:26:02.394 --> 00:26:04.329 align:middle line:84%
four very eventful
years from 1960

00:26:04.329 --> 00:26:07.165 align:middle line:84%
to 64 right before
essentially being one of sort

00:26:07.165 --> 00:26:09.401 align:middle line:84%
of the pipe smokers,
one of the scholars

00:26:09.401 --> 00:26:12.203 align:middle line:84%
in the intelligence community
who were both promulgating

00:26:12.203 --> 00:26:14.739 align:middle line:84%
and reading the intelligence
reports about the past

00:26:14.739 --> 00:26:17.809 align:middle line:84%
and future that resulted from
the debriefings of individuals

00:26:17.809 --> 00:26:20.679 align:middle line:84%
like me who they were sending
to the past and future.

00:26:20.679 --> 00:26:24.649 align:middle line:84%
And my dad said, well, what
about this dot com suffix.

00:26:24.649 --> 00:26:29.321 align:middle line:84%
And John Alexander McCone,
everybody was calling him Alec

00:26:29.321 --> 00:26:32.357 align:middle line:84%
or Alex, all of the
project people I remember,

00:26:32.357 --> 00:26:35.994 align:middle line:84%
and he was actually
smoking a pipe.

00:26:35.994 --> 00:26:37.996 align:middle line:90%
And he said to my dad, well,

00:26:37.996 --> 00:26:40.098 align:middle line:84%
Ray that's just a
destination on the system.

00:26:40.098 --> 00:26:41.199 align:middle line:90%
It just means communication.

00:26:41.199 --> 00:26:43.335 align:middle line:84%
And my dad got up from
the table and said,

00:26:43.335 --> 00:26:44.536 align:middle line:90%
well, how do we know that?

00:26:44.536 --> 00:26:47.172 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it means the commies
have taken over by then.

00:26:47.172 --> 00:26:50.642 align:middle line:84%
So I think that anecdote kind
of puts an insight into the fact

00:26:50.642 --> 00:26:54.312 align:middle line:84%
that as a result of starting to
send children and adults to past

00:26:54.312 --> 00:26:55.981 align:middle line:90%
and future events

00:26:55.981 --> 00:26:58.350 align:middle line:84%
and promulgating these
one-off holograms of past

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:01.186 align:middle line:84%
and future events, the
project principles were

00:27:01.186 --> 00:27:02.520 align:middle line:90%
by no means omniscient about,

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.589 align:middle line:84%
for example, what
the future held.

00:27:04.589 --> 00:27:08.460 align:middle line:84%
But in addition to the Nixon
resignation and the internet,

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:11.796 align:middle line:84%
9/11 was openly discussed in
front of me at different meals

00:27:11.796 --> 00:27:13.131 align:middle line:84%
that we took with
the project people.

00:27:13.131 --> 00:27:14.265 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And this
was in the 60s?

00:27:14.265 --> 00:27:15.667 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: This
would be early 70s.

00:27:15.667 --> 00:27:16.668 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Early 70s.

00:27:16.668 --> 00:27:17.435 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: In fact,
my dad and I --

00:27:17.435 --> 00:27:18.503 align:middle line:90%
well, my father was called

00:27:18.503 --> 00:27:21.139 align:middle line:84%
down to the Aerojet
Corporation facility

00:27:21.139 --> 00:27:23.808 align:middle line:84%
that then existed
immediately adjacent

00:27:23.808 --> 00:27:26.444 align:middle line:84%
to the New Mexico Institute
of Science and Technology

00:27:26.444 --> 00:27:28.713 align:middle line:90%
and Socorro, New Mexico.

00:27:28.713 --> 00:27:31.649 align:middle line:84%
And we viewed about
a 20 second film loop

00:27:31.649 --> 00:27:34.486 align:middle line:84%
that had been retrieved from
the future, I don't know

00:27:34.486 --> 00:27:37.088 align:middle line:84%
by what means, of one of
the planes hitting one

00:27:37.088 --> 00:27:38.723 align:middle line:90%
of the Twin Towers on 9/11.

00:27:38.723 --> 00:27:41.192 align:middle line:84%
And then there were times
when we would be at a meal,

00:27:41.192 --> 00:27:44.062 align:middle line:84%
particularly lunchtime,
and some of the individuals

00:27:44.062 --> 00:27:47.432 align:middle line:84%
who were being let into fewer
of the secrets about the future

00:27:47.432 --> 00:27:49.634 align:middle line:90%
that the project was collecting,

00:27:49.634 --> 00:27:52.370 align:middle line:84%
would sort of inveigh upon
my dad to reveal what he knew

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:54.606 align:middle line:84%
as one of the senior
project people.

00:27:54.606 --> 00:27:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And so the 9/11 event was
discussed openly in my presence

00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:02.847 align:middle line:84%
in the early 70s when I was
a child on Project Pegasus.

00:28:02.847 --> 00:28:06.217 align:middle line:84%
I know they knew about
the emergence of AIDS,

00:28:06.217 --> 00:28:09.054 align:middle line:84%
HIV/AIDS as at least a
potentially venereally

00:28:09.054 --> 00:28:13.391 align:middle line:84%
transmitted disease,
a new public disease.

00:28:13.391 --> 00:28:18.363 align:middle line:84%
I know that they knew about
widespread cell phone use.

00:28:18.363 --> 00:28:20.231 align:middle line:84%
Because in a later
discussion when I was no longer

00:28:20.231 --> 00:28:23.501 align:middle line:84%
on the project my dad said,
well, mobile phones are going

00:28:23.501 --> 00:28:24.436 align:middle line:90%
to become very popular.

00:28:24.436 --> 00:28:25.837 align:middle line:84%
And I said how did
you learn that?

00:28:25.837 --> 00:28:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, we would just
tune in an ordinary street scene

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:31.209 align:middle line:84%
in any major city in the
country and we saw all of you

00:28:31.209 --> 00:28:32.277 align:middle line:90%
in the future walking

00:28:32.277 --> 00:28:34.145 align:middle line:84%
around with these
little walkie talkies.

00:28:34.145 --> 00:28:37.182 align:middle line:84%
So they knew about the fact that
the world would be connected

00:28:37.182 --> 00:28:39.150 align:middle line:84%
with handheld communication
devices and that

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:43.421 align:middle line:84%
that would speed human progress
and some basic events like that.

00:28:43.421 --> 00:28:47.592 align:middle line:84%
They were actively identifying
and briefing future presidents

00:28:47.592 --> 00:28:48.993 align:middle line:90%
of their destinies as president.

00:28:48.993 --> 00:28:51.629 align:middle line:84%
I remember one lunch that
the Bush family was out,

00:28:51.629 --> 00:28:56.401 align:middle line:84%
both George H.W. Bush, his wife,
Barbara, and son George W. Bush,

00:28:56.401 --> 00:28:58.870 align:middle line:84%
and George W. Bush was
going around to the tables

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:00.572 align:middle line:84%
that the project people
were at, and he said right

00:29:00.572 --> 00:29:03.541 align:middle line:84%
in my face basically have you
heard my daddy and I are going

00:29:03.541 --> 00:29:06.010 align:middle line:90%
to be president, ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:07.745 align:middle line:84%
So here we had the
Bush family aware.

00:29:07.745 --> 00:29:08.713 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And he
was a kid still.

00:29:08.713 --> 00:29:10.682 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: He was
about 24, 25.

00:29:10.682 --> 00:29:12.550 align:middle line:84%
I must have been
about 9, 10 years old.

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:13.485 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And his
dad hasn't come

00:29:13.485 --> 00:29:14.786 align:middle line:90%
into that position then yet.

00:29:14.786 --> 00:29:16.955 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: So his father
had run for Senate in Texas

00:29:16.955 --> 00:29:20.792 align:middle line:84%
in the late 60s but had not
yet run for the House seat

00:29:20.792 --> 00:29:24.762 align:middle line:84%
in Houston at that time and
had not yet served as director

00:29:24.762 --> 00:29:26.097 align:middle line:90%
of Central Intelligence.

00:29:26.097 --> 00:29:29.033 align:middle line:90%
Then there was another lunch

00:29:29.033 --> 00:29:32.003 align:middle line:84%
where a young Georgetown student
named William Clinton was

00:29:32.003 --> 00:29:33.471 align:middle line:84%
present sitting right
next to me.

00:29:33.471 --> 00:29:37.775 align:middle line:84%
And he apparently had just been
told of his destiny as president

00:29:37.775 --> 00:29:40.011 align:middle line:84%
because after the
introductions were told --

00:29:40.011 --> 00:29:42.180 align:middle line:84%
actually let me just
say that sitting next

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:46.117 align:middle line:84%
to Mr. Clinton was the
project administrator

00:29:46.117 --> 00:29:48.520 align:middle line:84%
of Project Pegasus,
Harold M. Agnew,

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:51.389 align:middle line:84%
one of the Manhattan Project
physicists who was then by them

00:29:51.389 --> 00:29:55.226 align:middle line:84%
or would be destined to become
the director of Los Alamos Labs.

00:29:55.226 --> 00:29:57.862 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Iben Browning, the director
of science and technology

00:29:57.862 --> 00:29:59.898 align:middle line:90%
for CIA was at that lunch.

00:29:59.898 --> 00:30:02.167 align:middle line:84%
And then my father and his
colleague Joseph Connison

00:30:02.167 --> 00:30:03.968 align:middle line:84%
from Parsons,
and I was sitting

00:30:03.968 --> 00:30:06.271 align:middle line:90%
over on Mr. Clinton's right.

00:30:06.271 --> 00:30:07.205 align:middle line:90%
And one of the comments --

00:30:07.205 --> 00:30:08.740 align:middle line:84%
I remember getting
a very good vibe

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:10.141 align:middle line:84%
from Bill Clinton
as a young man.

00:30:10.141 --> 00:30:12.810 align:middle line:84%
I felt that he was good
natured, intelligent

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:14.212 align:middle line:90%
and had a great sense of humor.

00:30:14.212 --> 00:30:18.750 align:middle line:84%
He was very sort of buoyant and
I could pick that up as a child.

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:21.786 align:middle line:84%
And I remember that
he said, well, fellas,

00:30:21.786 --> 00:30:26.591 align:middle line:84%
I know that you all work for
the atomic research community,

00:30:26.591 --> 00:30:28.726 align:middle line:84%
and I know that you do
things like the design

00:30:28.726 --> 00:30:32.030 align:middle line:84%
of more effective nuclear
weapons all the time,

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:34.766 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes, you know, when
you tell me this I think,

00:30:34.766 --> 00:30:37.535 align:middle line:84%
you know, me Bill Clinton,
President of the United States,

00:30:37.535 --> 00:30:39.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, fellas, that
dog don't hunt.

00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:42.941 align:middle line:84%
So this was a young Bill
Clinton probably not yet out

00:30:42.941 --> 00:30:46.277 align:middle line:84%
of Georgetown grappling with
his destiny as President

00:30:46.277 --> 00:30:49.314 align:middle line:84%
of the United States, Commander
in Chief of the U.S. Military,

00:30:49.314 --> 00:30:52.250 align:middle line:84%
Chief Executive and leader
of the free world as it were.

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:55.186 align:middle line:84%
The same kind of shocking
information that had been given

00:30:55.186 --> 00:30:56.788 align:middle line:90%
to Mr. Bush, both Bushes.

00:30:56.788 --> 00:30:59.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Both Bushes,
yes, interesting.

00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:03.127 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: So on the threshold
of playing God and trying

00:31:03.127 --> 00:31:06.497 align:middle line:84%
to influence the future as a
result of gathering information

00:31:06.497 --> 00:31:09.400 align:middle line:84%
about the past as it really
happened and the future

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:13.171 align:middle line:84%
as it was destined to happen,
they clearly made a decision

00:31:13.171 --> 00:31:14.906 align:middle line:84%
to push the advantage
a little bit

00:31:14.906 --> 00:31:17.675 align:middle line:84%
and brief future presidents
of their destinies.

00:31:17.675 --> 00:31:21.746 align:middle line:84%
And I was even briefed of my
future presidential destiny

00:31:21.746 --> 00:31:25.383 align:middle line:84%
in the summer of 1980 when I
was 19 years old going on 20.

00:31:25.383 --> 00:31:26.985 align:middle line:84%
So the American people
deserve to know this

00:31:26.985 --> 00:31:28.720 align:middle line:90%
because surely the framers

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:32.724 align:middle line:84%
of the U.S. Constitution
could not anticipate their

00:31:32.724 --> 00:31:35.593 align:middle line:84%
constitutional framework for
selecting their president

00:31:35.593 --> 00:31:38.162 align:middle line:84%
to have been undermined
by time travel.

00:31:38.162 --> 00:31:38.963 align:middle line:90%
But it has to.

00:31:38.963 --> 00:31:40.365 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah, no kidding.

00:31:40.365 --> 00:31:45.737 align:middle line:84%
Okay. And that I find a really
fascinating part of your work.

00:31:45.737 --> 00:31:49.741 align:middle line:84%
So now that we've kind of looked
at the time travel part straight

00:31:49.741 --> 00:31:52.810 align:middle line:84%
up I want to go into the
plasma confinement center

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:54.212 align:middle line:90%
and what that was about.

00:31:54.212 --> 00:31:57.582 align:middle line:84%
Because now we're bringing the
subject of radiation, time slips

00:31:57.582 --> 00:32:01.319 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of things in
and a particular feeling

00:32:01.319 --> 00:32:02.820 align:middle line:90%
that we talked about off camera

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:04.289 align:middle line:84%
that I've been very
curious about.

00:32:04.289 --> 00:32:05.556 align:middle line:90%
>> Bassagio: Right.

00:32:05.556 --> 00:32:08.226 align:middle line:84%
The plasma confinement
chamber is potentially the most

00:32:08.226 --> 00:32:10.895 align:middle line:84%
publically significant
time travel technology

00:32:10.895 --> 00:32:13.798 align:middle line:84%
that I was exposed to during
those years and time travel

00:32:13.798 --> 00:32:18.403 align:middle line:84%
to the past in because of its
implications about the threat

00:32:18.403 --> 00:32:21.439 align:middle line:84%
of time slipping as a result
of radioactive plasma.

00:32:21.439 --> 00:32:22.807 align:middle line:90%
So it was essentially --

00:32:22.807 --> 00:32:26.477 align:middle line:84%
the plasma confinement chamber
was essentially a lucite box

00:32:26.477 --> 00:32:28.379 align:middle line:84%
inside of a brick building
that's still there.

00:32:28.379 --> 00:32:32.984 align:middle line:84%
I just recently visited
Morristown and Morris Plains

00:32:32.984 --> 00:32:36.587 align:middle line:84%
and East Hanover, New Jersey
where these labs were,

00:32:36.587 --> 00:32:39.791 align:middle line:84%
Wood-Ridge, New Jersey where
the teleportation unit was.

00:32:39.791 --> 00:32:44.796 align:middle line:84%
And that brick building is still
at the corner of School Avenue

00:32:44.796 --> 00:32:47.899 align:middle line:84%
and Ridgedale Avenue in
East Hanover, New Jersey.

00:32:47.899 --> 00:32:50.468 align:middle line:84%
They built a Presbyterian
church frontage on the front

00:32:50.468 --> 00:32:52.470 align:middle line:84%
of that brick building and
then placed a nursery school

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:54.972 align:middle line:84%
in that brick building
behind the church.

00:32:54.972 --> 00:32:58.242 align:middle line:84%
Working there was Dr.
Sterling Colgate, the President

00:32:58.242 --> 00:33:00.411 align:middle line:84%
of the New Mexico's
Science and Technology

00:33:00.411 --> 00:33:04.582 align:middle line:84%
where we had seen the footage
of 9/11 30 years in the future.

00:33:04.582 --> 00:33:09.887 align:middle line:84%
And the plasma confinement
chamber was maybe about the size

00:33:09.887 --> 00:33:12.457 align:middle line:90%
of half of a tennis court.

00:33:12.457 --> 00:33:14.892 align:middle line:84%
If you just drew a line
through the medial axis

00:33:14.892 --> 00:33:18.463 align:middle line:84%
of a conventional tennis court
and maybe about 15 feet high.

00:33:18.463 --> 00:33:23.301 align:middle line:90%
So sort of like a squash court.

00:33:23.301 --> 00:33:28.339 align:middle line:84%
And there was a blue line on
the floor that would emit plasma

00:33:28.339 --> 00:33:32.877 align:middle line:84%
under confinement, radioactive
plasma into the end of this box.

00:33:32.877 --> 00:33:34.846 align:middle line:84%
And we knew that
once we walked past

00:33:34.846 --> 00:33:38.383 align:middle line:84%
that blue line we could
literally feel a dropping

00:33:38.383 --> 00:33:41.953 align:middle line:84%
sensation and violently
wormhole for about 30 seconds

00:33:41.953 --> 00:33:45.490 align:middle line:84%
and find ourselves
physically in a past event.

00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:47.625 align:middle line:84%
And I was sent to
Gettysburg, Pennsylvania

00:33:47.625 --> 00:33:50.461 align:middle line:84%
on the day Abraham Lincoln
gave the Gettysburg Address

00:33:50.461 --> 00:33:54.632 align:middle line:84%
which was November 19th of
1863 via that methodology.

00:33:54.632 --> 00:33:58.069 align:middle line:84%
And what we've been talking
about relative to time slips is

00:33:58.069 --> 00:34:00.538 align:middle line:84%
that there's evidence
that both natural releases

00:34:00.538 --> 00:34:04.575 align:middle line:84%
and accidental industrial
releases or negligent releases

00:34:04.575 --> 00:34:07.778 align:middle line:84%
of radioactive plasma have
been causing the time slips

00:34:07.778 --> 00:34:09.847 align:middle line:84%
that different individuals
have been experiencing.

00:34:09.847 --> 00:34:14.952 align:middle line:84%
For example, the famous
Montelimar, France time slip

00:34:14.952 --> 00:34:16.988 align:middle line:84%
in which two British
couples, the Gisbys

00:34:16.988 --> 00:34:21.425 align:middle line:84%
and the Simpsons drove into
Montelimar, France on their way

00:34:21.425 --> 00:34:25.129 align:middle line:84%
to a holiday in Nice
in the south of France

00:34:25.129 --> 00:34:27.398 align:middle line:84%
and discovered some
unusual things at a bed

00:34:27.398 --> 00:34:28.833 align:middle line:90%
and breakfast in Montelimar.

00:34:28.833 --> 00:34:32.135 align:middle line:84%
Such as the fact that their
windows on the second floor

00:34:32.135 --> 00:34:36.007 align:middle line:84%
of that hotel didn't have any
glass, they had wooden shutters.

00:34:36.007 --> 00:34:40.077 align:middle line:84%
The French waitress down in
the tavern didn't recognize the

00:34:40.077 --> 00:34:42.180 align:middle line:90%
modern French word for motorway.

00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:45.416 align:middle line:84%
One of the Britains
involved was fluent in French

00:34:45.416 --> 00:34:46.918 align:middle line:90%
and so was conversing with her.

00:34:46.918 --> 00:34:48.352 align:middle line:84%
And she was confused
about what he meant

00:34:48.352 --> 00:34:51.021 align:middle line:84%
by the modern French
term for motorway.

00:34:51.021 --> 00:34:53.257 align:middle line:84%
They paid for their
breakfast that next morning

00:34:53.257 --> 00:34:56.694 align:middle line:84%
with four pence which would
just be literally pennies

00:34:56.694 --> 00:34:59.497 align:middle line:84%
for breakfast in a
French bed and breakfast.

00:34:59.497 --> 00:35:02.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Absolutely,
yeah, it's like 4 cents.

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.836 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: It should be
several hundred franks.

00:35:04.836 --> 00:35:07.805 align:middle line:84%
And also as they were leaving
two French gendarmes walked

00:35:07.805 --> 00:35:11.342 align:middle line:84%
into the tavern wearing French
period clothing as policemen

00:35:11.342 --> 00:35:13.511 align:middle line:90%
from 100 years in the past.

00:35:13.511 --> 00:35:15.446 align:middle line:84%
So they went on their
vacation, talked about how weird

00:35:15.446 --> 00:35:16.647 align:middle line:90%
that bed and breakfast was.

00:35:16.647 --> 00:35:18.182 align:middle line:84%
And they said let's go
back to it on the way back

00:35:18.182 --> 00:35:21.018 align:middle line:84%
to the channel to
get back to England.

00:35:21.018 --> 00:35:24.021 align:middle line:84%
And they went down the
same street, same alleyway,

00:35:24.021 --> 00:35:26.557 align:middle line:84%
there was the same
circus poster on the wall

00:35:26.557 --> 00:35:27.592 align:middle line:90%
but no bed and breakfast.

00:35:27.592 --> 00:35:28.993 align:middle line:90%
It was an empty lot.

00:35:28.993 --> 00:35:32.530 align:middle line:84%
So, again, as a result of being
fluid in French they were able

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:35.199 align:middle line:84%
to converse with
the locals there.

00:35:35.199 --> 00:35:37.101 align:middle line:84%
And they asked the neighbors
was there anything ever

00:35:37.101 --> 00:35:37.802 align:middle line:90%
here recently.

00:35:37.802 --> 00:35:39.170 align:middle line:90%
They said no, no.

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:40.571 align:middle line:84%
Well, was there anything
there historically.

00:35:40.571 --> 00:35:43.574 align:middle line:84%
They said, yes, there was kind
of a tavern and a hotel there

00:35:43.574 --> 00:35:45.476 align:middle line:84%
where you could take a
meal on the ground floor

00:35:45.476 --> 00:35:48.312 align:middle line:84%
and then get a room for the
night on the upper floor.

00:35:48.312 --> 00:35:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
when was it torn down?

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:53.084 align:middle line:84%
And they said sometime
in the 1890s.

00:35:53.084 --> 00:35:55.887 align:middle line:84%
Jenny Randles tells a brilliant
telling of this as a result

00:35:55.887 --> 00:35:58.089 align:middle line:84%
of her work with the
Gisbys and the Simpsons.

00:35:58.089 --> 00:35:59.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And the
book Time Storms.

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:02.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: Yes, if I'm
not mistaken she wrote

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:05.229 align:middle line:84%
in a very fascinating way
in her book Time Storms

00:36:05.229 --> 00:36:07.265 align:middle line:84%
which I would recommend
to your viewers.

00:36:07.265 --> 00:36:09.500 align:middle line:90%
It's a brilliant work.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And so I investigated
the Montelimar time slip

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:15.306 align:middle line:84%
because I was realizing, well
wait a minute, Dr. Colgate

00:36:15.306 --> 00:36:18.910 align:middle line:84%
and my father who had a few
technicians literally physically

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:21.078 align:middle line:84%
imbedded me in Gettysburg,
Pennsylvania

00:36:21.078 --> 00:36:25.349 align:middle line:84%
in 1863 utilizing a form
of radioactive plasma.

00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:30.821 align:middle line:84%
I think I should
investigate Montelimar to see

00:36:30.821 --> 00:36:33.758 align:middle line:84%
if there was any radioactive
plasma present when the Gisbys

00:36:33.758 --> 00:36:35.960 align:middle line:84%
and Simpsons had their
famous time slip.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.295 align:middle line:90%
Well, there was.

00:36:37.295 --> 00:36:41.098 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in the week before
that time slip I discovered,

00:36:41.098 --> 00:36:43.167 align:middle line:84%
and in fact I haven't even
consulted Jenny Randles

00:36:43.167 --> 00:36:45.369 align:middle line:84%
about this discovery,
that the Montelimar,

00:36:45.369 --> 00:36:47.838 align:middle line:90%
France civilian nuclear plant,

00:36:47.838 --> 00:36:51.509 align:middle line:84%
which is the largest civilian
nuclear plant in all of France,

00:36:51.509 --> 00:36:54.011 align:middle line:84%
released the largest
amount of radioactive plasma

00:36:54.011 --> 00:36:56.480 align:middle line:84%
that has ever been
released in an accidental

00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:00.384 align:middle line:84%
or negligent nuclear
accident in all of France.

00:37:00.384 --> 00:37:05.256 align:middle line:84%
And that radioactive plasma
was covering the whole town

00:37:05.256 --> 00:37:07.158 align:middle line:84%
when the Gisbys and
Simpsons rode

00:37:07.158 --> 00:37:09.694 align:middle line:84%
in in their vehicle
into Montelimar.

00:37:09.694 --> 00:37:12.496 align:middle line:84%
So how can you not
conclude if independent

00:37:12.496 --> 00:37:16.100 align:middle line:84%
of that I've described being
sent to Gettysburg in 1863

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:19.737 align:middle line:84%
by a radioactive plasma, how
can we not account for that,

00:37:19.737 --> 00:37:22.373 align:middle line:84%
that that was probably the
cause or is the cause of some

00:37:22.373 --> 00:37:23.708 align:middle line:90%
of these accidental time slips.

00:37:23.708 --> 00:37:25.543 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Obviously a lot
more that we need to know

00:37:25.543 --> 00:37:27.244 align:middle line:90%
about the nature of radiation.

00:37:27.244 --> 00:37:33.184 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm wondering about is
they didn't feel the difference

00:37:33.184 --> 00:37:34.518 align:middle line:90%
within their own being.

00:37:34.518 --> 00:37:35.920 align:middle line:84%
They're just going along on
their journey, and they end

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:38.756 align:middle line:84%
up back in time at a place
that no longer exists.

00:37:38.756 --> 00:37:42.593 align:middle line:84%
When you were sent through
the particular device,

00:37:42.593 --> 00:37:44.362 align:middle line:90%
the plasma confinement device,

00:37:44.362 --> 00:37:47.131 align:middle line:84%
you experienced something
entirely different.

00:37:47.131 --> 00:37:48.666 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about
this off camera,

00:37:48.666 --> 00:37:50.101 align:middle line:84%
the feeling, the body feeling of
it.

00:37:50.101 --> 00:37:51.335 align:middle line:90%
>> Bassagio: Right.

00:37:51.335 --> 00:37:53.804 align:middle line:84%
On the way there I found
myself -- when the floor --

00:37:53.804 --> 00:37:55.806 align:middle line:84%
it felt like the floor was
falling out from beneath just

00:37:55.806 --> 00:37:57.074 align:middle line:90%
as my father had described.

00:37:57.074 --> 00:38:01.278 align:middle line:84%
When I got inside this
opalescent swirling pattern

00:38:01.278 --> 00:38:06.417 align:middle line:84%
of plasma with pastel
colors I literally fell

00:38:06.417 --> 00:38:07.718 align:middle line:90%
through the floor.

00:38:07.718 --> 00:38:09.720 align:middle line:90%
And I found myself tumbling

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:12.590 align:middle line:84%
through a cascading
series of wormholes.

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:16.293 align:middle line:84%
And then I suddenly was
tumbled out on the ground

00:38:16.293 --> 00:38:18.663 align:middle line:84%
on the southern side of
Mummisburg Road

00:38:18.663 --> 00:38:20.798 align:middle line:84%
which went from the northwest
of Washington Street.

00:38:20.798 --> 00:38:23.801 align:middle line:84%
And my dad had instructed
me to just start walking

00:38:23.801 --> 00:38:26.504 align:middle line:84%
and ask the first person
that I saw, hey friend,

00:38:26.504 --> 00:38:27.605 align:middle line:90%
which way to Gettysburg.

00:38:27.605 --> 00:38:29.306 align:middle line:84%
And a young Union
soldier pointed

00:38:29.306 --> 00:38:31.108 align:middle line:84%
in the direction
where I was walking.

00:38:31.108 --> 00:38:34.412 align:middle line:84%
I then made the first right as
my father described and walked

00:38:34.412 --> 00:38:36.881 align:middle line:84%
down Washington Street,
and then made a hard left

00:38:36.881 --> 00:38:39.684 align:middle line:90%
and went northeast

00:38:39.684 --> 00:38:42.620 align:middle line:84%
on the northern pike
of Emmitsburg Road.

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:45.956 align:middle line:84%
And that's where John Lawrence
Burns the Gettysburg cobbler

00:38:45.956 --> 00:38:50.394 align:middle line:84%
and town constable equipped me
with the huge oversized shoes

00:38:50.394 --> 00:38:52.163 align:middle line:84%
that I've seen in the
Josephine Cobb image of Lincoln

00:38:52.163 --> 00:38:54.598 align:middle line:84%
at Gettysburg and the
jacket and the hat.

00:38:54.598 --> 00:38:59.303 align:middle line:84%
Because my hat, both shoes and
one sock had been wrenched off

00:38:59.303 --> 00:39:02.440 align:middle line:84%
in this violent cascading
pattern of wormholes

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:05.342 align:middle line:84%
that literally deposited
me north of the town

00:39:05.342 --> 00:39:07.311 align:middle line:84%
of Gettysburg on
November 19, 1863.

00:39:07.311 --> 00:39:08.713 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: What did it
feel like inside your body.

00:39:08.713 --> 00:39:11.015 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: I felt hot as if
my temperature had been raised.

00:39:11.015 --> 00:39:12.817 align:middle line:90%
I smelled ozone.

00:39:12.817 --> 00:39:14.185 align:middle line:90%
I was confused momentarily.

00:39:14.185 --> 00:39:16.020 align:middle line:84%
This was a pretty
violent arrival.

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:20.825 align:middle line:84%
Most of my common Tesla
teleportation to New Mexico

00:39:20.825 --> 00:39:24.095 align:middle line:84%
or back to New Jersey was
relatively uneventful and not

00:39:24.095 --> 00:39:27.164 align:middle line:84%
that stressful, except one
time when I had to jump --

00:39:27.164 --> 00:39:28.299 align:middle line:84%
where I had been
accidentally sent

00:39:28.299 --> 00:39:32.103 align:middle line:84%
to 1991 I literally
hit the tarmac in 1971

00:39:32.103 --> 00:39:34.305 align:middle line:84%
when I jumped back
from Sandia back

00:39:34.305 --> 00:39:36.207 align:middle line:84%
to Curtiss-Wright in
that particular sort

00:39:36.207 --> 00:39:38.709 align:middle line:84%
of emergency extraction
from the future.

00:39:38.709 --> 00:39:40.177 align:middle line:84%
But usually it was
much less violent

00:39:40.177 --> 00:39:42.446 align:middle line:84%
than this plasma
confinement base.

00:39:42.446 --> 00:39:43.914 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And you
were explaining how --

00:39:43.914 --> 00:39:46.517 align:middle line:84%
and I was asking about it
because I had had an experience

00:39:46.517 --> 00:39:48.786 align:middle line:84%
where I had been experimenting
with another person,

00:39:48.786 --> 00:39:52.656 align:middle line:84%
and we did this repeatedly,
and it was like blowing apart

00:39:52.656 --> 00:39:56.093 align:middle line:84%
into trillions of
particles of light that were

00:39:56.093 --> 00:39:58.963 align:middle line:84%
so electrified it was
almost like painful.

00:39:58.963 --> 00:40:00.731 align:middle line:84%
It was like a chill
at the center of you.

00:40:00.731 --> 00:40:01.799 align:middle line:90%
>> Bassagio: Right.

00:40:01.799 --> 00:40:03.033 align:middle line:84%
Now, the paradox of
that particular form

00:40:03.033 --> 00:40:06.570 align:middle line:84%
of time travel is that right
after Mathew Brady took

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:10.107 align:middle line:84%
that photograph of the
citizens of Gettysburg arriving

00:40:10.107 --> 00:40:13.978 align:middle line:84%
to hear President Lincoln give
a speech, November 19, 1863,

00:40:13.978 --> 00:40:16.213 align:middle line:84%
and I'm standing there in the
foreground of that photograph.

00:40:16.213 --> 00:40:20.351 align:middle line:84%
Within seconds, literally within
minutes of Lincoln arriving

00:40:20.351 --> 00:40:24.655 align:middle line:84%
on the dias and hearing this
boisterous cheer of approval

00:40:24.655 --> 00:40:25.856 align:middle line:90%
and congratulations going up,

00:40:25.856 --> 00:40:28.292 align:middle line:84%
of course we had turned
the Civil War four months

00:40:28.292 --> 00:40:32.496 align:middle line:84%
previously, the Union had
in the Battle of Gettysburg,

00:40:32.496 --> 00:40:35.032 align:middle line:84%
possibly Fredericksburg
previously,

00:40:35.032 --> 00:40:37.201 align:middle line:84%
but clearly Abraham Lincoln
was a popular president

00:40:37.201 --> 00:40:39.603 align:middle line:84%
in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania
that day.

00:40:39.603 --> 00:40:41.906 align:middle line:90%
So I heard the cheer go up.

00:40:41.906 --> 00:40:44.408 align:middle line:84%
And I was standing with
my back to the dias

00:40:44.408 --> 00:40:46.310 align:middle line:84%
because I had gathered
too much attention

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:47.912 align:middle line:90%
to myself near the dias.

00:40:47.912 --> 00:40:52.049 align:middle line:84%
And so basically my
training was triggered,

00:40:52.049 --> 00:40:54.084 align:middle line:84%
and I walked away
from that area.

00:40:54.084 --> 00:40:57.054 align:middle line:84%
And I stood with my right
foot to the opposite direction

00:40:57.054 --> 00:40:59.557 align:middle line:84%
from where Lincoln would be
striding on the top of the dias,

00:40:59.557 --> 00:41:02.893 align:middle line:84%
and my left foot forward so
that my huge shoes would not be

00:41:02.893 --> 00:41:06.297 align:middle line:84%
noticed until I evanesced
is the term I've been using.

00:41:06.297 --> 00:41:07.565 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Evanesced,
that feeling.

00:41:07.565 --> 00:41:08.966 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: I didn't
wormhole back to the present.

00:41:08.966 --> 00:41:12.469 align:middle line:84%
What happened is that localized
quantum field effect wore off,

00:41:12.469 --> 00:41:14.205 align:middle line:84%
and I felt exactly
as you described.

00:41:14.205 --> 00:41:17.741 align:middle line:84%
It was as if I was in a
massive Kundalini sensation.

00:41:17.741 --> 00:41:18.742 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yup.

00:41:18.742 --> 00:41:19.577 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: In which
every molecule

00:41:19.577 --> 00:41:22.413 align:middle line:90%
of my body had disintegrated --

00:41:22.413 --> 00:41:23.814 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Exactly.

00:41:23.814 --> 00:41:28.052 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: -- but stayed in
like a broad spherical pattern

00:41:28.052 --> 00:41:32.756 align:middle line:84%
that was both heavy, and
the Kundalini sensation was

00:41:32.756 --> 00:41:35.893 align:middle line:84%
so profound that it was
almost painful to withstand.

00:41:35.893 --> 00:41:37.061 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: That's
what I experienced.

00:41:37.061 --> 00:41:39.530 align:middle line:84%
It was very painful,
but then coalesced back

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:42.900 align:middle line:84%
to something more familiar
when it got to its destination,

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:45.236 align:middle line:84%
which in my case was
a point of light.

00:41:45.236 --> 00:41:46.503 align:middle line:90%
>> Bassagio: Right.

00:41:46.503 --> 00:41:48.606 align:middle line:84%
Back in the plasma confinement
chamber in East Hanover

00:41:48.606 --> 00:41:51.275 align:middle line:84%
in Spring of 1972, I don't
know what day exactly

00:41:51.275 --> 00:41:54.144 align:middle line:84%
but it was spring, a
sunny day in spring of 72

00:41:54.144 --> 00:41:56.847 align:middle line:84%
in East Hanover back
in New Jersey,

00:41:56.847 --> 00:42:00.451 align:middle line:84%
I felt myself being condensed
back into human form.

00:42:00.451 --> 00:42:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And I was fine except I was
wearing these

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:03.454 align:middle line:90%
civilian shoes.

00:42:03.454 --> 00:42:06.056 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Very famous photo.

00:42:06.056 --> 00:42:10.527 align:middle line:84%
Okay, now this takes us to
another historical meeting

00:42:10.527 --> 00:42:13.330 align:middle line:84%
that you've kind of pieced
together through time.

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:15.666 align:middle line:84%
And that was you went back
to a time where you met

00:42:15.666 --> 00:42:17.601 align:middle line:90%
with George Washington.

00:42:17.601 --> 00:42:18.836 align:middle line:90%
>> Bassagio: Right.

00:42:18.836 --> 00:42:19.937 align:middle line:84%
And let me just say in
prescript about these claims

00:42:19.937 --> 00:42:22.139 align:middle line:84%
of seeing images of the
crucifixion of Jesus

00:42:22.139 --> 00:42:25.676 align:middle line:84%
of Nazareth, briefing General
George Washington in August

00:42:25.676 --> 00:42:28.879 align:middle line:84%
of 1776 via chronovision,
and then being sent

00:42:28.879 --> 00:42:31.515 align:middle line:84%
to the Gettysburg
address by Abraham Lincoln

00:42:31.515 --> 00:42:33.284 align:middle line:90%
by plasma confinement --

00:42:33.284 --> 00:42:34.785 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: These were
different technologies, too.

00:42:34.785 --> 00:42:36.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Bassagio: Well, yeah.

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:37.488 align:middle line:84%
We were not only working
with different technologies,

00:42:37.488 --> 00:42:40.658 align:middle line:84%
but there was a programmatic
reason to select Jesus,

00:42:40.658 --> 00:42:44.628 align:middle line:84%
Washington and Lincoln, because
they were individuals in history

00:42:44.628 --> 00:42:47.064 align:middle line:84%
that hundreds of
books and dozens

00:42:47.064 --> 00:42:49.066 align:middle line:90%
of source material was available

00:42:49.066 --> 00:42:51.168 align:middle line:84%
to compare what history
had recorded

00:42:51.168 --> 00:42:53.103 align:middle line:84%
about these three
prone individuals

00:42:53.103 --> 00:42:55.873 align:middle line:84%
and what our U.S.
chrononaut corps would report

00:42:55.873 --> 00:42:59.810 align:middle line:84%
after seeing an event or
literally interacting with them

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:01.078 align:middle line:84%
at least in the case
of my interaction

00:43:01.078 --> 00:43:04.114 align:middle line:84%
with General Washington
utilizing the different forms

00:43:04.114 --> 00:43:06.183 align:middle line:84%
of time travel that
were developing.

00:43:06.183 --> 00:43:09.486 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not just relying
on three famous personages

00:43:09.486 --> 00:43:11.956 align:middle line:90%
to cobble together a tall tale.

00:43:11.956 --> 00:43:13.824 align:middle line:84%
The were literally the
people that I saw or visited.

00:43:13.824 --> 00:43:14.959 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: They were
strategic targets.

00:43:14.959 --> 00:43:16.026 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: Yeah,
because we had a lot

00:43:16.026 --> 00:43:17.895 align:middle line:84%
to compare what we
were finding against.

00:43:17.895 --> 00:43:22.333 align:middle line:84%
I mean even by 1972 there had
been hundreds of histories

00:43:22.333 --> 00:43:25.636 align:middle line:84%
of the civil war and dozens and
dozens and dozens of biographies

00:43:25.636 --> 00:43:27.938 align:middle line:84%
of Lincoln and the
Gettysburg Address.

00:43:27.938 --> 00:43:29.606 align:middle line:84%
So they had selected
these individuals

00:43:29.606 --> 00:43:31.809 align:middle line:90%
for sound programmatic reasons.

00:43:31.809 --> 00:43:34.411 align:middle line:84%
And I had forms of contact
with all three of them,

00:43:34.411 --> 00:43:36.113 align:middle line:90%
seeing, conversing with them.

00:43:36.113 --> 00:43:37.548 align:middle line:90%
And, again, I was supposed

00:43:37.548 --> 00:43:39.650 align:middle line:84%
to see Abraham Lincoln give
the Gettysburg Address.

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:41.385 align:middle line:90%
I went back to East Hanover.

00:43:41.385 --> 00:43:42.653 align:middle line:90%
I evanesced back.

00:43:42.653 --> 00:43:43.854 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You blew apart and
evanesced back, yeah.

00:43:43.854 --> 00:43:46.256 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: Shortly after
he strode to the dias.

00:43:46.256 --> 00:43:47.358 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So what
was Washington

00:43:47.358 --> 00:43:48.659 align:middle line:90%
like from your perspective then?

00:43:48.659 --> 00:43:51.128 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: Well, they put
us down in the encampment

00:43:51.128 --> 00:43:55.833 align:middle line:84%
above New York Harbor,
and we found his tent.

00:43:55.833 --> 00:43:57.968 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of the other child
chrononauts came over to me

00:43:57.968 --> 00:44:01.772 align:middle line:84%
and said General George
Washington is in that tent.

00:44:01.772 --> 00:44:04.475 align:middle line:90%
And I had great trepidation.

00:44:04.475 --> 00:44:05.976 align:middle line:90%
I mean because just like my fear

00:44:05.976 --> 00:44:07.678 align:middle line:84%
of seeing Lincoln give
the Gettysburg Address --

00:44:07.678 --> 00:44:09.346 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Now, how
old were you then?

00:44:09.346 --> 00:44:12.616 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: Let's see
that was in fall of 70

00:44:12.616 --> 00:44:17.321 align:middle line:84%
so I had just turned nine having
been born in September of 61.

00:44:17.321 --> 00:44:21.725 align:middle line:84%
And I had a wave of trepidation,
some of that Bart Simpson kind

00:44:21.725 --> 00:44:23.127 align:middle line:90%
of childhood fear crept in.

00:44:23.127 --> 00:44:27.131 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, okay, but I was
the team leader of blue team.

00:44:27.131 --> 00:44:29.266 align:middle line:84%
But also I had a
very superb memory.

00:44:29.266 --> 00:44:30.334 align:middle line:90%
They had identified that as one

00:44:30.334 --> 00:44:33.137 align:middle line:84%
of my God given gifts
as it were.

00:44:33.137 --> 00:44:36.573 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to memorize
this debriefing document

00:44:36.573 --> 00:44:39.510 align:middle line:84%
to literally inform
George Washington

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:42.913 align:middle line:84%
of what his destiny was and of
the pressing necessity for him

00:44:42.913 --> 00:44:46.283 align:middle line:84%
to retreat his troops from
New York Harbor immediately.

00:44:46.283 --> 00:44:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And so I walked in and he
was there sort of smiling.

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:53.157 align:middle line:84%
And then he walked out
and then he came back in.

00:44:53.157 --> 00:44:56.827 align:middle line:84%
And he indicted that we should
take a seat on the divan

00:44:56.827 --> 00:44:59.296 align:middle line:84%
that was there, it was
kind of a backless sofa.

00:44:59.296 --> 00:45:01.198 align:middle line:90%
He was sitting in a plush chair.

00:45:01.198 --> 00:45:06.236 align:middle line:84%
Washington's tent above New
York Harbor had been sort of --

00:45:06.236 --> 00:45:11.341 align:middle line:84%
was outfitted with elegant
furniture and elegant carpet.

00:45:11.341 --> 00:45:14.645 align:middle line:84%
Canteens and water bags
hanging from the struts

00:45:14.645 --> 00:45:16.213 align:middle line:90%
that held up the tent.

00:45:16.213 --> 00:45:21.051 align:middle line:84%
He was in his full dress
uniform of blue and gold.

00:45:21.051 --> 00:45:22.853 align:middle line:84%
And the best way I can
describe George Washington

00:45:22.853 --> 00:45:27.458 align:middle line:84%
that really doesn't show up
in the statues of Washington,

00:45:27.458 --> 00:45:32.563 align:middle line:84%
his paintings and so forth is
he was a study in opposites.

00:45:32.563 --> 00:45:36.066 align:middle line:84%
He was a commanding figure
but extremely relaxed.

00:45:36.066 --> 00:45:39.837 align:middle line:84%
He was sagacious and
intelligent but also witty.

00:45:39.837 --> 00:45:44.374 align:middle line:84%
He was confident and has
clear physical prowess.

00:45:44.374 --> 00:45:47.878 align:middle line:84%
Washington was 44 when I met
him via chronovision by the way,

00:45:47.878 --> 00:45:50.414 align:middle line:84%
so he was there in the
flesh, and I was there

00:45:50.414 --> 00:45:56.553 align:middle line:84%
in a physio virtual way via
one of the chronovisors.

00:45:56.553 --> 00:45:58.021 align:middle line:90%
So I'm there hologrammatically,

00:45:58.021 --> 00:46:01.258 align:middle line:84%
and he's there living
his life in the flesh.

00:46:01.258 --> 00:46:03.994 align:middle line:84%
And the term that I've
come up with to sort

00:46:03.994 --> 00:46:07.498 align:middle line:84%
of describe his basic
personality was he was kind

00:46:07.498 --> 00:46:10.100 align:middle line:84%
of relating to us in
this bemused swagger.

00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:12.503 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Did he understand
what he was interfacing with?

00:46:12.503 --> 00:46:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Bassagio: No.

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:14.338 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: No.

00:46:14.338 --> 00:46:17.508 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: He said, so
surely lads you must be angels.

00:46:17.508 --> 00:46:22.446 align:middle line:84%
And I said, no sir, we're
time travelers from 1970.

00:46:22.446 --> 00:46:24.348 align:middle line:84%
And he said time travelers,
well, what do you mean?

00:46:24.348 --> 00:46:29.720 align:middle line:84%
Do you mean an angel who comes
from heaven to impart a message

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:33.223 align:middle line:84%
to some human being in
need of the information?

00:46:33.223 --> 00:46:34.725 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, he
sounded very much

00:46:34.725 --> 00:46:36.193 align:middle line:90%
like Prince Charles does today.

00:46:36.193 --> 00:46:37.961 align:middle line:84%
He was speaking the
King's English.

00:46:37.961 --> 00:46:44.635 align:middle line:84%
Because before, a month
earlier on July 4th of 1776,

00:46:44.635 --> 00:46:48.238 align:middle line:84%
he had been an English
gentleman in a British colony.

00:46:48.238 --> 00:46:51.074 align:middle line:84%
And when we told him
we were time travelers

00:46:51.074 --> 00:46:54.178 align:middle line:84%
from the future he cupped
his hand kind of like this,

00:46:54.178 --> 00:46:56.880 align:middle line:84%
and over his shoulder in
the chair I don't know

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:59.416 align:middle line:84%
who is Alexander Hamilton,
but again Alexander comes up

00:46:59.416 --> 00:47:02.519 align:middle line:84%
and he said, Alec,
these lads say

00:47:02.519 --> 00:47:05.355 align:middle line:84%
that they're time travelers
from our own future.

00:47:05.355 --> 00:47:07.024 align:middle line:84%
Tell me, have you ever
heard such a thing?

00:47:07.024 --> 00:47:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And his young page,
presumably Alexander Hamilton,

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:11.795 align:middle line:90%
said, no sir, I haven't.

00:47:11.795 --> 00:47:13.664 align:middle line:84%
He said something like that
sounds like a tall drink

00:47:13.664 --> 00:47:15.299 align:middle line:84%
of water, general, or
something like that.

00:47:15.299 --> 00:47:19.469 align:middle line:84%
So he looks at us again and
says, well, what does this mean?

00:47:19.469 --> 00:47:22.706 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well sir,
200 years into the future

00:47:22.706 --> 00:47:24.975 align:middle line:84%
of the government that
you're going to create

00:47:24.975 --> 00:47:28.912 align:middle line:84%
by winning this Revolutionary
War that you're prosecuting,

00:47:28.912 --> 00:47:30.380 align:middle line:84%
our government will
have developed --

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:33.217 align:middle line:84%
the government that you're
going to found is going

00:47:33.217 --> 00:47:36.286 align:middle line:84%
to develop technologies that
will enable it to put people

00:47:36.286 --> 00:47:38.288 align:middle line:90%
into past or future events.

00:47:38.288 --> 00:47:41.058 align:middle line:84%
And they've sent us to
this event right here, sir,

00:47:41.058 --> 00:47:43.594 align:middle line:84%
via a device called
a chronovisor

00:47:43.594 --> 00:47:46.663 align:middle line:84%
where they create a field
of light, and when we stand

00:47:46.663 --> 00:47:48.198 align:middle line:84%
in that light when
the light is brought

00:47:48.198 --> 00:47:51.168 align:middle line:84%
down around us they
tuned in this event

00:47:51.168 --> 00:47:53.437 align:middle line:84%
with that machine
and here we are.

00:47:53.437 --> 00:47:55.539 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, why
have they sent you?

00:47:55.539 --> 00:48:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And then I went into my speech
about how I've been instructed

00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:02.779 align:middle line:84%
to tell you, General Washington,
that you're going to win the war

00:48:02.779 --> 00:48:05.082 align:middle line:84%
that you're presently
prosecuting.

00:48:05.082 --> 00:48:07.684 align:middle line:84%
That you will be the first
president of that country

00:48:07.684 --> 00:48:09.319 align:middle line:90%
after operating for 13 years

00:48:09.319 --> 00:48:11.521 align:middle line:84%
under the articles
of confederation.

00:48:11.521 --> 00:48:14.424 align:middle line:84%
You will then become the
President of the United States.

00:48:14.424 --> 00:48:19.429 align:middle line:84%
You will be regarded in history
as the father of your country.

00:48:19.429 --> 00:48:21.632 align:middle line:90%
The United States of America

00:48:21.632 --> 00:48:24.167 align:middle line:84%
which is what the country will
be called will be regarded

00:48:24.167 --> 00:48:27.004 align:middle line:84%
as the greatest country in
the history of civilization.

00:48:27.004 --> 00:48:28.438 align:middle line:90%
Its capital city, in fact,

00:48:28.438 --> 00:48:31.541 align:middle line:84%
will be named Washington
in honor of you, sir.

00:48:31.541 --> 00:48:34.144 align:middle line:84%
But that none of these
propitious things will happen

00:48:34.144 --> 00:48:35.579 align:middle line:90%
unless you retreat your troops

00:48:35.579 --> 00:48:37.581 align:middle line:84%
from New York Harbor
immediately.

00:48:37.581 --> 00:48:42.552 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, I'm
a general waging a war

00:48:42.552 --> 00:48:44.621 align:middle line:84%
and you're telling me you're a
time traveler from the future.

00:48:44.621 --> 00:48:45.822 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: A kid.

00:48:45.822 --> 00:48:48.759 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: And you're,
what, 9 years old Andrew?

00:48:48.759 --> 00:48:50.661 align:middle line:84%
Because we had introduce
ourselves.

00:48:50.661 --> 00:48:52.996 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yes, general,
that's what I'm telling you

00:48:52.996 --> 00:48:54.031 align:middle line:84%
and that's why I've
been sent here.

00:48:54.031 --> 00:48:56.466 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, well, I'm sorry

00:48:56.466 --> 00:48:58.702 align:middle line:84%
but you're just going
to have to prove it.

00:48:58.702 --> 00:49:01.605 align:middle line:84%
And what I'd been given
is an eight and a half

00:49:01.605 --> 00:49:03.707 align:middle line:90%
by eleven inch sheet of paper

00:49:03.707 --> 00:49:06.877 align:middle line:84%
that had a two dimensional
hologram on it.

00:49:06.877 --> 00:49:08.945 align:middle line:84%
Like when hologram was
publically introduced

00:49:08.945 --> 00:49:13.083 align:middle line:84%
in the 1970s let's say on a
baseball cover or the cover

00:49:13.083 --> 00:49:14.951 align:middle line:90%
of the National Geographic.

00:49:14.951 --> 00:49:18.755 align:middle line:84%
And it featured a patriotic
symbol of an eagle landing

00:49:18.755 --> 00:49:23.694 align:middle line:84%
on an American crest, a red,
white and blue crest with stars.

00:49:23.694 --> 00:49:25.362 align:middle line:90%
But it was all holographic.

00:49:25.362 --> 00:49:27.464 align:middle line:84%
You could see the depth
of the eagle, its talons

00:49:27.464 --> 00:49:29.800 align:middle line:90%
and so forth, its wings.

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And I handed it to Washington,
and I said surely, sir,

00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:36.873 align:middle line:84%
this artifact did not
originate in your time.

00:49:36.873 --> 00:49:41.278 align:middle line:84%
Based on where printing is
in the age of Washington

00:49:41.278 --> 00:49:44.214 align:middle line:84%
as this age shall become
known that technology,

00:49:44.214 --> 00:49:45.882 align:middle line:84%
that printing technology
doesn't exist yet,

00:49:45.882 --> 00:49:48.618 align:middle line:90%
so we must be from your future.

00:49:48.618 --> 00:49:52.489 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, this is
certainly something I must show

00:49:52.489 --> 00:49:55.158 align:middle line:84%
Ben Franklin, he would
be fascinated by this.

00:49:55.158 --> 00:49:57.527 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, well
Andrew, I agree with you.

00:49:57.527 --> 00:50:00.063 align:middle line:84%
And then he thought for
a second, and he stood

00:50:00.063 --> 00:50:03.567 align:middle line:84%
up abruptly, and he said not
even looking at us, he's looking

00:50:03.567 --> 00:50:05.569 align:middle line:84%
at the door of his tent,
the opening of his tent,

00:50:05.569 --> 00:50:08.038 align:middle line:84%
he said I shall order
the retreat immediately.

00:50:08.038 --> 00:50:11.475 align:middle line:84%
And he left the tent, and that's
the last that I saw Washington.

00:50:11.475 --> 00:50:14.778 align:middle line:84%
We persisted there for
several hours even to nightfall

00:50:14.778 --> 00:50:17.748 align:middle line:84%
as Washington's, I think
it was his major regiment,

00:50:17.748 --> 00:50:20.884 align:middle line:84%
then retreated there
up to Brooklyn Heights

00:50:20.884 --> 00:50:22.519 align:middle line:90%
on their way to Manhattan.

00:50:22.519 --> 00:50:27.758 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was 400 Maryland
sharpshooters were covering

00:50:27.758 --> 00:50:30.560 align:middle line:84%
their retreat as
essentially the major part

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:33.697 align:middle line:84%
of the revolutionary army
retreated and was not destroyed

00:50:33.697 --> 00:50:36.733 align:middle line:84%
by canon fire from the
myriad of British vessels

00:50:36.733 --> 00:50:39.536 align:middle line:84%
that were lurking out
in New York Harbor.

00:50:39.536 --> 00:50:42.172 align:middle line:84%
So people have asked
me how did that work?

00:50:42.172 --> 00:50:45.442 align:middle line:84%
Did the event happen and
then you were born in 1961

00:50:45.442 --> 00:50:48.078 align:middle line:84%
and you were placed in Project
Pegasus and you went back

00:50:48.078 --> 00:50:52.749 align:middle line:84%
and intervened so that a
second past event occurred

00:50:52.749 --> 00:50:54.785 align:middle line:84%
and you then changed
history on that time line?

00:50:54.785 --> 00:50:56.720 align:middle line:90%
And the answer to that is no.

00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:00.290 align:middle line:84%
I was sent back -- I mean the
sine qua non the essential thing

00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:04.227 align:middle line:84%
of time travel is that you
visit the actual past or future.

00:51:04.227 --> 00:51:06.863 align:middle line:84%
So what happened is that
I had intervened there

00:51:06.863 --> 00:51:11.001 align:middle line:84%
and convinced Washington to
retreat from New York Harbor.

00:51:11.001 --> 00:51:14.037 align:middle line:84%
But then later in time
I provided the causation

00:51:14.037 --> 00:51:15.505 align:middle line:90%
for that effect.

00:51:15.505 --> 00:51:19.910 align:middle line:84%
In other words I went ultimately
in the future back to the past

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:23.513 align:middle line:84%
and retrocausally caused
George Washington to make

00:51:23.513 --> 00:51:25.215 align:middle line:90%
that decision in real time.

00:51:25.215 --> 00:51:27.651 align:middle line:84%
So in the same way that the
plasma confinement chamber sent

00:51:27.651 --> 00:51:30.921 align:middle line:84%
me to Gettysburg on the day
the first time and only time

00:51:30.921 --> 00:51:35.258 align:middle line:84%
that Lincoln gave that address
on our time line, I was sent

00:51:35.258 --> 00:51:38.261 align:middle line:84%
and advised Washington to
retreat from New York Harbor

00:51:38.261 --> 00:51:40.130 align:middle line:84%
on the day that he
made that decision.

00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:42.699 align:middle line:84%
I literally briefed him from
the U.S. government 200 years

00:51:42.699 --> 00:51:43.967 align:middle line:90%
in the future.

00:51:43.967 --> 00:51:47.137 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Again, a very
strategic positioning

00:51:47.137 --> 00:51:50.841 align:middle line:84%
of yourself and the
others that went with you.

00:51:50.841 --> 00:51:52.042 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember who went with
you?

00:51:52.042 --> 00:51:53.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: Well, I think
although I was captain

00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:59.182 align:middle line:84%
of our team of 10, we were
14 teams of 10 children,

00:51:59.182 --> 00:52:00.884 align:middle line:90%
140 children nationally involved

00:52:00.884 --> 00:52:03.253 align:middle line:84%
in time traveling
for Project Pegasus.

00:52:03.253 --> 00:52:06.089 align:middle line:84%
One lost his feet during
one jump to Santa Fe.

00:52:06.089 --> 00:52:07.691 align:middle line:90%
A girl went blind looking at one

00:52:07.691 --> 00:52:09.960 align:middle line:84%
of the crystal arrays
producing the hologram

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:11.328 align:middle line:90%
in one of the chronovisors.

00:52:11.328 --> 00:52:17.667 align:middle line:84%
One of our colleagues is now
dead after reaching 700 pounds

00:52:17.667 --> 00:52:19.302 align:middle line:84%
as a result of metabolic
disruption

00:52:19.302 --> 00:52:20.971 align:middle line:90%
from his project activities.

00:52:20.971 --> 00:52:22.305 align:middle line:84%
But I was the captain
of the blue team,

00:52:22.305 --> 00:52:23.373 align:middle line:84%
but I think I was
really sent just

00:52:23.373 --> 00:52:25.876 align:middle line:84%
because I had a very
good memory.

00:52:25.876 --> 00:52:27.844 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some past life
information was used

00:52:27.844 --> 00:52:29.779 align:middle line:84%
because I have past
life memories

00:52:29.779 --> 00:52:33.250 align:middle line:84%
of being Dr. Thomas Bond
who was the chief physician

00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:34.651 align:middle line:90%
of the Revolutionary Army.

00:52:34.651 --> 00:52:37.387 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So maybe you had a
resonance already with that era

00:52:37.387 --> 00:52:38.788 align:middle line:90%
and those individuals?

00:52:38.788 --> 00:52:41.157 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: Well, since we know
from CIA people who have told me

00:52:41.157 --> 00:52:43.960 align:middle line:84%
to my face that the Central
Intelligence Agency can

00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:45.729 align:middle line:84%
literally print a
list of who you were

00:52:45.729 --> 00:52:49.966 align:middle line:84%
in the past utilizing means
that may involve time travel

00:52:49.966 --> 00:52:53.403 align:middle line:84%
or some other capability that
they have to literally read

00:52:53.403 --> 00:52:55.505 align:middle line:90%
who we were in past lives.

00:52:55.505 --> 00:52:58.575 align:middle line:84%
I've had profound past life
memories of being somebody

00:52:58.575 --> 00:53:00.176 align:middle line:84%
who clearly would have
had personal contact

00:53:00.176 --> 00:53:02.712 align:middle line:84%
with General Washington
during the Revolution.

00:53:02.712 --> 00:53:08.084 align:middle line:84%
Because Dr. Thomas Bond was a
Philadelphia based physician

00:53:08.084 --> 00:53:12.188 align:middle line:84%
who literally assembled
the medical response

00:53:12.188 --> 00:53:15.091 align:middle line:84%
to the battlefield
casualties that were occasioned

00:53:15.091 --> 00:53:17.260 align:middle line:84%
by our prosecution of
the Revolutionary War.

00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:18.562 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: So when a lot

00:53:18.562 --> 00:53:20.030 align:middle line:84%
of people hear this they say
how do you know it's your

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:20.630 align:middle line:90%
own memory?

00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:21.765 align:middle line:90%
How do you know?

00:53:21.765 --> 00:53:23.667 align:middle line:84%
With all of this time
travel, with jumping.

00:53:23.667 --> 00:53:26.403 align:middle line:84%
With going back through
these various chambers

00:53:26.403 --> 00:53:28.638 align:middle line:90%
holographically, physically

00:53:28.638 --> 00:53:31.975 align:middle line:84%
and so forth how do you
know what's a real memory?

00:53:31.975 --> 00:53:32.943 align:middle line:90%
How do you distinguish it?

00:53:32.943 --> 00:53:34.344 align:middle line:90%
>> Bassagio: Right.

00:53:34.344 --> 00:53:35.545 align:middle line:84%
Well, my response to that is I
think that's a valid question.

00:53:35.545 --> 00:53:37.314 align:middle line:84%
I've never purported my
information and said,

00:53:37.314 --> 00:53:38.715 align:middle line:90%
well, you must believe me.

00:53:38.715 --> 00:53:40.216 align:middle line:90%
All I'm doing is this happened,

00:53:40.216 --> 00:53:42.219 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling the truth,
take it or leave it.

00:53:42.219 --> 00:53:43.620 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing I can
do to bend your arm

00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:45.255 align:middle line:84%
to make somebody believe
that this is true.

00:53:45.255 --> 00:53:46.590 align:middle line:90%
It is true.

00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:51.661 align:middle line:84%
The way that I answer that
is, look, all human experience

00:53:51.661 --> 00:53:54.264 align:middle line:84%
of either an ordinary or
a non-ordinary nature,

00:53:54.264 --> 00:53:57.100 align:middle line:84%
your last trip to
McDonald's, could have resulted

00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:59.502 align:middle line:90%
from non-ordinary causation.

00:53:59.502 --> 00:54:02.138 align:middle line:84%
Being drugged, being
mind controlled,

00:54:02.138 --> 00:54:05.909 align:middle line:84%
being hit on the head, having
a fever, having been poisoned

00:54:05.909 --> 00:54:09.079 align:middle line:84%
by something accidentally
from a food or what have you.

00:54:09.079 --> 00:54:13.717 align:middle line:84%
And my response to that is that
years later my involvement,

00:54:13.717 --> 00:54:16.319 align:middle line:84%
for example, was
corroborated by my own father.

00:54:16.319 --> 00:54:19.889 align:middle line:84%
Imagine you're sitting with one
of your parents in your sofa

00:54:19.889 --> 00:54:23.760 align:middle line:84%
in your residence ten years
after doing something,

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:27.130 align:middle line:84%
and your mom or dad are talking
about how it actually happened

00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:30.567 align:middle line:84%
in a dispassionate way, just in
an ordinary family conversation.

00:54:30.567 --> 00:54:33.203 align:middle line:84%
Many of the things I did in
Project Pegasus were reviewed

00:54:33.203 --> 00:54:36.973 align:middle line:84%
by my father between 1986
and his death in 1990.

00:54:36.973 --> 00:54:38.274 align:middle line:90%
We had many heart to hearts

00:54:38.274 --> 00:54:39.976 align:middle line:84%
about what we done
together on Project Pegasus.

00:54:39.976 --> 00:54:44.214 align:middle line:84%
And that was in an environment
which I could not have been

00:54:44.214 --> 00:54:46.983 align:middle line:84%
under mind control because I was
interacting with my own father.

00:54:46.983 --> 00:54:49.019 align:middle line:84%
I never had any history
of alcohol

00:54:49.019 --> 00:54:52.889 align:middle line:90%
or recreational drug abuse.

00:54:52.889 --> 00:54:55.792 align:middle line:84%
He knew he was nearing his
death from heart disease.

00:54:55.792 --> 00:54:59.029 align:middle line:84%
He probably remembered the
actual year of his death

00:54:59.029 --> 00:55:02.298 align:middle line:84%
from reading my book
in the early 70s.

00:55:02.298 --> 00:55:05.435 align:middle line:84%
And he asked me shortly
before his death

00:55:05.435 --> 00:55:07.437 align:middle line:90%
to convene a family meeting

00:55:07.437 --> 00:55:09.773 align:middle line:84%
and then tell everything we
did together in Project Pegasus

00:55:09.773 --> 00:55:13.043 align:middle line:84%
or separately and then
tell the entire world.

00:55:13.043 --> 00:55:16.646 align:middle line:84%
So my father was motivated as
a Ralph M. Parsons engineer

00:55:16.646 --> 00:55:20.083 align:middle line:84%
who had been on an
extraordinary project

00:55:20.083 --> 00:55:22.419 align:middle line:84%
where astonishing
things were achieved

00:55:22.419 --> 00:55:25.522 align:middle line:84%
by our profoundly creative
American civilization.

00:55:25.522 --> 00:55:28.391 align:middle line:84%
That he wanted the
truth to be told.

00:55:28.391 --> 00:55:30.527 align:middle line:84%
And I also later had my
involvement corroborated

00:55:30.527 --> 00:55:31.461 align:middle line:90%
by other people.

00:55:31.461 --> 00:55:32.562 align:middle line:84%
I had a conversation
with, again,

00:55:32.562 --> 00:55:34.230 align:middle line:84%
his colleague Joe
Connison at Parsons.

00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:37.634 align:middle line:84%
And he listened for a half hour
denying that the teleporters

00:55:37.634 --> 00:55:40.770 align:middle line:84%
or chronovisors I was
describing existed for example.

00:55:40.770 --> 00:55:42.739 align:middle line:84%
And then when he asked me,
well, what am I going to do

00:55:42.739 --> 00:55:45.041 align:middle line:84%
with this information, and I
stated I was going to go public

00:55:45.041 --> 00:55:48.411 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately write a book and
try to work with film producers

00:55:48.411 --> 00:55:51.514 align:middle line:84%
to have the book told
as a motion picture,

00:55:51.514 --> 00:55:52.749 align:middle line:90%
this is a direct quote

00:55:52.749 --> 00:55:54.651 align:middle line:84%
from a Ralph M. Parsons
Company engineer.

00:55:54.651 --> 00:55:58.521 align:middle line:84%
He said a book, a movie,
nobody on the outside knows

00:55:58.521 --> 00:56:01.257 align:middle line:84%
about that stuff,
namely the derivation

00:56:01.257 --> 00:56:03.593 align:middle line:90%
of time travel technologies.

00:56:03.593 --> 00:56:05.962 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Gene Marie Arrigo who
is an ethicist for the CIA

00:56:05.962 --> 00:56:10.233 align:middle line:84%
and the U.S. military confirmed
very early in interacting

00:56:10.233 --> 00:56:13.703 align:middle line:84%
with me about dealing with the
posttraumatic stress of being

00:56:13.703 --> 00:56:18.908 align:middle line:84%
in such trying experiences as a
child and networking effectively

00:56:18.908 --> 00:56:20.577 align:middle line:84%
within the intelligence
community and military

00:56:20.577 --> 00:56:23.713 align:middle line:84%
and among project people,
engineers and so forth.

00:56:23.713 --> 00:56:25.648 align:middle line:84%
She was helping me
in the early 2000

00:56:25.648 --> 00:56:27.517 align:middle line:84%
to really map what
had happened to me.

00:56:27.517 --> 00:56:30.620 align:middle line:84%
He said, Andy, just stop looking
for complex explanations.

00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:32.388 align:middle line:90%
You were in all that far

00:56:32.388 --> 00:56:34.190 align:middle line:84%
out quantum axis stuff
in the early 70s.

00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:36.693 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And it's true in your
own experience, in your body,

00:56:36.693 --> 00:56:38.428 align:middle line:90%
your emotions, your mind.

00:56:38.428 --> 00:56:40.230 align:middle line:90%
It is your experience.

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:44.701 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: When you described
essentially your unique form

00:56:44.701 --> 00:56:46.770 align:middle line:84%
of sort of out of body
experience during that event.

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:48.171 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yeah, that
blowing apart thing.

00:56:48.171 --> 00:56:49.205 align:middle line:90%
>> Bassagio: That expansion.

00:56:49.205 --> 00:56:50.306 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: That was real.

00:56:50.306 --> 00:56:51.608 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: I know
exactly what you felt.

00:56:51.608 --> 00:56:54.611 align:middle line:84%
You felt as if you were both
more expanded and heavier.

00:56:54.611 --> 00:56:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And the Kundalini,
the stimulation

00:56:56.980 --> 00:56:59.115 align:middle line:84%
of the central nervous
system was almost painful.

00:56:59.115 --> 00:57:00.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: It was painful, yeah.

00:57:00.550 --> 00:57:01.785 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: That's
exactly what I experienced

00:57:01.785 --> 00:57:03.887 align:middle line:90%
when I came back to the --

00:57:03.887 --> 00:57:05.789 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So that's
your experience.

00:57:05.789 --> 00:57:08.424 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: So I've
gone to New Mexico

00:57:08.424 --> 00:57:12.061 align:middle line:84%
and identified small
pieces of local folklore

00:57:12.061 --> 00:57:15.165 align:middle line:84%
in Old Town Albuquerque
that nobody but somebody

00:57:15.165 --> 00:57:17.367 align:middle line:84%
who would have spent
time there would know.

00:57:17.367 --> 00:57:20.003 align:middle line:84%
And my four older siblings are
still alive and could testify

00:57:20.003 --> 00:57:22.972 align:middle line:84%
to the fact that, no,
Andrew was with us

00:57:22.972 --> 00:57:26.142 align:middle line:84%
in our Chevy station wagon when
we crossed southern New Mexico

00:57:26.142 --> 00:57:30.947 align:middle line:84%
in November of 1972 after
Parsons had moved to Los Angeles

00:57:30.947 --> 00:57:34.184 align:middle line:84%
from New York City on
its way to Pasadena.

00:57:34.184 --> 00:57:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And there would have been no
reason for him to walk to,

00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:40.256 align:middle line:84%
drive, take a plane, train
or automobile to New Mexico.

00:57:40.256 --> 00:57:41.558 align:middle line:90%
It didn't happen.

00:57:41.558 --> 00:57:44.027 align:middle line:84%
So they would deny that I'd
ever been in New Mexico.

00:57:44.027 --> 00:57:49.032 align:middle line:84%
How then am I full of all these
local folkloric kind of stories

00:57:49.032 --> 00:57:50.600 align:middle line:90%
from Old Town Albuquerque,

00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:52.502 align:middle line:84%
literally the area there
near the restaurants

00:57:52.502 --> 00:57:56.573 align:middle line:84%
and the San Filipe
De Neri Church there.

00:57:56.573 --> 00:57:57.907 align:middle line:90%
That long time friends

00:57:57.907 --> 00:58:00.043 align:middle line:84%
of my father had lived
there their whole lives.

00:58:00.043 --> 00:58:02.712 align:middle line:84%
I became basically a
child who was being raised

00:58:02.712 --> 00:58:05.715 align:middle line:84%
in two different
realities of the verdant,

00:58:05.715 --> 00:58:09.752 align:middle line:84%
the green grassy suburb of New
Jersey where our house was,

00:58:09.752 --> 00:58:12.789 align:middle line:84%
and then taking these periodic
trips via teleportation

00:58:12.789 --> 00:58:13.623 align:middle line:90%
to New Mexico.

00:58:13.623 --> 00:58:14.824 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And the reality is

00:58:14.824 --> 00:58:19.362 align:middle line:84%
that the quantum sciences
are validating that time

00:58:19.362 --> 00:58:22.565 align:middle line:84%
and space is not what we
think, that time is not linear.

00:58:22.565 --> 00:58:27.337 align:middle line:84%
So if we can embrace this notion
scientifically then why can't we

00:58:27.337 --> 00:58:29.239 align:middle line:90%
embrace it experientially?

00:58:29.239 --> 00:58:30.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Bassagio: Right.

00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:33.343 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, the fact that
my beliefs that I had been

00:58:33.343 --> 00:58:35.879 align:middle line:84%
in the project were
not internal or driven

00:58:35.879 --> 00:58:40.316 align:middle line:84%
by some other non-experiential
process was evident in things

00:58:40.316 --> 00:58:43.920 align:middle line:84%
like talking to the
waitress in Madrid

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:46.789 align:middle line:90%
who said, sure, in 1974 --

00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:48.691 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Right, exactly, yeah,
those kids were jumping through.

00:58:48.691 --> 00:58:50.693 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: I heard in
kindergarten that residents

00:58:50.693 --> 00:58:53.229 align:middle line:84%
of Santa Fe were seeing
children suddenly appear

00:58:53.229 --> 00:58:54.430 align:middle line:90%
in the State Capital complex.

00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:57.767 align:middle line:84%
I mean I have hundreds of
confirmations like that.

00:58:57.767 --> 00:59:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So we only have
a couple minutes left now.

00:59:01.070 --> 00:59:03.473 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
was the greatest,

00:59:03.473 --> 00:59:08.578 align:middle line:84%
most disconcerting
experience or remembrance

00:59:08.578 --> 00:59:10.847 align:middle line:84%
of what had happened
during all of this?

00:59:10.847 --> 00:59:14.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: Well, I have to
say it was literally seeing one

00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:17.520 align:middle line:84%
of my same age peer lose
his feet when he arrived

00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:20.423 align:middle line:84%
in an abandoned junior high
school grounds in Santa Fe,

00:59:20.423 --> 00:59:21.758 align:middle line:90%
not the State Capital complex.

00:59:21.758 --> 00:59:24.394 align:middle line:84%
They were often using
different abandoned school sites

00:59:24.394 --> 00:59:27.797 align:middle line:84%
to house the time travel
technology for us to arrive

00:59:27.797 --> 00:59:30.133 align:middle line:90%
in that year or what have you.

00:59:30.133 --> 00:59:32.969 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was he
suddenly materialized --

00:59:32.969 --> 00:59:34.871 align:middle line:90%
or the vortal tunnel closed --

00:59:34.871 --> 00:59:36.306 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Before his
feet were through?

00:59:36.306 --> 00:59:37.674 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: Well,
before his feet were

00:59:37.674 --> 00:59:40.410 align:middle line:84%
through because he arrived
standing in three inches

00:59:40.410 --> 00:59:41.711 align:middle line:90%
of water that had collected

00:59:41.711 --> 00:59:45.048 align:middle line:84%
in the basement of
a public fountain.

00:59:45.048 --> 00:59:48.952 align:middle line:84%
And hence the specific gravity
of the water impeded the arrival

00:59:48.952 --> 00:59:50.787 align:middle line:84%
of his feet below the
middle of his ankles.

00:59:50.787 --> 00:59:51.688 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Did he
have to go the rest

00:59:51.688 --> 00:59:53.122 align:middle line:90%
of his life then, what, how?

00:59:53.122 --> 00:59:54.824 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: Well, he
basically slid off his ankles

00:59:54.824 --> 00:59:56.759 align:middle line:84%
as if they had been
passed through a bandsaw

00:59:56.759 --> 00:59:58.394 align:middle line:90%
through the middle of the ankle.

00:59:58.394 --> 01:00:00.763 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Did he live the rest
of his life with prosthetics or?

01:00:00.763 --> 01:00:02.899 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: The accident
cauterized the wound

01:00:02.899 --> 01:00:04.767 align:middle line:90%
so he wasn't bleeding to death.

01:00:04.767 --> 01:00:08.237 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see him tumble
off his ankles essentially,

01:00:08.237 --> 01:00:09.906 align:middle line:90%
slide off his ankles.

01:00:09.906 --> 01:00:11.240 align:middle line:90%
But I did see him on the ground.

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:13.242 align:middle line:84%
There was already a team leader
holding him to the ground

01:00:13.242 --> 01:00:14.911 align:middle line:84%
so he wouldn't be
further injured.

01:00:14.911 --> 01:00:16.446 align:middle line:84%
But it disconcerts
me to this day

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:19.482 align:middle line:84%
that he was yelling
my feet, my feet.

01:00:19.482 --> 01:00:24.921 align:middle line:84%
I'm only nine years old, what am
I going to do without any feet?

01:00:24.921 --> 01:00:27.790 align:middle line:84%
That was pretty horrific
to witness that accident.

01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:29.359 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And then we
only have a minute left.

01:00:29.359 --> 01:00:31.060 align:middle line:84%
What was the more
glorious part about this?

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:32.295 align:middle line:90%
>> Bassagio: I have to say

01:00:32.295 --> 01:00:33.763 align:middle line:84%
that meeting General
Washington was the high point

01:00:33.763 --> 01:00:36.432 align:middle line:84%
because he was truly
larger than life.

01:00:36.432 --> 01:00:42.805 align:middle line:84%
He was this dynamic, active,
positive, charismatic presence,

01:00:42.805 --> 01:00:46.009 align:middle line:84%
and it's easy to see how he
could have been the principle

01:00:46.009 --> 01:00:47.577 align:middle line:90%
founder of a great nation.

01:00:47.577 --> 01:00:50.780 align:middle line:84%
He was a superlative
human being.

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:52.682 align:middle line:84%
He scintillated with
positive energy

01:00:52.682 --> 01:00:55.752 align:middle line:84%
that almost made him look
illuminated physically.

01:00:55.752 --> 01:00:58.521 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Many say he
was sort of at the base

01:00:58.521 --> 01:01:01.491 align:middle line:84%
of the brotherhood and of the
Freemasons in a higher order.

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:02.625 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: Well,
different generations

01:01:02.625 --> 01:01:04.694 align:middle line:84%
of Freemasons have done
things for good or ill.

01:01:04.694 --> 01:01:05.728 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: That's right.

01:01:05.728 --> 01:01:06.496 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: I think
he was definitely

01:01:06.496 --> 01:01:07.764 align:middle line:90%
on the side of the light.

01:01:07.764 --> 01:01:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And I would just consider
the great accomplishments

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.068 align:middle line:84%
of the United Stated
to say that.

01:01:12.068 --> 01:01:15.505 align:middle line:84%
But he was just simply an
astonishing human being.

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:17.974 align:middle line:84%
And when I look back at what
I've witnessed as a result

01:01:17.974 --> 01:01:20.910 align:middle line:84%
of interacting with him, and
then as a history buff realize

01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:23.746 align:middle line:84%
that I also played that
kind of informing role

01:01:23.746 --> 01:01:26.716 align:middle line:84%
in an important event in the
revolution and the becoming

01:01:26.716 --> 01:01:29.719 align:middle line:84%
of the United States of America
I feel very proud that I able

01:01:29.719 --> 01:01:31.220 align:middle line:84%
to be given that
cosmic privilege

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:33.122 align:middle line:84%
to interact with
him in that way.

01:01:33.122 --> 01:01:34.323 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, Andrew,
there are no words

01:01:34.323 --> 01:01:35.858 align:middle line:90%
for the life you've led.

01:01:35.858 --> 01:01:38.494 align:middle line:84%
I thank you very much
for sharing them with us.

01:01:38.494 --> 01:01:39.462 align:middle line:84%
>> Bassagio: Thank
you for having me.

01:01:39.462 --> 01:01:40.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Just amazing
experiences.

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:41.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Bassagio: Thank you.

01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:42.732 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And amazing life.

01:01:42.732 --> 01:01:44.067 align:middle line:90%
>> Bassagio: Thank you, Regina.

01:01:44.067 --> 01:01:45.935 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: If there's one
big takeaway here besides the

01:01:45.935 --> 01:01:47.637 align:middle line:84%
incredible technology
on the planet it is

01:01:47.637 --> 01:01:51.340 align:middle line:84%
that the human mind is for more
expansive than we have imagined.

01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:54.744 align:middle line:84%
It is, in fact, our birthright
to see beyond time and space

01:01:54.744 --> 01:01:56.612 align:middle line:90%
if we choose to activate that.

01:01:56.612 --> 01:02:00.716 align:middle line:84%
Until next time thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
