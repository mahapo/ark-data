00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.360 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
It's my privilege

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.000 align:middle line:10%
to have Raymond Tarpey
back with us again.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.085 align:middle line:84%
A scholar, teacher and linguist
he helps us wrap our minds

00:00:35.085 --> 00:00:37.460 align:middle line:84%
around the connectedness
between past [? high ? ] periods

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.400 align:middle line:84%
of history and the true
destiny of humankind.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.100 align:middle line:84%
Today, we'll speak about
what Sir Francis Bacon called

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.380 align:middle line:84%
the New Atlantis in
the 16th century, which

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.320 align:middle line:90%
of course, is America, right?

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.727 align:middle line:84%
And I find-- well,
there's so much

00:00:50.727 --> 00:00:52.310 align:middle line:84%
that's fascinating
in the story, which

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.100 align:middle line:84%
is why we're kind of calling
this the New Atlantis.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.960 align:middle line:84%
But there are
several other themes

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.500 align:middle line:84%
that are going to be woven
into America's destiny

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.550 align:middle line:90%
as the new Atlantis.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.550 align:middle line:84%
But before we get to that, I'm
sure our viewers have noticed

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.650 align:middle line:90%
we have a friend with us.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:06.566 align:middle line:90%
>>RAYMOND TARPEY: Yes.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.750 align:middle line:90%
His name is Earth Keeper.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And Earth Keeper was given to
me during the 11/11/11 Crystal

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.450 align:middle line:84%
Skulls Conference
in Los Angeles.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's when I met you.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And I met you, I
think within an hour

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.250 align:middle line:84%
after you were
given Earth Keeper.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.790 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: That's right.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And so it was a
very exciting time.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.250 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about-- because we
are going to-- crystal, crystal

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.320 align:middle line:84%
technology, Crystal Skulls will
come into this conversation.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.010 align:middle line:84%
So I would like to just launch
into this for a few moments,

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.830 align:middle line:90%
if you don't mind.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:36.630 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Sure.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Since you've developed
a very deep relationship

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.880 align:middle line:84%
with Earth Keeper
from the moment

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.870 align:middle line:84%
you met him until now, which is
another 6 and 1/2 years later.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about the journey
between the two of you

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.760 align:middle line:84%
and where he's
taking you and what

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.620 align:middle line:90%
his destiny is on the planet.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.530 align:middle line:10%
>>TARPEY: Well, it's gone
from shock to intimacy,

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.410 align:middle line:10%
because I never expected to
just have Earth Keeper just come

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.460 align:middle line:10%
at me.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.450 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Again,
tell us who he is

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.130 align:middle line:10%
and where he's from
and all that, too.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.500 align:middle line:10%
>>TARPEY: He is--

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.440 align:middle line:10%
I hate to use the
word "he/she/it."

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.060 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't describe.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.810 align:middle line:84%
It's an agate crystal skull,
which means it's of the moon.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.810 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Cayce said
agate is of the moon.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.090 align:middle line:90%
And it's the grayish blue.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.710 align:middle line:90%
And it's filled with animals.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.480 align:middle line:90%
And my teacher is in there.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.520 align:middle line:84%
It's an ancient lady
from the Pacific.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.290 align:middle line:84%
It looks like a Japanese or
a Chinese lady with a child.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And so she is my teacher
within the skull.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.800 align:middle line:84%
But within the skull, there
are 276,000 entities in there

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.120 align:middle line:84%
that give testimony from
many different lifetimes.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And Earth Keeper has become
my companion during readings.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And then, I dare to say things
that I never said before

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.690 align:middle line:90%
as a Mayan calendar reader.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:57.950 align:middle line:90%
So that has been the gift.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.770 align:middle line:90%
And also, my responsibility.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.490 align:middle line:84%
I have to watch out where he
is, that he's comfortable.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And I feel a sense of
guilt if I don't take care.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.320 align:middle line:84%
I have the
guardianship and I have

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.690 align:middle line:84%
to keep focused on where
he is and what's going on.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And our relationship becomes
more and more intimate

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.000 align:middle line:90%
as we go.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And has he been able to
share with you-- having

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.870 align:middle line:84%
all of this knowledge from
the past, share with you

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.960 align:middle line:84%
also some of the destiny
of where we're going?

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.880 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes, he has.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.210 align:middle line:84%
It comes as I read because
he's right there as I'm

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.080 align:middle line:84%
reading and doing my research
and doing my meditations.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.410 align:middle line:90%
And he has his part in there.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.380 align:middle line:84%
Because many times I look up
because a strange thought comes

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.510 align:middle line:90%
from in and among the words.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's just like a
crystal that you find in

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.370 align:middle line:90%
between and among the words.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.060 align:middle line:90%
And I look at him.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.575 align:middle line:84%
And I go, it's like
Tom Hanks in "Castaway"

00:04:00.575 --> 00:04:02.800 align:middle line:90%
is looking at Wilson.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wilson.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.630 align:middle line:84%
I bet he has more
insight than Wilson.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.220 align:middle line:84%
Though, Wilson was a
good and true companion.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.803 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Was an
important thing, yes.

00:04:08.803 --> 00:04:10.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:11.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.088 align:middle line:84%
Now, one other
little, quick thing.

00:04:13.088 --> 00:04:15.130 align:middle line:84%
You looked at the numerol--
not the numerology,

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.180 align:middle line:84%
but astrology before we
did this interview today,

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.860 align:middle line:84%
which you tend to
take everything

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:19.910 align:middle line:90%
in a very mindful way.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.060 align:middle line:84%
That if this is a gathering
between the two of us,

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.700 align:middle line:84%
or you and someone else where
it's important, you look at it.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.110 align:middle line:90%
And you found an interesting--.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.610 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:35.060 align:middle line:84%
I decided the night before
last that I should check out

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.520 align:middle line:84%
why it is that we are
to come together again

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.870 align:middle line:90%
after six and a half years.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And as I looked, I found
out this is a day named

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.890 align:middle line:84%
[NON-ENGLISH],,
which translates--

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.180 align:middle line:84%
in the Mayan calendar, there
are two sets, main sets,

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.630 align:middle line:90%
of important numbers.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.150 align:middle line:84%
In the Americas, the two
most important numbers

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.245 align:middle line:90%
are 20 and 13.

00:05:00.245 --> 00:05:03.590 align:middle line:90%


00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.800 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the greatest
verifications of the validity

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:14.240 align:middle line:84%
of the calendar because a
5,125-year-long count of Mayan

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:20.225 align:middle line:84%
calendar ended at the
cusp of 2012 and 2013.

00:05:20.225 --> 00:05:21.480 align:middle line:90%
20 and 13.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.876 align:middle line:90%
So that's amazing.

00:05:22.876 --> 00:05:23.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.630 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And of the 13,
today is the number 2.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.170 align:middle line:84%
And of the 20, it
is the number 5.

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.900 align:middle line:90%
And put them together, it's 25.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.800 align:middle line:84%
I just thought of this--
now I know he's working--

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.770 align:middle line:90%
that 25 is the 12 plus the 13.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And the sacred
number of Eurasia,

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.150 align:middle line:84%
where most of the newer
people came from--

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.060 align:middle line:84%
not the indigenous people
here, but the new people--

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:58.370 align:middle line:84%
came in the 1500s and
1600s, even the late 1400s.

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:59.590 align:middle line:90%
They're from Eurasia.

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And the sacred number
in Eurasia is 12.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.330 align:middle line:90%
12 knights of the round table.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.160 align:middle line:90%
12 months of the year.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.570 align:middle line:90%
12 people on the jury.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.060 align:middle line:90%
12 lost tribes.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.410 align:middle line:90%
12 tribes of Israel.

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.240 align:middle line:90%
I could go on and on.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:18.280 align:middle line:84%
Here in the Americas,
the sacred number is 13.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.580 align:middle line:84%
It started at the beginning,
because the last colony

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.420 align:middle line:84%
to enter, quite
surprisingly, was Georgia.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.030 align:middle line:90%
And Georgia became number 13.

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:33.190 align:middle line:84%
And that sealed the destiny
because the people from Eurasia

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:36.700 align:middle line:84%
would love for it
to have been 12.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.700 align:middle line:84%
Only the Masons understood
that it's now 13.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.960 align:middle line:84%
That this is a different
spiritual place, a sector

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.970 align:middle line:90%
of the world that's different.

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.480 align:middle line:84%
That has its own
unique read testimony.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And so it's just interesting
how that worked out.

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And I found that out
from Edgar Casey.

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:00.790 align:middle line:84%
Also, he said that the lands
of the Americas and Atlantis

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:04.600 align:middle line:90%
are the red residence places.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which are?

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:08.590 align:middle line:90%
The Americas?

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:09.820 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: All the Americas.

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.320 align:middle line:84%
All the Americas,
North and South.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.970 align:middle line:90%
The two big pieces.

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And the Maya, as it turns out,
are right at the crossroads

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.900 align:middle line:84%
in between the two big pieces
at the heart of the Americas,

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.490 align:middle line:90%
Central America.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:25.150 align:middle line:10%
And as it stood
in ancient times,

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:32.180 align:middle line:10%
the Maya were right in between
the two great lost continents,

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.900 align:middle line:10%
Lemuria and Atlantis.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:39.376 align:middle line:10%
So they were very well fixed
for a civilization unparalleled.

00:07:39.376 --> 00:07:45.277 align:middle line:10%
A civilization that shocks
and surprises the deeper I go.

00:07:45.277 --> 00:07:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the Mayan-- as you
say, they sat between the two.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:48.660 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So at the
sinking and/or destruction

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.960 align:middle line:84%
of one or the other,
there were beings,

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.460 align:middle line:84%
people that were
able to emigrate

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.660 align:middle line:90%
from there to the Mayan lands.

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.699 align:middle line:84%
So they had the
influence of both?

00:08:01.699 --> 00:08:02.740 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: That's correct.

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is one of the
only places on Earth, right?

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:05.540 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Right.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That has
the confluence--

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:07.386 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Right there.

00:08:07.386 --> 00:08:09.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --of
Lemurian and Atlantean.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:09.850 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:12.190 align:middle line:84%
It's a very thin
place right there.

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And the Maya was
set right there.

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Cayce's readings opened
a whole new dimension for me

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.580 align:middle line:84%
in history and
the way to see it.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And he describes the émigrés
coming from Atlantis after

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.190 align:middle line:90%
the destructions.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:33.190 align:middle line:84%
There were three
main destructions,

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:40.390 align:middle line:84%
probably about 52,000 years
ago and 26,000 years ago.

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And then finally,
13,000 years ago.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:46.320 align:middle line:84%
I put them in terms
of Mayan numbers

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.520 align:middle line:84%
because those are
three powerful numbers.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And there were
émigrés that came out.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.950 align:middle line:84%
The most famous of which
mentioned by Edgar Cayce

00:08:56.950 --> 00:09:01.960 align:middle line:84%
is a soul called Iltar
of the house of Aztlan.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.640 align:middle line:10%
And that was the
house of Atlantis.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.240 align:middle line:10%
And the Aztecs
said that they came

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.950 align:middle line:10%
from the place called Aztlan.

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:13.330 align:middle line:10%
So it's a confirmation of that
happening in ancient times.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And he came with a group,
I believe it was 10,

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:23.140 align:middle line:84%
and built some of the first
temples in these Mayan lands.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And Edgar Cayce went on to
say that the people of Mu

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:31.330 align:middle line:84%
had been coming
for millennia here.

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I first began
to study the Maya because I

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:37.450 align:middle line:90%
could see China underneath.

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:40.375 align:middle line:84%
As I explained in
our first meeting,

00:09:40.375 --> 00:09:43.780 align:middle line:84%
that there were only two
cultures in the world

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:48.070 align:middle line:84%
that esteemed jade above
gold, the Maya and China.

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And the Maya have a
glyph of the goddess

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:53.050 align:middle line:90%
of the moon with the rabbit.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:54.990 align:middle line:90%
Only the Chinese have that.

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:57.740 align:middle line:84%
It's a very ancient,
ancient story.

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.110 align:middle line:84%
So there are ancient
connections here.

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
love to study about.

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:04.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you do a
beautiful job, by the way.

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:07.640 align:middle line:84%
Everybody can look
into your work.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:13.060 align:middle line:84%
So with Lemuria or Mu, some
of the emigration from there

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:16.420 align:middle line:84%
went as far North, as my
understanding is, even

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:17.920 align:middle line:90%
to what is now California.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.270 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: That's correct.

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:20.830 align:middle line:90%
Cayce talked a lot about Mt.

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:24.190 align:middle line:90%
Shasta as a place of Lemuria.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:27.480 align:middle line:84%
Because the Pacific
plate is right next

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.460 align:middle line:90%
to and underneath us.

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:30.830 align:middle line:90%
So Mu is underneath us.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:32.640 align:middle line:90%
And that gives us a new--

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.450 align:middle line:84%
I just found this out
studying the Hopi.

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And many of the
American Indians say

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:38.914 align:middle line:90%
they emerged from underneath.

00:10:38.914 --> 00:10:39.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:43.320 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And so this sort
of is a corroboration.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.690 align:middle line:84%
That's why I think
I'm stationed now

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:48.800 align:middle line:84%
in southwest part of
the United States.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.380 align:middle line:84%
That's an area around
Arizona and the Four Corners,

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:55.660 align:middle line:84%
where I'm set to do
this kind of research.

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:56.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:00.240 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to seem like
we're going tangential a bit,

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.800 align:middle line:84%
but I want to introduce
another place that

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.890 align:middle line:84%
has remained kind of
mysterious regarding Atlantis.

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And again, some
of the emigration

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:12.180 align:middle line:84%
from Atlantis before it
went down the final time.

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:15.727 align:middle line:90%
Or even earlier than that.

00:11:15.727 --> 00:11:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, at least
one of the times--

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:19.170 align:middle line:84%
it was over a long
period of time

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:20.590 align:middle line:90%
that that event took place.

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:23.460 align:middle line:84%
So there was a lot of time for
people to move off the land.

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:25.670 align:middle line:90%
They had notice.

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:28.140 align:middle line:84%
So we have-- from
Lemuria, we have

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:29.670 align:middle line:90%
California all the way up Mt.

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:35.189 align:middle line:84%
Shasta, and the Mayan lands, and
down the coast of South America

00:11:35.189 --> 00:11:37.480 align:middle line:84%
that were populated by some
of the people from Lemuria,

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.010 align:middle line:90%
correct?

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:38.949 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes, yes.

00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:40.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where else
did some of the people

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.780 align:middle line:90%
from the original Lemuria go?

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.730 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: They went
all around the world.

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:46.930 align:middle line:90%
They were really missionaries.

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:48.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:52.320 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: I think their
migrations were even much

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.510 align:middle line:90%
heavier than the Atlanteans.

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Because as a
theosophical Society,

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:02.040 align:middle line:84%
Madame Blavatsky found
that they were in India.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.570 align:middle line:90%
They were in Burma.

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And so all around
the world feels

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.930 align:middle line:84%
that Pacific, peaceful
influence of Mu.

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:13.980 align:middle line:84%
It is famous for
not being as active.

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:17.670 align:middle line:84%
Casey described the Atlanteans
as having very active souls,

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:18.570 align:middle line:90%
entrepreneurial.

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:20.880 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: The Lemurians
are different.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:21.838 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: More passive.

00:12:21.838 --> 00:12:23.760 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: As are the
Asian peoples themselves.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.540 align:middle line:84%
They're more reticent to
speak than in the West.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about
Tibet and Nepal?

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:30.670 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Right there.

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And because of the Tibetans at
the other side of the world,

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:37.710 align:middle line:90%
the similarities are incredible.

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And during the '70s, at the time
of the hippies when the Indians

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:45.840 align:middle line:84%
got more hope that possibly
these people could change--

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm taking some credit
for that, by the way.

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.544 align:middle line:90%
It was a hippie for a long time.

00:12:50.544 --> 00:12:51.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Please do.

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:54.210 align:middle line:90%


00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:57.930 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And the Tibetans got
very close in the Southwest

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:02.890 align:middle line:84%
to the Hopi and to other
tribes in the Southwest.

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And they found
their common ground.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And so there are many societies
now where the grandmothers are

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:11.370 align:middle line:84%
together with the
Tibetan Buddhists

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:15.030 align:middle line:84%
and working together and
meeting together all the time.

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:19.620 align:middle line:84%
I am a member of that
group in Phoenix, Arizona,

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.900 align:middle line:90%
called the Circle of Friends.

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:25.200 align:middle line:84%
It's a Tibetan Buddhist group,
but the American Indians

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.801 align:middle line:84%
are very much a part of our
meetings and consultations.

00:13:28.801 --> 00:13:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
common denominator

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.660 align:middle line:84%
is the influence
from Lemuria or Mu?

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:33.870 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes, yes.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:37.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what would you say
was the nature of what they--

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:39.170 align:middle line:84%
you say they're kind
of missionaries?

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:39.970 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:42.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Of what the nature
of the message or knowledge

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.710 align:middle line:90%
they propagated?

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:45.810 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: The nature is peace.

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:50.760 align:middle line:84%
The nature is in making
sacrifices inside the self,

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.740 align:middle line:90%
not outside the self.

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And the building
of proper temples.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And the temples
with the stones that

00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:01.380 align:middle line:84%
are round before the
altars as Edgar Cayce said.

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.710 align:middle line:90%
And in the step pyramids.

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And in just a Pacific,
the ocean is well-named,

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:10.850 align:middle line:90%
the Pacific nature.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And Edgar Cayce mentioned
that of all the civilizations

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:17.730 align:middle line:84%
in the entire
history of humankind

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:20.250 align:middle line:84%
according to the
Akashic record, those

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:23.990 align:middle line:84%
that reach the highest level
of spiritual civilization

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:27.040 align:middle line:90%
were the Mu Lemurians.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:27.840 align:middle line:90%
Some people--

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:28.625 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's my
understanding as well.

00:14:28.625 --> 00:14:29.500 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: --will say,
well, that's early.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:30.690 align:middle line:90%
It's early.

00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:32.160 align:middle line:90%
And so they were more ethereal--

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:32.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.040 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: --than later on.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:34.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.310 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: There is that
area to qualify it also.

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:38.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.890 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't necessarily
be in human form

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:42.470 align:middle line:90%
exactly as we are right now.

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:45.310 align:middle line:84%
There was a lighter essence
to us or them at that time.

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:46.110 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:46.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:49.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's look at the
influences from Atlantis

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:52.980 align:middle line:84%
and we'll work our way
toward the New Atlantis.

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And I think one area of the
world I've always been curious

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:58.860 align:middle line:84%
about is according to
some of the ancient texts,

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:02.370 align:middle line:84%
the last remaining
visible part of Atlantis

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:05.190 align:middle line:84%
is the tip of Mount
Picos in the Azores.

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And people do
wonder for example,

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.420 align:middle line:84%
about the Basque region
and their Basque language.

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:12.060 align:middle line:90%


00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.460 align:middle line:84%
We know Atlanteans went
into the area of Portugal

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:17.307 align:middle line:84%
and many other places
when it went East.

00:15:17.307 --> 00:15:19.390 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about the
Basque region, for example?

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:19.500 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yeah.

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.870 align:middle line:84%
The Basque region is right
there in the Pyrenees

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:23.360 align:middle line:90%
between France and Spain.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:27.960 align:middle line:84%
So they've always been in
some irregular relationships

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.410 align:middle line:90%
with those two larger cultures.

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:32.070 align:middle line:90%
But they're so strong.

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:35.040 align:middle line:84%
They managed to keep
their independence.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And their language,
Euskera is ancient.

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:40.830 align:middle line:90%
We can't trace it.

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Most of the, if not all,
of the European languages

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:45.540 align:middle line:90%
are from India.

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:47.400 align:middle line:90%
So they're Indo-European.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.500 align:middle line:90%
And they conjugate their verbs.

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.610 align:middle line:90%
Basque is another story.

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:52.960 align:middle line:90%
And we don't know.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:56.269 align:middle line:84%
There's Edgar Cayce said that
the Basques were from Atlantis.

00:15:56.269 --> 00:15:57.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
why I'm asking that.

00:15:57.810 --> 00:15:58.610 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:15:58.610 --> 00:15:59.409 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:59.409 --> 00:16:02.100 align:middle line:84%
That it would seem to be because
it doesn't fit in any other--

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:04.170 align:middle line:84%
their language doesn't
fit in another pattern.

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And like you say, the strength
of the species themselves.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.100 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:08.900 align:middle line:90%
The power.

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:12.400 align:middle line:84%
Because once you have a memory
of your achievement in history,

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.240 align:middle line:84%
even on a subconscious
level you tend

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:19.100 align:middle line:84%
to have a more resistive
power to the overtaking of you

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:22.860 align:middle line:84%
by others who wish to just
sort of rub you out as they

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:24.990 align:middle line:90%
say in the history books.

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:26.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:27.972 align:middle line:84%
Well, and from
Atlantis also-- again,

00:16:27.972 --> 00:16:29.430 align:middle line:84%
depending on whether
you're talking

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:32.010 align:middle line:84%
about the first or second
or third destruction, each

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:34.630 align:middle line:90%
of which were different.

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:37.560 align:middle line:84%
Again, the people emigrated
all over the planet.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:38.700 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:43.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And my understanding
is that because there was high

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:44.367 align:middle line:90%
technology--

00:16:44.367 --> 00:16:46.200 align:middle line:84%
and this is a part that
often gets left out.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.730 align:middle line:84%
We're looking for
land bridges when,

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:50.147 align:middle line:84%
in fact, if you have flight,
you don't need a land bridge.

00:16:50.147 --> 00:16:51.188 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: That's correct.

00:16:51.188 --> 00:16:52.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can
pretty much deposit

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:56.270 align:middle line:84%
people, whatever you wish,
around the planet as you wish.

00:16:56.270 --> 00:17:00.770 align:middle line:84%
So let's just say there
was flight at that time.

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And there were also
adjacent lands.

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:08.430 align:middle line:84%
How did you see that emigration
happening away from Atlantis,

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:11.280 align:middle line:84%
starting first, second,
and third destructions?

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: I think it
was people in a panic.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And there were both groups
as Cayce described them,

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:23.089 align:middle line:84%
the sons of Belial and
the followers of the One,

00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:27.930 align:middle line:84%
or the children of the Law
of One as Cayce called them.

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:32.730 align:middle line:84%
Those who were more
spiritually-oriented

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:35.220 align:middle line:84%
were the children
of the Law of One,

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:38.940 align:middle line:84%
because it's the knowledge that
we are not in small groups.

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:40.740 align:middle line:84%
We are in one large
group, which is

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:43.830 align:middle line:84%
the message of Buddha
and Jesus and Muhammad

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:49.770 align:middle line:84%
and every great teacher, that
we must join the large group.

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:52.104 align:middle line:84%
I ran into something-- if I
might diverge a little bit--

00:17:52.104 --> 00:17:52.903 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Please

00:17:52.903 --> 00:17:54.050 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: --at a gift shop.

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Please.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.550 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: A definition
of a small group as if

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:58.890 align:middle line:90%
the small group was talking.

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:01.210 align:middle line:84%
We have gotten
used to each other.

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:03.480 align:middle line:90%
We know each other for so long.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.370 align:middle line:90%
We know each part of us.

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:06.960 align:middle line:90%
We get along.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.580 align:middle line:84%
We don't necessarily
like each other,

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.275 align:middle line:90%
but we've learned to get along.

00:18:10.275 --> 00:18:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And we no longer
judge each other.

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:15.680 align:middle line:90%
We simply judge others together.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:17.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:21.000 align:middle line:84%
That's the definition
of a small group.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.840 align:middle line:84%
With that, let's talk about the
nature of the sons of Belial.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.570 align:middle line:90%
Sons and daughters, obviously.

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:26.550 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:29.760 align:middle line:84%
The sons of Belial are
those that come in.

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.710 align:middle line:90%
Everything is choice here.

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And they get attached
to the material world

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:37.380 align:middle line:84%
as all of the souls
that first came in.

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.450 align:middle line:84%
They were thought
forms in the beginning

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:42.130 align:middle line:84%
according to the
testimony of Edgar Cayce.

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And so they were just creating
things all around them.

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:48.930 align:middle line:90%
And it was play.

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:50.830 align:middle line:90%
It was fun in the dense field.

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:53.160 align:middle line:84%
But then, as they
got into it, they

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:56.120 align:middle line:84%
began to believe the
world that they were in

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.520 align:middle line:90%
and they forgot who they were.

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:04.230 align:middle line:84%
There are some that could
not remember any of it.

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, they're
completely blocked out.

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:08.650 align:middle line:90%
But it's choice.

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:10.680 align:middle line:90%
And this is a place of choice.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.990 align:middle line:90%
And there's no judgment.

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And some souls will
take more time.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:21.340 align:middle line:84%
But as much time as needed,
that's the time given.

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:23.910 align:middle line:90%
But there will be adjustments.

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:25.855 align:middle line:90%
and resets, I call them.

00:19:25.855 --> 00:19:27.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
do you mean by that?

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:28.896 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: An
adjustment or a reset

00:19:28.896 --> 00:19:31.530 align:middle line:90%
is when things are going wrong.

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:34.680 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Cayce called this
place laboratory earth.

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.420 align:middle line:90%
It's a giant classroom.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And so we're not allowed
to destroy the classroom

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:43.470 align:middle line:84%
because too many
souls are involved

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:46.180 align:middle line:84%
and too many contracts
have been made.

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And so if one life
form decides that they

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.870 align:middle line:84%
are more important
than all this and want

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:56.160 align:middle line:84%
to do things that would
destroy laboratory earth,

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.440 align:middle line:84%
then there are
gentle adjustments,

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.960 align:middle line:84%
and then there are
shake-ups that occur.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Earthquakes and the
destructions of Atlantis

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:06.870 align:middle line:84%
would be an example
of a heavy one.

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:07.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A final one.

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:08.100 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.390 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Which, as I said
to you once before I think,

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:11.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm into the minor adjustments,
not the major ones.

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, so am
I. Actually, I was in--

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:19.440 align:middle line:84%
Dolores Cannon
regressed me one time.

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.940 align:middle line:90%
About 15 years ago.

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And I was quite surprised
where I ended up.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.420 align:middle line:90%
I didn't plan on going there.

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:31.620 align:middle line:84%
But it was on the final hours
of the earliest breaking off

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:34.450 align:middle line:90%
or destruction of Atlantis.

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And what had happened
psychologically to us

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:40.800 align:middle line:84%
as a species and what
the life at that time

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.680 align:middle line:84%
was like, which was
actually beautiful.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.055 align:middle line:84%
This was before a lot of the
corruption of technologies

00:20:46.055 --> 00:20:47.040 align:middle line:90%
had really set in.

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.400 align:middle line:84%
We were using the
natural technologies.

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.350 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: It was sort
of the beginning--

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:50.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was the beginning--

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:50.925 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: --of that technology.

00:20:50.925 --> 00:20:53.341 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was the beginning
where a lot of the Lemurian

00:20:53.341 --> 00:20:55.142 align:middle line:84%
influence had already
migrated over into--

00:20:55.142 --> 00:20:55.942 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:20:55.942 --> 00:20:57.650 align:middle line:84%
The Lemurian crystals
were already there.

00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:59.580 align:middle line:84%
There was a correspondence
between the two.

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:00.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:04.240 align:middle line:84%
It was quite an interesting and
shocking thing to go through.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.510 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand,
it was known for so long.

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Many people with knowledge
had been taken out

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:11.550 align:middle line:84%
to preserve that
knowledge elsewhere.

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:13.340 align:middle line:90%
Others went down with the ship.

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:15.050 align:middle line:90%
And that was by design.

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:16.440 align:middle line:90%
By choice, too.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:19.960 align:middle line:84%
But one thing-- it's just
intersecting in my mind

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:20.760 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:25.170 align:middle line:84%
According to the Hermetic text,
Aegyptia, the earliest stages

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:28.330 align:middle line:84%
of Egypt, were
200,000 years ago.

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:29.529 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:21:29.529 --> 00:21:31.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about this confluence,

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.900 align:middle line:84%
because Egyptologists
are very confused.

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And they haven't even begun
to make their discoveries that

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:38.880 align:middle line:90%
are well under the sand still.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.860 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
where the migrations

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:44.970 align:middle line:84%
between early, early Egypt,
Lemuria, and Atlantis

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:45.820 align:middle line:90%
were taking place.

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:46.620 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:49.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The very earliest
one are prehistoric.

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And so some of them have
no records anywhere.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:56.370 align:middle line:84%
The thing is during
the destruction times,

00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:58.650 align:middle line:90%
there were emergencies.

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And people leave without
so much preparation.

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And they leave in chaotic
groups without planning.

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:09.570 align:middle line:84%
Although, during the
last destruction, Cayce

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:15.120 align:middle line:84%
talks about planning and groups
going an an orderly fashion.

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:20.170 align:middle line:84%
But they went and the
technology did not go with them.

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And if you bring that kind of
knowledge into another society,

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:27.060 align:middle line:84%
it's very difficult
for it to go through,

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:32.070 align:middle line:84%
except if there's an
extraordinarily invitational

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:36.870 align:middle line:84%
situation involved there, where
that technology can develop.

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And hints of it-- at least
hints of it can go on.

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think Egypt was
the beneficiary of that.

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:46.720 align:middle line:10%
But Egypt was also involved
in wars with Atlantis

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:50.000 align:middle line:10%
according to the testimony
in Plato's "Republic."

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:50.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:52.710 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And the great
wars that went on.

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:53.560 align:middle line:90%
And the Egyptians--

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:57.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're saying this was
when Atlantis and the peoples

00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:59.370 align:middle line:84%
had become more
militarily aggressive?

00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:00.657 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Right.

00:23:00.657 --> 00:23:02.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And Egypt was
in a very high state

00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:03.480 align:middle line:90%
still at that point.

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:06.750 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Around
13,000 years ago.

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And so when Solon,
the great lawmaker

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:12.150 align:middle line:90%
from Greece, who actually--

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:13.500 align:middle line:90%
because of the difference.

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:18.360 align:middle line:84%
It happened in Greece also
where the most powerful and rich

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:22.110 align:middle line:84%
people had all of the
riches and the poor people

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:24.140 align:middle line:90%
had nothing after a while.

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And so Solon made a law,
which was very dangerous law.

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:33.550 align:middle line:84%
He canceled all debts
in ancient Greece.

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And soon after that, he decided
to leave because he knew

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:38.760 align:middle line:90%
it would be dangerous for him.

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:41.250 align:middle line:84%
So he began his
travels of 10 years

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:46.770 align:middle line:84%
to get away from the chaos
that resulted afterwards.

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:50.280 align:middle line:84%
He visited Egypt, anyway,
at the temple of Sais.

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.870 align:middle line:84%
And the Egyptians told
him, oh, you Greeks.

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:53.670 align:middle line:90%
You're so young.

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:57.660 align:middle line:84%
You don't even know of the
great wars that occurred,

00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:58.780 align:middle line:90%
all that has happened.

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:01.800 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
helping us in the defeat

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.890 align:middle line:84%
of the Atlanteans,
those on the other side

00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:07.020 align:middle line:90%
of the Pillars of Hercules.

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And so Plato's testimony in
the "Critias" and the "Timaeus"

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:14.200 align:middle line:84%
is very important for
us now in this time.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.190 align:middle line:84%
So let's now move
into this time.

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:20.430 align:middle line:84%
Because you're talking about
who was the beneficiary

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:23.010 align:middle line:84%
of certain technologies
of a high nature.

00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And then, who was the
beneficiary of technologies

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:28.050 align:middle line:84%
that were mishandled
and misused,

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:30.090 align:middle line:84%
which is expressing
itself again today.

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And you would have to say,
let's go to Francis Bacon.

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:36.990 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to the emergence
of the New Atlantis.

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:40.380 align:middle line:84%
What that actually means--
we'll get into definitions.

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And the misuse of
technology once again.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:44.130 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:48.060 align:middle line:84%
It began with the large animals
according to Edgar Cayce.

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:49.980 align:middle line:84%
There were large
animals there, which

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:52.020 align:middle line:84%
was a natural
process of laboratory

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:54.570 align:middle line:90%
earth and a challenge.

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And the Atlanteans were
the most active souls

00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:00.330 align:middle line:84%
according to Edgar Cayce,
the entrepreneurial souls.

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And they decided to take action
against the large animals,

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:08.540 align:middle line:84%
unaware that this had already
been planned for by nature.

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:10.380 align:middle line:84%
With the ice sheets
and everything else,

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:12.820 align:middle line:84%
that was all going
to be handled.

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:15.480 align:middle line:90%
But they were impatient.

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And so they began to fool
around with crystals.

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And they used those crystals,
much like some technology being

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.910 align:middle line:84%
used at this moment, to
bombard the stratosphere

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:28.910 align:middle line:90%
and the ionosphere with rays.

00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:31.610 align:middle line:90%
And it disturbed the weather.

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And it disturbed other
things within the Earth.

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:36.080 align:middle line:90%
And that was the cause--

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:39.320 align:middle line:84%
the beginning of the
wave of destruction

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:42.990 align:middle line:84%
that would plague
Atlantis from then on.

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:43.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:46.234 align:middle line:84%
Well, that opens up
a big can of worms.

00:25:46.234 --> 00:25:47.150 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:49.108 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because we're
right back there again.

00:25:49.108 --> 00:25:51.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a bugaboo
I have when people start

00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:55.490 align:middle line:84%
trying to get into the debate,
the kind of classical Fox News

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:59.830 align:middle line:84%
versus CNN and MSNBC debate
about global climate change.

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:03.380 align:middle line:84%
If you cannot take these hidden
technologies into account,

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:05.740 align:middle line:84%
you cannot intelligently
discuss that subject.

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:06.540 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: No.

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:07.998 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're
doing it again.

00:26:07.998 --> 00:26:10.070 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Well, we
are where we were.

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:11.810 align:middle line:90%
This is the New Atlantis.

00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:14.915 align:middle line:84%
But then again, "new" has
many shades of meaning.

00:26:14.915 --> 00:26:16.790 align:middle line:90%
"New" just means time.

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:19.790 align:middle line:84%
But "new" can also
mean a transformation.

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:20.720 align:middle line:90%
We're not sure yet.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.310 align:middle line:90%
It's all a matter of choice.

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:25.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you and I were
talking in prep on the phone

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.950 align:middle line:84%
about a week or so ago, we
were talking about a new start.

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:29.870 align:middle line:90%
And you made this distinction.

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:33.500 align:middle line:84%
The new start of an old
version or a new version

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:34.757 align:middle line:90%
of the previous Atlantis.

00:26:34.757 --> 00:26:35.715 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: That's right.

00:26:35.715 --> 00:26:38.048 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which alludes to
kind of what you were saying.

00:26:38.048 --> 00:26:42.020 align:middle line:84%
So let's get into the
prophecies, the potential,

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:46.190 align:middle line:84%
why Francis Bacon called
America the New Atlantis.

00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:47.060 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:50.330 align:middle line:84%
It's the new Atlantis because
they're fresh of mind.

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:51.680 align:middle line:90%
They're active.

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:55.700 align:middle line:90%
They took the best people.

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:58.040 align:middle line:84%
Really, the ones
that didn't fit.

00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.745 align:middle line:84%
The ones that wanted
their freedom.

00:27:00.745 --> 00:27:02.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Original
thinkers more?

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.050 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: The original thinkers.

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:04.580 align:middle line:90%
The ones that wouldn't go along.

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:07.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And criminals, which
are often original thinkers.

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:10.280 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: But
anyway, it's destiny.

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.550 align:middle line:90%
It was a time of great change.

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:13.970 align:middle line:90%
And they came here.

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And they came here
from all parts.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And then later on, they came
from all over the world.

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And it just became a new
character all together

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:23.850 align:middle line:90%
to this nation.

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And it is the promise
of the coming together.

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Because Edgar Cayce said
this was an invitation

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:34.970 align:middle line:84%
by the people of the
red residence field

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:39.350 align:middle line:84%
to the people of the Eurasian
white field for them to come.

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:42.110 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, they didn't
know it was an invitation.

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:45.280 align:middle line:84%
They thought it was just a
happening and an opportunity.

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And they thought they came
to conquer when actually they

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:49.940 align:middle line:90%
came to learn.

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As you say,
it became opportunism.

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:53.960 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:56.240 align:middle line:90%
The Conquistadors came.

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And Spain just wanted
to get rid of them.

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:01.190 align:middle line:84%
You know, keep soldiers
around after the war is over

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:03.740 align:middle line:84%
because they form
groups and pillage.

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And so they figured, go
someplace else and pillage.

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:08.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:09.130 align:middle line:90%
So send them over here.

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:10.070 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yeah.

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we have now, from
the 1600s, the view that this

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:16.920 align:middle line:90%
was the place of new thought?

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:17.720 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, let's progress
that forward to today.

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:21.140 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:23.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The technologies--
some of the technologies,

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:25.370 align:middle line:90%
not all, have re-emerged.

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:25.730 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:27.438 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The remembrances
are happening.

00:28:27.438 --> 00:28:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And certainly over the next,
I think couple lifetimes

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.270 align:middle line:84%
of people, we're going
to see, maybe almost

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:35.900 align:middle line:84%
a complete re-emergence of some
of those profound technologies

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:37.790 align:middle line:90%
of the Atlantean times.

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:39.210 align:middle line:90%
Evaluate for us.

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And then also,
maybe use whatever

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:43.710 align:middle line:84%
is in the Hopi
knowledge and legend.

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And even in Cayce's
knowledge and legend,

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:51.590 align:middle line:84%
what is supposed to happen
here, what the temptations are,

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:52.730 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:54.520 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Well, the
way I'd answer it

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:58.160 align:middle line:84%
is that Cayce said the
function of crystal

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:01.670 align:middle line:84%
is first, the communication
with other dimensions.

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:03.630 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's most meant for.

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:04.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:06.054 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: But it has
another flip-side,

00:29:06.054 --> 00:29:09.440 align:middle line:90%
which is of technological use.

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:11.350 align:middle line:90%
Because the crystal radio came.

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And crystal is the basis of our
computer technology-- silicon

00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:18.960 align:middle line:84%
crystal and
variations thereafter.

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really
a secondary use.

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:25.730 align:middle line:84%
But the humans, being who
we are, and especially

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:29.570 align:middle line:84%
the Atlanteans being so
active and entrepreneurial,

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:31.730 align:middle line:90%
they sort of ran with the ball.

00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And although Thomas Edison
said whatever human beings can

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:39.170 align:middle line:84%
come up with
technologically, they

00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:42.380 align:middle line:84%
have the character
that can handle it.

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:43.820 align:middle line:90%
They can do this.

00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:45.680 align:middle line:84%
The thing is it's
a matter of timing.

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Do we have the
time to control it?

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And do we have the strength
of people in this civilization

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:56.750 align:middle line:84%
to hold them off a little
bit from the playing,

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:58.430 align:middle line:84%
like they're doing
in the ionosphere?

00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:59.125 align:middle line:90%
Bombarding the ionosphere.

00:29:59.125 --> 00:30:00.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what I
was just going to bring up.

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:02.420 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Looking for
weather weapons again.

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:03.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Again?

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:03.830 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yeah.

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:04.940 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we're repeating.

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:06.200 align:middle line:90%
We're repeating.

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:09.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, I'm not a
doomsdayer in this way at all,

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:12.800 align:middle line:84%
because I do believe in
the spirit of the people

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.810 align:middle line:90%
to transcend that.

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:18.330 align:middle line:84%
Just as a-- maybe a different
question for a moment.

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:20.030 align:middle line:84%
Do you see the
makeup of the people

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:23.020 align:middle line:84%
in this land as
dominantly Atlantean,

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:26.485 align:middle line:84%
or is there the Lemurian
effect under there too?

00:30:26.485 --> 00:30:27.610 align:middle line:10%
>>TARPEY: They're all here.

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:27.990 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.600 align:middle line:10%
>>TARPEY: They're all here.

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:30.600 align:middle line:10%
Many different souls,
not only from there,

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.700 align:middle line:10%
from all different places.

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:36.270 align:middle line:84%
We don't know the choices
made in the bardo, which

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:39.990 align:middle line:84%
is the lifetimes in between,
many contracts are made

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:41.380 align:middle line:90%
and nobody is to be judged.

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:42.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:43.763 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Even
somebody that you think

00:30:43.763 --> 00:30:48.840 align:middle line:84%
is not right for the
civilization, or evil,

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.520 align:middle line:90%
we can't be too quick.

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:54.239 align:middle line:84%
Because some souls have taken
on roles to shake us up.

00:30:54.239 --> 00:30:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
there for a reason.

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:58.770 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: They are
there for a reason.

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:01.380 align:middle line:84%
They're like a
streak in the '70s,

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:03.540 align:middle line:84%
I remember in the
Academy Awards.

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And they used to have these
naked people streak across.

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:09.270 align:middle line:90%
And it streaked across.

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:10.800 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, wow.

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
there was a moment of thought.

00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:15.450 align:middle line:90%
That's what they're like.

00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to
respect and we have

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.804 align:middle line:90%
to wait and see what happens.

00:31:18.804 --> 00:31:20.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And maybe
see the people

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:22.532 align:middle line:84%
that we judge as more
simply a disruptive force.

00:31:22.532 --> 00:31:23.490 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: That's right.

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:25.489 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because the
program needs readjusting.

00:31:25.489 --> 00:31:26.790 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to be patient and
come out of the polarization.

00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:33.660 align:middle line:84%
That's sons of
Belial and children

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:36.090 align:middle line:90%
of the Law of One polarization.

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:38.580 align:middle line:84%
It means both sides, we're
not doing enough work

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:43.030 align:middle line:84%
to do their talking,
especially in smaller groups.

00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:45.240 align:middle line:84%
The talking must be
in smaller groups,

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.300 align:middle line:90%
not in the large groups.

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And democracy has
its limitations,

00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:55.920 align:middle line:84%
as the Eastertime ballot between
Barabbas and Jesus told us,

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:58.250 align:middle line:90%
votes can be manipulated.

00:31:58.250 --> 00:31:59.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right We know that.

00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:02.440 align:middle line:90%


00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:07.770 align:middle line:84%
So what was Edgar
Casey's prophecy

00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:11.190 align:middle line:84%
for this coming together
at this time in history?

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:14.070 align:middle line:84%
Aside from any earth
calamities, because we're

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:16.680 align:middle line:84%
familiar with his East
Coast/West Coast earth

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:17.940 align:middle line:90%
calamity processes.

00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And the being that I've spoken
with over the last 30 years

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:23.490 align:middle line:84%
said some of this
will be changed.

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:25.800 align:middle line:84%
Much is true, but
much will be averted

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:27.390 align:middle line:84%
because of the
consciousness shifting

00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:29.340 align:middle line:90%
and the people on the land.

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:30.660 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk about all of this?

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Edgar Cayce, I think
was very positive about it.

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:37.200 align:middle line:84%
It's all part of laboratory
earth-- the system,

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.270 align:middle line:90%
the process of choice.

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:42.300 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing to
worry about because,

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:44.890 align:middle line:84%
as I found in the
Course of Miracles--

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:49.500 align:middle line:84%
a wonderful program--
that we are invulnerable.

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:54.210 align:middle line:84%
If we could only know that as
souls, we are invulnerable.

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:57.090 align:middle line:84%
It's our fear of death that
gives us our limitations.

00:32:57.090 --> 00:32:57.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:00.000 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And our secrets
among each other that

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.010 align:middle line:90%
gives us our limitations.

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And so we-- whatever it
is, we can handle it.

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:07.620 align:middle line:90%
We can do it.

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:11.640 align:middle line:84%
So it's the time now for
all souls to come together,

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:14.550 align:middle line:90%
but come together where you are.

00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:18.450 align:middle line:90%
In small groups, get together.

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:21.210 align:middle line:84%
My work as a shaman with
Mayan calendar readings

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:26.850 align:middle line:84%
is involved with the one-to-one,
where it really goes in.

00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:28.980 align:middle line:90%
It goes in deep on both sides.

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:32.560 align:middle line:84%
The teaching goes way down
into the subconscious.

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:36.180 align:middle line:84%
And that one-on-one then
develops into groups.

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And I advocate that each person
that gets a Mayan calendar

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:43.530 align:middle line:84%
reading, calls for a
Mayan calendar reading,

00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:45.430 align:middle line:90%
make a small group.

00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And I have a recommendation
of how to do it.

00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:49.440 align:middle line:90%
And it's very simple.

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:51.270 align:middle line:90%
Don't have an agenda.

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:53.820 align:middle line:90%
Let each person speak in turn.

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:56.745 align:middle line:90%
And let whatever they say stand.

00:33:56.745 --> 00:33:58.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Respect one
another in this regard.

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:02.340 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Respect one
another and stop cutting off,

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:05.010 align:middle line:84%
like the talking
heads on the TV.

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:07.200 align:middle line:90%
Nobody can finish a story.

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.409 align:middle line:90%
The commercial comes in.

00:34:08.409 --> 00:34:11.580 align:middle line:90%
It's like ADHD communication.

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:13.920 align:middle line:84%
But we can stop that
at the grassroots.

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:16.190 align:middle line:90%
We have something we can do.

00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And so there are also the broad
movements of consciousness

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:21.420 align:middle line:90%
that are abroad.

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And that also was very
helpful, because they

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:27.150 align:middle line:84%
create thought forms
that stay and hover

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:29.540 align:middle line:90%
around us like the orbs.

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:31.389 align:middle line:90%
And that will help.

00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And so the souls that
have the consciousness,

00:34:33.810 --> 00:34:36.480 align:middle line:84%
like the children
of the Law of One,

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:40.949 align:middle line:84%
must come forward now and do
their work because we need it

00:34:40.949 --> 00:34:42.550 align:middle line:90%
now more than ever.

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:46.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how do people
self-select in this process?

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:49.989 align:middle line:84%
How do they know
what they're from?

00:34:49.989 --> 00:34:51.650 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Ah.

00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:53.380 align:middle line:90%
What they're from?

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:54.370 align:middle line:90%
How do they know?

00:34:54.370 --> 00:34:57.890 align:middle line:84%
They know by coming together
with others of like mind.

00:34:57.890 --> 00:34:58.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:34:58.690 --> 00:35:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And you can see what the
collective looks like?

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:01.293 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: And you can see.

00:35:01.293 --> 00:35:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And they will
sharpen each other.

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:04.120 align:middle line:90%
They will know.

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:08.170 align:middle line:84%
They will recharge a battery
from the static given

00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:14.110 align:middle line:84%
in society's control by cultures
and governments with agendas

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:16.070 align:middle line:90%
all over the place.

00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:18.686 align:middle line:84%
And it's only at the grass
roots that this can be done.

00:35:18.686 --> 00:35:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This makes sense.

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:22.720 align:middle line:84%
Because if you are
naturally resonating

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:25.150 align:middle line:84%
with this person, or
this topic, or that,

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:28.050 align:middle line:84%
and you start in this
very organic level

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:31.420 align:middle line:84%
drawing people together for
conversation over dinner

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:33.820 align:middle line:90%
or coffee, or whatnot.

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And the agenda that's
emerging from it

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:39.280 align:middle line:84%
will tell you what
your path is, won't it?

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:40.080 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:41.480 align:middle line:90%
And sit in the circle.

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And as you sit in the circle,
there's a magic of the circle.

00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:46.780 align:middle line:84%
I discovered it
in organizations,

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:51.940 align:middle line:84%
but it would always
be sort of interrupted

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:55.180 align:middle line:84%
because a railroad was coming
through, a decision that

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:58.735 align:middle line:84%
was coming through, that
was made before the meeting.

00:35:58.735 --> 00:36:01.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you can feel
the organic nature of that

00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:05.410 align:middle line:84%
compared to standing in line
as troops with the commander

00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:08.040 align:middle line:90%
on the stage looking out, right?

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:09.214 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't feel so good.

00:36:09.214 --> 00:36:11.380 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And so when they're
all together like that

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:14.500 align:middle line:84%
and they respect what each
other says, believe me,

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:16.160 align:middle line:90%
they're coming back.

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:18.280 align:middle line:84%
They don't get
that anyplace else.

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:20.350 align:middle line:90%
They don't get that respect.

00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And we have a
saying in our groups

00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:29.290 align:middle line:84%
when somebody finishes
speaking, please, don't say but.

00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:32.990 align:middle line:84%
Keep your "but" out of other
people's conversations.

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:35.173 align:middle line:84%
And so it has a
double meaning there.

00:36:35.173 --> 00:36:36.173 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it does.

00:36:36.173 --> 00:36:38.440 align:middle line:90%
That's a good one.

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:41.020 align:middle line:84%
It's funny, I was meditating
yesterday on something,

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:43.570 align:middle line:84%
and the words just came
streaming through so clearly.

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:45.310 align:middle line:84%
Bow to no one, but
honor everyone--

00:36:45.310 --> 00:36:46.110 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that we
are sovereign beings.

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:48.130 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:49.690 align:middle line:90%
Because we don't know much.

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:51.910 align:middle line:90%
Human beings know so little.

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:53.520 align:middle line:84%
The first question
that the shaman

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:56.830 align:middle line:84%
asks of the human being
that's in front of him

00:36:56.830 --> 00:37:00.220 align:middle line:84%
or her is, who's
running the show?

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:04.870 align:middle line:84%
Human beings, you ask people,
who takes care of digestion?

00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:07.220 align:middle line:90%
Who is changing the cells?

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:08.340 align:middle line:90%
Who's doing that?

00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:12.220 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my brain is doing
that, or I'm doing that.

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:16.150 align:middle line:84%
It's all correct, except
for the word "I" and "my."

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:19.180 align:middle line:84%
Human beings are so
great at taking credit

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:20.390 align:middle line:90%
for things they don't do.

00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:21.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:22.231 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: That's the ego.

00:37:22.231 --> 00:37:25.120 align:middle line:84%
Most everything is
done for us here.

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:26.350 align:middle line:90%
It's on the automatic.

00:37:26.350 --> 00:37:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And animals and plants
have the same facility,

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:33.050 align:middle line:84%
which the Western mind
has to begin to learn.

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:35.830 align:middle line:84%
Because when the
American Indians pray,

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:38.200 align:middle line:84%
they pray to the
plants and the animals

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:42.010 align:middle line:84%
for patience with the newer
life form that is here,

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:43.750 align:middle line:90%
the human being.

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:47.790 align:middle line:84%
Because animals and plants
are actually more aligned.

00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's the arrogance
of civilization

00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:56.020 align:middle line:84%
that pumps up the human being
beyond what they're entitled

00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:58.630 align:middle line:90%
to do on laboratory earth.

00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:01.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And since you brought
the Native American story

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:03.670 align:middle line:84%
into it a little bit, which
is-- and thank you for that--

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:07.090 align:middle line:90%
so true, what is the Hopi view?

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:09.760 align:middle line:84%
You've been studying
with the Hopi lately.

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:11.740 align:middle line:84%
What does the Hopi
view on what's

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:13.620 align:middle line:90%
emerging in this new Atlantis?

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:18.190 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: The Hopi
are an amazing people.

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:22.900 align:middle line:10%
I was drawn to them because
I met some people that were--

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:23.860 align:middle line:10%
White Bear.

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:26.470 align:middle line:10%
I didn't meet White Bear,
but I met the people

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:29.600 align:middle line:10%
through the circle of
friends who knew White Bear.

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And we took a trip
up to the Hopi lands

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:36.160 align:middle line:84%
with my friend John
[? Lorenz ?] and Patrick Walsh.

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And something magical
happened there.

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I was
stimulated to begin my study,

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:48.490 align:middle line:84%
because I felt
something there that I

00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:51.370 align:middle line:84%
hadn't felt in a
long time since going

00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:53.620 align:middle line:90%
to the Mayan lands in Egypt.

00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:55.990 align:middle line:90%
And so I began my study.

00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And what I found
is a treasure trove

00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:07.390 align:middle line:84%
of people who used what is the
Sanskrit word of "swastika."

00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:09.430 align:middle line:90%
"Swastika" in the German.

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:11.289 align:middle line:84%
They took it, it's
a Buddhist symbol.

00:39:11.289 --> 00:39:12.580 align:middle line:90%
It's an ancient-- not Buddhist.

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:13.990 align:middle line:90%
It's all over the world.

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:15.590 align:middle line:90%
We can't trace where it's from.

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:16.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:19.830 align:middle line:84%
Mostly, it goes back to India
as far as most people trace.

00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And so that
united the Tibetans

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:24.570 align:middle line:90%
and the Hopi, that symbol.

00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And the Hopi translate it as
the migrations of their clans

00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:34.270 align:middle line:84%
to the four corners
of the Americas.

00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:36.850 align:middle line:84%
According to their legends,
they went all the way down

00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:40.390 align:middle line:84%
to Patagonia, different
clans of them.

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:43.630 align:middle line:84%
They went all the way to the
East, all the way to the West,

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:48.190 align:middle line:84%
all the way to what they called
the Back Door up in the North

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:50.170 align:middle line:90%
where the ice begins.

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:52.520 align:middle line:90%
And they all came back.

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And after all their
experiences, they

00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:58.760 align:middle line:84%
had to pick a place
that would be peaceful,

00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:00.650 align:middle line:90%
that they could be permanent.

00:40:00.650 --> 00:40:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And it had to be a place
with no running water.

00:40:05.330 --> 00:40:08.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why would they choose
a place with no running water?

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:10.642 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Because nobody
else would want it.

00:40:10.642 --> 00:40:11.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:13.340 align:middle line:84%
That's the only sane
answer I can think of.

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:14.120 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: The measure of peace.

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:15.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The measure of peace.

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:16.650 align:middle line:90%
A land that no one else wants.

00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:17.900 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing to fight over.

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: They had developed a
spirit, a trust in themselves,

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:26.600 align:middle line:84%
that if they do their ceremonies
and they follow their heart,

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:30.140 align:middle line:84%
that they will be provided
for wherever they are

00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:32.750 align:middle line:90%
on the Earth or any place else.

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:35.930 align:middle line:84%
What an amazing
premise of people.

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:36.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:39.105 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: I was just floored
when I found that out.

00:40:39.105 --> 00:40:40.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting chills now.

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:40.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:41.530 align:middle line:90%
I've never heard that.

00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:42.350 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:40:42.350 --> 00:40:43.174 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yeah.

00:40:43.174 --> 00:40:44.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Total faith.

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:45.350 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yeah, yeah.

00:40:45.350 --> 00:40:48.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about their
connection with the stars

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:50.780 align:middle line:84%
and the star people
portion of that story?

00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:52.238 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: They do
have connections.

00:40:52.238 --> 00:40:55.520 align:middle line:84%
And they have it
in their art forms.

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:56.810 align:middle line:90%
Their star people came.

00:40:56.810 --> 00:41:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And many now today are
talking about the star people.

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:03.665 align:middle line:84%
My wife, Nobie, and I were
talking about that yesterday.

00:41:03.665 --> 00:41:05.540 align:middle line:90%
And they're there.

00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:07.272 align:middle line:90%
And some come to help.

00:41:07.272 --> 00:41:08.730 align:middle line:84%
There are different
spirit species.

00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:15.020 align:middle line:84%
They're the sons of Belial and
the followers of the Law of One

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:16.580 align:middle line:90%
among them, too.

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:19.010 align:middle line:84%
They are souls
with choices also.

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:22.040 align:middle line:84%
But somehow, there is a
protective layer here.

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:24.870 align:middle line:84%
Laboratory earth
will be protected.

00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:29.570 align:middle line:84%
They cannot take it over because
it's protected by the creator,

00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:33.430 align:middle line:90%
the inviter himself/herself.

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:36.130 align:middle line:90%
The creator is the inviter.

00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:39.730 align:middle line:84%
Because the synonym for
creation is invitation.

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:43.990 align:middle line:84%
It's an invitation for
evolution to become

00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:48.160 align:middle line:84%
a companion of a different
order to the creator.

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:50.860 align:middle line:84%
That's the only explanation
I've ever found.

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And I found out through the
[? ARE ? ] records and Edgar

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:57.130 align:middle line:90%
Cayce records.

00:41:57.130 --> 00:41:58.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What
about the notion--

00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:02.680 align:middle line:84%
because virtually
every world tradition,

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:04.570 align:middle line:84%
every religion
has this component

00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:09.190 align:middle line:84%
to it of the notion of
beings from the realms

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:14.000 align:middle line:84%
above and the realms below
basically joining here.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:14.800 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
influencing here what

00:42:16.330 --> 00:42:18.950 align:middle line:84%
goes on in this dimension
with Earth people.

00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:21.325 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Apparently, we're
a very enticing little sector

00:42:21.325 --> 00:42:22.125 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:42:22.125 --> 00:42:23.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Apparently.

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:24.930 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And there's
a lot of interest.

00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And also there are, for
example, the people of Eurasia

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:31.120 align:middle line:90%
wanting to go to the Americas.

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.920 align:middle line:84%
But there, we're surrounded
by a magnetic field here.

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:38.770 align:middle line:84%
There's a protection,
a natural protection.

00:42:38.770 --> 00:42:41.260 align:middle line:84%
The creator has a
plan going on here.

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:45.740 align:middle line:84%
And my feeling is that that
plan is this is to continue.

00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And there will be some
that are coming in--

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:49.300 align:middle line:90%
star people.

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:51.460 align:middle line:90%
They have always been coming in.

00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And many of them are in
the form of the Christs.

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:57.370 align:middle line:90%
Because a Christ is really--

00:42:57.370 --> 00:43:01.810 align:middle line:84%
the definition of it would be
a divine infusion for help.

00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And there have
been many of them,

00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:06.322 align:middle line:90%
because we need a lot of help.

00:43:06.322 --> 00:43:07.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We do
need a lot of help.

00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:13.030 align:middle line:84%
So I guess part of my
question is, if we're a place,

00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:18.280 align:middle line:84%
if we're a plane or a
dimension that is intersecting

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:21.430 align:middle line:84%
with higher and
lower planes, there

00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:24.010 align:middle line:84%
has to be some
self-determination within us

00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:27.730 align:middle line:84%
as individuals and
small groups as to which

00:43:27.730 --> 00:43:30.160 align:middle line:84%
we're going to align with
on a simple frequency level.

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:30.970 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Right.

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:33.053 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this seems
to play out all the time.

00:43:33.053 --> 00:43:36.670 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm hearing you say
is that we are protected,

00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:40.030 align:middle line:84%
hopefully not from the
influence of the higher realms,

00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:42.970 align:middle line:84%
but in that we're protected
from the extreme influence

00:43:42.970 --> 00:43:43.870 align:middle line:90%
of the lower realms.

00:43:43.870 --> 00:43:44.800 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: The harm.

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:45.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The harm.

00:43:45.130 --> 00:43:46.505 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: That's
what I found out

00:43:46.505 --> 00:43:48.320 align:middle line:84%
in the Mayan records
is that we're now

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:50.307 align:middle line:90%
in the Fourth Creation.

00:43:50.307 --> 00:43:51.640 align:middle line:90%
There was the first, the second.

00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:53.140 align:middle line:90%
The third was Atlantis.

00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:55.750 align:middle line:90%
And Atlantis fell.

00:43:55.750 --> 00:44:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's very well-told in the
Popol Vuh about the Principle

00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:03.790 align:middle line:84%
Bird Deity, which
represented Atlantis

00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:07.780 align:middle line:84%
with its jewelry and its
ego during those dark times.

00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:11.080 align:middle line:84%
During the fall of Atlantis,
they were still maintaining.

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:14.590 align:middle line:84%
But the Christ of the Maya
came and shot him down

00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:16.575 align:middle line:90%
from the tree with a blowgun.

00:44:16.575 --> 00:44:17.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, there you go.

00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:19.600 align:middle line:90%
Took care of that.

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:21.310 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: And the same--

00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:24.640 align:middle line:84%
but they shot him
down because he,

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:27.160 align:middle line:84%
himself, the
Principal Bird Deity,

00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:31.690 align:middle line:84%
is so powerful that he
is actually helping.

00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:33.310 align:middle line:90%
He's not evil.

00:44:33.310 --> 00:44:38.290 align:middle line:84%
He's helping that civilization
to end more quickly so

00:44:38.290 --> 00:44:41.250 align:middle line:84%
that the new civilization
can transform.

00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And he later takes other
aspects on as Itzamna,

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:48.460 align:middle line:84%
which is the one who
created humankind

00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:52.660 align:middle line:84%
with the goddess Ixchel of the
moon and their 13 children.

00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:53.595 align:middle line:90%
Of course, 13.

00:44:53.595 --> 00:44:54.595 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course, 13.

00:44:54.595 --> 00:44:59.440 align:middle line:90%


00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:03.100 align:middle line:90%
Let's look beyond the Hopi now.

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:06.250 align:middle line:84%
One thing is you said the number
20 is important in America.

00:45:06.250 --> 00:45:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And you say the year
2020 is important.

00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:11.800 align:middle line:84%
Before we get to that,
let's feed into it.

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:15.607 align:middle line:84%
December 21, 2012, the
end of the Mayan calendar.

00:45:15.607 --> 00:45:17.440 align:middle line:84%
People were freaking
out all over the world.

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:18.240 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:19.450 align:middle line:90%
So it's come and it's gone.

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:21.880 align:middle line:84%
What was the literal
interpretation

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:24.250 align:middle line:84%
of what was to have
happened at that time?

00:45:24.250 --> 00:45:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And then, what does
2020 lead us to?

00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:31.360 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: The 2012/2013
juncture is the end

00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:34.900 align:middle line:90%
of the juncture from 3100 BC.

00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:39.970 align:middle line:84%
That's when upper and
lower Egypt were united.

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:41.680 align:middle line:90%
It's like a marker of time.

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And the Sumerian civilization
was developing a pace.

00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And that is a beginning
of this civilization.

00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:54.670 align:middle line:84%
We are them, because it's
not that all of us are them,

00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:59.020 align:middle line:84%
but it is the dominant thrust
of our civilization, that

00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:01.590 align:middle line:84%
which came from
the Persian Gulf,

00:46:01.590 --> 00:46:05.650 align:middle line:90%
and the Mesopotamia, and Egypt.

00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And the torch got passed
to the Persians, and then

00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:11.620 align:middle line:90%
the Persians and the Egyptians.

00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:14.245 align:middle line:84%
And then, the Egyptians
to the Greeks.

00:46:14.245 --> 00:46:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And then, the Greeks
to the Romans.

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And then, the Romans
to the French.

00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:22.300 align:middle line:90%
And then, to England.

00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And then, the torch was
passed to the United States.

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:28.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does this
also bring reincarnation

00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:31.920 align:middle line:84%
in when you say we are them,
as we have, from that period,

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:33.640 align:middle line:90%
reincarnated in mass now?

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:34.890 align:middle line:90%
Because that's my observation.

00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:36.890 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And they're
coming in from different--

00:46:36.890 --> 00:46:37.800 align:middle line:90%
we don't know where.

00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:41.610 align:middle line:84%
All sorts of different
places because it's arranged.

00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:44.700 align:middle line:84%
Because there are conferences
in the bardo, in the time

00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:47.710 align:middle line:84%
in between lives,
where we make contract.

00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:49.110 align:middle line:90%
We have a mission.

00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:54.090 align:middle line:84%
The Mayan calendar is
the finest instrument

00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:58.800 align:middle line:84%
I have ever seen to tell people
what their spiritual mission

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:00.640 align:middle line:90%
in here is.

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And their incarnate
Kundalini aspect.

00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:06.900 align:middle line:84%
What's at the flip-side, the
bottom at the Lord of night,

00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:11.100 align:middle line:84%
for example, that walks
underneath them 24/7.

00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And that guides them through
their legs and their left ear

00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:15.180 align:middle line:90%
at night.

00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:19.080 align:middle line:84%
Things like that that are
unheard of in other areas.

00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:20.460 align:middle line:90%
And China has this.

00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:24.600 align:middle line:84%
The other regions all
have this unique part.

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And we must listen
to them the same

00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:30.750 align:middle line:84%
as we listen to the
global civilization coming

00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:32.490 align:middle line:90%
from the Middle East.

00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:37.200 align:middle line:84%
We have to allow those other
testimonies to get through.

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:38.800 align:middle line:90%
And that's my life work.

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:39.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And you do a
beautiful job of it.

00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:41.380 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Thank you.

00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:43.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I remember my
reading with you years ago.

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:47.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, one thing you did say also
that we have not touched on yet

00:47:47.010 --> 00:47:49.770 align:middle line:84%
is part of the issue
with the red land.

00:47:49.770 --> 00:47:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And the red land being--
which is the Americas,

00:47:51.850 --> 00:47:55.980 align:middle line:84%
being the new Atlantis,
is that we sadly have lost

00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:58.500 align:middle line:84%
our connection with nature,
which is what allows us

00:47:58.500 --> 00:47:59.670 align:middle line:90%
to bring in these--

00:47:59.670 --> 00:48:02.400 align:middle line:84%
what you can say are
damaging technologies

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:04.680 align:middle line:84%
that we talked about,
such as altering weather

00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:08.640 align:middle line:84%
patterns with intention, without
regard for the planet itself.

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:12.300 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that necessity
to reconnect with nature.

00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:14.490 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Nature is
the intelligence.

00:48:14.490 --> 00:48:18.090 align:middle line:84%
The human mind is not
the intelligent party.

00:48:18.090 --> 00:48:20.340 align:middle line:90%
The heart is the intelligence.

00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:22.770 align:middle line:84%
The human mind is
rather like a machine

00:48:22.770 --> 00:48:24.790 align:middle line:90%
that can spin it around.

00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And the heart and the
subconscious will follow,

00:48:28.290 --> 00:48:33.300 align:middle line:84%
but it's given a power to
whatever it thinks of--

00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:35.010 align:middle line:90%
this will work for it.

00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:37.500 align:middle line:84%
But the heart will
sometimes go against it

00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:39.890 align:middle line:90%
because it knows that.

00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:41.740 align:middle line:90%
And you won't be able to sleep.

00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:44.560 align:middle line:84%
You won't be able to sit still
if you're doing the wrong thing

00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:45.710 align:middle line:90%
and you know.

00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:47.590 align:middle line:90%
And that's the conscience.

00:48:47.590 --> 00:48:53.621 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a built-in
power that we have.

00:48:53.621 --> 00:48:54.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The power of nature.

00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:58.020 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: The power of nature.

00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:00.360 align:middle line:90%
The word of God is in nature.

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:03.840 align:middle line:84%
It cannot be in anything
formed by human hand.

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:04.890 align:middle line:90%
I don't care what it is.

00:49:04.890 --> 00:49:08.250 align:middle line:84%
If it's formed by
human hand, it is

00:49:08.250 --> 00:49:11.700 align:middle line:84%
the Akashic when it
speaks to human being,

00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:14.430 align:middle line:84%
speaks to that
human being alone.

00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:16.860 align:middle line:90%
It's not for everybody else.

00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:20.910 align:middle line:84%
Because that human being is
an interpreter right away.

00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And the Akashic will
allow its will--

00:49:24.210 --> 00:49:28.650 align:middle line:84%
the Akashic record, which cannot
go against the will of that

00:49:28.650 --> 00:49:31.920 align:middle line:84%
which it's in
communication with.

00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:33.000 align:middle line:90%
That is the sanctified--

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.333 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which is the natural--

00:49:34.333 --> 00:49:37.110 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: --contract
of our invitation here.

00:49:37.110 --> 00:49:39.660 align:middle line:90%
And so we cannot trust that.

00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:41.220 align:middle line:90%
We listen to all of it.

00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:45.570 align:middle line:84%
Because like any other source,
there are things in between.

00:49:45.570 --> 00:49:49.350 align:middle line:84%
It's called what I call
the filtering of signs.

00:49:49.350 --> 00:49:52.620 align:middle line:84%
It's like when I was going
to meet with you here today,

00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:54.640 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to see what
it was all about.

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:56.640 align:middle line:90%
So I looked at the sky.

00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And the Mayan calendar date
for today is [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:50:01.890 --> 00:50:03.510 align:middle line:90%
2 and 5.

00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:05.190 align:middle line:90%
Of the 13, it's the 2.

00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:07.920 align:middle line:90%
Of the 20, it's the 5.

00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at the sky
through the star programs,

00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:16.500 align:middle line:84%
and I found that the ecliptic
has an extraordinary situation

00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:17.820 align:middle line:90%
this day.

00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And it is that 5
of the 10 orbs seen

00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:24.780 align:middle line:90%
in the ecliptic from the Earth--

00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:27.400 align:middle line:90%
that's where the zodiac is.

00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:34.500 align:middle line:84%
5 of the 10 orbs are
in one place, Pisces.

00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:37.410 align:middle line:84%
The last sign, the
most spiritual.

00:50:37.410 --> 00:50:40.840 align:middle line:84%
Our meeting here
is very important.

00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:41.730 align:middle line:90%
That's the 5.

00:50:41.730 --> 00:50:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And it represents
the vision serpent,

00:50:44.530 --> 00:50:48.120 align:middle line:84%
where we have our ceremony
and we do a burned offering

00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:49.200 align:middle line:90%
with precious things.

00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And we look into the smoke and
we can envision how it can be.

00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:54.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:58.350 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And the 2, the
number 2 is the duality.

00:50:58.350 --> 00:51:02.160 align:middle line:84%
It's the cross of the Maya,
the cross of the Christians,

00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:03.960 align:middle line:90%
the North and the South.

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:07.290 align:middle line:84%
The North is the constant place,
the unchanging, and the South

00:51:07.290 --> 00:51:08.910 align:middle line:90%
the changing place.

00:51:08.910 --> 00:51:12.040 align:middle line:84%
Because Canopus sometimes
can be seen and not seen.

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:14.910 align:middle line:84%
Then, the East and the
West where the sun goes

00:51:14.910 --> 00:51:17.460 align:middle line:90%
representing the incarnate.

00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:20.190 align:middle line:90%
And the two represents that.

00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:23.310 align:middle line:84%
It is the original
energy of separation

00:51:23.310 --> 00:51:25.470 align:middle line:90%
that caused the creation.

00:51:25.470 --> 00:51:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And that separation is
a longing for the two

00:51:29.070 --> 00:51:30.470 align:middle line:90%
to come back together.

00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
talking about and ways to do.

00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:36.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And one
final question.

00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:40.190 align:middle line:84%
In that journey, we take us
to the other number, 2020,

00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:42.290 align:middle line:84%
because this is going
to be an important year.

00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:44.780 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: I love this, 2020.

00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:46.430 align:middle line:90%
We are in the 20th century.

00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:48.950 align:middle line:90%
And 20 is the powerful number.

00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:53.390 align:middle line:84%
In most civilizations, the
number 20 represents maturity.

00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:55.670 align:middle line:90%
Time when you're a full citizen.

00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And the Hopi keep their
child in darkness for 20 days

00:51:59.210 --> 00:52:02.500 align:middle line:90%
to remember their original home.

00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:06.980 align:middle line:84%
2020 means, in our
culture, full sight.

00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:09.200 align:middle line:90%
The best the eye can see.

00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:13.760 align:middle line:84%
What is happening in the year
2020, something will happen.

00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:16.104 align:middle line:90%
The streaker will pass by.

00:52:16.104 --> 00:52:17.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A disruptor.

00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:19.400 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And the person,
like in "The Wizard of Oz"

00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:22.430 align:middle line:84%
that's behind the
curtain, will be seen.

00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:25.010 align:middle line:90%
This is my hope and prayer.

00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:27.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it is mine, too.

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:28.929 align:middle line:90%
All will be revealed.

00:52:28.929 --> 00:52:30.470 align:middle line:84%
So it's a pulling
back of the curtain

00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:34.700 align:middle line:84%
to reveal the forces
behind the perceptions that

00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:35.690 align:middle line:90%
are being created.

00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:38.060 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: We are charged
to keep the hope.

00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:41.510 align:middle line:84%
We are never to be
done in by fear.

00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:45.055 align:middle line:84%
The best stone I recommend
for people is hematite.

00:52:45.055 --> 00:52:47.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And tell us a
little more about hematite.

00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:50.570 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Hematite is
the glossy, black stone,

00:52:50.570 --> 00:52:52.280 align:middle line:84%
but it's really
the symbol of hope.

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:56.000 align:middle line:84%
Because if you grind it
into powder, it is red.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.490 align:middle line:84%
It is the red of blood
in your own heart.

00:52:58.490 --> 00:53:03.470 align:middle line:84%
Things may look black, but the
essence of it is red and hope.

00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And just
one more-- we have

00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:07.390 align:middle line:90%
just a couple of minutes left.

00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:09.344 align:middle line:84%
We've gotten to a
few of the things

00:53:09.344 --> 00:53:10.510 align:middle line:90%
we were going to talk about.

00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:13.862 align:middle line:84%
Any final thoughts you want to
leave us with at this time when

00:53:13.862 --> 00:53:15.070 align:middle line:90%
we're looking at this change?

00:53:15.070 --> 00:53:19.090 align:middle line:84%
We're looking forward to
the revelations of 2020.

00:53:19.090 --> 00:53:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And we're in the midst of now
really interesting, somewhat

00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:23.470 align:middle line:90%
chaotic times.

00:53:23.470 --> 00:53:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And the opportunity
within the times

00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:28.210 align:middle line:90%
between now, 2017, and 2020.

00:53:28.210 --> 00:53:30.100 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: The opportunity
is at hand to us

00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:35.710 align:middle line:84%
all the time to not
stay in one group alone.

00:53:35.710 --> 00:53:39.940 align:middle line:84%
Go and visit the other groups
beyond their periphery.

00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:44.200 align:middle line:84%
Let them know that you're there
and you care and respect them.

00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:46.790 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
think the same way,

00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:49.630 align:middle line:84%
but know that that
God is the god of all.

00:53:49.630 --> 00:53:50.950 align:middle line:90%
The creator is one.

00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:52.450 align:middle line:90%
The Law of One.

00:53:52.450 --> 00:53:53.520 align:middle line:90%
And know that.

00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And as much as possible,
make your own group.

00:53:57.320 --> 00:53:58.120 align:middle line:90%
You can.

00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has the
facility to facilitate.

00:54:04.570 --> 00:54:07.100 align:middle line:90%
Let them sit in a circle.

00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:08.260 align:middle line:90%
Have groups.

00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:09.760 align:middle line:90%
Let the groups meet together.

00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:11.180 align:middle line:90%
Have events.

00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:13.540 align:middle line:90%
Build it from the grassroots.

00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:16.180 align:middle line:84%
And pay attention to
there at the grassroots.

00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And the upper echelon must
begin to pay attention to you.

00:54:21.130 --> 00:54:23.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: On that
note, that's beautiful.

00:54:23.770 --> 00:54:24.830 align:middle line:90%
That was beautiful.

00:54:24.830 --> 00:54:27.485 align:middle line:84%
And I agree, coming
together with clear minds,

00:54:27.485 --> 00:54:28.285 align:middle line:90%
clear hearts--

00:54:28.285 --> 00:54:28.570 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Ourselves.

00:54:28.570 --> 00:54:30.195 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and
listening to each other

00:54:30.195 --> 00:54:32.620 align:middle line:84%
because nobody's
feeling heard anymore.

00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:33.670 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yeah, right.

00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:35.080 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:36.090 align:middle line:90%
And we keep that circle.

00:54:36.090 --> 00:54:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And vouchsafe the validity
of whatever a soul says.

00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:42.310 align:middle line:10%
That's all they want.

00:54:42.310 --> 00:54:43.040 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: They want to be heard.

00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:44.140 align:middle line:10%
>>TARPEY: They want to be heard.

00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:44.940 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:47.500 align:middle line:10%
>>TARPEY: It's that frustration
of talking at the same time.

00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:49.360 align:middle line:10%
Like sometimes when
I argue in New York.

00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:51.820 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's like--

00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:54.915 align:middle line:10%
I'm from New York, so it's
a special kind of argument.

00:54:54.915 --> 00:54:57.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A parallel.

00:54:57.520 --> 00:54:58.860 align:middle line:90%
Raymond, thank you so much.

00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:01.590 align:middle line:84%
So until next time--
it's taken a few years,

00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:03.890 align:middle line:84%
but it's wonderful having
you and Earth Keeper back.

00:55:03.890 --> 00:55:04.690 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yep.

00:55:04.690 --> 00:55:05.850 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:55:05.850 --> 00:55:06.650 align:middle line:90%
Namaste.

00:55:06.650 --> 00:55:08.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Namaste.

00:55:08.490 --> 00:55:10.090 align:middle line:84%
To go further into
Raymond's work

00:55:10.090 --> 00:55:11.800 align:middle line:84%
