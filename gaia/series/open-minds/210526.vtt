00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.843 align:middle line:90%


00:00:08.843 --> 00:00:10.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY MILLER: Many
kids on the spectrum

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:16.329 align:middle line:84%
are so adept at seeing into
us that very often they

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:21.370 align:middle line:84%
see things within us that
we have so long ago buried.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.870 align:middle line:84%
The frequency of emotion is
you might say subtle enough

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.210 align:middle line:90%
for them to connect to.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.950 align:middle line:90%
It's a frequency mismatch.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.580 align:middle line:84%
That kid is banging his
head up against the wall.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.910 align:middle line:84%
I always ask parents, I
mean, it seems so simple,

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.510 align:middle line:84%
but how is it that we might
be banging our heads up

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.680 align:middle line:90%
against the wall?

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.500 align:middle line:90%
Seeing is not just seeing.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.550 align:middle line:90%
Hearing is not just hearing.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.100 align:middle line:90%
Touch is not just touch.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.850 align:middle line:84%
It's so much more
than that for them

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.990 align:middle line:84%
because every way in which
they're using those senses,

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.068 align:middle line:84%
they are gleaning
additional information.

00:00:58.068 --> 00:00:59.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Right.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: They are not
only hearing the loudness

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.580 align:middle line:84%
or quietness of an experience,
but they are also hearing

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.590 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of other information.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.650 align:middle line:84%
Children diagnosed with autism
hear what you don't say.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.180 align:middle line:90%


00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.340 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Suzy Miller
has spent the past 20

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.670 align:middle line:10%
years working with and learning
from autistic children.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.430 align:middle line:10%
She's been telling us that
what we see on the outside

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.560 align:middle line:10%
is not what's going
on inside their minds.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And that many have come to
Earth from times far past.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.740 align:middle line:84%
Since the numbers of
people on the spectrum

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.540 align:middle line:84%
has been rising
by the year, we're

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.450 align:middle line:84%
going to take a deeper look
into these beings in all

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.320 align:middle line:90%
the iterations.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.920 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for coming back.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.990 align:middle line:90%
It's been a few years--

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: It has.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --since we've
been together here.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.360 align:middle line:90%
A lot has happened in that time.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Absolutely.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the sheer
numbers statistically

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.030 align:middle line:84%
of people being born that are
termed on the spectrum, which

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.370 align:middle line:84%
is almost becoming kind of
a garbage bucket diagnosis.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Totally.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Honestly.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.563 align:middle line:84%
It's like a few other
things, that you

00:01:58.563 --> 00:02:01.300 align:middle line:84%
don't know where to put it, so
what else are you going to say?

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.930 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, there's a
very wide array of beings.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.030 align:middle line:84%
So before we go
into all of that,

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.759 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about
that part itself.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Just get some defining factors
here about the different kinds

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.440 align:middle line:84%
of autism and on the spectrum
people that you're working with

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.800 align:middle line:90%
and you're seeing.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Yeah.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.560 align:middle line:10%
So the kids that I work
with or the parents

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.640 align:middle line:10%
that find me are typically
the parents of children

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.310 align:middle line:10%
who are those higher
dimensional beings and they

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.205 align:middle line:10%
are looking very specifically
to come in and integrate.

00:02:36.205 --> 00:02:39.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What we would call
more high function, or no,

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.150 align:middle line:90%
not necessarily.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: No, not necessarily.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.350 align:middle line:84%
I think it has a lot more to
do with when they've come in,

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.810 align:middle line:84%
like the timing
that they came in.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.900 align:middle line:10%
So a lot of children who
maybe came in 25, 30 years ago

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.750 align:middle line:10%
that were diagnosed
with autism did not

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.030 align:middle line:10%
have the vibrational support
in order to fully embody all

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.050 align:middle line:10%
that they are.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.752 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean that
in the realms and realities

00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:07.210 align:middle line:84%
that they hang out
that they aren't

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.720 align:middle line:84%
very proficient in higher
states of consciousness.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: So, I have a
tendency to have all kinds

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.980 align:middle line:90%
of different kids come to me.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.570 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
considered vaccine injured.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.120 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
considered low functioning

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.450 align:middle line:90%
or high functioning.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.770 align:middle line:84%
But honestly, they all
have a common denominator.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And that common
denominator is, I'd say,

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.400 align:middle line:84%
the vibrational
information that they've

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.880 align:middle line:84%
come with and their
attempts to get

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.330 align:middle line:84%
their parents and the
people, the adults,

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.870 align:middle line:84%
around them to really
kind of take a,

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.970 align:middle line:84%
might say, a bit of a quantum
leap into those higher

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.330 align:middle line:90%
states of consciousness.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.600 align:middle line:84%
So that's what they're here
for and what it's all about.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so for
those who haven't

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.670 align:middle line:84%
seen our previous
interviews, because it's

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.850 align:middle line:84%
been a little while, let's
talk about how you began

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.030 align:middle line:84%
and how you began noticing
these real differences

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.760 align:middle line:84%
in the internal kind
of consciousness

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.050 align:middle line:84%
wiring of the people
coming before you.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Yeah.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:15.760 align:middle line:84%
So my story is pediatric
speech language pathologist

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.070 align:middle line:84%
to multidimensional
communicator.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.290 align:middle line:90%
And so it was--

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.510 align:middle line:84%
yeah, and a rocky journey
sometimes in there as well.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.190 align:middle line:84%
But nevertheless, I mean at the
hands of one of these children,

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.690 align:middle line:84%
I was opened up to my own
multidimensional sight

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.420 align:middle line:90%
and capacity.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.270 align:middle line:84%
And with that
capacity, he then asked

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.140 align:middle line:84%
me to help him integrate
his light body back

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.880 align:middle line:90%
into the physical body.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And every client
I've worked with,

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.340 align:middle line:84%
every child I've worked
with in the last 25 years

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.760 align:middle line:90%
has been the same.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.130 align:middle line:84%
So there-- and for
whatever reason,

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.790 align:middle line:84%
they have been kind of stuck in
between worlds, you might say.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.520 align:middle line:90%
But that's not unlike us.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.680 align:middle line:84%
Each one of us is kind of stuck
in between worlds as well.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.360 align:middle line:84%
There's that part of us that
is that higher dimensional

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.270 align:middle line:84%
consciousness that the
essence of who we are.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.910 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
human conditioned part.

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And so we're all dancing
between these two worlds.

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And as far as I'm concerned,
the vast majority of these kids

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.860 align:middle line:84%
have come so that they
can, in some ways,

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.260 align:middle line:84%
show us what doesn't work
for humanity anymore,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.160 align:middle line:84%
what's not in our highest
and best interest, how

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.090 align:middle line:84%
we need to move out of our
limited perception of who

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.890 align:middle line:90%
we are.

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:43.323 align:middle line:84%
And they're constantly
inviting us to more.

00:05:43.323 --> 00:05:44.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
we're going to get

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.960 align:middle line:84%
to a point in the conversation--
we're going to talk about some

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.240 align:middle line:84%
of those things that aren't
working that are really

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.420 align:middle line:84%
going to have to change because
of the presence on Earth.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.250 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
let's talk about what

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.600 align:middle line:84%
happens when a being who's
considered on the spectrum

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.600 align:middle line:84%
is born with a very
different emotional structure

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.430 align:middle line:90%
than their family.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: Well, there's a couple
of different pieces here.

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.400 align:middle line:84%
From my vantage
point, they are born

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.560 align:middle line:84%
at a completely different
frequency band, you might say,

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.060 align:middle line:90%
completely different vibration.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.050 align:middle line:84%
They have completely different
levels of information

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.920 align:middle line:84%
that they have access to than
what their parents have access

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.760 align:middle line:90%
to.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.520 align:middle line:84%
So, one of the very first
places where these kids are

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.880 align:middle line:84%
able to interface
with their parents

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.090 align:middle line:90%
is at the emotional body level.

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not talking just about
emotions as feelings emotions,

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.550 align:middle line:90%
that kind of thing.

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about the
frequency of emotion.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:51.370 align:middle line:84%
So the frequency of emotion
is you might say subtle enough

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.570 align:middle line:84%
for them to connect to,
but complicated enough

00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:01.210 align:middle line:84%
that when they do connect
with that level of experience,

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.320 align:middle line:84%
sometimes they're
repelled by it.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.100 align:middle line:84%
So let's imagine if
you have a child who

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.530 align:middle line:90%
comes in kind of like--

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:12.760 align:middle line:84%
I always say it's like having an
angel show up in that frequency

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.840 align:middle line:84%
and there is challenge
in the household,

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.960 align:middle line:84%
or there's anger,
frustration, irritation,

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.360 align:middle line:84%
whatever might be going
on in the household.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.940 align:middle line:84%
There's a frequency
mismatch, right?

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And so the children
are constantly--

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.990 align:middle line:84%
when that happens, the
kids are constantly

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.560 align:middle line:84%
attempting to get their
parents or other adults

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:41.848 align:middle line:84%
in their environment to actually
see where that's going on,

00:07:41.848 --> 00:07:43.640 align:middle line:84%
what's going on for
them within their own--

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, give examples
of how that would work?

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:45.582 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: --emotional body.

00:07:45.582 --> 00:07:49.380 align:middle line:84%
Yep, so an example
of that would be,

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:54.080 align:middle line:84%
let's say a kid who might be
considered low functioning

00:07:54.080 --> 00:08:00.290 align:middle line:84%
by medical allopathic kind of
more Western medical standards,

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:05.180 align:middle line:84%
that kid is banging his head
up against the wall, literally.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And I always ask parents,
I mean, it seems so simple,

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:13.130 align:middle line:84%
but how is it that we might
be banging our heads up

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:14.270 align:middle line:90%
against the wall?

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:16.430 align:middle line:84%
How is it that we
might be frustrated?

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:23.150 align:middle line:84%
How is it that we might be just
not able to literally express

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:25.020 align:middle line:90%
something and share something?

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.870 align:middle line:84%
And so it literally
has driven us

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:30.470 align:middle line:84%
to the place where we feel
like we're banging our heads up

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:31.650 align:middle line:90%
against the wall.

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as we can
direct the parent to that

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:37.549 align:middle line:84%
and they start looking
at that, oh my gosh,

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:39.650 align:middle line:90%
yes, this is how I feel.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:43.340 align:middle line:84%
The minute they understand
how they feel and they start

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:47.210 align:middle line:84%
processing some of that energy,
their children very frequently

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:51.350 align:middle line:84%
stop the behaviors that
they were reflecting back.

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And they're not reflecting
these behaviors back

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.230 align:middle line:84%
to tell the parents that
they're wrong, or bad,

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:00.795 align:middle line:90%
or don't have it together.

00:09:00.795 --> 00:09:03.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're literally
almost an unconscious messenger

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:04.560 align:middle line:90%
of it in a way.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: They're an
unconscious mirror--

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:07.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mirror.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: --of what hasn't
been yet integrated

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.800 align:middle line:84%
not just within the parents,
but within the whole lineage.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:19.500 align:middle line:84%
Many kids on the spectrum are
so adept at seeing into us

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.520 align:middle line:84%
that very often they
see things within us

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:27.540 align:middle line:84%
that we have so long ago
buried that we don't even

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:28.388 align:middle line:90%
know are there.

00:09:28.388 --> 00:09:29.680 align:middle line:90%
So we kind of scan the surface.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you give me an
example of a couple of those?

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: Well, I'll give you
an example, a personal one.

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.750 align:middle line:84%
Even back when I was
a speech pathologist

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:40.860 align:middle line:84%
and still just developing
some of this skill set,

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:46.320 align:middle line:84%
I would go in to see this
kid and he was semi-verbal

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:53.790 align:middle line:84%
and he would come in and
he would say sad, sad, sad.

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And at first I was
like, are you sad?

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.480 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.660 align:middle line:84%
No, he was talking about
the sadness that was still

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:04.620 align:middle line:90%
unintegrated within me, right?

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:09.600 align:middle line:84%
But the minute I figured that
out, that went away, right?

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen so
many times where

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:16.620 align:middle line:84%
parents will have certain
experiences, like I

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:20.280 align:middle line:84%
had one parent a
long time ago who she

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.600 align:middle line:90%
was a very A-type personality.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.890 align:middle line:84%
So she was a lot of lists,
and get everything done,

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:27.100 align:middle line:90%
and that kind of thing.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And she was always talking
to herself in her head.

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:38.370 align:middle line:84%
Her son was a teenager
and he was just

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:41.760 align:middle line:84%
verbally communicating all the
time, asking her questions,

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.520 align:middle line:84%
asking her questions,
asking her questions.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.358 align:middle line:84%
And we were kind of having
a conversation about this

00:10:47.358 --> 00:10:49.650 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden, I was
like, what kind of questions

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:51.030 align:middle line:90%
are you asking yourself?

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:54.870 align:middle line:84%
You know, what kind of lists
are you making in your head?

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And he used to literally walk
around with a paper and pencil.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.560 align:middle line:90%
Here's my list.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.580 align:middle line:90%
Here's my list.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.662 align:middle line:84%
She woke up one morning and she
went, oh my gosh, it's my list.

00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:03.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He's mimicking her.

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:07.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: He's mimicking
my need for information.

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:12.190 align:middle line:84%
My need to know in order
to feel comfortable.

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as she
got it, he literally

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:15.900 align:middle line:84%
put the list down on
the bed and walked away.

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Amazing.

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: So, so many people
talk about this population

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:26.250 align:middle line:84%
as not being very
connected emotionally.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:28.770 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's exactly
the opposite of that.

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:32.430 align:middle line:84%
I think they are so
connected emotionally

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:38.070 align:middle line:84%
that they don't have any other
option other than to act out

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:40.440 align:middle line:84%
what they're seeing, because
a lot of times they don't

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.740 align:middle line:90%
have verbal communication.

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:46.860 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times their parents
are not yet telepathic

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:51.250 align:middle line:84%
or there is not that ability
to connect in that way.

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:55.160 align:middle line:84%
So the only way they
have of demonstrating

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.490 align:middle line:84%
to the parents what is yet
to be integrated within them

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:04.830 align:middle line:84%
and thus help the kids
integrate is to act it out.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:06.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, out.

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:10.560 align:middle line:84%
So they're as you're
saying super connected

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.340 align:middle line:84%
on levels we don't understand
but have no means of dealing

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:17.190 align:middle line:84%
and sorting through and
expressing the emotions,

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:19.150 align:middle line:84%
except through perhaps
extreme measures.

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:19.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Yep.

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They also
often generally

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:26.820 align:middle line:84%
have very heightened
senses, sensory perception,

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.830 align:middle line:84%
which now that
starts interfacing

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:32.220 align:middle line:84%
with coming into a world like
this, coming into a household.

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:33.520 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:37.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: So if you
consider that, let's say,

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:42.600 align:middle line:84%
their information
field allows them

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.000 align:middle line:84%
to use all their
senses to perceive

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.470 align:middle line:90%
at a multi-dimensional level.

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:51.720 align:middle line:84%
So, for instance, hearing
to us is hearing, right?

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes
things are too loud.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:54.900 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they're too quiet.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes for a child
diagnosed with autism,

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:04.930 align:middle line:84%
they are not only hearing
the loudness or quietness

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:06.790 align:middle line:84%
of an experience,
but they are also

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:10.550 align:middle line:84%
hearing all kinds of other
information within that.

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:13.030 align:middle line:84%
So children
diagnosed with autism

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:16.645 align:middle line:84%
hear what you don't say as much
as they hear what you do say.

00:13:16.645 --> 00:13:18.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, you're
talking about telepathy?

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: Well, I'm not only
talking about telepathy,

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:24.650 align:middle line:84%
because that is just an
innate capacity of theirs.

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's one
of the reasons why

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:31.390 align:middle line:84%
that was one of the first
things that opened up for me.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:35.800 align:middle line:84%
But it's not just that,
it's the telepathy is there,

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:41.170 align:middle line:84%
but this capacity to read
an information field--

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:42.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: More
multi-dimensional,

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:45.760 align:middle line:84%
reaching into multi-dimensional
streams of information.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:46.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Absolutely.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: And so we have this
physical, mental, emotional

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.960 align:middle line:84%
body that makes up
our human experience.

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:57.550 align:middle line:84%
But there are all kinds of
different levels of information

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:59.620 align:middle line:90%
that are within those fields.

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And so something as
simple as a child

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:07.780 align:middle line:84%
walking up to somebody
who is not yet

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:11.740 align:middle line:84%
visibly pregnant,
but absolutely knows

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:14.530 align:middle line:84%
that that individual is pregnant
because of the information

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:16.010 align:middle line:90%
that's in that field.

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:16.810 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And very often we'll
say something like that.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.370 align:middle line:90%
This is really common.

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of parents
of kids on the spectrum

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:27.190 align:middle line:90%
will say my kid reads my mind.

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:32.680 align:middle line:84%
Or if my emotions are off,
their emotions are off.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And this is because of that
multi-dimensional capacity.

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:43.060 align:middle line:90%
So, seeing is not just seeing.

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:45.080 align:middle line:90%
Hearing is not just hearing.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.600 align:middle line:90%
Touch is not just touch.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.380 align:middle line:84%
It's so much more
than that for them.

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:54.550 align:middle line:84%
Because every way in which
they're using those senses,

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:56.930 align:middle line:84%
they are gleaning
additional information.

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:57.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:00.130 align:middle line:90%
So it's almost an overload then?

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: Well, it absolutely
can be an overload

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:06.200 align:middle line:84%
until we know what they're doing
and we start communicating that

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.000 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.330 align:middle line:84%
Because, quite frankly, this
is where we're all going.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:16.330 align:middle line:84%
We are all going to be
reading and experiencing

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:18.340 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of different
information fields.

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
that is our future.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:21.692 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: That is
our-- well, it's--

00:15:21.692 --> 00:15:22.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's our beginning.

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:24.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: It's our beginning
and it's our future.

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:26.110 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:31.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if you're a
family and you have a newborn

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.910 align:middle line:84%
and you start realizing this
newborn is uber sensitive

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:36.400 align:middle line:84%
and start having
these traits, how

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.220 align:middle line:84%
do you, besides what
you talked about,

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:43.180 align:middle line:84%
about once you reflect on your
own out of balance portions,

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:45.640 align:middle line:84%
it'll often correct a
behavior in a child.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.760 align:middle line:84%
Beyond that, how do you
create an environment

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:54.210 align:middle line:84%
so that the child can thrive
and be able to hear themselves?

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:56.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: This is a trick
right now, I will say.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And the reason it's
a trick is because we

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:02.580 align:middle line:84%
have been so conditioned
as a humanity

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:06.480 align:middle line:90%
to our perceived limitations.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.900 align:middle line:84%
We don't see ourselves
as gods and goddesses.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:14.070 align:middle line:84%
We don't see ourselves as
the multidimensional beings

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:16.060 align:middle line:90%
that we actually are.

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:19.620 align:middle line:84%
And so typically when we
see a child who's showing up

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:22.740 align:middle line:90%
differently, uniquely--

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:25.920 align:middle line:84%
seeing things in the room
that nobody else sees,

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:29.910 align:middle line:84%
or talking to things that
nobody else is talking to,

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:34.770 align:middle line:84%
we have a tendency to put them
in the category of disordered,

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:36.170 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:39.320 align:middle line:84%
And this is where education
is really important now

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.320 align:middle line:84%
because we are at a
time in human history

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:46.820 align:middle line:84%
where we absolutely have to
begin to perceive ourselves

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:48.660 align:middle line:90%
as energy first.

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:52.040 align:middle line:84%
So when I work with people,
the very first thing

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:56.510 align:middle line:84%
that we go to is this is
what your child is doing,

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:58.730 align:middle line:84%
this is why they're
doing it, this

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:00.740 align:middle line:90%
is where they're doing it from.

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
that we want to do

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:05.030 align:middle line:84%
is we want to start
talking to that child

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:07.369 align:middle line:84%
about what they're
actually doing,

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:10.400 align:middle line:84%
not what we perceive
that they're doing.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that kind of
honoring of what's going on?

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:13.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Exactly.

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:14.560 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.670 align:middle line:84%
So something as
simple as, wow, I

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:19.500 align:middle line:84%
notice that you see something
in the room that I don't see.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:20.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: I notice
that you really like

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:26.540 align:middle line:84%
to snuggle up against my neck
and rub up against my neck.

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder if you're
getting information that way?

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.070 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if there's a reason
why certain foods that you

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:37.400 align:middle line:84%
won't eat are the ones
that you won't eat?

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.720 align:middle line:84%
What information-- we
want to look at everything

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:40.520 align:middle line:90%
as information.

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:41.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So be curious about.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Yeah.

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:42.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:44.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Yeah, curiosity.

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:46.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what about the
actual environment itself?

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.680 align:middle line:84%
Because you often
hear-- my neighbor,

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:52.340 align:middle line:84%
for example, is a doctor,
a wonderful woman.

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:53.810 align:middle line:90%
She's an angel.

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:55.650 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I think she really is.

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:57.770 align:middle line:90%
And she has two autistic sons.

00:17:57.770 --> 00:17:59.010 align:middle line:90%
One quite severe.

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:03.890 align:middle line:84%
The other not as severe
in terms of the disruptive

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:05.630 align:middle line:90%
behaviors in the household.

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:08.388 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out she's also
on the spectrum, right?

00:18:08.388 --> 00:18:09.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Yeah, it's very common.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:10.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:14.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so for
her, you can learn

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:16.340 align:middle line:90%
how to adjust around that.

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:18.710 align:middle line:84%
It's just like do not
go out with those people

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:20.540 align:middle line:90%
anymore to that restaurant.

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:23.300 align:middle line:84%
Because I can watch
her just shutting down.

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:24.950 align:middle line:84%
It almost seems
like she can't hear.

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:25.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Right, yeah.

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:26.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And she's just like--

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:27.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Yeah, overwhelmed.

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: a deer
in the headlights.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And I've just watched her
over a period of time.

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:32.070 align:middle line:90%
She never said anything.

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:34.782 align:middle line:84%
And then she'll just very
sweetly get up and say, well,

00:18:34.782 --> 00:18:35.990 align:middle line:90%
this has been nice and leave.

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Got to go.

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, how
do we start helping

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:43.010 align:middle line:84%
because this is not only
of the people in our lives.

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:44.030 align:middle line:90%
This is us.

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:46.490 align:middle line:84%
This is us in the
future, if not now.

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:49.550 align:middle line:84%
How do we create
environments that

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:53.680 align:middle line:90%
are more conducive to peace?

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.121 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Well, we become it.

00:18:56.121 --> 00:18:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is
where education really

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:00.250 align:middle line:90%
comes into play.

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about the
wish unit in a bit, too.

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:08.020 align:middle line:84%
A device that can help
with that as well.

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:11.280 align:middle line:84%
But this is the thing, it's
like the kids have always

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:16.320 align:middle line:84%
said we can't be here until
here is the frequency of love.

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:20.230 align:middle line:84%
We can't fully embody
here until here is love.

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And so this is where
we're in a transition.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:27.630 align:middle line:84%
We've had all of these kids
show up that on the one

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:31.440 align:middle line:84%
hand are holding this higher
vibration, this higher

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:35.250 align:middle line:84%
frequency and on the other
hand, are really challenging

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:37.470 align:middle line:84%
everybody in their
midst because they

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:39.510 align:middle line:90%
are holding that vibration.

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:44.790 align:middle line:84%
So this is where we
really are invited to find

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:46.590 align:middle line:90%
that peace within ourselves.

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:47.970 align:middle line:90%
And this is no small feat--

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:48.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not, it's not.

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:51.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: --for a parent of a
child diagnosed with autism.

00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:56.130 align:middle line:84%
But when we really begin
to understand that,

00:19:56.130 --> 00:20:00.000 align:middle line:84%
for, like your friend,
where is her peace?

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.590 align:middle line:90%
Where does she find peace?

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:03.930 align:middle line:84%
She finds peace in being
in that environment

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:06.990 align:middle line:84%
for a small period of time
and then leaving and going

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:09.840 align:middle line:84%
to where it feels a little
bit more sacred to her.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:13.980 align:middle line:84%
These ideas, these opportunities
to literally create

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.025 align:middle line:90%
sacred spaces--

00:20:15.025 --> 00:20:17.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what it seems
to me is really important.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: It's huge.

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:20.040 align:middle line:90%
It's hugely important.

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And this is also why this
population is demonstrating

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:28.890 align:middle line:84%
to us everything that does not
work for evolving humanity--

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:30.913 align:middle line:84%
like education,
public education--

00:20:30.913 --> 00:20:32.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
we're going to get into.

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:33.872 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: --public schools.

00:20:33.872 --> 00:20:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:39.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: When you're in an
environment where everything is

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:41.550 align:middle line:90%
about--

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:45.060 align:middle line:84%
where everything is about
getting something done and not

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:47.700 align:middle line:90%
anything about the being, right?

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.140 align:middle line:84%
That it's not going to
work for us anymore.

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.680 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to work
for an evolving humanity.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:57.930 align:middle line:84%
So, we really are looking
at creating these spaces.

00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And for those of us who have
this kind of information,

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:05.130 align:middle line:84%
helping in every way we can
to create them everywhere,

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:08.820 align:middle line:84%
because it's not just about
lowering the volume at a movie

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:15.500 align:middle line:84%
theater or creating
a school or a center

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:20.570 align:middle line:84%
where it's sensory appropriate
for this population.

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:23.160 align:middle line:90%
Those are all wonderful steps.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:26.960 align:middle line:84%
But if we're really talking
about the future of humanity

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:29.720 align:middle line:84%
and where these kids are
attempting to take us,

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:33.170 align:middle line:84%
then we really
need to go inward.

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:36.290 align:middle line:84%
We really need to
understand that by creating

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:40.790 align:middle line:84%
these spaces within ourselves,
we begin to create that field.

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And the more we
create that field,

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:45.622 align:middle line:90%
the more the kids show up.

00:21:45.622 --> 00:21:48.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Before we came on
here, when we were in the Green

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.390 align:middle line:84%
Room, I sent you this
little thing I just

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:51.980 align:middle line:90%
felt inclined to send you.

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting down to
read a book and, boom,

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:55.380 align:middle line:84%
this message starts
coming through.

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:58.400 align:middle line:84%
So I just took
dictation and I felt

00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.900 align:middle line:90%
compelled to share it with you.

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.290 align:middle line:84%
You were reading
it and you said,

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:03.380 align:middle line:84%
this is what the
kids are saying.

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And this has to do with
the absolute necessity

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:11.540 align:middle line:84%
that we, in every moment,
in every way possible,

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:13.680 align:middle line:84%
start connecting to
the frequency of love.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Yeah.

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If it's
an appreciation

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:16.940 align:middle line:90%
for your little puppy.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:18.530 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter what it is.

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:19.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Absolutely.

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:25.190 align:middle line:84%
It's anything that puts us
right in the world, anything

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:28.550 align:middle line:84%
that puts us right with
ourselves in the world.

00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And again, on the
one hand, that's

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.790 align:middle line:84%
not an easy task right
now because there's

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:38.210 align:middle line:90%
so much going on in the world.

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:40.700 align:middle line:84%
But again, I tell
parents all the time,

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:43.520 align:middle line:84%
turn it all off because
you are attempting

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:47.960 align:middle line:84%
to create an environment that
is literally sacred for you

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.190 align:middle line:90%
and your kids.

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And I have a couple that
I'm working with right now

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:54.410 align:middle line:90%
that I absolutely adore.

00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:56.390 align:middle line:90%
They're an Indian couple.

00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And because of their
culture, and because

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:02.900 align:middle line:84%
of their background,
they have practices

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.780 align:middle line:84%
that they do that
have really enhance

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:09.140 align:middle line:90%
that experience for them.

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:12.740 align:middle line:84%
The truth of who they are
is being more embodied.

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And as the truth of who they
are is being more embodied,

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:19.910 align:middle line:84%
of course, their
son, looks at them

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:21.920 align:middle line:84%
through those
multidimensional eyes,

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:24.170 align:middle line:84%
and through that
multidimensional sight,

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:28.100 align:middle line:84%
and is noticing what's working
for them in order to come in.

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:30.350 align:middle line:90%
And he tracks them right in.

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:31.830 align:middle line:90%
He follows them right in.

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:32.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:33.547 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:23:33.547 --> 00:23:35.030 align:middle line:10%
You know, what
happens when we're

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:37.520 align:middle line:10%
talking kind of
environmental, situational

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:42.280 align:middle line:10%
when these kids interface
a lot with technology?

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: It depends, honestly.

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:47.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it grounding,
or is it disorienting,

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:48.340 align:middle line:90%
or is it individual?

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: It's, in some
ways, it's individual.

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:52.300 align:middle line:84%
But I think with all
the kids that I've

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.610 align:middle line:84%
seen over the years,
what I will say

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:59.920 align:middle line:84%
is the technology in some
ways is multilayered,

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.600 align:middle line:90%
multi-dimensional as well.

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:06.110 align:middle line:84%
The way technology is set up
now, and I'm not a tech person,

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:11.500 align:middle line:84%
but what I notice is there's
an interest in that technology

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:14.458 align:middle line:84%
because it is
multilayered, multi--

00:24:14.458 --> 00:24:16.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It has
all these algorithms

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.420 align:middle line:90%
running behind the scenes.

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:18.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: Yeah, and it's short
and sweet and to the point.

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And it just keeps moving, which
is very similar to the kids.

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:34.300 align:middle line:84%
The challenge becomes when
that technology is really

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:41.200 align:middle line:84%
wrapped up in violence and/or
aggression and/or anything that

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:45.610 align:middle line:84%
really is not in alignment with
the souls of these kids seeking

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:47.170 align:middle line:90%
to come into the frequency.

00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:49.900 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That's
what my neighbor said

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:52.780 align:middle line:10%
she's concerned about
because her younger

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:57.520 align:middle line:10%
son has become addicted to
his technological devices,

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.240 align:middle line:10%
but he is doing violent games.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:00.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Yes.

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And she's seeing
big changes in his behavior.

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.540 align:middle line:84%
He's not even trying
at school now.

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:04.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Yeah.

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:06.442 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He doesn't
want to anymore.

00:25:06.442 --> 00:25:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: Well, even, I would say,
over the last few years now,

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.280 align:middle line:84%
I've had more
parents contacting me

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:16.030 align:middle line:84%
saying that they've
kids are literally

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:20.260 align:middle line:90%
throwing computers or phones.

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:24.160 align:middle line:10%
I did have a mom the other
day on the integration series

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.450 align:middle line:10%
that I teach and she
was saying, you know,

00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:28.900 align:middle line:10%
my child is definitely
giving me a message,

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:34.870 align:middle line:10%
but he's picking up my
cell phone and tossing it.

00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:36.100 align:middle line:90%
And it was great.

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:40.180 align:middle line:84%
I was like, would you
consider that maybe we

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:44.320 align:middle line:84%
are so into this technology
right now it literally is

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.450 align:middle line:90%
taking us away from ourselves?

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And maybe some of that time
could be spent internally,

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:56.020 align:middle line:84%
really kind of getting
to know who we are.

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And he just literally
is tossing it

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:03.760 align:middle line:84%
like that needs to go so
that we can be more present.

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:05.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, interesting.

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:09.010 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things you and
I talked about a few weeks ago

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:10.720 align:middle line:84%
when we decided to
do this interview

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:13.250 align:middle line:84%
is I had interviewed
Dr. Linda Bachman.

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:14.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Right.

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:16.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
many of the beings,

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:18.370 align:middle line:84%
people coming for
aggression now are

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:20.410 align:middle line:84%
finding they're
not from here, also

00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:24.790 align:middle line:84%
a big increase relatively
of the instance of people

00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:25.990 align:middle line:90%
on the spectrum.

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:31.990 align:middle line:84%
So coming in from other
places and you said, yes.

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:33.370 align:middle line:90%
And so let's talk about that.

00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And then I want to go
to ancient times past.

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.977 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk first about
beings who are telling you,

00:26:38.977 --> 00:26:40.810 align:middle line:84%
letting you know they've
come from somewhere

00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:42.340 align:middle line:84%
else for something
specific and may

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:44.350 align:middle line:90%
be wired entirely differently.

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:45.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Absolutely.

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:48.460 align:middle line:84%
So when I very first started
working with the kids,

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:51.370 align:middle line:84%
I used to ask all the
time, it's like, OK,

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:53.230 align:middle line:90%
clearly, you're not from here.

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:55.120 align:middle line:90%
You know, where are you?

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, I kind of
understood that the Earth

00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:00.760 align:middle line:90%
had 12 dimensions, you know?

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:02.022 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:27:02.022 --> 00:27:04.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You assumed it's a
dimension of Earth, initially.

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:07.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: I assumed it
was one of those, yes.

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:11.680 align:middle line:84%
But what was great
is, like, and quite

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:14.890 align:middle line:84%
honestly I wasn't at the time, I
wasn't looking into dimensions.

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:17.350 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what the different
dimensions actually really

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:18.170 align:middle line:90%
meant.

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:22.270 align:middle line:84%
But when I would ask, the kids
would say over and over again,

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:25.000 align:middle line:90%
you know, where are you from?

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.030 align:middle line:90%
19, 20, 32.

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:31.690 align:middle line:84%
I was like, OK, and
what are your bodies

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:34.690 align:middle line:84%
look like if you're
in those spaces?

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:36.910 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes those
bodies were light.

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:40.720 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes those bodies were
more like a consciousness.

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:44.750 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes those bodies
were in a physical form.

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:53.450 align:middle line:84%
But the whole expression of
that body was very different.

00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And they kept taking
me back to one

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:59.300 align:middle line:84%
of the very first
experiences I had

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:04.710 align:middle line:84%
after I met the kid
that changed my life

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:06.650 align:middle line:84%
and I went from being
speech pathologist

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:09.860 align:middle line:84%
to multidimensional
communicator.

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:13.220 align:middle line:84%
People used to come
to my office and they

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:16.520 align:middle line:84%
would lay down on
the table and I

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:18.470 align:middle line:90%
would do energy work with them.

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And when I would
close my eyes, I

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:27.350 align:middle line:84%
would see their bodies as
their galactic self, right?

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:29.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, what kind
of bodies have you seen?

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: All kinds of bodies.

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:36.200 align:middle line:84%
There are as many bodies
as you can conceive of.

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.680 align:middle line:84%
But what I also
realized, especially

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:45.610 align:middle line:84%
with this population, if
you have a body in a higher

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:51.160 align:middle line:84%
dimensional state that
is not in alignment

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:54.220 align:middle line:84%
with this human physical
body, this human physical body

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:57.550 align:middle line:84%
is going to have all kinds
of challenges, right?

00:28:57.550 --> 00:29:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And so, again, how do we
integrate those two realities?

00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:03.700 align:middle line:84%
It's like trying to put two
main frames of a computer

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:08.950 align:middle line:84%
together and have them
work as one unit, right?

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:10.480 align:middle line:84%
But this is something
that we need

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:14.620 align:middle line:84%
to address because, quite
frankly, every single one of us

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:18.070 align:middle line:84%
is attempting to go through
this same integration process.

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:22.060 align:middle line:84%
We're attempting to bring
the capacity that we actually

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:25.690 align:middle line:84%
are in these other worlds
and realms and realities

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:29.710 align:middle line:84%
into the human experience
so that we can gift back

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:33.575 align:middle line:84%
to humanity what
we are in truth.

00:29:33.575 --> 00:29:34.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
Earth, herself,

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:36.910 align:middle line:84%
is going through these
vibratory changes.

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:37.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Absolutely.

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:39.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Refining herself.

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And the only way to stay with
a body of any kind, a planet

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:46.230 align:middle line:84%
or whatnot, is you
have to keep pace

00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:48.790 align:middle line:84%
with the available
frequencies to incarnate into.

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:49.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Absolutely.

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:53.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you can't raise
your frequencies over time,

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:55.170 align:middle line:84%
you really can't
incarnate to Earth

00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:56.520 align:middle line:90%
or this iteration of Earth.

00:29:56.520 --> 00:30:00.282 align:middle line:84%
Maybe to another dimension
of it, but not this iteration

00:30:00.282 --> 00:30:01.740 align:middle line:84%
that we're all
sitting in together.

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:04.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: Well, and I see
it as going both ways.

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:09.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's like that Earth
mother is a consciousness

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:10.470 align:middle line:90%
of her own, right?

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:11.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Vast.

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:17.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: And so, to me, this
population is not just this

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:22.020 align:middle line:84%
population, but all the new
populations coming in are--

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:23.220 align:middle line:90%
there's an exchange.

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:27.090 align:middle line:84%
There's a vibrational exchange
going on between the Earth

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:29.250 align:middle line:90%
and this consciousness.

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:34.590 align:middle line:84%
Because as much as there
are all kinds of beings

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:37.110 align:middle line:84%
that we can interact
with and there's

00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:43.450 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of information that
we can be privy to as we open

00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:45.740 align:middle line:84%
to these different
realms of ourselves,

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:50.680 align:middle line:84%
I think the way that
humanity actually changes

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:54.130 align:middle line:84%
is by giving birth, by literally
physically giving birth

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:58.510 align:middle line:84%
to a child that holds a higher
vibrational field than what

00:30:58.510 --> 00:30:59.828 align:middle line:90%
has been here before.

00:30:59.828 --> 00:31:01.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It makes total sense.

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:01.900 align:middle line:90%
Its evolution.

00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:02.817 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Its evolution.

00:31:02.817 --> 00:31:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And with one in 43 kids
diagnosed on the spectrum,

00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:06.490 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's like--

00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, when
you started this--

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: One in 10,000.

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: One in 10,000.

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:13.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, one in 43.

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And that number is going
to continue reducing.

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:17.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Yes.

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:19.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, and what's
interesting too is

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:22.420 align:middle line:84%
that when you look at some
of the kids that were born

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:26.290 align:middle line:84%
like 25, 30 years ago,
like we were talking,

00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:29.170 align:middle line:84%
they did not have
the vibrational field

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:31.780 align:middle line:90%
to step into, right?

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:35.600 align:middle line:84%
It was very challenging for
them to be present here.

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:38.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lot of upheaval for
the families and the beings.

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Oh, terrible.

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And there was also
this energy of there

00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:46.660 align:middle line:84%
were very few of
those kids that were

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:49.690 align:middle line:90%
able to really fully embody.

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And by fully embody, I
don't mean that they end up

00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:53.560 align:middle line:90%
looking just like us.

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:57.940 align:middle line:84%
What I mean is they fully embody
that frequency that they are

00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:00.440 align:middle line:84%
and they expressed
it and act from that.

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:01.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: The kids that
are coming in now

00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:07.930 align:middle line:84%
have the benefit of those
that have come before them.

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And because humanity
as a whole is

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:16.450 align:middle line:84%
starting to wake up and
evolve, express differently

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:20.240 align:middle line:84%
than we have, they're
having a much easier time.

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.120 align:middle line:84%
That's why I love
getting families

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:24.310 align:middle line:84%
who have young kids
on the spectrum,

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:26.470 align:middle line:84%
because you know that
you can completely

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:33.190 align:middle line:84%
reorient how that experience
is going to be for them.

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:35.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and media
has been taking it on.

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:36.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Yes.

00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have in all
different kinds of shows

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:41.530 align:middle line:84%
someone on the spectrum
now is very common.

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:44.410 align:middle line:84%
Even in the world
of cartoons, they'll

00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:46.960 align:middle line:84%
have someone who's on
the spectrum amidst

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:49.630 align:middle line:84%
them who is screaming because
it's too loud or whatever.

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And they'll say it's
just that I'm sensitive

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.200 align:middle line:84%
and the sound feels
different to me.

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And so the educational process
is becoming almost ubiquitous

00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:59.980 align:middle line:90%
through entertainment and media.

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:01.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Right.

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And I love seeing
all of that shift.

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And me being a little
bit of a futurist myself,

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:12.250 align:middle line:84%
I still would love
this information

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:17.720 align:middle line:90%
to expand into we are energy.

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:19.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
it's not there yet.

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:20.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: I know.

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:20.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not
there physically.

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:23.420 align:middle line:84%
It's just accepting
people who are differently

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:26.090 align:middle line:84%
at this, which is further
along than we were

00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:27.370 align:middle line:90%
10 or 15 years ago, for sure.

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:28.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Oh, light years ahead.

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:29.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a start.

00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:32.150 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
that you talk about too

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:34.430 align:middle line:84%
is that aside from
many of the beings

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:37.340 align:middle line:84%
having totally different
cosmic bodies because they're

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:40.790 align:middle line:84%
from other places and who've
come for task for purpose,

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:44.330 align:middle line:84%
to teach, to help
lift the frequencies,

00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:46.490 align:middle line:84%
is also those who
are coming back

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:49.100 align:middle line:84%
after a long break
from Lemurian times.

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of our viewers
will find this interesting,

00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:55.730 align:middle line:84%
because many of them have past
life recall from the Lemurian

00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:57.900 align:middle line:84%
times and know a bit
about their own history.

00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:00.180 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
significance of that?

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: So, I kept
hearing from kids

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:08.353 align:middle line:84%
that they were from Lemuria
over and over and over again.

00:34:08.353 --> 00:34:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And I got in a little
trouble, actually,

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:12.420 align:middle line:84%
because I made a blanket
statement one point

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:15.719 align:middle line:84%
and said, you know, autistic
individuals across the board

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:16.830 align:middle line:90%
are from Lemuria.

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:18.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if that's the case.

00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:24.280 align:middle line:84%
The ones that come to me have a
tendency to have started there,

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:25.510 align:middle line:90%
you might say.

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:30.810 align:middle line:84%
So at the time of Lemuria,
we were in bodies of light

00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:34.050 align:middle line:84%
and the body frequency
and the consciousness

00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:39.719 align:middle line:84%
were much more able
to interface, right?

00:34:39.719 --> 00:34:43.810 align:middle line:90%
And so a lot of those children--

00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:46.520 align:middle line:84%
literally, the last
time they were here

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.870 align:middle line:84%
when I first started
working in '99,

00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:51.580 align:middle line:84%
the last time these
kids had been here

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:53.409 align:middle line:90%
was at the time of Lemuria.

00:34:53.409 --> 00:34:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And it just blew me away that
these children, these souls,

00:34:58.090 --> 00:35:03.400 align:middle line:84%
could come into form holding
that kind of frequency

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:08.840 align:middle line:84%
and yet being the
density of a 3D body.

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:12.400 align:middle line:84%
So if you put those two things
together, it's like no wonder

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:16.165 align:middle line:84%
that they have such a
challenge being in form.

00:35:16.165 --> 00:35:17.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That makes sense.

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And I reflect back to
my own spiritual group,

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:23.410 align:middle line:84%
my guides talking
to me about what

00:35:23.410 --> 00:35:25.400 align:middle line:84%
it was like in the
beginning here,

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:28.660 align:middle line:84%
which when everything was coming
in to formation before it was

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:32.290 align:middle line:84%
dense, before it had
dropped into this frequency,

00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:33.340 align:middle line:90%
this density.

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:34.690 align:middle line:90%
But the template was there.

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:36.290 align:middle line:90%
The beings were there.

00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And it does make sense that
those who did not choose

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:43.650 align:middle line:84%
to make that leap to incarnate
once we densify, so to speak--

00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:45.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Yes, exactly.

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and what pretty
much what we see now,

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:50.770 align:middle line:84%
it makes sense that
while I know many did not

00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:52.840 align:middle line:84%
choose to incarnate
during those times

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:56.680 align:middle line:84%
because it was too painful and
the merging wasn't going well.

00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:01.870 align:middle line:84%
But, like you say, the
Earth, herself, cosmically,

00:36:01.870 --> 00:36:03.770 align:middle line:90%
the frequencies are lifting.

00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:05.840 align:middle line:84%
So it makes sense
that the beings,

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.560 align:middle line:84%
just by virtue of the
lift and vibration,

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.690 align:middle line:84%
would be able to now
start contemplating

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:12.580 align:middle line:90%
coming into a physical body.

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:14.290 align:middle line:84%
But it's still
awfully dense compared

00:36:14.290 --> 00:36:20.230 align:middle line:84%
to what was in that pre-third
dimensional phase on Earth.

00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:22.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: The kids had
said at one point

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:24.730 align:middle line:84%
that there was a
harmonic convergence

00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:28.720 align:middle line:84%
or something along those
lines like in 1986, I think.

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:32.110 align:middle line:84%
That seemed to be a huge
portal to start letting

00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:33.743 align:middle line:90%
some of these souls come in.

00:36:33.743 --> 00:36:34.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:37.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: And some
came in beforehand,

00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:41.770 align:middle line:84%
but they started coming
in mass, you might say.

00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:44.530 align:middle line:90%
Then, it started to--

00:36:44.530 --> 00:36:46.450 align:middle line:84%
yeah, just create
a portal, I guess,

00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:51.010 align:middle line:84%
to really start opening them
up to come in and show up.

00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And then I also heard that
in 1995, a lot of the souls

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:59.200 align:middle line:84%
that started coming
in at that time

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:02.110 align:middle line:84%
of the harmonic convergence,
they started getting stuck

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:03.880 align:middle line:90%
is what the kids would say.

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:07.270 align:middle line:84%
And when I asked about
what that was about,

00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:12.670 align:middle line:84%
that's where we got into the
whole thing about vaccinations

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:13.690 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:17.930 align:middle line:84%
Because in 1995 is where the
American Medical Association

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:18.730 align:middle line:90%
went from--

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:19.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Schedule.

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:21.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: 12 to 36.

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:22.000 align:middle line:90%
Tripled it.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:22.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And there are many people
who make that argument.

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:25.420 align:middle line:90%
Many.

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:26.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Yes.

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:28.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can certainly go
to Children's Health Defense

00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:28.840 align:middle line:90%
to look into that.

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:29.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Totally.

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:30.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:32.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So here we're
talking about, we brought it

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:34.990 align:middle line:84%
up earlier, the
educational system.

00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:37.450 align:middle line:84%
How in the world-- and I
want to save a little time

00:37:37.450 --> 00:37:40.060 align:middle line:90%
for Wish and the technology.

00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:44.860 align:middle line:84%
How in the world are we
going to work this now?

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:47.260 align:middle line:90%
What, when, we get to--

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:49.120 align:middle line:90%
we're in one in 43?

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:52.920 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to be a leap
at all before it's 1 in 10.

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:57.100 align:middle line:84%
Or as educational systems
are completely outdated

00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:59.460 align:middle line:84%
for the new being, what
are we're going to do?

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:00.460 align:middle line:90%
How is this going to go?

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:03.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: Yeah, well, I think
that part of this last few years

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:06.940 align:middle line:84%
have been really helpful too
because so many parents have

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:08.860 align:middle line:84%
had to pull their
kids out of school--

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:09.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Because of COVID.

00:38:09.610 --> 00:38:10.443 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Yeah, right.

00:38:10.443 --> 00:38:11.890 align:middle line:84%
And it may not
have been something

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:14.770 align:middle line:84%
that they would have ever
considered doing before.

00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:20.860 align:middle line:84%
But for, I would say not all
of them, but for many of them,

00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:23.950 align:middle line:84%
they began to see that their
children function differently

00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:27.560 align:middle line:84%
because they were pulled
from those situations.

00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:30.640 align:middle line:84%
And again, I'm not saying that
every school is, you know?

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:32.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, it's
just a system that

00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:34.520 align:middle line:90%
was created out of past needs.

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:35.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Absolutely.

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:36.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not current
and future needs.

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:38.872 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: And I think that
that's an important word

00:38:38.872 --> 00:38:42.640 align:middle line:84%
to use is the system is
not a vibrational match

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:44.200 align:middle line:90%
to who these kids are.

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:46.505 align:middle line:84%
Some of the individuals
in those systems are--

00:38:46.505 --> 00:38:47.305 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:38:47.305 --> 00:38:48.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: --absolutely
a vibrational match.

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And some
schools are more.

00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:50.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Right.

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:54.520 align:middle line:84%
But what's fascinating
to me is that as parents

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.590 align:middle line:84%
have been pulling
their kids home

00:38:56.590 --> 00:39:00.070 align:middle line:84%
and have had to seek
other opportunities,

00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:03.280 align:middle line:84%
they're seeing that their
children are more comfortable,

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:09.250 align:middle line:84%
or are less aggressive,
or something's

00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:10.990 align:middle line:90%
changing behaviorally.

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And for a parent of a
kid on the spectrum,

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:16.600 align:middle line:84%
let me tell you if they
start seeing that shift,

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:20.110 align:middle line:84%
they also, then, are starting
to make these shifts.

00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:23.620 align:middle line:84%
And so parents that would never
have considered homeschooling

00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:27.490 align:middle line:84%
or doing other things along
those lines all of a sudden

00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:28.960 align:middle line:90%
are--

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.880 align:middle line:84%
something vibrational
has changed,

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:33.170 align:middle line:84%
something energetically
is different.

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:36.080 align:middle line:84%
So let's keep going
down this road.

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:37.850 align:middle line:84%
I honestly think we're
just going to keep

00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:40.130 align:middle line:90%
going down that line, you know?

00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And different people
are coming together now

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:45.710 align:middle line:84%
to literally create
sacred spaces.

00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:47.390 align:middle line:84%
They're literally
coming together

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:53.000 align:middle line:84%
to speak to who these
children are in truth

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.455 align:middle line:84%
and address them from
that vantage point.

00:39:55.455 --> 00:39:57.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
so many more people

00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:59.360 align:middle line:84%
are able to also
communicate telepathically

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:00.208 align:middle line:90%
than in the future.

00:40:00.208 --> 00:40:01.250 align:middle line:90%
I mean, then in the past.

00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:02.120 align:middle line:90%
That is our future.

00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:03.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Absolutely.

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:04.070 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:06.380 align:middle line:90%
And the kids are--

00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:08.390 align:middle line:84%
as the kids are working
with their parents

00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:12.680 align:middle line:84%
and they're working with people
like us who can access them,

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:17.510 align:middle line:84%
what ends up happening is
they give us little glimpses

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:18.740 align:middle line:90%
into their worlds.

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:22.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had a
kid a few years ago

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:24.140 align:middle line:84%
that literally just
grabbed my hand.

00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:27.640 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting on a park
bench and he grabbed my hand.

00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing I know I'm in
a completely different reality

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:32.470 align:middle line:90%
with him.

00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:35.200 align:middle line:84%
He's completely verbal
in that reality.

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:36.880 align:middle line:90%
He's in his art studio.

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:38.860 align:middle line:90%
He's telling me why he does art.

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:42.670 align:middle line:84%
He also does art in the
physical, in this world, right?

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And he's explaining all
of this information to me.

00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:51.220 align:middle line:84%
So what we really want
to begin to understand

00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:55.270 align:middle line:84%
is that they're
trying to access us.

00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And as we'll be
curious, like you

00:40:57.910 --> 00:41:03.760 align:middle line:84%
said, as we'll start asking more
questions than thinking that we

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:07.300 align:middle line:84%
have the answers, they
begin to open us up

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:10.240 align:middle line:84%
to our own
multidimensional capacity

00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:11.340 align:middle line:90%
just like they did for me.

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:13.090 align:middle line:84%
If they can do it for
me, they can do it--

00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:14.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:15.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: --anywhere.

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:16.112 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, go ahead.

00:41:16.112 --> 00:41:21.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: Yeah, so I was just
saying that this is the gift.

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And as they start
connecting with us,

00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:28.180 align:middle line:84%
we can start hearing
directly from them

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:30.460 align:middle line:84%
what is required for
the next education

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:34.353 align:middle line:84%
system, what is required for
the next medical systems.

00:41:34.353 --> 00:41:35.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we
can co-create it.

00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:37.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: And we can co-create it.

00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:39.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Meanwhile,
sometimes technology

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:40.290 align:middle line:90%
can give a little lift.

00:41:40.290 --> 00:41:40.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: A little boost.

00:41:40.690 --> 00:41:42.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so I want to
save just a few minutes for--

00:41:42.850 --> 00:41:43.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Yeah.

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:46.313 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So tell us
about the Wish technology

00:41:46.313 --> 00:41:48.730 align:middle line:84%
and-- we only have about five
minutes-- how it came about,

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:50.200 align:middle line:90%
what it's being used for now?

00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:53.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: Yeah, so the
Wish technology stands

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:57.640 align:middle line:84%
for World Integrity Space
Harmonizing Harmonizer.

00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that has
a fifth dimensional background.

00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:08.230 align:middle line:84%
So it has a different
state of consciousness

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:10.360 align:middle line:90%
that this was created from.

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And from me, for me,
I'm always looking

00:42:14.350 --> 00:42:17.170 align:middle line:84%
for things that can create
a higher symmetry state.

00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:20.818 align:middle line:84%
I'm always looking for
opportunities to create--

00:42:20.818 --> 00:42:22.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Coherent
symmetry so forth.

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:24.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: Exactly, and
create sacred space.

00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:28.090 align:middle line:90%
Basically, coherent space.

00:42:28.090 --> 00:42:32.100 align:middle line:84%
So this technology
was created really

00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:35.340 align:middle line:84%
to do just that so
that when somebody

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:39.930 align:middle line:84%
has this unit in their
home, it actually starts to,

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:46.870 align:middle line:84%
you might say, clear the
fields, clear the information

00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:50.320 align:middle line:84%
fields in the house, clear
the energy of the land.

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And then by connecting up
with the unit yourself,

00:42:54.490 --> 00:42:58.282 align:middle line:84%
it starts to clear each
individual in the household.

00:42:58.282 --> 00:42:59.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
happened when you

00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:04.150 align:middle line:84%
started playing with this with
some of your autistic clients?

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:08.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: What happened, we had
one experience in particular

00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:09.530 align:middle line:90%
that really struck me.

00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:12.100 align:middle line:84%
Because when I first
started working with this,

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:14.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm somebody who wants
to know that something's

00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:16.120 align:middle line:84%
going to do what it's
going to do in order

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:18.680 align:middle line:90%
to bring it to my population.

00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And so I was going to visit some
friends and have some body work

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:25.960 align:middle line:90%
and I took my unit with me.

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And they also have
a friend who's

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.330 align:middle line:84%
a client of mine who was
visiting at the same time.

00:43:32.330 --> 00:43:33.820 align:middle line:90%
So I gave them my unit--

00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:37.150 align:middle line:84%
they had just moved
into a new house--

00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:38.920 align:middle line:84%
so that they could
clear out the space.

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And they kept talking
about the fact

00:43:40.810 --> 00:43:43.900 align:middle line:84%
that this little girl
diagnosed on the spectrum

00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:45.880 align:middle line:84%
was doing so well
in this new house.

00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't paying
much attention to it

00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:49.600 align:middle line:84%
because I was there
for body work.

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:54.010 align:middle line:84%
So on one day in particular,
we are all eating

00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:57.970 align:middle line:84%
and the little girls started
becoming very aggressive,

00:43:57.970 --> 00:44:01.390 align:middle line:84%
and she just got very
anxious, and her mom

00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:05.050 align:middle line:84%
was trying to support her, and
that wasn't really working.

00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:06.550 align:middle line:84%
And my friend came
down the stairs

00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:08.800 align:middle line:90%
and I said, is the Wish unit on?

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And he said, no, I
just turned it off.

00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:14.260 align:middle line:90%
And I said, go turn it back on.

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:17.590 align:middle line:84%
So he turned it back on
and it took three minutes

00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:19.900 align:middle line:90%
for this child to regulate.

00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And I asked her mom, I
said, how long would this

00:44:23.110 --> 00:44:26.740 align:middle line:84%
have taken if you were at home
under regular circumstances?

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:28.840 align:middle line:84%
She goes an hour,
an hour and a half

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:31.900 align:middle line:84%
and I would have just been
pinched, and kicked, and hit,

00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:35.290 align:middle line:84%
and kind of bruised up
in the meantime as I

00:44:35.290 --> 00:44:37.250 align:middle line:84%
tried to support her
as moving through this.

00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:38.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:41.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: So it was exactly
what I was asking for,

00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:44.697 align:middle line:84%
because we didn't set
it up as an experiment,

00:44:44.697 --> 00:44:46.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You needed to
have some objective truth.

00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:46.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: I needed to
have some experience.

00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:47.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:47.290 --> 00:44:48.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Right.

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:50.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:52.310 align:middle line:84%
So people now, they use
it to help with their kids

00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:53.110 align:middle line:90%
and sooth them.

00:44:53.110 --> 00:44:54.970 align:middle line:84%
And when I first
heard about it, it

00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:56.920 align:middle line:84%
reminded me a
little bit of FLFE--

00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:58.570 align:middle line:90%
the Focus Life Force Energy.

00:44:58.570 --> 00:44:59.800 align:middle line:90%
Are they similar?

00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:02.140 align:middle line:84%
Do they have slightly
different functions?

00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:06.460 align:middle line:84%
They both bring up the
frequencies in a space.

00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:09.955 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: This, as I
have worked with this,

00:45:09.955 --> 00:45:11.710 align:middle line:90%
this is a consciousness.

00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:15.410 align:middle line:84%
So the consciousness has one
intention and one intention

00:45:15.410 --> 00:45:16.210 align:middle line:90%
only.

00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And that is for the highest
and best for each individual

00:45:19.810 --> 00:45:20.840 align:middle line:90%
in this space.

00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:22.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So does it
permeate a small space?

00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:23.933 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: 3,000 square feet.

00:45:23.933 --> 00:45:25.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 3,000 square feet?

00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:25.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Yeah.

00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:30.430 align:middle line:84%
It can also be connected to
each person in the household.

00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:33.200 align:middle line:84%
So for a child diagnosed
on the spectrum,

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:37.760 align:middle line:84%
let's say they're requiring a
little different vibrational

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:38.560 align:middle line:90%
space.

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:42.070 align:middle line:84%
You might say that maybe the
mother or the parents who

00:45:42.070 --> 00:45:45.490 align:middle line:84%
are attempting to
maybe work through some

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:48.010 align:middle line:84%
of their own emotional
stress of having a child

00:45:48.010 --> 00:45:49.850 align:middle line:90%
diagnosed with autism.

00:45:49.850 --> 00:45:52.570 align:middle line:84%
So it does different
things for different people

00:45:52.570 --> 00:45:55.540 align:middle line:90%
because it's a consciousness.

00:45:55.540 --> 00:46:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And I've had some really fun
experiences with it myself.

00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:03.850 align:middle line:84%
So I just, yeah,
I know that it's--

00:46:03.850 --> 00:46:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, did this come
about when William Tiller--

00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:08.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:46:08.050 --> 00:46:08.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: Yes.

00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:11.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Famous, wonderful
Dr. William Tiller,

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:13.600 align:middle line:84%
who's no longer with
us, the man who said

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:15.520 align:middle line:90%
love is the universal solvent.

00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:17.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SUZY: He was so right.

00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:18.235 align:middle line:90%
And the kids would--

00:46:18.235 --> 00:46:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
all agree with him.

00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:20.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: --applaud
him over and over.

00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:22.360 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:27.460 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, I worked
with Bill Tiller

00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:29.750 align:middle line:84%
to do the autism
intervention experiment.

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:30.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:32.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZY: And in
that experiment, we

00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:35.470 align:middle line:84%
use something called the
intention host device.

00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And the intervention
host device was brilliant

00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:43.374 align:middle line:84%
because Bill Tiller, in that
heart energy that he was,

00:46:43.374 --> 00:46:47.980 align:middle line:84%
was imprinting that intention
and broadcasting it.

00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And that intention
was coming directly

00:46:50.110 --> 00:46:52.600 align:middle line:84%
from the collective
consciousness of the children.

00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And then with his
heart energy, we

00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:58.570 align:middle line:84%
had some really lovely
success with that.

00:46:58.570 --> 00:47:02.230 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of what I would
consider the next generation

00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:04.480 align:middle line:90%
of the intention host device.

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:08.980 align:middle line:10%
And the consciousness
here is also love-based--

00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:10.930 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:10.930 --> 00:47:12.310 align:middle line:10%
>>SUZY: Love-based
consciousness.

00:47:12.310 --> 00:47:13.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:13.110 --> 00:47:14.290 align:middle line:90%
Yes, wonderful.

00:47:14.290 --> 00:47:16.720 align:middle line:84%
