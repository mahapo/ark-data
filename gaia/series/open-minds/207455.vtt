00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Your
parents were both born in Iran

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.820 align:middle line:90%
and became practicing Hindus.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.400 align:middle line:84%
Now what percentage
of residents of Iran

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.810 align:middle line:90%
would be considered Hindu?

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.390 align:middle line:90%
And you said, 000.1%.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ROHINI MORADI: We
lived there until 1989.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: And we were
finally able to flee.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.450 align:middle line:84%
My parents moved here
with $300 in their pocket.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: My.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: I had to start
masking and pretending

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.667 align:middle line:90%
I'm somebody I'm not to fit in.

00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:35.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Did you speak English?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: Not very
well, actually.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not very well.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: I knew
the word "apple."

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.352 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Apple, that's--

00:00:38.352 --> 00:00:39.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: [LAUGHS]
The astrologer

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.800 align:middle line:84%
told us there is a chance that
we would have another child

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.140 align:middle line:84%
and that this child wouldn't
be with us very long.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.810 align:middle line:90%
My daughter Rishi was born.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And we had one of the
most difficult experiences

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.180 align:middle line:90%
with her birth.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.980 align:middle line:84%
I have a really
hard time saying,

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.290 align:middle line:84%
things happened for a reason,
or anything like that,

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.885 align:middle line:84%
because there's so much
bad stuff that can happen.

00:00:59.885 --> 00:01:00.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: Little by
little, I was led

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.370 align:middle line:90%
to the words "Akashic Records."

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.200 align:middle line:90%
They shook me up.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.270 align:middle line:84%
There's a big chance
you're carrying trauma

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.120 align:middle line:84%
from your past life that's
not even a part of your soul.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.070 align:middle line:84%
It's something you
picked up somewhere.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.430 align:middle line:84%
Knowing that something like
this exists and is real

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.800 align:middle line:84%
has changed my path
in life so much.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.690 align:middle line:90%
The realization of--

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.420 align:middle line:90%


00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Today's
guest Rohini Moradi

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.010 align:middle line:84%
has lived her trials by
fire before returning

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.180 align:middle line:90%
to her true self.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Born in Tehran, Iran
as a practicing Hindu,

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.910 align:middle line:84%
her family was forced to
flee under the Ayatollah.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.070 align:middle line:84%
This is when her life
began turning dark.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.440 align:middle line:84%
But it's always the
darkest just before dawn,

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.020 align:middle line:84%
and that's a big part
of Rohini's story.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.770 align:middle line:84%
Rohini, thank you
for joining us.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: Thank you so much
for having me on the show.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.610 align:middle line:90%
It's an honor.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
kind of-- you've

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.338 align:middle line:84%
been doing what you're
doing for a while,

00:01:50.338 --> 00:01:52.890 align:middle line:84%
but being with the media and
on camera, and everything,

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:53.875 align:middle line:90%
is new to you.

00:01:53.875 --> 00:01:54.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Absolutely.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.170 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, so I
just want to welcome you

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.740 align:middle line:84%
and say thank you so much for
trusting us with your story.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.470 align:middle line:90%
It's a really interesting story.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think in American
culture, history is really not

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.900 align:middle line:84%
that prevalent in terms of
our academic understanding

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.700 align:middle line:90%
at large.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought this is
a wonderful opportunity

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.600 align:middle line:84%
to help expose people to an area
of the world that had some very

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.360 align:middle line:84%
complex history that you
were part of before we even

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.410 align:middle line:90%
go into your story.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.040 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, your parents
were both born in Iran

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.110 align:middle line:90%
and became practicing Hindus.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.520 align:middle line:90%
But they had traveled to India.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.150 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about that
part of the story, where

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.420 align:middle line:90%
this journey begins.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Thank you.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, both of my parents
individually traveled to India

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.130 align:middle line:84%
and fell in love
with the culture.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.210 align:middle line:10%
And my dad went as far
as becoming a pujari

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.105 align:middle line:10%
for the only Hindu
temple in Tehran.

00:02:48.105 --> 00:02:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And pujari is the
equivalent of priest.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.100 align:middle line:90%
So he would run the temple.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.860 align:middle line:10%
And my mom's attraction to
the culture and Hinduism,

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.900 align:middle line:10%
in general, led
her to that temple.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And they got married and
lived in the temple together.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:05.830 align:middle line:90%
And then we were born.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:06.630 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And their practices
really were in alignment with

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.200 align:middle line:90%
the Hindu faith--

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yes.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --the
yogic practices--

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yes.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.703 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --which
is not what we think

00:03:13.703 --> 00:03:15.880 align:middle line:90%
of as yoginis in Lululemon.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: No.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.263 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We think, in America,
that's what yoga is, but let's

00:03:19.263 --> 00:03:22.360 align:middle line:84%
talk about what yoga is in
the deepest truest sense.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: So yoga
is a way of life,

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.930 align:middle line:84%
and it incorporates all
aspects of the self.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And the asanas, or
the poses, are just

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.930 align:middle line:90%
a very small part of it.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.365 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, I think the
true core of what yoga is

00:03:37.365 --> 00:03:41.130 align:middle line:84%
is getting to know our
soul on a deeper level

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.330 align:middle line:90%
and understanding our soul.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.720 align:middle line:84%
So all these practices that
we do on a daily ritual,

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.750 align:middle line:84%
like cleanliness
or the way we cook

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.690 align:middle line:84%
or the poses or breath
work or meditation,

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.118 align:middle line:84%
are all designed to bring
us back to that inner light.

00:03:55.118 --> 00:03:56.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so you
were raised with this.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:57.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yes.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And can
you tell us when

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.830 align:middle line:84%
you were a little girl,
how it influenced your life

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:02.815 align:middle line:90%
or what you practiced?

00:04:02.815 --> 00:04:03.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Absolutely.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.210 align:middle line:84%
So when I was a little girl,
we lived in the temple.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.970 align:middle line:84%
So we were the only
family that lived there.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.680 align:middle line:84%
We would have weekly, I guess,
sermons you would call it,

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.140 align:middle line:84%
but the celebrations really,
where people would come

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.700 align:middle line:84%
and we would cook and
feed everybody and do

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.320 align:middle line:90%
a meditation and a teaching.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.850 align:middle line:84%
But the way our everyday
life looked was you get up,

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.060 align:middle line:84%
you clean, you chant,
you do breath work,

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.310 align:middle line:84%
you meditate, you
do yoga, and then

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.330 align:middle line:90%
you give back to your community.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.250 align:middle line:84%
So it was very common for
us to cook huge pots of food

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.030 align:middle line:84%
and distribute them, again,
around and feed the homeless,

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.060 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.410 align:middle line:84%
So our everyday life was
just tuning into ourselves

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.278 align:middle line:84%
and then giving to
our surroundings.

00:04:48.278 --> 00:04:49.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very beautiful.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.085 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: It was so beautiful.

00:04:50.085 --> 00:04:51.130 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so that did take
a little turn there for a while.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.860 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.970 align:middle line:84%
All right, so let's talk
about what happened.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.680 align:middle line:84%
Because we were
talking off camera.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.130 align:middle line:84%
I said, no, what percentage
of residents of Iraq

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.480 align:middle line:90%
would be considered Hindu?

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.220 align:middle line:90%
And you said, 000.1%.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was
the only temple.

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: The only temple.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:08.823 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The only temple.

00:05:08.823 --> 00:05:12.750 align:middle line:84%
So when the Ayatollah deposed
the Shah, came to power,

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.190 align:middle line:90%
what happened?

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.860 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: Well, my dad
and the whole temple,

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.580 align:middle line:90%
in general, struggled a lot.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted everyone to
conform to the Muslim faith.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And they were really
against anyone

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.110 align:middle line:90%
who saw outside of that box.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.260 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, that temple
was a big problem to them.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.170 align:middle line:84%
And I remember as
a little girl, we

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.680 align:middle line:84%
would have a lot of
government officials

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.820 align:middle line:84%
come and visit us and sit in
on the teachings of my father

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.490 align:middle line:84%
and just observe
what's really happening

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.210 align:middle line:84%
to see if we're telling people
not to be Muslim, or things

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.020 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And he actually ended up
going to jail a few times.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What did
they imprison him for?

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:56.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Just--

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Being an infidel,
I suppose, being an infidel.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so what was that
experience like for the family?

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.970 align:middle line:84%
Was he gone for a day or
two or a little longer?

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: Well, we
were really lucky,

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.700 align:middle line:84%
in a sense, because
my mom's family was

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.030 align:middle line:90%
connected to the government.

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.970 align:middle line:84%
So he was able to
get out safely,

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.730 align:middle line:90%
which a lot of people didn't.

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:19.830 align:middle line:90%
But, yeah--

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:20.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He would get
out for a little while,

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.170 align:middle line:84%
and then they'd
come get him again.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:22.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so this
went on until you

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.380 align:middle line:90%
realized you couldn't stay?

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: Well, I
believe that they

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.460 align:middle line:84%
were trying to leave most
of the time we lived there.

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:31.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: We lived
there until 1989.

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:34.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.262 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: And we were
finally able to flee.

00:06:36.262 --> 00:06:37.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ah, OK.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.790 align:middle line:84%
And you were-- how old
were you by this time?

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:39.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: I was eight years old.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:40.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Eight years old, OK.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And so then you got safely
out, and you came to America.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: We did.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.923 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why did
they choose America?

00:06:45.923 --> 00:06:50.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: You know, my dad
went to college in Detroit

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.160 align:middle line:84%
and just loved
everything America.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.000 align:middle line:84%
He moved to Florida at
18 and then to Detroit.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.405 align:middle line:84%
But America was glorified
in our household.

00:07:00.405 --> 00:07:02.260 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.940 align:middle line:84%
So it was just this
land of opportunity,

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.600 align:middle line:84%
where everyone
could be themselves.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the
main reason we came here.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so when you
came to America, first of all,

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.280 align:middle line:90%
where did you locate in America?

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: We located to the Bay
Area in Burlingame, California.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.417 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: South of San
Francisco, my hometown.

00:07:20.417 --> 00:07:21.217 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Oh!

00:07:21.217 --> 00:07:22.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes!

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And so, let's talk about
what began happening there

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.930 align:middle line:84%
because this was not a life
filled with prayer and service.

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:28.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: No.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You had
arrived in America.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:30.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a life of
individuality, accomplishment,

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.780 align:middle line:90%
achievement, and competition.

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:39.150 align:middle line:84%
OK, so what happened
to all of you--

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:40.080 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.480 align:middle line:84%
--from your dad's dream
of what it would be like?

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: [LAUGHS] I giggle
because the dreams were

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:46.650 align:middle line:90%
very big.

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:50.920 align:middle line:84%
My parents moved here
with $300 in their pocket.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:51.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: My.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: So you can
just imagine the road

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.990 align:middle line:90%
that would take you on.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:00.910 align:middle line:84%
We lived in a one bedroom
apartment, all five of us.

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:03.420 align:middle line:90%
And I loved it actually.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.980 align:middle line:84%
I loved being with my parents
and close to my family.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.070 align:middle line:84%
But it was just going
to school and getting

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:12.660 align:middle line:84%
to know my surroundings that
started this inner turmoil

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:16.020 align:middle line:84%
within me, where I felt
like I'm not good enough

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.620 align:middle line:84%
to be a part of the community,
where I had to start masking

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:24.150 align:middle line:84%
and pretending I'm
somebody I'm not to fit in,

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:26.800 align:middle line:84%
so that I don't get made
fun of for the clothes I'm

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:27.600 align:middle line:90%
wearing or--

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.470 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:29.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Did you speak English?

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:30.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: Not very
well, actually.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.220 align:middle line:90%
I knew the word "apple."

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:32.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Apple, that's--

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:33.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: [LAUGHS]

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:35.273 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that's
limited vocabulary

00:08:35.273 --> 00:08:36.690 align:middle line:84%
unless you're
hungry for an apple.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:37.559 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.840 align:middle line:84%
So you didn't
speak the language.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.340 align:middle line:90%
You had no money for clothing.

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.673 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't easy to fit in
with the other kids for you.

00:08:43.673 --> 00:08:44.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Not at all.

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's talk
about what that did to you

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.160 align:middle line:84%
inside and where it took you
when you entered your teenage

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.920 align:middle line:84%
years and what happened to
you that led you on, really,

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.140 align:middle line:84%
to a place that was
dark and mirrored a bit

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.018 align:middle line:90%
of your dad's past--

00:08:56.018 --> 00:08:57.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yes, of course.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:57.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --not for
the same reason.

00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:59.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: [LAUGHS]
No, not at all.

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:04.890 align:middle line:84%
But what that really did
was diminish my true spirit

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.110 align:middle line:84%
in a way, where I feel
like I had to hide it

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:09.040 align:middle line:90%
for a really, really long time.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And I made up this persona
that really wasn't me.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.860 align:middle line:84%
I started partying and
doing all these things

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.390 align:middle line:90%
that I wasn't happy doing.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.430 align:middle line:84%
Because really when
I was by myself,

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:22.680 align:middle line:84%
I would go to my room
and meditate or practice

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:22.770 align:middle line:90%
a yoga pose.

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:23.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, really?

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: Yeah, but when I
was outside, I was like, yay!

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:26.490 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:27.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, let's party.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:28.783 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Like me, please.

00:09:28.783 --> 00:09:30.940 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:33.750 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like that
ended up really

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:36.010 align:middle line:84%
killing my self-esteem
for a really long time.

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:38.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in your teenage
years, you were a party girl?

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: Yeah, absolutely,
teenage years, all my 20s.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:41.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah, it was--

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:46.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And at one point,
you ended up in prison.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:46.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: I did.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:47.875 align:middle line:90%
Well, in jail.

00:09:47.875 --> 00:09:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In jail,
not prison, in jail.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:49.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:50.430 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:51.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about that.

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: It was very
close to my 30th birthday.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And my husband and I
were on a camping trip

00:09:58.350 --> 00:09:59.430 align:middle line:90%
with a few friends.

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And we were drinking
for most of the day.

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:04.500 align:middle line:90%
And we got in an argument.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And out of nowhere really,
cops jumped out of the bushes.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:08.760 align:middle line:90%
And I feel like--

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.200 align:middle line:90%
I know this sounds really funny.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.960 align:middle line:84%
But there was a campsite
near us that was really loud,

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.835 align:middle line:84%
and I think somebody
called the cops on them.

00:10:14.835 --> 00:10:15.635 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:15.635 --> 00:10:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: But they heard
us arguing, and they came.

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:20.460 align:middle line:84%
And they took me, and
I was there overnight.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.370 align:middle line:90%
And it was terrifying.

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.080 align:middle line:84%
It was a really
big wake-up call.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:29.710 align:middle line:84%
Because after that, my father
picked me up in the morning.

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:32.250 align:middle line:84%
He was just, instead
of being disappointed,

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:35.070 align:middle line:84%
he was loving and went
through every step with me,

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:36.930 align:middle line:90%
but gave me a book.

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And I decided to actually
implement everything

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:42.030 align:middle line:90%
that was in that book.

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:43.197 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What was the book?

00:10:43.197 --> 00:10:47.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: The book was
"Psycho-Cybernetics," by--

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:48.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Maltz.

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:49.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Walter Maltz.

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:50.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Maxwell Maltz.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: Maxwell
Maltz, thank you!

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know this
because my father gave me

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:54.090 align:middle line:90%
that book when I was 18.

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:56.340 align:middle line:84%
It was the very first
book I was ever given

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.000 align:middle line:90%
about personal empowerment.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:58.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yes!

00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
"Psycho-Cybernetics."

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Wow!

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:01.830 align:middle line:90%
It changed my life.

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:03.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, it
was an amazing book.

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:06.360 align:middle line:90%
And so, OK, very good.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.090 align:middle line:84%
By the way, Mitch Horowitz,
who I also interview,

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:11.460 align:middle line:84%
he has the rights to
republish that book

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:15.180 align:middle line:84%
and has just a beautiful
limited edition of that book

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:19.680 align:middle line:84%
that's hardbound now, with
I think gold-gilded pages,

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.340 align:middle line:90%
gold leaf pages, and so forth.

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:23.670 align:middle line:84%
It's really-- I
was so happy to see

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:25.210 align:middle line:90%
the resurrection of that book.

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:26.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Wow.

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:26.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:26.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: That's incredible.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I just thought I'd
share that with you in case you

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:31.650 align:middle line:84%
wanted to maybe, for old time's
sake, pick up a new copy--

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:32.025 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Absolutely.

00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:32.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --share
it with people.

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:34.165 align:middle line:90%
It's still very valuable today.

00:11:34.165 --> 00:11:35.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Absolutely.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.110 align:middle line:84%
You know, I go through it
every couple of years still--

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:37.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, you do.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: --when I need
just a little rewiring.

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:40.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And for people that
don't know about it,

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.770 align:middle line:90%
he was a plastic surgeon.

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And what he realized is as he
was operating on these clients,

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:49.350 align:middle line:84%
that the clients
oftentimes did not

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:52.110 align:middle line:84%
feel any better about themselves
even after they had their dream

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:55.260 align:middle line:84%
face or dream nose,
dream whatever.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And he realized there
was something much deeper

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:58.550 align:middle line:90%
at play in belief systems.

00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:59.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:01.175 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So anyway, for
anyone who hasn't read it,

00:12:01.175 --> 00:12:03.640 align:middle line:84%
it's very, very beautifully
done and relevant.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.880 align:middle line:84%
So you read this, and
you started practicing.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.860 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's talk about
what happened after that.

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:12.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: Well, I started really
exploring that inner child

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:16.530 align:middle line:84%
of mine that I had abandoned
at that point of moving away

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:20.130 align:middle line:84%
from everything I had
known and learning

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:22.740 align:middle line:90%
how to love that person again.

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:27.330 align:middle line:84%
But during this journey,
maybe a few months--

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.090 align:middle line:84%
maybe about a year after that,
my husband and I got married

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:34.000 align:middle line:84%
and decided to bring my
daughter Pele into the world.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that she was
really an angel in my life

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:43.150 align:middle line:84%
placed right in front of me
to help me grow in that way.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that if I want
her to be self-confident,

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:50.910 align:middle line:84%
to love herself, to
follow her dreams,

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:53.700 align:middle line:84%
I have to show her
that I can do the same.

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, you had
to lead by example.

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:56.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:58.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, and then as I
understand it and remember,

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.300 align:middle line:90%
you had an astrological reading.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:01.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: I did, yes.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that indicated
this would be a good time

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:04.590 align:middle line:90%
to expand the family.

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:06.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: Absolutely,
yeah, after a few years

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:09.900 align:middle line:84%
of just soaking Pele up
in every way we could,

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:16.290 align:middle line:84%
I felt an itch to bring her
to the land of my upbringing.

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And we couldn't
take her to Iran.

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:21.120 align:middle line:84%
My husband's American,
and getting a passport

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.090 align:middle line:84%
for an American is
really difficult.

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And I explored it
for a while, but I

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.680 align:middle line:84%
realized that I could
take her to India,

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.250 align:middle line:84%
which was like a second
home to me growing up.

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:33.600 align:middle line:90%
So we traveled to India.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And my mom said, if
you're going to India,

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:40.170 align:middle line:84%
make sure you go to Rishikesh
and get an astrology reading.

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:44.200 align:middle line:84%
So that was pretty much
the main event of our trip.

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.500 align:middle line:90%
We made a-- we made a big--

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:48.300 align:middle line:90%
sorry.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.490 align:middle line:84%
We traveled all the
way up to Rishikesh

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:55.050 align:middle line:84%
and had an astrology reading
with a Vedic astrologer.

00:13:55.050 --> 00:14:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And the astrologer told us
that there is a chance that we

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:02.100 align:middle line:90%
would have another child.

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And if we did, this child
wouldn't be with us very long.

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And if we did have another
child, it would be a girl.

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:11.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.260 align:middle line:90%
That's a very precise reading.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:14.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: It was very precise.

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:16.343 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what did
you think about that?

00:14:16.343 --> 00:14:18.320 align:middle line:84%
You thought, OK, I feel
the urge to do this.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.820 align:middle line:84%
But what does it mean, they're
not going to be with us long?

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: I didn't
understand it.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.155 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You didn't.

00:14:23.155 --> 00:14:25.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: No, we cried
all night after because it

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:28.250 align:middle line:90%
hit a very special place.

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And we really weren't planning
on having any other kids.

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:33.560 align:middle line:90%
We were so happy with Pele.

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:37.490 align:middle line:84%
But this just really stirred
something unnatural up

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:39.470 align:middle line:84%
within both of us,
where we're like,

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:41.240 align:middle line:90%
I really do want another child.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.175 align:middle line:84%
And my husband had
the same feeling.

00:14:43.175 --> 00:14:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you just
ignore the part about,

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:46.400 align:middle line:84%
but they wouldn't
be with you long,

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:46.880 align:middle line:84%
or just didn't know
what to do with it?

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: I didn't
understand that.

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:49.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:50.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: I really didn't.

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.220 align:middle line:90%
He kept saying, the line--

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.380 align:middle line:90%
her line fades.

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:57.230 align:middle line:84%
But he didn't say, she's
going to pass away,

00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:00.020 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:02.750 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really understand
it, to be honest with you.

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:03.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So--

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:04.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: So--

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:05.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --you go
ahead and decide,

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:07.100 align:middle line:84%
let's go ahead and
do this thing--

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:07.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:08.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --to
have another baby.

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
what happened then.

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:12.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah, so we went--

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:16.520 align:middle line:84%
when I came back, I really got
back into my spiritual side

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.900 align:middle line:90%
and was meditating again.

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:22.790 align:middle line:84%
And my daughter Rishi was
born February 18, 2018.

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And we had one of the
most difficult experiences

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:31.560 align:middle line:84%
with her birth, maybe not
the most, for me, the most.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:38.030 align:middle line:84%
So once we got to the hospital,
my pain went from maybe a two

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:42.590 align:middle line:84%
to a 20, way over
10, rather quickly,

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:44.480 align:middle line:84%
where the nurse was
a little concerned,

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.860 align:middle line:90%
like, OK, this is not normal.

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:48.860 align:middle line:84%
But just move
around, sit around.

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:50.120 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what happens.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And it was so excruciating
that I started

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:55.650 align:middle line:90%
asking for pain medication.

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:57.000 align:middle line:90%
They were like, let's hold off.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.380 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what happens.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:03.750 align:middle line:84%
So I sat down on the
bed and was trying

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:05.050 align:middle line:90%
to work through the pain.

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:07.710 align:middle line:90%
And I lost my breath.

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And my vitals and Rishi's
vitals dropped way

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:17.370 align:middle line:84%
below a level that is
comfortable for the hospital.

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:18.840 align:middle line:90%
So the nurse panicked.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.070 align:middle line:90%
She didn't say anything.

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:21.520 align:middle line:90%
She's like, we have to go.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.670 align:middle line:90%
My husband had to stay back.

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:28.680 align:middle line:84%
She rushed me to the
emergency C-section room.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And everyone was just screaming
around me like, we need this.

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:38.310 align:middle line:84%
We need that, like panicking
and then panicking me.

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
I'm not breathing.

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:41.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:42.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: I'm not breathing.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And then at a certain
point, I left my body.

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And I was above my
body, watching myself,

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:56.200 align:middle line:84%
with the doctors and
nurses yelling at me

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.740 align:middle line:84%
and telling me that I have
to move from the bed I'm

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:00.790 align:middle line:90%
in to the other bed.

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:03.430 align:middle line:84%
They don't have enough
people to move me.

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:05.661 align:middle line:90%
If I don't move, we're all--

00:17:05.661 --> 00:17:07.119 align:middle line:84%
my daughter and I
are going to die.

00:17:07.119 --> 00:17:08.319 align:middle line:90%
They kept saying that.

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And I'm viewing myself from
above my body at this point,

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.780 align:middle line:90%
where I can't move myself.

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:19.680 align:middle line:84%
But it was a very strange
feeling of being above myself.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:26.190 align:middle line:84%
But instead of feeling fear or
any negative thought like that,

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:29.310 align:middle line:84%
I felt a lot of
love and more love

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:31.560 align:middle line:84%
than I've ever felt
in my whole life.

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And the type of love
that I felt was--

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.410 align:middle line:84%
can, I guess, best be described
as interconnectedness.

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:44.730 align:middle line:84%
I felt so connected to every
single person in that room

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:46.500 align:middle line:90%
and not in the room.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And just, I knew I was going to
be OK no matter what happened.

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:54.660 align:middle line:90%
It was very calming.

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:59.400 align:middle line:84%
So at a certain point, they
move my body to the other table.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And my oxygen mask isn't
working, and they're just--

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:05.872 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: God.

00:18:05.872 --> 00:18:07.080 align:middle line:90%
Could anything else go wrong?

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: [LAUGHS] I don't know!

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:09.450 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:13.085 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, OK, so then they
were able to get the baby out.

00:18:13.085 --> 00:18:15.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: Yeah, they were
able to get the baby out.

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:17.700 align:middle line:84%
I came back in my body
before they got the baby out

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:18.870 align:middle line:90%
because I started breathing.

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, they
got the baby out.

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:27.090 align:middle line:84%
She didn't cry for
maybe a minute, or so.

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:28.080 align:middle line:90%
Everyone is panicked.

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.580 align:middle line:90%
But I'm back in my body.

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:31.620 align:middle line:84%
No one knows what
just happened to me.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.290 align:middle line:90%
And I'm feeling so much bliss.

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:36.240 align:middle line:90%
And I'm so happy.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm not worried.

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:38.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm not scared.

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, I heard
her cry eventually.

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:43.770 align:middle line:90%
And I held her.

00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:47.260 align:middle line:90%
And it felt like home.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:48.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:48.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this
blissful experience,

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:52.800 align:middle line:84%
this feeling like
home, she's alive.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.390 align:middle line:90%
You're alive.

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:57.810 align:middle line:84%
Did she have any health
impediments at that time when--

00:18:57.810 --> 00:18:58.780 align:middle line:90%
or was she OK?

00:18:58.780 --> 00:18:59.580 align:middle line:90%
She was healthy.

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:00.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: She was very healthy.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.150 align:middle line:84%
They checked
everything, and she was

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:06.850 align:middle line:84%
just perfect on every
measure that they tested.

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:08.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So then
two months pass.

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:09.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:10.947 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And what happened?

00:19:10.947 --> 00:19:15.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: Well, leading
up to the two months,

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:18.600 align:middle line:84%
she would lose her breath
often when I was holding her.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.415 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:19:19.415 --> 00:19:20.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just
stopped breathing?

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:22.165 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: Just
stopped breathing.

00:19:22.165 --> 00:19:23.640 align:middle line:84%
The same thing that
happened to me,

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.640 align:middle line:84%
I watched happen to her
probably, maybe two or three

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.440 align:middle line:90%
times.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.270 align:middle line:90%
And it worried me.

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:35.250 align:middle line:84%
I had to shake her, like really
shake her to wake her up.

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:38.490 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, one night
she went to bed.

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And I had slept longer
than I had in a long time.

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And I immediately knew
something was wrong.

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And my husband rushed
into my room, just like,

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.330 align:middle line:90%
Rishi's not breathing.

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:51.720 align:middle line:84%
We need to call the doc--
we need to call 9-1-1.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:52.590 align:middle line:90%
So we called.

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:53.760 align:middle line:90%
They immediately came.

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.690 align:middle line:84%
It was about maybe 60 seconds
after we called that they came.

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:01.710 align:middle line:84%
But we watched them try
to retrieve her there.

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:03.240 align:middle line:90%
They rushed her to the hospital.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.070 align:middle line:84%
I went with her, and
my husband stayed back

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:06.450 align:middle line:90%
with our daughter Pele.

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:10.150 align:middle line:90%
And I watched them work on her.

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:14.348 align:middle line:84%
And at this point, I'm pleading
with the universe, please--

00:20:14.348 --> 00:20:15.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --let her live.

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:16.598 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: --I'll do anything.

00:20:16.598 --> 00:20:19.080 align:middle line:90%
I'll give anything up.

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.400 align:middle line:90%
I'll do anything.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:24.840 align:middle line:10%
And something in me
knew she wasn't there

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:29.250 align:middle line:10%
because the look on the nurses'
faces and doctors' faces

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:32.430 align:middle line:10%
and the measures
they were taking,

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:39.340 align:middle line:10%
but, yeah, eventually they told
me that she's not coming back.

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And at this point, I
fell to the ground.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And I remember this
vision so clearly

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:54.710 align:middle line:84%
of seeing my shoes and
my coat and falling,

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:58.130 align:middle line:84%
but then watching the back
of my head hit the ground.

00:20:58.130 --> 00:20:59.550 align:middle line:90%
And I'm still standing there.

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:02.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, I'm not
in my body again.

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And I went up, and I
looked around again.

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:07.100 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's crying.

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And people are trying to get me
up, but I'm just on the ground.

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And I realized,
[EXHALES SHARPLY] I'm

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.310 align:middle line:90%
in that connected feeling again.

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's probably
where she's at.

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:18.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:23.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: So, yeah, somehow
I got myself together.

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.610 align:middle line:84%
We went and said
goodbye to her body

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:31.180 align:middle line:84%
and went home and
tried to be normal.

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:31.980 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:33.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, but
something happened

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:36.540 align:middle line:84%
in you that took you to
a new level, this feeling

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:37.740 align:middle line:90%
of interconnectedness.

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:40.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, where did this take
you on a spiritual level?

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And did you ever piece together
that what the astrologer told

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:48.800 align:middle line:84%
you-- did you ever piece
whether it was a warning

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.050 align:middle line:84%
or was it something
to simply inform

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:54.560 align:middle line:90%
you of a certain destiny?

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: I would
go with destiny.

00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:58.040 align:middle line:90%
It didn't seem like a warning.

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And I feel her
impact was designed

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:09.150 align:middle line:84%
in a way where I have a
really hard time saying,

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:11.460 align:middle line:84%
things happen for a reason,
or anything like that,

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:15.940 align:middle line:84%
because there's so much [LAUGHS]
bad stuff that can happen.

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:22.410 align:middle line:84%
But I feel that she
came and had that impact

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:25.410 align:middle line:84%
to change the
world somehow and--

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:27.545 align:middle line:90%


00:22:27.545 --> 00:22:28.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -- and
by changing you.

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: --and
changed me, yeah.

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:32.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --by changing you,
and you can then help the world.

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:33.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Absolutely.

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:34.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:35.370 align:middle line:90%
So she had a short mission.

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:35.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:37.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And who
knows where she is now.

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:37.275 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:22:37.275 --> 00:22:37.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: She's
watching over us.

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:39.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, she's watching.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And she may even be
incarnate-- or maybe waiting

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:44.220 align:middle line:84%
for someone in your bloodline,
or something, one day.

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:45.180 align:middle line:90%
Who knows where she is.

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:47.820 align:middle line:84%
But she came for this
one moment in time

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:50.700 align:middle line:84%
to help you and help
both you and your husband

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:52.030 align:middle line:90%
come to a new level.

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:53.940 align:middle line:84%
So this opened up
a subject for you

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:56.820 align:middle line:84%
that you started diving
into and the notion

00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:58.210 align:middle line:90%
of looking into the Records.

00:22:58.210 --> 00:22:59.010 align:middle line:90%
Who are we?

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:00.210 align:middle line:90%
Where have we been?

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:01.080 align:middle line:90%
What are we about?

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:04.170 align:middle line:84%
What are we trying to define
in ourselves at this time?

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And you were looking
at it through the lens

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.075 align:middle line:90%
of reading the Akashic Records.

00:23:08.075 --> 00:23:08.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Absolutely.

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:10.533 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about the leap

00:23:10.533 --> 00:23:14.250 align:middle line:84%
from after her
passing, her transition

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:18.270 align:middle line:84%
to getting into Akashic
Record reading and studies.

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:23.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: [LAUGHS] So shortly
after she passed away,

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:28.360 align:middle line:84%
this wonderful woman started
having dreams about my family.

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I'm
telling you this too

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:34.500 align:middle line:84%
is because for so
long, I had hidden

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:36.930 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual part of
myself and ignored it

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:39.700 align:middle line:84%
and just didn't want to
have anything to do with it.

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:43.105 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to be the
odd one in the room, who's

00:23:43.105 --> 00:23:43.905 align:middle line:90%
talking about--

00:23:43.905 --> 00:23:44.730 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:45.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:49.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: It was traumatic
for me when I was a child.

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.660 align:middle line:84%
So I'm like, I
can't do that again.

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:54.810 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like this
woman is a big part of it

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:58.260 align:middle line:84%
and really opened up my
perception once again

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:00.900 align:middle line:84%
and made me realize
that there is

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:04.170 align:middle line:84%
so much that we
don't consider or we

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:05.970 align:middle line:90%
don't let ourselves open up to.

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:08.970 align:middle line:84%
At least, for me,
that was the case.

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:14.350 align:middle line:84%
So this person is my husband's
sister's husband's co-worker.

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:15.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:17.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: And [LAUGHS] he works
at a construction company.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:18.433 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Loosely related, yeah.

00:24:18.433 --> 00:24:19.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Very loosely related.

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:22.590 align:middle line:84%
But about nine days
after she passed,

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:26.400 align:middle line:84%
this woman started having
really, really deep dreams

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.210 align:middle line:90%
about us.

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And during that same time,
we were building an itinerary

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:37.140 align:middle line:84%
to go back to
India, to Rishikesh

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:40.560 align:middle line:84%
to release her ashes into
the Ganges, Rishi's ashes

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.670 align:middle line:90%
into the Ganges.

00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't want to tell
us about the first dream.

00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:51.810 align:middle line:84%
But once we were in India,
she had a very vivid dream

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:54.480 align:middle line:84%
about the exact place we
were in in India, which is

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.610 align:middle line:90%
a small town called Haridwar.

00:24:56.610 --> 00:25:05.350 align:middle line:84%
And this person, this
not-so-well-known angelic

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:08.740 align:middle line:84%
person in the Hindu
tradition, came in the dream,

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:10.880 align:middle line:84%
where we didn't know
about her either,

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.000 align:middle line:84%
and was giving her
messages to give to us.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.730 align:middle line:90%
And it just so happens that--

00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:17.950 align:middle line:90%
and her name is Anandamayi Ma.

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And her temple and where her
body lays is in the same town

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:24.820 align:middle line:90%
we were in.

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:26.200 align:middle line:90%
So this was fascinating.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.170 align:middle line:84%
We were like, there's a
lot of serendipity here.

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:31.280 align:middle line:84%
So my heart started
opening up a little.

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:34.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, OK, I can take
in this information,

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.340 align:middle line:90%
I guess, and maybe believe it.

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:39.970 align:middle line:84%
But these dreams ended up
giving us exact directions

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:42.430 align:middle line:84%
to go on this very spiritual
journey while we were there.

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:43.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did she ever
end up telling you

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:44.530 align:middle line:90%
what the first dream was?

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:44.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:44.950 align:middle line:90%
I have all the dreams.

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:46.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What was it?

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: The first dream
was about Rishikesh.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:53.620 align:middle line:84%
And, oh, the first dream
was leaving her body

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:57.380 align:middle line:84%
and being in the neighborhood
we live in San Francisco,

00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:59.270 align:middle line:84%
even though she didn't
know where we lived.

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:03.880 align:middle line:84%
But she mentioned the popular
parts of that neighborhood.

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And going up, zooming out on
Earth, and seeing spirits,

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:14.590 align:middle line:84%
wisps, flowing everywhere and
how some of them would dim

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:16.810 align:middle line:84%
and some of them
would brighten up

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:22.570 align:middle line:84%
and how it was a symbolism for
souls leaving and coming back.

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:24.970 align:middle line:90%
But the wisps stayed.

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:26.573 align:middle line:84%
They just either
dimmed or didn't.

00:26:26.573 --> 00:26:27.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:28.907 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: It was
very interesting.

00:26:28.907 --> 00:26:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how
did this lead you

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:34.210 align:middle line:84%
to studying the Akashic
Records under Linda Howe?

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:38.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: Well, I sat
in meditation every day

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:45.010 align:middle line:84%
and asked for healing and
to connect with the spirit

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:47.080 align:middle line:90%
of Anandamayi Ma and Rishi.

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And eventually,
little by little,

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:52.870 align:middle line:84%
I was led to the words
"Akashic Records."

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And I had never
known of them before.

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:58.990 align:middle line:84%
But upon first sight,
they shook me up.

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And I sensed such a familiarity
that I knew I had to explore.

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:07.970 align:middle line:84%
I did ignore it for
quite some time,

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:12.710 align:middle line:84%
though, because, again, I'm
very reluctant about going down

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:15.855 align:middle line:84%
the rabbit hole of the
spiritual side of things, just

00:27:15.855 --> 00:27:16.655 align:middle line:90%
from my experience.

00:27:16.655 --> 00:27:18.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, from
ridicule, and all that.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:22.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you start going
into the Akashic Records.

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:23.540 align:middle line:90%
You start studying it.

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:24.920 align:middle line:90%
You start going into your own.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:26.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about what

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:28.925 align:middle line:84%
happened there, what happened
to your health, everything.

00:27:28.925 --> 00:27:30.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah, absolutely.

00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:34.610 align:middle line:84%
When I first was able to
access my own Akashic Records,

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:37.820 align:middle line:84%
most of the guidance
was how to heal myself

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:40.860 align:middle line:84%
and how to become
a healthy person,

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.070 align:middle line:84%
so I can receive bigger
messages, really.

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:47.810 align:middle line:84%
So I ended up drinking more
water, meditating more.

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:52.410 align:middle line:84%
One of the lessons was that
I have to take cold showers.

00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:53.900 align:middle line:84%
So I started taking
cold showers.

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:57.920 align:middle line:84%
I did everything that would come
to me in the Akashic Records.

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, I realized
that what's happening

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:07.280 align:middle line:84%
is I'm preparing my body for
something a little bigger

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.160 align:middle line:90%
than I can comprehend.

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:09.960 align:middle line:90%
So that was--

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:11.555 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so let's
talk about what you

00:28:11.555 --> 00:28:12.722 align:middle line:90%
were preparing yourself for.

00:28:12.722 --> 00:28:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about the
fact that other lifetimes

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:17.390 align:middle line:84%
of information started
flowing into you.

00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:19.400 align:middle line:84%
So go ahead and
tell us that now.

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:22.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: Yeah, so one of
the most interesting things

00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:25.370 align:middle line:84%
that flowed through
the Akashic Records

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:28.670 align:middle line:84%
is that in a very
past life of mine,

00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:32.690 align:middle line:84%
I was one of the rishis that
were sitting in the Himalayan

00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:34.100 align:middle line:90%
mountains and meditating.

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And my daughter
Rishi was my friend.

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:39.140 align:middle line:90%
We meditated together.

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And we were connected
in that way.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And we have gone through
many lifetimes together.

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very slow evolution
to bring this inner light back

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:55.830 align:middle line:90%
to people.

00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:59.550 align:middle line:84%
So it's-- I don't even
know how to explain it,

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:07.320 align:middle line:84%
but it's this profound feeling
and mission in a way that I

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:08.850 align:middle line:90%
finally decided to accept.

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And I was conducting readings
for others for a while

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:16.350 align:middle line:84%
and realized that the ripple
effect of that is so small.

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:19.560 align:middle line:84%
So I eventually transitioned
into teaching people

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:21.630 align:middle line:84%
how to open their own
records because it's really

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:25.740 align:middle line:84%
about empowerment when
it comes down to it.

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:28.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So did you ever
learn any more about Rishi?

00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And during this,
did she tell you

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:33.660 align:middle line:84%
why she came for just that brief
period of time to be with you?

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:34.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: No, no.

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:35.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:38.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: Because it's
a really-- our soul

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:39.600 align:middle line:90%
is a really sacred place.

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:46.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very reluctant to go and
search in somebody else's soul.

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:50.690 align:middle line:84%
So I only really explored my
own up until a certain point.

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And after some
exploration, I realized

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:56.450 align:middle line:84%
that I don't need to keep
bringing up these old wounds

00:29:56.450 --> 00:30:01.550 align:middle line:84%
and investigating them
because it wasn't healthy.

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:03.750 align:middle line:84%
Unless it's coming
up in my life,

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:07.820 align:middle line:84%
I leave it, let it
be at this point.

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:09.950 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, I've
never really dove in

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:12.930 align:middle line:84%
and explored her
journey too much.

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So here you are.

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:17.510 align:middle line:84%
You say you've
accepted the mission.

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And you've come
out of the closet.

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:21.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: [LAUGHS]

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:23.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
you're now starting

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:26.090 align:middle line:84%
to accept the spiritual
aspects of yourself

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:28.160 align:middle line:84%
and what you've come to
Earth to do at this time,

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:29.360 align:middle line:90%
in this lifetime.

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:32.875 align:middle line:84%
And so in facilitating people
to read their own records-- when

00:30:32.875 --> 00:30:34.250 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at
records, you're

00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:36.290 align:middle line:84%
usually talking about
past incarnations.

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:37.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yes.

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:40.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, it's
interesting because I've

00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:44.418 align:middle line:84%
heard that debate in modern
society in America for so long.

00:30:44.418 --> 00:30:46.460 align:middle line:84%
Why do you want to know
anything about your past?

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:48.477 align:middle line:84%
You just need to
focus on your present.

00:30:48.477 --> 00:30:50.060 align:middle line:84%
If you do your present
right, the past

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:51.810 align:middle line:90%
doesn't matter, and on and on.

00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I've had so many people
debate this point with me.

00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I have my
own perspective on it.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And so let's have
your perspective

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:04.130 align:middle line:84%
on the value of opening
up to your own records

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:05.805 align:middle line:90%
and your own past lives.

00:31:05.805 --> 00:31:06.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Absolutely.

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.270 align:middle line:90%
There's so much value in it.

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:10.945 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times,
we carry and loop

00:31:10.945 --> 00:31:12.320 align:middle line:84%
around the trauma
that's happened

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:15.560 align:middle line:84%
in a different lifetime that
we've held on to unknowingly.

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And it shows up in
our current life.

00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And if something
is bothering you,

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:23.780 align:middle line:84%
if you keep running into
the same type of situation

00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:26.810 align:middle line:84%
with others or yourself,
there's a big chance

00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:29.130 align:middle line:84%
you're carrying trauma
from a past life.

00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:34.490 align:middle line:84%
So going and investigating that
unravels the tension around it

00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:38.960 align:middle line:84%
and gives you the tools to know
how to navigate and that you

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:42.200 align:middle line:84%
actually don't-- you don't have
to carry that with you forever

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.270 align:middle line:84%
or that's not even
a part of your soul.

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:46.370 align:middle line:84%
It's something you
picked up somewhere.

00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like that's
a really important tool.

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:51.470 align:middle line:84%
I do always recommend,
though, to not just go

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:55.370 align:middle line:84%
searching for anything
because that just--

00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:58.250 align:middle line:84%
there's so much you
can unravel there.

00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:01.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, to be pointed
when you go into your search

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:04.340 align:middle line:84%
to begin with, that there's
something specific that you'd

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:05.550 align:middle line:90%
like to be working on.

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:10.580 align:middle line:84%
So initially, besides the
life with Rishi before,

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:12.860 align:middle line:84%
what else did you find
out about your past

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:15.560 align:middle line:84%
that you were carrying
forward by way of any programs

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:16.892 align:middle line:90%
or habits in this lifetime?

00:32:16.892 --> 00:32:18.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: One of
the biggest things

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:23.070 align:middle line:84%
that I found that I was
carrying with me was I

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:28.200 align:middle line:84%
had a big vision about
being prosecuted as a witch

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.470 align:middle line:90%
and burned.

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:31.230 align:middle line:90%
It was very vivid.

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And I feel my soul learned
to hide its power so that it

00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:43.470 align:middle line:84%
doesn't reveal itself too
much and so that people

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:44.735 align:middle line:90%
can't point fingers.

00:32:44.735 --> 00:32:46.860 align:middle line:84%
I feel like in this lifetime,
I kept putting myself

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:50.460 align:middle line:84%
in situations where that would
happen to me, to be ridiculed

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:53.460 align:middle line:84%
and to be made small
and to have to hide.

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:56.040 align:middle line:84%
But once you unravel
that and realize that,

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:58.410 align:middle line:90%
wow, that's not who I am.

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:00.030 align:middle line:84%
That's just something
that happened.

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:02.610 align:middle line:90%
And I can move past that now.

00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:03.840 align:middle line:90%
It's very freeing.

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:04.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very freeing.

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:06.030 align:middle line:90%
I relate to that strongly.

00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:09.750 align:middle line:84%
I remember, many years ago, a
man that I was spending time

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:12.420 align:middle line:84%
with at the time was
trying to encourage

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:16.830 align:middle line:84%
me to speak more of my own
knowledge and truth, which--

00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:18.010 align:middle line:90%
that's good.

00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:18.810 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:22.210 align:middle line:84%
But I had that same sinking
feeling all the time.

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And I remember one time,
I was in San Francisco,

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:27.210 align:middle line:84%
looking down at
this tiled floor.

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And he said, why won't you
just speak your own truth

00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:32.550 align:middle line:90%
and begin sharing what you know?

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And I said, because it
didn't go well last time.

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.520 align:middle line:90%
And I just blurted it out.

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And I realized
the amount of fear

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:43.410 align:middle line:84%
that had been holding me
back and, to an extent,

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:49.230 align:middle line:84%
still does from having met a
dire outcome in previous times.

00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And I've met many
women, in particular,

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:54.300 align:middle line:84%
who were sages in the past
that have this same feeling.

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And some of them have
stepped forward, some of them

00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:58.920 align:middle line:84%
are receded, and some are
somewhere in the middle.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:00.990 align:middle line:84%
But this fear is very
great because, of course,

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:03.570 align:middle line:84%
your life was at stake
as a result of having

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:04.660 align:middle line:90%
knowledge in those times.

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:05.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:06.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:07.950 align:middle line:84%
So you've seen this
in others, too,

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:12.580 align:middle line:84%
then as you go through and help
them discover their own pasts.

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:15.600 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about how you
do that, just a little bit

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:17.790 align:middle line:84%
functionally about how
you do that with people.

00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd like a
couple of examples

00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:21.360 align:middle line:84%
of where people have
been able to find

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:23.670 align:middle line:84%
their freedom through
understanding their past.

00:34:23.670 --> 00:34:24.719 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Absolutely.

00:34:24.719 --> 00:34:27.330 align:middle line:84%
So you mean what happens
during a reading?

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, what
happens during a reading.

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:33.909 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: The first thing we do
is open up our energy centers.

00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And this is really vital and
important because grounding

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:40.460 align:middle line:84%
before you do a reading,
just connecting to the Earth

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:41.260 align:middle line:90%
is important.

00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:43.350 align:middle line:90%
So we connect.

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:47.880 align:middle line:84%
We open up our crown
and then our hearts.

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And then I ask for
access to their soul.

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And I step into the
vibrational frequency

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:57.480 align:middle line:90%
that they carry around.

00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:59.550 align:middle line:90%
And we explore.

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:03.120 align:middle line:90%
And usually what happens is--

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you-- are you
intuitively dialed into them,

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:07.620 align:middle line:84%
so you can see what
they're experiencing?

00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:08.005 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:35:08.005 --> 00:35:08.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:09.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And usually, it's a
lot of confirmation,

00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:14.400 align:middle line:84%
like, yes, this
happens in my life.

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:17.700 align:middle line:84%
Yes, this is where my
path is leading to.

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:20.130 align:middle line:84%
So we start with a lot of
confirmations in the beginning,

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:26.130 align:middle line:84%
so they know that this is
serious and we're together.

00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:30.660 align:middle line:84%
Then after navigating
myself, I ask

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:35.430 align:middle line:84%
them to bring up a question,
and we navigate together.

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:37.170 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes, things come up.

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:38.700 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they don't.

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like it's designed
that way in a way too.

00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Because when we're stepping into
each other's soul, what we're--

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:49.370 align:middle line:84%
or into somebody else's
soul, what we're doing is

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:52.130 align:middle line:84%
we're asking all the energies
they've also interacted with

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:53.330 align:middle line:90%
to come help.

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:55.520 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times,
some people aren't

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:58.230 align:middle line:84%
ready to hear some of the
things that may come up.

00:35:58.230 --> 00:35:59.120 align:middle line:90%
So I'll be blocked--

00:35:59.120 --> 00:35:59.450 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:00.402 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:36:00.402 --> 00:36:01.610 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: --from information.

00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:02.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:05.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah, but let's see.

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:08.340 align:middle line:90%
What are some examples?

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:10.010 align:middle line:90%
One really good example--

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:12.590 align:middle line:84%
[GASPS] all right, I
have one good example.

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:16.460 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] There is this
woman that came to me

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:18.620 align:middle line:90%
very early on in my readings.

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And I was practicing--
let's see.

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:28.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember the exact
question she asked me.

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:32.030 align:middle line:84%
But she asked me to just
explore a past life of hers.

00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:34.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember the
specifics of that.

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:36.200 align:middle line:84%
That's one thing
that happens when

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:37.790 align:middle line:84%
you read someone's
records, too, it's

00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:40.290 align:middle line:84%
like the information's not mine,
so it doesn't stick with me

00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:41.090 align:middle line:90%
for very long.

00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:42.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure, yeah.

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:46.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: And I feel the
reading gave her the courage

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.315 align:middle line:90%
to stand up to this person.

00:36:47.315 --> 00:36:47.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful.

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:49.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Sweet and beautiful.

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:51.020 align:middle line:84%
But I think that's
one of the biggest

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:52.380 align:middle line:90%
things that's come out of it.

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:56.028 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't checked in with
too many people, to be honest.

00:36:56.028 --> 00:36:58.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --to find out
where it went after that.

00:36:58.070 --> 00:36:58.355 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:36:58.355 --> 00:36:58.640 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:01.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, how do you teach
them to do it for themselves?

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:04.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: I teach them how to
open up their energy centers.

00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And the way accessing
the Akashic Records works

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:12.620 align:middle line:84%
is through vibrational frequency
and matching our body up

00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:16.370 align:middle line:84%
to that vibrational frequency,
kind of like phantom notes.

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:20.030 align:middle line:84%
So I teach them to open
their energy centers

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:22.790 align:middle line:84%
and then raise their
body's vibration

00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:24.260 align:middle line:90%
to that of the Akasha.

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And this can be done through
the throat chakra, the throat

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:35.220 align:middle line:84%
energy center, through prayer
or an access key of some sort.

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's very common to
do that in the beginning

00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:41.760 align:middle line:84%
when you're getting used to
what that frequency feels like.

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:44.840 align:middle line:84%
So we practice a lot,
opening up our centers

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:46.188 align:middle line:90%
and connecting with it.

00:37:46.188 --> 00:37:48.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and there
are many different ways

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:49.000 align:middle line:90%
to get there.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:49.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:51.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You just have to
find one that works for you.

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:52.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Absolutely.

00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:54.230 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's so different.

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:55.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For me, I just--

00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:56.630 align:middle line:84%
if there's something
I want to know,

00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:57.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm usually very targeted.

00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:02.060 align:middle line:84%
If I ask, I go into a state,
shift my frequencies and wait.

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:03.440 align:middle line:90%
And the screen's black.

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm to see
something, then, boom.

00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:07.010 align:middle line:90%
It's all there in living color.

00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:08.375 align:middle line:90%
Everything's shown at one time.

00:38:08.375 --> 00:38:08.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Absolutely.

00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:10.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you get about
one minute, and then it's gone.

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:11.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:11.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And that's it.

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:12.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: It's very fleeting.

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You can't go back.

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:14.057 align:middle line:90%
It's very fleeting.

00:38:14.057 --> 00:38:15.890 align:middle line:84%
You can't go back and
say, wait, wait, wait.

00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:16.690 align:middle line:90%
I missed something.

00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:17.585 align:middle line:90%
Show it to me again.

00:38:17.585 --> 00:38:20.990 align:middle line:84%
No, you have to be very
observant in the moment.

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And again, like you say, to have
vague questions, like, oh, I

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:26.960 align:middle line:90%
just, I'm not sure what--

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.340 align:middle line:84%
I just want to
know about myself.

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:29.900 align:middle line:84%
That is not a good
starting place.

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:31.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: No, not at all.

00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:32.690 align:middle line:84%
The intention is
really important.

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:33.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:33.490 --> 00:38:34.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, so tell us
just, kind of, in summary,

00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:39.380 align:middle line:84%
what you've seen
this do to your life.

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:41.540 align:middle line:84%
Pele's a little-- how old
is Pele now, by the way?

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:42.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: She's nine years old.

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:44.072 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She's nine
years old-- what

00:38:44.072 --> 00:38:47.000 align:middle line:84%
you've brought into Pele's
life and helped her understand,

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.390 align:middle line:84%
what this has done for your own
life, not just the people that

00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:51.777 align:middle line:90%
study your course.

00:38:51.777 --> 00:38:53.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: Thank you
for this question.

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:57.320 align:middle line:84%
I feel that knowing
that something like this

00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:00.800 align:middle line:84%
exists and is real has obviously
changed my path in life

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:01.740 align:middle line:90%
so much.

00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:05.120 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things that
it's done for me mostly

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:09.950 align:middle line:84%
is the realization of
how connected we all are

00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:14.630 align:middle line:84%
and how, in a way, we are
all the same consciousness,

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:16.860 align:middle line:84%
split up into little
bits and pieces.

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:20.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's given me a lot of
understanding towards others,

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:23.090 align:middle line:84%
a lot of compassion
and also a lot

00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:26.350 align:middle line:90%
of compassion towards myself.

00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:28.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm not so hard
on myself anymore.

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'm OK with letting myself
make mistakes and run free

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:36.470 align:middle line:84%
and be the weird
person that I am.

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that it's done the
same for my daughter Pele too.

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And it actually
helped her heal a lot

00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:46.370 align:middle line:84%
after losing a little
sister, knowing that there's

00:39:46.370 --> 00:39:49.070 align:middle line:84%
something much
greater than we're

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:51.765 align:middle line:84%
aware of happening
behind the scenes.

00:39:51.765 --> 00:39:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What happened to
her at that time, by the way--

00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:56.020 align:middle line:84%
I didn't ask-- when
she lost her sister?

00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:57.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Well, I mean--

00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:58.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was she
just confused or--

00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah, she's so sweet.

00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:03.170 align:middle line:84%
But she was really
sad obviously.

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And her trauma manifested
in a fear of fires.

00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And she was very
terrified for a long time

00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:13.587 align:middle line:84%
that everything is
going to burn in a fire.

00:40:13.587 --> 00:40:15.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
coming from the past.

00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:17.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah, definitely.

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:20.860 align:middle line:84%
But we went to a lot of therapy,
and we worked together a lot.

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:23.312 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about it
any time she wanted to,

00:40:23.312 --> 00:40:24.770 align:middle line:84%
and I feel like
that really helped.

00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you switch
to an electric stove?

00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:29.813 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:29.813 --> 00:40:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MORADI: No, but our
house is very fire-safe.

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:33.153 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:40:33.153 --> 00:40:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I bet it is.

00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:34.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:35.843 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, thank you.

00:40:35.843 --> 00:40:38.240 align:middle line:84%
I know that it's hard
to come on a show

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:39.908 align:middle line:84%
and when you're not
used to being on--

00:40:39.908 --> 00:40:42.200 align:middle line:84%
with all the lights and
cameras on you, and everything.

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:43.677 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate
your coming out

00:40:43.677 --> 00:40:45.635 align:middle line:84%
and starting to share
your story more publicly.

00:40:45.635 --> 00:40:46.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Thank you.

00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:47.965 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
decided to go for it.

00:40:47.965 --> 00:40:49.700 align:middle line:84%
You named your site
"Magic Inclined."

00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:50.900 align:middle line:84%
You just owned it,
the word "magic."

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:51.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: I did.

00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:52.340 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:54.507 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so you do
private sessions for people,

00:40:54.507 --> 00:40:56.750 align:middle line:84%
but do you also do
workshops, and such?

00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:57.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah, absolutely.

00:40:57.950 --> 00:41:00.230 align:middle line:10%
I've actually transitioned
from public sessions

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:02.720 align:middle line:10%
to just teaching people how
to open their own records

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:05.960 align:middle line:10%
and also becoming Akashic
Records practitioners.

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:08.180 align:middle line:84%
Just the ripple
effect of that is

00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:09.563 align:middle line:90%
more valuable to me right now.

00:41:09.563 --> 00:41:10.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --than one-on-one.

00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:11.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:12.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:14.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you for the
good work that you do.

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:14.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Thank you.

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:16.418 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have
lovely energies.

00:41:16.418 --> 00:41:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's great that you
had all those dreams

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:21.620 align:middle line:84%
and that you had everything
so validated also

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:24.950 align:middle line:84%
by your Vedic
astrologer in Rishikesh.

00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:26.120 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty incredible.

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:28.530 align:middle line:84%
You had access to that and
got a glimpse of who you are.

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And of course, in
the Hindu faith,

00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:32.790 align:middle line:90%
astrology is a huge part of it--

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:33.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:35.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --oftentimes
an astrologer

00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:37.370 align:middle line:84%
arriving at birth
to tell the parents

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:38.790 align:middle line:90%
the destiny of their child.

00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:39.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Yeah.

00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:41.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is really
good you followed it.

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:42.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Thank you.

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:44.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you so
much for joining us.

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MORADI: Thanks for having me.

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:49.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can go to
magicinclined.com and learn

00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:52.280 align:middle line:84%
much more about Rohini and
Akashic Record reading.

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:54.500 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:56.090 align:middle line:90%
on "Open Minds."
