00:00:27.952 --> 00:00:30.410 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: In my last
conversation with Len Kasten,

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.780 align:middle line:10%
we covered some of the
political and military times

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.120 align:middle line:10%
of the 1960s surrounding
a secret mission

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.020 align:middle line:10%
to send human beings to
a distant planet as part

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.520 align:middle line:10%
of an exchange program.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.500 align:middle line:84%
In this talk, Len
discusses the mission

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.060 align:middle line:84%
itself, and what the
exchange was about.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.540 align:middle line:90%
They gave us technology.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what we gave
them, but we will find out.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.220 align:middle line:90%
Maybe just friendship?

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.280 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of what we came
to in the last conversation.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.970 align:middle line:84%
But there are some
nuances that were

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.780 align:middle line:84%
concerning for the
crew surrounding this,

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.330 align:middle line:90%
so it's fair to ask.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.530 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, before we get
on the planet Serpo itself,

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.671 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about the setting
up of the people to go to it.

00:01:06.671 --> 00:01:08.420 align:middle line:84%
We talked about it a
little bit last time.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Now December 1963, Los
Alamos received a message

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.120 align:middle line:84%
from the Ebens about
their landing on Earth.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.869 align:middle line:84%
This was just weeks after
Kennedy's death as I recall.

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.910 align:middle line:84%
Was it just after or just
before Kennedy's death?

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.493 align:middle line:84%
>>LEN KASTEN: No, the exchange
program was set up in the '50s.

00:01:23.493 --> 00:01:25.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, but I'm talking
about that communication

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.350 align:middle line:90%
in the '60s that came through.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.160 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yes.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To start setting
up the notion of a landing

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.260 align:middle line:84%
and how we're going to
do this thing together.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.730 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: That was when
Kennedy came into office.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.854 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's talk
about that a little bit

00:01:35.854 --> 00:01:37.530 align:middle line:90%
and how that worked out.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.300 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yes.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.290 align:middle line:10%
Kennedy was briefed
on it by the CIA,

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.810 align:middle line:10%
in the early '60s,
when he took over.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And then he approved
it, naturally.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.190 align:middle line:84%
He wanted a space triumph,
desperately, after Sputnik.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And had already
asked von Braun when

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.210 align:middle line:84%
we could send somebody to the
moon and something on the moon.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.375 align:middle line:84%
And Lyndon Johnson
was brought in on it

00:02:03.375 --> 00:02:07.390 align:middle line:84%
because Kennedy had made
him the space council.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.718 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: After Kennedy's
death, he was brought in.

00:02:09.718 --> 00:02:10.259 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: No.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.320 align:middle line:84%
Kennedy had appointed him as
head of the space council.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But he didn't
know about the project yet.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.343 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: He did not
know about the project.

00:02:15.343 --> 00:02:16.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.930 align:middle line:90%
So there we are.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And now, April 24,
1964, so Kennedy's gone,

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.890 align:middle line:90%
now Johnson is in command.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.910 align:middle line:90%
Two craft landed near Sirocco.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:28.660 align:middle line:90%
Let's start there.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.870 align:middle line:90%
What happened after that?

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.400 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: No, the
first craft-- they

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.135 align:middle line:84%
sent two craft into our
atmosphere, April 24th, 1964.

00:02:37.135 --> 00:02:39.260 align:middle line:84%
One of them, the first one
went to the wrong place.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.531 align:middle line:84%
It landed outside of
Corona-- was it Corona?

00:02:43.531 --> 00:02:45.030 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was
Corona, New Mexico.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.040 align:middle line:84%
It was about 100 miles away
from where it was headed.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Slightly
off target, yeah.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.806 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And do
you know anything

00:02:49.806 --> 00:02:51.080 align:middle line:90%
about the Lonnie Zamora case?

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.128 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:02:53.128 --> 00:02:57.640 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Do you know that a
New Mexico policeman was called

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.780 align:middle line:84%
to an emergency call
because an alien craft had

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.990 align:middle line:90%
landed near Corona, New Mexico.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.279 align:middle line:84%
His name was patrolman
Lonnie Zamora.

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:10.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, it's coming back.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:11.360 align:middle line:90%
I've read bits about it.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.943 align:middle line:90%
Yes, go ahead.

00:03:11.943 --> 00:03:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And the date
was April 24, 1964.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:15.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.966 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: That was
the alien craft

00:03:16.966 --> 00:03:20.050 align:middle line:90%
that missed the landing place.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And what he encountered
was the two aliens,

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.760 align:middle line:84%
standing outside the
craft, which he said

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.920 align:middle line:84%
was egg-shaped and
very large, very large.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And then when they saw him,
they scrambled, and got back in,

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.400 align:middle line:90%
and took off.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.240 align:middle line:84%
That was the one was supposed to
have landed at the Holloman Air

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.980 align:middle line:90%
Force Base and missed it.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.220 align:middle line:84%
But then we sent a
message to that craft.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.700 align:middle line:84%
They eventually found
the right place.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.060 align:middle line:84%
But see how that Zamora
incident ties in with Serpo.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.040 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.290 align:middle line:84%
So once the contact was
made, now this is 1964.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.740 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about some
of the prep and how

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.190 align:middle line:84%
they were kind of managing the
logistics for this operation.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.092 align:middle line:90%


00:04:06.092 --> 00:04:07.800 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Oh, in terms
of training the--?

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.941 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: They put an ad in
many military journals asking

00:04:12.941 --> 00:04:13.565 align:middle line:90%
for volunteers.

00:04:13.565 --> 00:04:15.231 align:middle line:84%
They didn't tell them
anything about it,

00:04:15.231 --> 00:04:17.209 align:middle line:84%
just that it was a
dangerous mission.

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.459 align:middle line:90%
And they got 600 replies.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And they eventually
narrowed it down to 16.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:25.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And these guys.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.444 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And there were two
women in the original cut.

00:04:28.444 --> 00:04:29.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But not
in the final 12.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:30.240 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Not in the final.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There was some
misunderstanding about that.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:32.710 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Right, not
in the final cut.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:33.251 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:04:33.251 --> 00:04:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And now they were taken to the
hospitable quarters of Fort

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.480 align:middle line:90%
Leavenworth prison, right?

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.660 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Well, no.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.390 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:43.220 align:middle line:90%
No, not yet.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.760 align:middle line:90%
Not yet.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.093 align:middle line:90%
They didn't get into prison yet.

00:04:45.093 --> 00:04:48.600 align:middle line:84%
But the security
was so fanatical

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.600 align:middle line:84%
and so compartmentalised,
that the DIA didn't

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.980 align:middle line:84%
want to risk-- who was in
charge of the program--

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.040 align:middle line:84%
any possibility of it
leaking out to the point

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.910 align:middle line:84%
where they didn't want
people with families,

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.590 align:middle line:84%
they didn't want
people with children.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.537 align:middle line:84%
They wanted them to be
orphans, themselves.

00:05:06.537 --> 00:05:08.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it makes
sense once you understand

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.920 align:middle line:84%
what the actual mission
was, that you would not

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.160 align:middle line:84%
want them to have any people
waiting around for them.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.910 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Exactly.

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.000 align:middle line:84%
Or who might release an
article to the newspaper.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure, absolutely.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.910 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: A mother, a father,
whatever, who was concerned,

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:21.670 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And these men were
going to be gone

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:23.850 align:middle line:90%
for 10 years, don't forget.

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.430 align:middle line:90%
So they were concerned.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.395 align:middle line:84%
And so they select
them very carefully.

00:05:28.395 --> 00:05:31.240 align:middle line:84%
A guy from MI6 in England
was in part of his program.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And he sent in a
letter to the website

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.180 align:middle line:84%
saying that they had
trouble filling all the 12

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.880 align:middle line:84%
positions with the
right categories--

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.170 align:middle line:90%
physician, scientist.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.510 align:middle line:84%
They had to actually go out
and recruit a couple of them.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.700 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't find them all
within the military community.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.900 align:middle line:84%
They did have to go out
and recruit some of them.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they
have their final 16.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:52.970 align:middle line:90%
And how were they trained?

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.030 align:middle line:84%
How does one train for
going into outer space

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.340 align:middle line:84%
and then living on
a foreign planet

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.840 align:middle line:84%
that really we have
no knowledge of?

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.890 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: We already
had NASA at that point.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.382 align:middle line:84%
They were supposedly
in charge of anything

00:06:04.382 --> 00:06:05.340 align:middle line:90%
to do with outer space.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.970 align:middle line:84%
But they were not involved
in this program at all.

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.747 align:middle line:84%
They did get involved
in the training.

00:06:09.747 --> 00:06:11.330 align:middle line:84%
They did get involved
in the training.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So did they
have standard training

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.029 align:middle line:90%
that astronauts would have?

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:14.570 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: No.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.880 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then what
kind of training?

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.970 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: These men were
not trained as astronauts.

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about what

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.341 align:middle line:90%
their actual training was like.

00:06:20.341 --> 00:06:22.630 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: They were
given-- in my book,

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.155 align:middle line:84%
I have a complete curriculum
of their training.

00:06:26.155 --> 00:06:29.430 align:middle line:84%
The subject matter was
very wide, everything,

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.430 align:middle line:84%
everything you could
you think of, astronomy.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.210 align:middle line:90%


00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.940 align:middle line:84%
Everything that they thought
they might need to know

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.200 align:middle line:90%
was covered.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And many of the people that
trained did come forward later

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:45.850 align:middle line:84%
and send in anonymous
submissions to the website.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.270 align:middle line:84%
And that really helped to
flesh out the information

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.440 align:middle line:90%
on the Serpo website.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.270 align:middle line:84%
But they were sent to
Fort Peary, Virginia,

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.550 align:middle line:84%
which was the CIA training
facility, commonly

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.240 align:middle line:90%
known as the Farm.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.130 align:middle line:84%
You see it referred to as
the Farm in many movies.

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.650 align:middle line:84%
I think that they
call them farm boys,

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.380 align:middle line:84%
at one point, if they
were from the CIA.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:18.770 align:middle line:84%
In any case, they had their
own facility within the Farm.

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:22.979 align:middle line:84%
And so they were in a separate,
even more secure location.

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's where they
were trained, mainly.

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:26.603 align:middle line:84%
But they were also sent
to foreign countries

00:07:26.603 --> 00:07:29.660 align:middle line:90%
for training-- Chile, Mexico.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And they were sent to Tyndall
Air Force Base, in Florida,

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:38.560 align:middle line:90%
for the high altitude training.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.762 align:middle line:84%
So they got a very wide
kind of training for this.

00:07:42.762 --> 00:07:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what
was the training

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.850 align:middle line:84%
like for their physical
bodies in terms

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:49.479 align:middle line:84%
of being able to respond
to the environment they

00:07:49.479 --> 00:07:50.270 align:middle line:90%
would be living in?

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.530 align:middle line:84%
Were the Ebens giving
enough information

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:56.260 align:middle line:84%
that they could even
prepare their bodies

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.240 align:middle line:90%
for such a journey?

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.573 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: We know they had
the right kind of atmosphere.

00:07:59.573 --> 00:08:01.990 align:middle line:84%
We knew they had carbon,
hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen,

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:02.750 align:middle line:90%
just like we do.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:03.820 align:middle line:90%
We knew that already.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.611 align:middle line:84%
Don't forget, we had
been dealing with them

00:08:05.611 --> 00:08:08.622 align:middle line:84%
for nine years prior
to Kennedy's advent.

00:08:08.622 --> 00:08:09.330 align:middle line:90%
So we knew a lot.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.330 align:middle line:84%
We had volumes of information
about their planet

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:12.680 align:middle line:90%
that they had already given us.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.900 align:middle line:84%
They did send the four
aliens with the craft

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.000 align:middle line:84%
to help us develop--
back-engineer the craft.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.690 align:middle line:84%
So presumably, we knew
a lot about them even,

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:24.590 align:middle line:84%
though we couldn't communicate
fluently with them.

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:26.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet
ignorance is bliss,

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:29.610 align:middle line:84%
because things didn't
exactly go as planned

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:30.600 align:middle line:90%
once they got on board.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.480 align:middle line:90%
There were lots of surprises.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.725 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about--
OK, the movie.

00:08:35.725 --> 00:08:37.600 align:middle line:84%
We brought it up last
time, "Close Encounters

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.870 align:middle line:90%
of the Third Kind."

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:42.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, where does that
fit in with Serpo?

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:45.160 align:middle line:84%
Where are the overlapping
kind of images?

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.950 align:middle line:10%
>>KASTEN: Well
Spielberg presented

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:52.210 align:middle line:10%
the take-off-- the final
take-off from in his case,

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:57.160 align:middle line:10%
from the mountain there,
the Devil's Tower,

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:02.640 align:middle line:10%
whereas really, they departed
from the Nevada test site.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.820 align:middle line:84%
What happened was the first
landing, as we discussed,

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.220 align:middle line:84%
April 24, 1964,
they decided they

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:12.340 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to take the 12
people with them at that time.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:16.760 align:middle line:84%
We greeted them with a
greeting party of 16 officials

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.650 align:middle line:90%
from the government.

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:21.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that President
Johnson was among them.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.050 align:middle line:84%
The 16 people have
not been identified,

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:27.110 align:middle line:84%
but they were high officials
in the military intelligence

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:28.260 align:middle line:90%
community.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And probably MJ12, that's
my guess, I'm sure.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think possibly
Anonymous was one of them.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.570 align:middle line:84%
In any case, they presented
us with two gifts.

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:43.577 align:middle line:84%
One was an automatic translator
that we could type into,

00:09:43.577 --> 00:09:45.160 align:middle line:84%
and we could see
their language on it.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.630 align:middle line:90%
And they could see our language.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:48.129 align:middle line:84%
And they could
communicate that way.

00:09:48.129 --> 00:09:50.180 align:middle line:90%
They brought those with them.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.230 align:middle line:84%
They also presented
us with a gift

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:55.985 align:middle line:84%
to the people of Earth
called the Yellow Book.

00:09:55.985 --> 00:09:59.400 align:middle line:84%
The Yellow Book was an
amazing piece of technology.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.920 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't really a book.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.940 align:middle line:90%
It looked like a book.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:07.270 align:middle line:84%
But really, as you opened
it, images sprang out of it,

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:12.180 align:middle line:84%
holographic images of
what you were looking at,

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:15.450 align:middle line:84%
giving you pictures that were
of historical significance going

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:18.860 align:middle line:90%
back to 2000 BC.

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I loved the
description of this.

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And this particular
piece of technology,

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.700 align:middle line:90%
does it exist today?

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.675 align:middle line:90%
Does the military still have?

00:10:27.675 --> 00:10:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Yes, they
have it, of course.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.716 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And does is show
into the future as well or only

00:10:31.716 --> 00:10:32.590 align:middle line:90%
the past?

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:35.840 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: As far as I know,
it just discussed the past.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.740 align:middle line:84%
But the remarkable
thing about the book

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.700 align:middle line:84%
was that, when you
held it close to you,

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:45.410 align:middle line:84%
it picked up the language
that was in your aura

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:48.320 align:middle line:84%
and communicated with
you in that language.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And it supposedly had
80 different languages

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:52.730 align:middle line:90%
encoded into it.

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:55.062 align:middle line:84%
So if you thought
in terms of English,

00:10:55.062 --> 00:10:56.020 align:middle line:90%
you would read English.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:57.436 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
a beautiful gift.

00:10:57.436 --> 00:10:58.705 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yeah, it's amazing.

00:10:58.705 --> 00:10:59.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.600 align:middle line:84%
So now, at what
point-- now 1964,

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.990 align:middle line:84%
they decided not to take
them with them at this time.

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:05.160 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yes.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.493 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So then what happened?

00:11:06.493 --> 00:11:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: They took the 10,
they took the 11 bodies of Ebens

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:11.000 align:middle line:90%
that had died here.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.750 align:middle line:84%
There were six in
the second crash.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:16.040 align:middle line:84%
The Roswell crash was actually
a collision between two

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.660 align:middle line:90%
of their craft.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:22.572 align:middle line:84%
They were both identical
in terms of the same race.

00:11:22.572 --> 00:11:24.030 align:middle line:84%
When Reagan was
briefed on it, they

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:28.090 align:middle line:84%
told him that they were the same
exact race from both crashes.

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:30.750 align:middle line:84%
One crashed near
Datil, New Mexico,

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:33.684 align:middle line:84%
and the other one crashed
outside of Sicorro.

00:11:33.684 --> 00:11:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
one we recovered.

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And there were six on
the one from Datil.

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:43.950 align:middle line:84%
There were four dead aliens
at Sicorro and one live one.

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:47.000 align:middle line:84%
So they took back a total
of 11 bodies with them

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.360 align:middle line:90%
on that landing of April.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And were
they stored in the way

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.610 align:middle line:84%
that Corso mentioned,
where they were

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:56.710 align:middle line:84%
suspended in some kind of fluid
to keep them from degenerating?

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:57.870 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yes.

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:02.140 align:middle line:84%
At that time, Los Alamos had
developed a cryogenic facility

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.780 align:middle line:90%
to preserve bodies indefinitely.

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:07.650 align:middle line:84%
That was involved with cooling,
I guess, super cooling.

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:08.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure what.

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:11.520 align:middle line:84%
But we had also autopsied
several of them.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:16.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the film, "Alien
Autopsy," the most well-known

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:18.350 align:middle line:90%
film, called "Alien Autopsy?"

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:20.250 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: The
"Alien Autopsy" film

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:24.300 align:middle line:84%
was based on the crash that
occurred before Roswell.

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.140 align:middle line:90%
Those aliens were different.

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:29.600 align:middle line:90%
They had six fingers and toes.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.340 align:middle line:84%
They look more human
than the Ebens did.

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:36.620 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of them, if
you remember the video,

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:38.750 align:middle line:90%
had a big gash in his leg.

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And they looked
like smaller humans.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They did.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.570 align:middle line:84%
What was the source
of those beings?

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:46.480 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: We don't know
where they were from.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.420 align:middle line:84%
But the editor of
"Shutterbug" magazine

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:51.680 align:middle line:84%
said that he was there,
and he photographed them.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
real, because, of course,

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.870 align:middle line:90%
the media has poo-pooed this.

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:56.664 align:middle line:90%
It's been.

00:12:56.664 --> 00:12:57.580 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: The autopsy?

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:00.470 align:middle line:84%
Yes, that autopsy film
was the real thing.

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:03.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the guy
that briefed President Reagan

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:04.662 align:middle line:90%
said that.

00:13:04.662 --> 00:13:05.370 align:middle line:90%
He verified that.

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:07.030 align:middle line:90%
He validated that.

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:11.170 align:middle line:84%
So they've taken their
bodies back with them.

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:13.726 align:middle line:84%
And what is the plan to
return and pick up the humans?

00:13:13.726 --> 00:13:15.850 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: They said they
would come back in a year.

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:16.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
happened to this crew?

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:18.340 align:middle line:90%
They'd been trained already.

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.210 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: It was an enormous
logistics problem for us

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:24.090 align:middle line:84%
because we have 40
tons of equipment,

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:27.480 align:middle line:84%
sitting there, waiting to be
loaded onto the alien craft,

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:32.130 align:middle line:84%
including three
jeeps, 10 motorcycles,

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.340 align:middle line:90%
an incredible amount of stuff.

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And all that had to
be warehoused now.

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:41.087 align:middle line:84%
And 12 Americans were
sitting in a bus, waiting.

00:13:41.087 --> 00:13:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And they were told
they had to go back

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:45.960 align:middle line:84%
to Fort Leavenworth,
Kansas, which was a prison

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:49.710 align:middle line:84%
and wait there so they wouldn't
be able to contact anybody.

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And we treated them like
prisoners, basically.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How disappointing
that must've been.

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:57.804 align:middle line:84%
And as we said in our
last conversation,

00:13:57.804 --> 00:13:59.220 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't as though
you could say,

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.470 align:middle line:84%
hey, I'm out because
then you could stay there

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:05.130 align:middle line:84%
an additional 10 years
as the price you would

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:06.422 align:middle line:90%
pay for abandoning the mission.

00:14:06.422 --> 00:14:07.171 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Exactly.

00:14:07.171 --> 00:14:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
Americans did want

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.871 align:middle line:84%
to get out of it after he
found out what was happening.

00:14:10.871 --> 00:14:12.675 align:middle line:84%
And they said, if
we release you,

00:14:12.675 --> 00:14:15.116 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have spend 10
years in Leavenworth prison.

00:14:15.116 --> 00:14:17.440 align:middle line:90%
He said, all right, I'll go.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Twist your arm.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.750 align:middle line:90%
So the ships finally did come.

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about the ships,
what happened when they landed,

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:27.860 align:middle line:84%
the crew, and then
just going on board,

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.674 align:middle line:90%
to kind of getting comfortable.

00:14:29.674 --> 00:14:30.340 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Right.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And what was amazing about
that, when the ship finally

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:37.380 align:middle line:84%
arrived, in July, I think
it was 16th of 1965,

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:41.100 align:middle line:84%
this one landed at the Nevada
test site, not at Holloman.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.790 align:middle line:90%
The first one was at Holloman.

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:45.550 align:middle line:84%
It was actually on the border
of Holloman and White Sands

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:47.280 align:middle line:90%
proving ground.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.190 align:middle line:84%
The second one came directly
to the Nevada test site,

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:52.510 align:middle line:90%
which is right near Area 51.

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:54.410 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to be near Area 51.

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:58.850 align:middle line:90%
At that time, Area 51 did exist.

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:00.090 align:middle line:90%
That one landed there.

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And much like in the
movie, "Close Encounters,"

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:08.770 align:middle line:84%
the 12 men were taken
on board at that point.

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And what was amazing about
that was that the craft was

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:15.790 align:middle line:84%
large enough to
take the 40 tons,

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.240 align:middle line:84%
the shuttlecraft that
landed was large enough

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.810 align:middle line:84%
to take the 40
tons of equipment.

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:24.580 align:middle line:84%
But they took it
all in one move.

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:27.350 align:middle line:84%
So evidently, they had
anti-gravity technology.

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:28.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Apparently, yeah.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: In fact,
they were able--

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:32.750 align:middle line:84%
it was all on one platform,
all of it, the three jeeps--

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:34.125 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
that was shocking.

00:15:34.125 --> 00:15:35.751 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: --the 10 motorbikes.

00:15:35.751 --> 00:15:37.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And all their
food and supplies.

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.291 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And the food
and everything, yes.

00:15:39.291 --> 00:15:41.420 align:middle line:84%
It all went on in
one smooth move.

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So their
cargo is on board.

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.580 align:middle line:90%
The people are on board.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.765 align:middle line:90%
What was the first experience?

00:15:47.765 --> 00:15:49.140 align:middle line:84%
In terms of the
chain of command,

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:50.723 align:middle line:84%
who were the beings
that greeted them,

00:15:50.723 --> 00:15:53.060 align:middle line:84%
and what was that
experience like for them?

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:54.860 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Yes, well,
of course, they still

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:56.990 align:middle line:84%
couldn't communicate
language-wise.

00:15:56.990 --> 00:16:00.594 align:middle line:84%
But they did have somebody
designated as a communicator.

00:16:00.594 --> 00:16:01.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The female, right?

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: A female
they call EBE-2.

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:07.290 align:middle line:90%
She spoke English pretty well.

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:11.910 align:middle line:84%
Evidently her vocal cords
were OK to speak the language.

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And we found out that they
had certain people on Serpo

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:16.150 align:middle line:90%
that could also speak English.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:19.920 align:middle line:84%
But they were mainly
doctors and people who

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:23.320 align:middle line:90%
were in the educated bracket.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
female really was

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:30.180 align:middle line:84%
to remain their very close ally
and companion, more than just

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:31.310 align:middle line:90%
a translator.

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:33.530 align:middle line:84%
It seemed, the way
she was depicted was

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:35.430 align:middle line:84%
she was quite
compassionate and--

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:36.180 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: She was.

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:36.865 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --open with them.

00:16:36.865 --> 00:16:38.864 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: The commander
was very taken with her.

00:16:38.864 --> 00:16:43.310 align:middle line:84%
He was very pleased that she was
so compassionate and so caring.

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:47.570 align:middle line:84%
She was like a combination
hostess, translator, guide,

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:49.130 align:middle line:84%
all those things
wrapped into one.

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And she was the one that
had translated that portion

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:54.780 align:middle line:90%
of the Yellow Book to English.

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:57.790 align:middle line:90%
She was the one that did that.

00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:59.360 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So Eben 2?

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.810 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Eben 2.

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And the 12 men got on
board the shuttlecraft.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:09.099 align:middle line:90%


00:17:09.099 --> 00:17:12.232 align:middle line:84%
And they were taken, and
they were put in bubbles.

00:17:12.232 --> 00:17:14.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, that portion of the trip,
they weren't in the bubbles

00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:14.730 align:middle line:90%
yet.

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:15.396 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-mm.

00:17:15.396 --> 00:17:19.390 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: They were
taken to the mothership

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:21.839 align:middle line:84%
in the shuttlecraft, which
was very large in itself,

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:22.839 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And that was the one that had
landed at Zamora incident.

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
paintings of that incident,

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.330 align:middle line:84%
that craft doesn't appear
to be especially large.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:37.090 align:middle line:84%
But it was large enough to
take the 40 tons of equipment

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:38.769 align:middle line:90%
with it plus the 12 men.

00:17:38.769 --> 00:17:40.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have a book
with that painting.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:41.870 align:middle line:84%
I'll have to go check
it out again now,

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:43.020 align:middle line:90%
in light of this, yes.

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:44.811 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: It's an
egg-shaped thing sitting.

00:17:44.811 --> 00:17:45.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:47.320 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: But when they
got to the mothership,

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.861 align:middle line:84%
they were astounded because the
commander said, in his diary,

00:17:49.861 --> 00:17:52.450 align:middle line:84%
that he was standing in a
room with a ceiling that

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:56.100 align:middle line:90%
was about 100 feet high.

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:56.670 align:middle line:90%
It was huge.

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:59.410 align:middle line:90%
The mothership was huge.

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:02.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so they were
told from the beginning

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:05.894 align:middle line:84%
that they had access to wander
the ship, to go where they?

00:18:05.894 --> 00:18:07.060 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Not at that point.

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:08.101 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That was later?

00:18:08.101 --> 00:18:10.900 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Initially, they were
put in individual little--

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:11.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, the little pods.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:12.150 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: --bubbles--

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:13.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Bubbles, yeah.

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:15.263 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: --that were
attached to the floor,

00:18:15.263 --> 00:18:18.120 align:middle line:84%
to electronics in the floor,
so they could be monitored.

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.667 align:middle line:84%
And if they stepped outside of
those bubbles, they got sick.

00:18:21.667 --> 00:18:23.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's
what I was going to get to.

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:28.370 align:middle line:84%
Also, they were saying that
the sound of the Eben's voice

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:32.490 align:middle line:84%
would make some of them nauseous
and even dizzy, the tones

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:33.615 align:middle line:90%
that we're coming out them.

00:18:33.615 --> 00:18:36.012 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Yeah, they
said it was screeching,

00:18:36.012 --> 00:18:36.970 align:middle line:90%
like screeching sounds.

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:39.090 align:middle line:90%
It was very weird.

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And they said it sounded
like high-pitched singing is

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:45.500 align:middle line:84%
what the commander
said in his diary.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And so they were kept in those
bubbles during the take-off.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:54.790 align:middle line:84%
And if they went outside
of it, they did get sick.

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:57.810 align:middle line:84%
For the whole first
half of the journey,

00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:02.100 align:middle line:84%
they were mainly
in those bubbles.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.380 align:middle line:90%
And they lost all track of time.

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:07.110 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have their
backpacks with them.

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:09.680 align:middle line:84%
All their equipment was in
another part of the ship.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:13.120 align:middle line:84%
The commander was
frustrated by the fact

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.280 align:middle line:84%
that he couldn't get
to those backpacks

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:18.290 align:middle line:84%
because he wanted
to look at them.

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:24.250 align:middle line:84%
But they had to just
do with what they had.

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they were given
food that was from the Ebens

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:30.280 align:middle line:84%
as well, not just
their own food.

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:32.220 align:middle line:84%
They did run out at
one point, right?

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:33.965 align:middle line:90%
This was a 10 month journey.

00:19:33.965 --> 00:19:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: No, the
c-rations, they lasted.

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:37.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did they
last the whole time?

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: They lasted
the whole time.

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:39.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they were
eating Eben food, too.

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:40.650 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: But they were
trying to eat the Eben food.

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:42.580 align:middle line:90%
They said it tasted like paper.

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it
also had an effect

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:47.130 align:middle line:84%
of-- it seemed like
a healing effect

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:49.130 align:middle line:84%
when things started going
wrong in their bodies.

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:52.190 align:middle line:84%
Some of these foods started
balancing them out again,

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:53.729 align:middle line:90%
whatever they were.

00:19:53.729 --> 00:19:54.520 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Well, no.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:57.500 align:middle line:84%
What helped, what
healed and helped them

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:00.517 align:middle line:84%
with the illness was one of
the Ebens would pass a blue--

00:20:00.517 --> 00:20:01.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I remember that.

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:02.610 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: --a blue
light over them,

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:04.390 align:middle line:84%
and then they got much
better after that.

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:05.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
light technology.

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:06.534 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yeah.

00:20:06.534 --> 00:20:07.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now,
these guys were

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:13.280 align:middle line:84%
traveling for 10 months,
39 lightyears away,

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:15.520 align:middle line:84%
which would have been
as I think you said,

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.240 align:middle line:90%
40 times the speed of light.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.198 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: That's right.

00:20:18.198 --> 00:20:19.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the
implication there

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.437 align:middle line:84%
is they were transiting through
what we would call wormholes.

00:20:22.437 --> 00:20:23.270 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Wormholes.

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:26.401 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there was a
time/space effect going on

00:20:26.401 --> 00:20:26.900 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.330 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yes, yes.

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:30.730 align:middle line:84%
They found out later they also
had antimatter technology.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:32.420 align:middle line:84%
But the antimatter
technology was

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:34.628 align:middle line:84%
not what they used to traveled
through the wormholes.

00:20:34.628 --> 00:20:36.720 align:middle line:90%


00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.110 align:middle line:84%
Travel through a wormhole
is instantaneous.

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:41.926 align:middle line:84%
It would have to
be for them to have

00:20:41.926 --> 00:20:43.050 align:middle line:90%
covered that vast distance.

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:45.091 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Collapse the
time to that extent, yeah.

00:20:45.091 --> 00:20:46.580 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yeah, 10 months.

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.400 align:middle line:84%
Once they got to
the midway point--

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.900 align:middle line:84%
when one of the commanders--
one of the Ebens

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:53.502 align:middle line:84%
told them they were
at the halfway point,

00:20:53.502 --> 00:20:55.210 align:middle line:84%
they allowed them to
walk around the ship

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:58.171 align:middle line:84%
freely and ask questions, do
anything they wanted to do.

00:20:58.171 --> 00:20:59.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Once they
were acclimated?

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:00.560 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yeah.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think the only
times they really got sick

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:03.880 align:middle line:84%
is when they were going
through the wormholes.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what I
was just going to ask next.

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.240 align:middle line:84%
The team commander
wrote, we will all

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.640 align:middle line:84%
feel better when
the craft gets out

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.610 align:middle line:84%
of this time-wave is
how they understood it.

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: He knew even
then it was time-wave, yes.

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:18.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
they would go,

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:21.630 align:middle line:84%
whenever they needed to, back
into these bowls of protection.

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:24.200 align:middle line:84%
But then time, the
whole notion of time.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.800 align:middle line:84%
Now he was there to
chronicle their travels.

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.850 align:middle line:84%
But he began-- you could
see in the diary, he said,

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:32.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't know when the
last time I wrote was.

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:35.240 align:middle line:84%
They were all beginning
to lose track of time.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.640 align:middle line:84%
Because-- was time
passing, at this point,

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.047 align:middle line:90%
very differently for them then?

00:21:40.047 --> 00:21:41.630 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Yeah,
subjectively speaking,

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:43.870 align:middle line:84%
I think he was not
experiencing time

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:45.490 align:middle line:84%
the way we would
experience time.

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at his watch,
and it said so-and-so.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And he thought, well,
maybe one day has passed,

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.290 align:middle line:90%
but he didn't know.

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:54.080 align:middle line:90%
It might have been three days.

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well
this apparently was

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:58.760 align:middle line:84%
part of the problem in
the timing of the mission.

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:02.530 align:middle line:84%
They ended up overstaying their
original plan by a few years,

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:04.490 align:middle line:84%
because, I guess, they
lost track of time.

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:05.906 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: They
lost track of time.

00:22:05.906 --> 00:22:07.890 align:middle line:84%
They brought with them
timepieces on batteries.

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:10.070 align:middle line:90%
And the batteries ran out.

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:15.670 align:middle line:84%
They tried coordinating with
the Eben orbit of 43 days

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:21.340 align:middle line:84%
around their sun, whereas
ours was-- I mean, sorry,

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:24.270 align:middle line:84%
43 hours, whereas we
were on a 24 hour day.

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:26.240 align:middle line:84%
They had to make
those computations.

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.717 align:middle line:90%
It got complicated.

00:22:27.717 --> 00:22:29.675 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Ah, just to to
hell with it. [LAUGHS]

00:22:29.675 --> 00:22:30.410 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: I think,
to hell with it.

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think it
was a day or two ago.

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:32.260 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: We'll
just use Eben time.

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.562 align:middle line:84%
Just use Eben time, that's
what they decided to do.

00:22:34.562 --> 00:22:36.103 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
which is interesting.

00:22:36.103 --> 00:22:38.080 align:middle line:90%
We don't stop and think about.

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:39.530 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, they didn't either.

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:41.520 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know what to expect.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:44.570 align:middle line:84%
So one of them was
in the engine room.

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
what the engine room

00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:48.560 align:middle line:90%
was described as on the craft.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:53.190 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: They saw these pipes
leading to a central location.

00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And they saw like
an energy source

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:58.910 align:middle line:84%
coming down to that
central location.

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And they realized that
there was no sound.

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:05.940 align:middle line:84%
So whatever it
was, was energetic.

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.920 align:middle line:84%
They didn't understand
how it worked.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:12.080 align:middle line:84%
But they did know they
also were using antimatter.

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.952 align:middle line:90%
And Bob Lazar did mention that.

00:23:14.952 --> 00:23:16.160 align:middle line:90%
Have you talked to Bob Lazar?

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.201 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I have not.

00:23:17.201 --> 00:23:22.190 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: He mentioned that the
aliens had an element called

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:23.940 align:middle line:90%
"Element 115."

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:27.292 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, heavier
than our-- yeah.

00:23:27.292 --> 00:23:28.750 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Not native
to our planet.

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:29.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:30.758 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And that's
what they used

00:23:30.758 --> 00:23:33.410 align:middle line:90%
for the antimatter part of it.

00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:35.280 align:middle line:90%
So they did use that also.

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:38.880 align:middle line:84%
So I think Lazar was validated
when it comes to that.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about
sounds or tones

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:43.460 align:middle line:84%
and such going on
inside the craft?

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:46.920 align:middle line:84%
Was it noiseless,
or were there tones?

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:50.387 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: From what I
remember, the commander

00:23:50.387 --> 00:23:51.220 align:middle line:90%
didn't discuss that.

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:52.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because I don't
remember him talking about it

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:53.470 align:middle line:90%
either.

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:56.430 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: No, he
didn't talk about that.

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is where
it gets kind of sticky.

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:02.910 align:middle line:84%
One of the team members
died on the journey.

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:04.400 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.440 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the whole thing.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.960 align:middle line:90%
What happened on the Eben end?

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.410 align:middle line:84%
He said, she said,
you know, what

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:13.520 align:middle line:84%
happened on the
side of the crew,

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.840 align:middle line:84%
and what was created
as a result of that?

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:17.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean it was a
bit of an incident.

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.030 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: It was an incident.

00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:21.650 align:middle line:84%
They were all given three digit
numbers as new identities.

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:22.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: This one was
number 308 was his identity.

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:27.300 align:middle line:84%
He was actually
one of the pilots.

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.765 align:middle line:84%
They had two
pilots, a commander,

00:24:29.765 --> 00:24:34.080 align:middle line:84%
an assistant commander, two
scientists, two doctors,

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:34.580 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:35.940 align:middle line:90%
They had it all worked out.

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:39.720 align:middle line:84%
This one was the
pilot, number 308.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:42.610 align:middle line:84%
Supposedly, the
commander discovered

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:46.560 align:middle line:84%
that he was dead only because
his bubble was unoccupied

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:47.800 align:middle line:90%
when he walked around.

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.240 align:middle line:90%
He didn't see anybody in there.

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:52.230 align:middle line:84%
He said he only
counted 11 people.

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:55.616 align:middle line:84%
And finally, they told
him that he had died.

00:24:55.616 --> 00:24:58.580 align:middle line:84%
It turned out to be
a pulmonary embolism.

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:00.555 align:middle line:90%
And so 308 was dead.

00:25:00.555 --> 00:25:02.280 align:middle line:90%
But where was the body?

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.930 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't told
where the body was.

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't inquire
further at that point

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:12.782 align:middle line:84%
because he assumed that the body
was in a temporary location.

00:25:12.782 --> 00:25:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A holding
area somewhere.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.864 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Yeah, it
would be turned over

00:25:15.864 --> 00:25:17.590 align:middle line:90%
to them when they got to Serpo.

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:19.590 align:middle line:90%
But that never happened.

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:23.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, they found
out the body had actually been

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:27.560 align:middle line:90%
autopsied and closely examined.

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: After a
while, the commander

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:33.700 align:middle line:84%
asked again when they got
there, where is 308's body?

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:35.820 align:middle line:84%
The commander said, it
doesn't exist anymore.

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:38.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Ebens said,
it doesn't exist anymore.

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:43.000 align:middle line:84%
They said, we were honored to
have it to use for experiments.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:49.270 align:middle line:84%
And we have used it to clone
another type of creature,

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:52.006 align:middle line:90%
that's part alien, part human.

00:25:52.006 --> 00:25:54.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: See, now that's
what I was talking to you

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:56.620 align:middle line:90%
about off camera a little bit.

00:25:56.620 --> 00:26:00.310 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering what was in
it for-- you said, basically,

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:02.440 align:middle line:84%
friendship-- what was
in it for the Ebens?

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:05.400 align:middle line:90%


00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:09.240 align:middle line:90%
There was this hybridized being.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.090 align:middle line:90%
There were others as well.

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:14.280 align:middle line:84%
But do you not
feel that that was

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:18.020 align:middle line:84%
part of what the deal was,
was to be able to take some

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:22.090 align:middle line:84%
of our genetics and maybe
create a new type of species,

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:23.010 align:middle line:90%
a hybridized species?

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:24.510 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yeah, it was.

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:28.970 align:middle line:84%
Because they were not-- they did
not abduct, unlike the Greys.

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:30.196 align:middle line:90%
They never abducted.

00:26:30.196 --> 00:26:31.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they
both might have

00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:35.420 align:middle line:84%
had the same idea in mind, to
use human DNA to strengthen

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:39.230 align:middle line:84%
or for their own hybridization
purposes with their species.

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:42.444 align:middle line:84%
But it was done in a more
conscious way, you're saying.

00:26:42.444 --> 00:26:43.110 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Right.

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And Corso did say that
there were human body

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:47.250 align:middle line:90%
parts on the crashed craft.

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:49.800 align:middle line:90%
So Corso validated that.

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And we found out that
they did have human body

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:55.190 align:middle line:84%
parts on the craft that
crashed at Roswell.

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:56.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that's interesting.

00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:58.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, why would they
have human body parts?

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Might it have been kind
of the reverse situation,

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:06.060 align:middle line:84%
where they had humans on board
and perhaps someone had died?

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:09.564 align:middle line:84%
Why were the incoming
ones with body parts?

00:27:09.564 --> 00:27:10.980 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: They
obviously, wherever

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:13.350 align:middle line:84%
they travel throughout the
galaxy, that's what they did.

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:17.660 align:middle line:84%
They took parts back
with them for the DNA.

00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:19.840 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean
they killed them.

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:21.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I understand that.

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And it is a
significant difference

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.970 align:middle line:84%
between abducting,
against someone's will,

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:28.750 align:middle line:90%
utilizing their DNA.

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:30.530 align:middle line:84%
Although, that's
highly nuanced, too.

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:33.150 align:middle line:84%
The memories-- John Mack's
work, what came out of that,

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:36.650 align:middle line:84%
it was just so convoluted in
a sense, where people would

00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:38.860 align:middle line:90%
end up ether kind of in awe.

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:41.600 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it was
Stockholm Syndrome or what.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:45.900 align:middle line:84%
But that had its own story,
the abductees' stories.

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:48.775 align:middle line:84%
But this is just basically
more opportunistic.

00:27:48.775 --> 00:27:51.950 align:middle line:84%
If a body dies, then
let's not waste.

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:53.190 align:middle line:90%
Waste not, want not, right?

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:55.959 align:middle line:84%
And take the pieces, and
do what you can with them.

00:27:55.959 --> 00:27:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Think about
all the battlefields.

00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:01.820 align:middle line:84%
Oh, they had the choice of
many, many, many thousands

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:04.290 align:middle line:90%
of dead soldiers.

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:07.670 align:middle line:84%
So they could take
them from there.

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:09.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about-- they did,

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:13.980 align:middle line:84%
ultimately, a couple of them,
I think one of the doctors

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:16.570 align:middle line:84%
if I recall, came
across a laboratory

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:19.830 align:middle line:84%
where they had these
various growing

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:26.120 align:middle line:84%
entities in these containers
again in fluid and such.

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain
what that was like?

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:28.240 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: When
they got to Serpo,

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.789 align:middle line:84%
the commander insisted on
seeing the body of 308.

00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And they told him again that
the body no longer exists.

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.110 align:middle line:90%
He said, what do you mean?

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:36.359 align:middle line:84%
They said, we were honored
to be able to have the body

00:28:36.359 --> 00:28:38.690 align:middle line:90%
to use it for experiments.

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:40.070 align:middle line:90%
He said, what do you mean?

00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:42.590 align:middle line:84%
That body belongs
to the planet Earth,

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:44.270 align:middle line:90%
United States of America.

00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:48.160 align:middle line:90%
And we honor our dead.

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, I'm
sorry, it no longer exists.

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:56.092 align:middle line:84%
He said, I want to see what
you have left of that body.

00:28:56.092 --> 00:28:58.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But there were
some emotionally tense times

00:28:58.300 --> 00:28:58.750 align:middle line:90%
during this.

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:00.400 align:middle line:84%
I think there was a
drawing of weapons.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.400 align:middle line:84%
Like what good's
that going to do.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.900 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: There was
a confrontation.

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:05.810 align:middle line:84%
There was a confrontation,
and the security man

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:09.070 align:middle line:84%
on the team, number 899,
went to get the guns.

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:12.160 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'm going to get
the guns and explosives.

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:13.110 align:middle line:90%
Well, get the guns.

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:16.555 align:middle line:90%
And EBE-2 said, please no guns.

00:29:16.555 --> 00:29:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And she put her hand on
the commander's chest

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:19.840 align:middle line:90%
and said, please.

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:22.310 align:middle line:90%
And she begged him.

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:25.050 align:middle line:90%
She said, please many times.

00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:29.100 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, I want to know
what happened to 308's body.

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:37.820 align:middle line:84%
She said, I will get the doctor
in charge and bring him here.

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And the commander was
astounded that the doctor

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:42.222 align:middle line:90%
spoke perfect English.

00:29:42.222 --> 00:29:44.180 align:middle line:84%
He said, where has this
guy been all this time?

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:46.687 align:middle line:90%


00:29:46.687 --> 00:29:48.020 align:middle line:90%
Where was he when we needed him?

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:48.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When they
were struggling.

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:49.393 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yes.

00:29:49.393 --> 00:29:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And so the doctor
explained to him

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:55.470 align:middle line:84%
that they used most of
the parts of the body

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:58.260 align:middle line:90%
for creating other creatures.

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:01.630 align:middle line:84%
And the commander said, I'd
like to see what you've got.

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:05.790 align:middle line:84%
And they took them into
this biotechnology building.

00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And the case that supposedly
held 308's body was sealed

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:11.880 align:middle line:90%
shut.

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.770 align:middle line:84%
So the commander said,
go get the explosives.

00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:17.120 align:middle line:84%
I want to blow it
up, blow it open.

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And once again,
she stopped that.

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And they said, look, the
body no longer exists.

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:26.335 align:middle line:90%
It's been used.

00:30:26.335 --> 00:30:28.800 align:middle line:84%
The commander said,
I'd like to see where

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:31.500 align:middle line:90%
you do all this biotechnology.

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.780 align:middle line:84%
They took them
into that building.

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And the commander
walked down rows

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:40.780 align:middle line:84%
of creatures that were, he
said, hideous, part animal, part

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:44.930 align:middle line:84%
human, part everything, kept
in some sort of suspended

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:48.100 align:middle line:84%
animation, like a
gel of some sort.

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:51.490 align:middle line:90%
And he was revolted.

00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, let
me see the creature

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:58.580 align:middle line:90%
you've created with 308's body.

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And they took him
into another room.

00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And there he saw
creatures that were part--

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:07.630 align:middle line:84%
the one that was used for
308 had large hands and feet,

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:11.640 align:middle line:90%
but it didn't look at all human.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:15.922 align:middle line:84%
He was so revolted that he
wrote in his diary; he said,

00:31:15.922 --> 00:31:17.880 align:middle line:84%
I have seen the dark side
of this civilization.

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:19.860 align:middle line:90%
He thought it was evil.

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:22.570 align:middle line:90%
To him, it was evil.

00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:25.450 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have enough
experience with DNA technology

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:29.800 align:middle line:84%
at that point, even the doctors,
to know what they were doing.

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.310 align:middle line:90%
To them, it was just science.

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:33.020 align:middle line:90%
That's all it was.

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:34.430 align:middle line:90%
It was simply science.

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:37.610 align:middle line:84%
Here they were, traveling
throughout the galaxy,

00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:40.640 align:middle line:84%
bringing these creatures
back to their planet

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:42.670 align:middle line:90%
for experimentation.

00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:45.830 align:middle line:84%
And to him, it was
evil at that point.

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:49.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well if you saw what
was left of your comrade, which

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.180 align:middle line:90%
was unrecognizable.

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that was
also recognized by him

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:57.375 align:middle line:84%
is that these bodies
grew incredibly fast.

00:31:57.375 --> 00:31:59.530 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Fast, that's correct.

00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:04.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that would bring
me to kind of a segue question

00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:07.900 align:middle line:90%
about the Ebens themselves.

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:09.920 align:middle line:84%
Were they cloning
their own species

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:11.220 align:middle line:90%
as part of the population?

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:13.375 align:middle line:84%
And also, what was their
process of reproduction?

00:32:13.375 --> 00:32:15.990 align:middle line:90%


00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:18.282 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Our people
did snoop around.

00:32:18.282 --> 00:32:19.240 align:middle line:90%
They were asked not to.

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:23.140 align:middle line:84%
But they did snoop around and
find out how they reproduced.

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:25.777 align:middle line:84%
They looked in on some of
the huts that they lived in.

00:32:25.777 --> 00:32:26.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and?

00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:29.450 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And said that it
was very much like ours.

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:32.640 align:middle line:84%
But it was, you know,
kind of different too.

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:36.180 align:middle line:84%
They were only allowed to have
two children, each family.

00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:39.270 align:middle line:84%
And they lived in
very simple Spartan--

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:41.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, kind
of rounded domes.

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:43.650 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yeah, exactly.

00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Very unadorned and without
a lot of technology.

00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't have television
or anything like that,

00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:59.250 align:middle line:90%
no central facility for that.

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And they found out that they did
have sex, as we understand it.

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:08.340 align:middle line:84%
But their physiology was
very different from ours.

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:09.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tell us.

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:12.650 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And the CIA man
that briefed President Reagan

00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:14.230 align:middle line:90%
mentioned that.

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:15.470 align:middle line:90%
It's in the book.

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:18.190 align:middle line:84%
He said their blood system
was totally different.

00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:20.290 align:middle line:90%
Their skin was different.

00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:21.930 align:middle line:84%
But they did not
look like the Greys.

00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:22.780 align:middle line:90%
These were not the Greys.

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:24.696 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us the
differentiating factors.

00:33:24.696 --> 00:33:28.050 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: These are
smaller in stature.

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:30.760 align:middle line:84%
They're about four feet,
four and a half feet.

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.860 align:middle line:84%
But they had sort of
a brown complexion.

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:34.263 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Rather than grey.

00:33:34.263 --> 00:33:35.250 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Right.

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:38.760 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the
alien body that's

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:43.630 align:middle line:84%
on display at the museum
in Roswell under the case,

00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:44.620 align:middle line:90%
have you seen that?

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:46.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I have never been.

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:47.000 align:middle line:90%
Should I go?

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:47.990 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Yeah, you should
go to the museum there.

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:49.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:52.590 align:middle line:84%
That body was provided by Paul
Davids, a Hollywood producer.

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:56.100 align:middle line:84%
But it actually was very close
to what they looked like.

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:57.990 align:middle line:90%
They had large skulls.

00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:59.720 align:middle line:90%
The skulls were larger.

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:02.340 align:middle line:84%
But they had a
brownish complexion.

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:05.180 align:middle line:84%
My understanding was they also
had five digits on their hands

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:07.330 align:middle line:90%
and toes.

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And they had large eyes,
but not like the Greys.

00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:14.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Large almond eyes.

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:16.949 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Not the
wrap-around eyes.

00:34:16.949 --> 00:34:18.389 align:middle line:90%
But they did have large eyes.

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And they had a special kind of--
two eyelids, I think he said,

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:25.880 align:middle line:90%
a small nose, and a small mouth.

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:28.600 align:middle line:90%
Do you know Cynthia Crawford?

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:30.840 align:middle line:84%
She does little
sculptures of aliens.

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:35.179 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And she gets this
information psychically.

00:34:35.179 --> 00:34:37.504 align:middle line:84%
She has produced a
sculpture of the Ebens.

00:34:37.504 --> 00:34:38.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Cynthia
Crawford's work?

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:39.495 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:39.495 --> 00:34:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: I should've brought
mine with me, and I didn't.

00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:43.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I would
loved to have seen it.

00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:43.699 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yes.

00:34:43.699 --> 00:34:45.550 align:middle line:84%
They were kind of
impish looking humans.

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:47.429 align:middle line:90%
And they were brownish.

00:34:47.429 --> 00:34:49.880 align:middle line:84%
They didn't look anything at
all like the Greys though.

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:52.139 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:52.139 --> 00:34:55.909 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's talk
about how they lived.

00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:58.950 align:middle line:84%
Because I think most
people want to know.

00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:01.480 align:middle line:84%
They want to have a glimpse
of a life from another planet.

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:03.420 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
food supplies.

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:06.030 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what
the environment was like.

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:08.860 align:middle line:90%
They had two suns, for example.

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:11.440 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Two suns in the
sky, so it never got dark.

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:13.660 align:middle line:90%
They had a twilight.

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:15.120 align:middle line:84%
The Americans had
a difficult time

00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:19.020 align:middle line:84%
getting used to that, that
fact that it never got dark.

00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:21.500 align:middle line:10%
And they had to
accumulate-- they

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:24.520 align:middle line:10%
had to plan their
days, accordingly,

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:28.090 align:middle line:10%
to have eight or
nine hours of rest

00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:30.390 align:middle line:10%
even though it
was light outside.

00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:33.550 align:middle line:90%
And they worked that out.

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:36.710 align:middle line:84%
I think the planet
revolved around one

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:38.530 align:middle line:90%
of the suns, the larger one.

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:40.760 align:middle line:84%
The other one was
off in the distance.

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:43.540 align:middle line:90%
And it was there all the time.

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:45.417 align:middle line:84%
So that was why
it was never dark.

00:35:45.417 --> 00:35:47.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right and
when you go to twilight,

00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:50.365 align:middle line:84%
it was depending on the
rotation of the other sun,

00:35:50.365 --> 00:35:51.240 align:middle line:90%
around the other sun.

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:53.760 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And it's been
debatable whether or not

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:57.200 align:middle line:84%
the two suns actually
revolved around each other.

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're kind
of in a binary pattern.

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: But my understanding
was they were not.

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They were not?

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:02.040 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: They were not.

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:05.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what was
the landscape like?

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:08.430 align:middle line:84%
What were the temperatures
like and so forth?

00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:11.300 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: When the doors
opened and they walked out

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:14.210 align:middle line:84%
onto the planet, the first
reaction of the commander

00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:15.480 align:middle line:90%
was, god, what a planet.

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:20.570 align:middle line:84%
It was just like, he said,
New Mexico or Arizona,

00:36:20.570 --> 00:36:22.930 align:middle line:90%
sparse desert.

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:25.260 align:middle line:90%
Dirt, what it was, basically.

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:30.120 align:middle line:90%
And the heat was overwhelming.

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:34.540 align:middle line:84%
It was about 100-- I think
they figured about 140 degrees,

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:35.560 align:middle line:90%
something like that.

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:36.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How did these
guys contend with that?

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.730 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: They took them
into an underground place

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:39.260 align:middle line:90%
that was cooler.

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:40.560 align:middle line:90%
And that's where they stayed.

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:43.180 align:middle line:84%
That's where they put all the
equipment, under the ground.

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:44.917 align:middle line:84%
And so they could
tolerate it that way.

00:36:44.917 --> 00:36:47.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And was it always
that temperature then?

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.060 align:middle line:90%
That was a constant?

00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:51.420 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: That was the
equatorial region, yes.

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now that
wasn't the only region.

00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:55.080 align:middle line:84%
There was another
region on the planet.

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.212 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about the north.

00:36:56.212 --> 00:36:58.170 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: But the Ebens
preferred that climate.

00:36:58.170 --> 00:36:59.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The warm one?

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: They preferred
to live on the-- yes,

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:01.730 align:middle line:90%
they liked the heat.

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:03.660 align:middle line:90%
They liked the heat.

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:06.244 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
the other environment.

00:37:06.244 --> 00:37:07.660 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Well
after a while, when

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:09.370 align:middle line:84%
they started to
explore the planet,

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:14.150 align:middle line:84%
they found that the northern
quadrant was very, very

00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:18.500 align:middle line:84%
reasonably-- the
temperatures were fine.

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:19.500 align:middle line:90%
They were much better.

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:20.194 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Trees?

00:37:20.194 --> 00:37:20.860 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Trees.

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:21.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Verdant.

00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:22.910 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Water.

00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:23.470 align:middle line:90%
Mountains.

00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:25.300 align:middle line:84%
They said it looked
like Montana.

00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And they named it Little
Montana, Little Montana.

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:33.480 align:middle line:90%
And they loved it up there.

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:36.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people
loved it up there.

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:39.590 align:middle line:84%
But they lived in the
hot portion of the planet

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:43.180 align:middle line:90%
for about six or seven years.

00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:45.920 align:middle line:84%
Eventually they said, why
can't we just live up there?

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:46.824 align:middle line:90%
And they said, fine.

00:37:46.824 --> 00:37:47.990 align:middle line:90%
We'll build you a community.

00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.650 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:51.950 align:middle line:84%
They built them a community
especially for our people.

00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:55.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, were all
of these plants and trees

00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:56.825 align:middle line:90%
and such native to that planet?

00:37:56.825 --> 00:37:57.950 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:59.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It wasn't like
they brought those back

00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:03.430 align:middle line:84%
with body parts and
were creating something.

00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:05.250 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: No, they
looked like fir trees.

00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:06.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:10.530 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: I put a photo in the
book of the Montana climate.

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:14.609 align:middle line:84%
And they said that it looked
pretty much like that, yeah.

00:38:14.609 --> 00:38:16.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's
talk a little bit

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:19.360 align:middle line:84%
about some of the animals,
some of the animals

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.227 align:middle line:90%
they encountered.

00:38:20.227 --> 00:38:22.810 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Yeah, they encountered
some strange looking animals.

00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:26.380 align:middle line:84%
One looked like a lion,
but it had a lot of fur

00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:29.450 align:middle line:90%
around it's face.

00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And there was something that
looked like an armadillo.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And that turned out to be
dangerous, the armadillo.

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.550 align:middle line:84%
But they were instructed
not to try and kill them.

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:42.940 align:middle line:84%
By the way, they had
brought guns with them--

00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:45.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course.

00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:47.330 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: --revolvers
and rifles both.

00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:48.790 align:middle line:90%
They were told not to.

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:51.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't kill any
of our species, yeah.

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:53.620 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: But they
wanted-- the Americans

00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:56.970 align:middle line:84%
did want some source of meat,
which they weren't getting.

00:38:56.970 --> 00:38:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
they were vegetarian.

00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:00.440 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yeah.

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And the Ebens did not have
any concept of killing animals

00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:06.680 align:middle line:90%
to eat them at all.

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:12.330 align:middle line:84%
So they encountered a creature
that looked like a snake.

00:39:12.330 --> 00:39:15.600 align:middle line:90%
But it had very unusual eyes.

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:18.780 align:middle line:90%
And they did kill the snake.

00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:19.980 align:middle line:90%
They did kill it.

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:21.330 align:middle line:90%
And they dissected the eyes.

00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And the eyes, they said,
we're almost like human eyes.

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, that was
freaky reading about that.

00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:26.865 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:39:26.865 --> 00:39:29.770 align:middle line:90%


00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:32.380 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: But they were allowed
to explore the entire planet.

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:34.837 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so they were
allowed to eat the snake meat?

00:39:34.837 --> 00:39:36.670 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Yeah, in that
particular occasion.

00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:38.253 align:middle line:84%
But they told them
not to do it again.

00:39:38.253 --> 00:39:39.890 align:middle line:90%
They said, don't do it again.

00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:41.450 align:middle line:90%
We don't like you to do that.

00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:43.120 align:middle line:90%
Please, don't do it again.

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so let's
talk a little bit

00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:49.170 align:middle line:84%
about the food supplies that
they did encounter there.

00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:53.437 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: They grew food, as we
would call it, hydroponically

00:39:53.437 --> 00:39:55.270 align:middle line:84%
in a very artificial
environment, where they

00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:57.759 align:middle line:90%
had soil and they had water.

00:39:57.759 --> 00:39:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think, at that
time, I don't think we

00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:01.139 align:middle line:90%
had hydroponics on this planet.

00:40:01.139 --> 00:40:02.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure that we did.

00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:03.096 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In the '60s?

00:40:03.096 --> 00:40:06.160 align:middle line:90%
That would've been a bit early.

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.151 align:middle line:90%
We did by the '70s.

00:40:07.151 --> 00:40:09.650 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Yeah, well maybe some
of that that came from them.

00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:13.030 align:middle line:84%
A lot of technology did
come from that trip.

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:16.986 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we learned about
hydroponics from them.

00:40:16.986 --> 00:40:18.360 align:middle line:84%
They had to wear--
when they went

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:22.537 align:middle line:84%
into the hydroponics
facility, the person in charge

00:40:22.537 --> 00:40:25.120 align:middle line:84%
told them not to come in because
they weren't wearing anything

00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:26.880 align:middle line:90%
on their head.

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:30.249 align:middle line:84%
He got EBE-2 who
said that you have

00:40:30.249 --> 00:40:31.540 align:middle line:90%
to wear something on your head.

00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And she went and got
them hats to wear

00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:36.520 align:middle line:84%
while they went through
that particular facility.

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:39.460 align:middle line:90%


00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:42.419 align:middle line:90%
So they grew the food that way.

00:40:42.419 --> 00:40:44.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lot of it
was, again, tasteless

00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:47.320 align:middle line:84%
to the Americans, although some
of the fruits, it sounded like,

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:48.980 align:middle line:90%
were pretty decent and sweet.

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:50.460 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yes, exactly.

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:53.130 align:middle line:84%
The fruit was the closest
thing that we could come with.

00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:54.380 align:middle line:90%
The rest of it, they said--

00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:54.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Paper.

00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:55.899 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: --tasted like paper.

00:40:55.899 --> 00:40:58.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But again, they
said some of those foods,

00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:00.220 align:middle line:84%
those bland foods were
used in healing them

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:01.720 align:middle line:84%
when they weren't
feeling well, when

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:02.510 align:middle line:90%
they were nauseous and all.

00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: They did
say that, yeah.

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:06.920 align:middle line:90%
So the food's were nourishing.

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:11.025 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the Ebens
could get all they wanted.

00:41:11.025 --> 00:41:12.400 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have
to buy anything.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.764 align:middle line:90%
There was no money.

00:41:13.764 --> 00:41:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No money
in the culture.

00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:17.541 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of
people would-- yeah.

00:41:17.541 --> 00:41:18.790 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: No concept of money.

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:19.415 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:19.415 --> 00:41:20.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, there you go.

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:21.290 align:middle line:90%
That's a good one.

00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:22.062 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yeah, right.

00:41:22.062 --> 00:41:23.562 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Causes a
lot of suffering.

00:41:23.562 --> 00:41:25.910 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yeah, exactly.

00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:27.900 align:middle line:84%
They had a central
facility where

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:32.152 align:middle line:84%
the people, the Ebens could go
and take anything they wanted,

00:41:32.152 --> 00:41:32.860 align:middle line:90%
that they needed.

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they did use,
they continued using the light

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:37.520 align:middle line:90%
for healing purposes and such?

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:40.510 align:middle line:84%
Light was really primary
to what they did.

00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:41.840 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yeah, they did.

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:43.260 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:46.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Using frequencies.

00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:50.166 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: We tried to
teach them our science.

00:41:50.166 --> 00:41:51.790 align:middle line:84%
They weren't terribly
interested in it.

00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:55.700 align:middle line:84%
They took a radio, a
radio telephone apart

00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:57.710 align:middle line:90%
to show them how it worked.

00:41:57.710 --> 00:42:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And they were surprised
that it was so

00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:01.760 align:middle line:90%
different from what they knew.

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:05.170 align:middle line:90%


00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:09.920 align:middle line:84%
When they put them in their
quarters when they arrived,

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:13.250 align:middle line:84%
they had light,
and they had power.

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And our people were
able to plug anything

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:19.660 align:middle line:84%
we had into their
boxes, and it worked.

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:21.290 align:middle line:90%
It all worked.

00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:23.360 align:middle line:84%
We found out later
why that was the case.

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:27.050 align:middle line:84%
Because what they called
the "crystal rectangle"

00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:31.810 align:middle line:84%
was taken back to
Earth and analyzed.

00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:32.620 align:middle line:90%
But anyway--

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:34.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What did we find out
from the crystal rectangle?

00:42:34.290 --> 00:42:35.665 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: We found
out that there

00:42:35.665 --> 00:42:42.430 align:middle line:84%
was like a small, little bubble
of antimatter that reacted

00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:45.190 align:middle line:90%
to any demand put on it.

00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:46.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How are
we using that now?

00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:48.140 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: If it needed 50
volts, it got 50 volts.

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:49.810 align:middle line:84%
If it needed 10 volts,
it got 10 volts.

00:42:49.810 --> 00:42:50.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Perfect.

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:52.420 align:middle line:90%
How are we using it?

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:53.016 align:middle line:90%
Do we know?

00:42:53.016 --> 00:42:54.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's
obviously being used,

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:57.990 align:middle line:84%
probably in some exotic
military technology.

00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: If we have
that technology,

00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:02.130 align:middle line:84%
just think of all the things
it would revolutionize.

00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:03.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, don't we?

00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:04.550 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: We must.

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:05.309 align:middle line:90%
We must have it.

00:43:05.309 --> 00:43:07.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so-- yeah, I
think that's the Holy Grail.

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: The Ebens shared
everything with us, freely.

00:43:10.830 --> 00:43:14.510 align:middle line:90%
They didn't keep anything back.

00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:17.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So one
of the things they

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:21.920 align:middle line:84%
talked about was this little
device they wore on their belt,

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:25.220 align:middle line:84%
like a little television
monitor or something.

00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:31.290 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the structure
of the society a little bit.

00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:33.410 align:middle line:84%
The impression of
the crew seemed

00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:36.340 align:middle line:84%
to be that they were
very highly controlled.

00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:38.280 align:middle line:90%
There was very little free will.

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:40.540 align:middle line:84%
That wasn't really
a notion there.

00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:41.920 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk about this?

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:44.640 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: When they landed,
there was a large tower.

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:48.294 align:middle line:84%
I think they said it
was about 300 feet high.

00:43:48.294 --> 00:43:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And on the top of
it was something

00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:52.200 align:middle line:90%
that appeared to be a mirror.

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And as the sun went
through different phases,

00:43:57.730 --> 00:44:03.280 align:middle line:84%
the shadow on the ground kept
changing, like a sundial.

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:10.024 align:middle line:84%
And as it moved from one segment
of the circle to another,

00:44:10.024 --> 00:44:12.190 align:middle line:84%
all the Ebens would stop
doing what they were doing,

00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:14.350 align:middle line:84%
and they would start
doing something else.

00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:17.370 align:middle line:84%
So they were controlled
by the movements

00:44:17.370 --> 00:44:20.870 align:middle line:90%
from that device on the tower.

00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:28.690 align:middle line:84%
They're highly,
highly controlled

00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:30.310 align:middle line:90%
in every way, regimented.

00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:32.680 align:middle line:84%
Their lives were
totally regimented.

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:35.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this was
something that kind

00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:39.170 align:middle line:84%
raised their curiosity
about the nature of that.

00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And the notion of
controlling a species

00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:45.550 align:middle line:84%
is certainly not something
that's specific to Earth,

00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:47.740 align:middle line:84%
that it seems to happen
throughout the universe

00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:50.080 align:middle line:90%
or universes.

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:53.805 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: It was
really a police state,

00:44:53.805 --> 00:44:54.930 align:middle line:90%
in every sense of the word.

00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:58.580 align:middle line:84%
Because in addition to
the tower and the mirror,

00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:01.240 align:middle line:84%
they also wore devices
on their belts.

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:03.970 align:middle line:84%
At that time, we had
nothing like a smartphone.

00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:06.160 align:middle line:84%
But that's probably
what it was like.

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:08.577 align:middle line:84%
And they were told what
to do through that--

00:45:08.577 --> 00:45:09.785 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Through the device.

00:45:09.785 --> 00:45:11.770 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: --smartphone.

00:45:11.770 --> 00:45:17.980 align:middle line:84%
Presumably, originating from
some central control facility.

00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:21.660 align:middle line:84%
But they had nothing
like television or radio

00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:24.150 align:middle line:90%
in their homes.

00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:30.020 align:middle line:84%
So that device was used
strictly to inform them

00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:34.320 align:middle line:84%
of what they needed to do,
that plus the mirror tower.

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And the commander was told
that they had a tower like this

00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:41.740 align:middle line:90%
in every community.

00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:44.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did they
ever see any instances

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:47.290 align:middle line:84%
of civil disobedience,
for example?

00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:49.610 align:middle line:84%
Or were the Ebens just
simply not inclined

00:45:49.610 --> 00:45:52.425 align:middle line:84%
to doing anything other
than what was told?

00:45:52.425 --> 00:45:54.550 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: No rebelliousness
that they could detect.

00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:57.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A passive society.

00:45:57.890 --> 00:46:02.355 align:middle line:84%
And how did they
spend their own time?

00:46:02.355 --> 00:46:03.980 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: They did
have fun activities.

00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:05.300 align:middle line:90%
They did have feasts.

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:07.860 align:middle line:84%
They had parties,
things like that.

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:10.240 align:middle line:90%
They did get into that.

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And they invited our people
to be part of those things.

00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And I have a chapter
on that in the book.

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I understand
they would dance.

00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:20.360 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: They danced.

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:22.110 align:middle line:90%
They liked to dance.

00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:23.972 align:middle line:90%
They loved music.

00:46:23.972 --> 00:46:26.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Any notion of what
that music sounded like?

00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:27.990 align:middle line:84%
Were they able to
reconstruct it?

00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Yes, the music
was very similar to what

00:46:32.210 --> 00:46:34.727 align:middle line:90%
we know as Tibetan chants.

00:46:34.727 --> 00:46:35.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:36.601 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Chanting.

00:46:36.601 --> 00:46:38.880 align:middle line:90%


00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And I pointed out in the
book that the Americans

00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:45.550 align:middle line:84%
brought with them
tons of music tapes

00:46:45.550 --> 00:46:48.020 align:middle line:84%
to listen to when
they got there.

00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:50.914 align:middle line:84%
And some of those
were Tibetan chants.

00:46:50.914 --> 00:46:51.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:46:51.830 --> 00:46:54.821 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Yeah, that
tells me that-- what?

00:46:54.821 --> 00:46:59.580 align:middle line:84%
That we knew all about their
music before they even left.

00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:03.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, interesting.

00:47:03.370 --> 00:47:06.910 align:middle line:84%
When we were talking in
our last conversation,

00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:10.970 align:middle line:84%
the Tibetans were also aware
of the Reptilian societies,

00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:12.502 align:middle line:90%
is that correct?

00:47:12.502 --> 00:47:13.460 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: The who were?

00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:14.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Were the Tibetans?

00:47:14.650 --> 00:47:17.100 align:middle line:84%
Were we in Tibet
or where were we?

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:18.370 align:middle line:90%
When we were talking about--

00:47:18.370 --> 00:47:19.330 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: That was the
Reptillian connection.

00:47:19.330 --> 00:47:21.090 align:middle line:84%
The Ebens were not connected
with the reptilians.

00:47:21.090 --> 00:47:23.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know, but I'm
saying, there, in Tibet--

00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Oh yeah,
that's interesting.

00:47:24.330 --> 00:47:25.495 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --they had
both connections.

00:47:25.495 --> 00:47:26.453 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: That's right.

00:47:26.453 --> 00:47:28.312 align:middle line:90%


00:47:28.312 --> 00:47:29.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's interesting.

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:31.644 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Yeah, Tibet is
a very interesting place--

00:47:31.644 --> 00:47:34.270 align:middle line:90%
was before China took it over.

00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:38.070 align:middle line:84%
Very deep, interesting
stuff going on there.

00:47:38.070 --> 00:47:42.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the body,
themselves, I mean,

00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:42.980 align:middle line:90%
they took food in.

00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:44.470 align:middle line:84%
They were very
efficient in the way

00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:46.730 align:middle line:84%
they were able to utilize
their foods, it sounds like.

00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:49.352 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have a lot of waste
products, kind of like rat

00:47:49.352 --> 00:47:50.310 align:middle line:90%
droppings or something.

00:47:50.310 --> 00:47:51.407 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: That's right.

00:47:51.407 --> 00:47:53.240 align:middle line:84%
What they said was they
eliminated very much

00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:54.940 align:middle line:90%
like a cat, cat droppings.

00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:57.234 align:middle line:90%


00:47:57.234 --> 00:47:58.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
didn't urinate.

00:47:58.650 --> 00:47:59.760 align:middle line:90%
They happened to absorb.

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:01.879 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Which Anonymous
found very amusing.

00:48:01.879 --> 00:48:04.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Cat droppings and
they didn't really urinate.

00:48:04.170 --> 00:48:07.270 align:middle line:84%
Their body just
absorbed all the fluids

00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:09.370 align:middle line:90%
that they were taking in.

00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And they also had their own
kind of spiritual practices.

00:48:13.230 --> 00:48:15.010 align:middle line:84%
Was the chanting
that you were talking

00:48:15.010 --> 00:48:17.520 align:middle line:84%
about, kind of like
the Tibetan chanting,

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.790 align:middle line:84%
similar to their
religious-- was that part

00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:21.030 align:middle line:90%
of a religious practice?

00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:22.980 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Yeah,
apparently it was.

00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:25.850 align:middle line:84%
But that was the kind
of music they preferred.

00:48:25.850 --> 00:48:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And we learned a lot about
their religious orientation.

00:48:30.850 --> 00:48:33.810 align:middle line:84%
Also, we found out
that they believed

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:40.020 align:middle line:84%
in a creative force, which I
think they call something else.

00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And they believed in a
form of reincarnation.

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:49.020 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of their
worship attitude

00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:50.780 align:middle line:84%
was very similar,
in a lot of ways

00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:53.450 align:middle line:84%
to the Catholic Church,
which the Vatican was

00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:55.440 align:middle line:90%
very delighted to hear about.

00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:56.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Explain this.

00:48:56.850 --> 00:49:01.630 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Well, when they landed
in 2009, when they returned

00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:08.560 align:middle line:84%
in 2009, that was their
eighth visit to Earth,

00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:12.890 align:middle line:84%
we invited representatives
of the Vatican

00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:16.200 align:middle line:84%
to that landing as
well as representatives

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:19.550 align:middle line:84%
from the People's Republic
of China and Russia.

00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And the Vatican presented
them with religious paintings.

00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And they also gave a
gift to the Vatican.

00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:30.130 align:middle line:90%
So it was that exchange.

00:49:30.130 --> 00:49:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And that may be what
triggered the Vatican

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:34.719 align:middle line:90%
to their liberal policies.

00:49:34.719 --> 00:49:36.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Open their arms, yes.

00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:39.730 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Open their policies
about, start talking about

00:49:39.730 --> 00:49:40.480 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrials.

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:42.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA:
Extraterrestrial contact.

00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:44.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And why
couldn't extraterrestrials

00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:46.274 align:middle line:90%
exist under the Christian idea?

00:49:46.274 --> 00:49:47.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
think the Vatican also

00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:50.900 align:middle line:84%
had possessions of other
artifacts, as I recall,

00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:54.301 align:middle line:84%
and paintings that featured
UFOs in the background.

00:49:54.301 --> 00:49:55.675 align:middle line:84%
And some of Danny
Sheehan's work.

00:49:55.675 --> 00:49:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: That's right,
going back hundreds of years.

00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:59.584 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's not
like they were unaware.

00:49:59.584 --> 00:50:02.320 align:middle line:84%
It's just that they
publicly embraced the notion

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:04.595 align:middle line:84%
that we need to maybe
explore this relationship.

00:50:04.595 --> 00:50:06.940 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Exactly.

00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:08.700 align:middle line:84%
But they did believe
in reincarnation,

00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:11.300 align:middle line:84%
which the Vatican
does not, of course.

00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And they were very
reverent people.

00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And they did have occasions,
when somebody died,

00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:23.476 align:middle line:84%
they would have
elaborate funerals.

00:50:23.476 --> 00:50:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And then they would have
fun after that, just

00:50:25.350 --> 00:50:26.000 align:middle line:90%
like the Irish wakes.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was a
joyful event there.

00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:28.340 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yeah, right.

00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Because apparently,
the attitude was, well,

00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:34.712 align:middle line:84%
that soul has been
released, and that's good.

00:50:34.712 --> 00:50:36.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
they'll come back again.

00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: They'll come
back again, exactly.

00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:42.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, as we kind of
start, let's start moving.

00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Anything else about
their lifestyle there

00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:46.309 align:middle line:84%
that we haven't
covered that you think

00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:47.600 align:middle line:90%
people would be intrigued with?

00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:49.308 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: They had a
strange kind of game

00:50:49.308 --> 00:50:51.990 align:middle line:84%
where they all stood like
chess pieces at various places

00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:53.840 align:middle line:84%
and then moved in
very strange ways.

00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:55.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, I remember
reading about that.

00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:57.358 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And our people
never could figure out

00:50:57.358 --> 00:50:59.100 align:middle line:90%
what they were doing.

00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:01.104 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, human
chess or Eben chess.

00:51:01.104 --> 00:51:01.770 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Right.

00:51:01.770 --> 00:51:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And we tried to teach them to
play football and baseball,

00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:10.670 align:middle line:84%
but they could not comprehend
the concept of not allowing

00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:13.450 align:middle line:90%
the ball to hit the ground.

00:51:13.450 --> 00:51:15.310 align:middle line:84%
They never could
figure that out,

00:51:15.310 --> 00:51:17.210 align:middle line:84%
why we put so much
emphasis on that.

00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:21.120 align:middle line:90%


00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:22.700 align:middle line:90%
So we did play games with them.

00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:25.190 align:middle line:90%
And they invited us to a feast.

00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And they had a good time, the
Americans had a very good time,

00:51:29.310 --> 00:51:30.400 align:middle line:90%
they said, at the feast.

00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:32.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did the
commander and Eben 2

00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:33.660 align:middle line:90%
become closer through the years?

00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:34.810 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: They did.

00:51:34.810 --> 00:51:37.260 align:middle line:90%
And he really liked her a lot.

00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:39.130 align:middle line:90%
He said she was wonderful.

00:51:39.130 --> 00:51:42.695 align:middle line:84%
And she made the whole
thing work, really,

00:51:42.695 --> 00:51:45.350 align:middle line:90%
her translating capability.

00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:47.996 align:middle line:84%
Because they couldn't
communicate with the others.

00:51:47.996 --> 00:51:49.870 align:middle line:84%
There was one that
followed them around a lot

00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:51.971 align:middle line:90%
that they called the Einstein.

00:51:51.971 --> 00:51:53.470 align:middle line:84%
Because he wanted
to know everything

00:51:53.470 --> 00:51:56.010 align:middle line:90%
he could about our technology.

00:51:56.010 --> 00:51:58.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he
learned very rapidly?

00:51:58.290 --> 00:52:00.070 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: He learned
very rapidly.

00:52:00.070 --> 00:52:02.195 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They were
estimating, if you could put it

00:52:02.195 --> 00:52:05.880 align:middle line:84%
in human terms, the IQ
of that fellow, anyway,

00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:08.062 align:middle line:90%
some of the Ebens was over 300.

00:52:08.062 --> 00:52:10.020 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: I don't know
if that particular Eben,

00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:14.760 align:middle line:84%
but we did estimate their
average IQ was about 160-- what

00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:18.390 align:middle line:84%
we would call 160-- which
is in our estimation, that's

00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:19.550 align:middle line:90%
a genius category.

00:52:19.550 --> 00:52:21.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, of course.

00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:22.825 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: That's
even beyond Einstein.

00:52:22.825 --> 00:52:24.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it was
applied very differently

00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:28.290 align:middle line:84%
because even though the average
IQ may have been, say roughly

00:52:28.290 --> 00:52:30.860 align:middle line:84%
160, when they were
trying to interact

00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:34.810 align:middle line:84%
with the people around
them, the crew around them,

00:52:34.810 --> 00:52:36.380 align:middle line:84%
the ones they had
access to anyway,

00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:39.270 align:middle line:84%
they didn't understand
how certain rather

00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:41.615 align:middle line:84%
simple, mechanical things
or whatnot worked--

00:52:41.615 --> 00:52:42.782 align:middle line:90%
or electrical things.

00:52:42.782 --> 00:52:44.990 align:middle line:84%
But that's because they
weren't educated in that way.

00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:46.860 align:middle line:84%
They found out later,
there were others

00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:49.430 align:middle line:84%
that certainly had
all the understanding

00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:51.010 align:middle line:90%
necessary for our science.

00:52:51.010 --> 00:52:53.680 align:middle line:84%
It's just they were talking
to the milkman, so to speak.

00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:54.430 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Exactly.

00:52:54.430 --> 00:52:57.685 align:middle line:84%
And that led me to believe
that it was a police state.

00:52:57.685 --> 00:52:59.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
it was segmented.

00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:00.559 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And all
the high education

00:53:00.559 --> 00:53:06.380 align:middle line:84%
was kept in a particular--
among a particular clique, who

00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:08.350 align:middle line:90%
really ruled the roost.

00:53:08.350 --> 00:53:09.850 align:middle line:84%
Like when they found
out that doctor

00:53:09.850 --> 00:53:12.010 align:middle line:84%
could speak perfect
English, they

00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:17.300 align:middle line:84%
realized he was coming from
a different, let's just say,

00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:18.320 align:middle line:90%
economic strata.

00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:21.810 align:middle line:90%


00:53:21.810 --> 00:53:23.600 align:middle line:84%
They were the group
that made the rules

00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:25.470 align:middle line:84%
and sent the messages to
these little smartphones.

00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:26.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What did they learn?

00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:28.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean let's start
kind of wrapping up

00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:30.350 align:middle line:90%
the experience for them.

00:53:30.350 --> 00:53:33.170 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, they learned a lot
about that culture but maybe

00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:36.170 align:middle line:84%
even about the cosmos and
Earthlings, ourselves.

00:53:36.170 --> 00:53:38.380 align:middle line:84%
What were some of
the biggest takeaways

00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:40.530 align:middle line:90%
that the crew left behind?

00:53:40.530 --> 00:53:42.030 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: That the
crew left behind?

00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:44.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, not left
with them but left for us.

00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:47.270 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't know if any
of them are remaining now.

00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:48.744 align:middle line:90%
What did their collective?

00:53:48.744 --> 00:53:50.160 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: When
they got back here?

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:51.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:53:51.830 --> 00:53:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: They were
isolated and kept

00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:57.480 align:middle line:84%
in isolation for a full
year when they came back.

00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:00.095 align:middle line:84%
And they were debriefed
by the Air Force

00:54:00.095 --> 00:54:03.060 align:middle line:84%
Office of Special
Investigation as well as

00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:05.470 align:middle line:90%
the CIA and other people.

00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:10.660 align:middle line:84%
And the result of that
was a 3,000 page book.

00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And presumably, Anonymous
had access to that book.

00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:18.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's how all
of this came out.

00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:19.950 align:middle line:84%
Plus, they came
back with, I think

00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:23.130 align:middle line:84%
they said, around 3,000
photographs, probably movies as

00:54:23.130 --> 00:54:25.972 align:middle line:90%
well, soil samples, everything.

00:54:25.972 --> 00:54:27.180 align:middle line:90%
They brought back everything.

00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Everything kept
under lock and key

00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:33.400 align:middle line:84%
at Bolling Air Force
Base in Washington.

00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What
struck you the most

00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:39.970 align:middle line:84%
out of the words of the
commander and the release

00:54:39.970 --> 00:54:41.540 align:middle line:90%
by Anonymous about all this?

00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:43.340 align:middle line:84%
What was the most
profound takeaway

00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:47.669 align:middle line:84%
for you, personally, when you
became involved in this story?

00:54:47.669 --> 00:54:49.210 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Well, you
know, I've always

00:54:49.210 --> 00:54:51.870 align:middle line:84%
believed that in such
a large universe,

00:54:51.870 --> 00:54:55.970 align:middle line:84%
there have to be very
diverse civilizations that we

00:54:55.970 --> 00:54:57.830 align:middle line:90%
can't even comprehend.

00:54:57.830 --> 00:55:00.160 align:middle line:84%
For instance, a lot
of the UFO occupants

00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:04.625 align:middle line:84%
are strange looking, like
the so-called mantis types.

00:55:04.625 --> 00:55:05.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The mantis people.

00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:08.650 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And while they were
in one of the eating facilities,

00:55:08.650 --> 00:55:09.780 align:middle line:90%
one of those walked in.

00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:11.730 align:middle line:90%
And the commander was astounded.

00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And he asked EBE-2
about it, and she said,

00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:16.850 align:middle line:84%
he's just a visitor
from another planet.

00:55:16.850 --> 00:55:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And they were very
cosmopolitan about it.

00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:25.710 align:middle line:84%
What struck me was that
they had the same caring

00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:29.520 align:middle line:84%
and compassionate attitude
that we value here.

00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:32.350 align:middle line:84%
That probably beings
all over the universe

00:55:32.350 --> 00:55:35.930 align:middle line:84%
can feel as we do in
terms of spirituality.

00:55:35.930 --> 00:55:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, I
think we're going

00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:41.030 align:middle line:84%
to find a lot of very
receptive civilizations

00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:44.670 align:middle line:84%
out there as we start to
explore the galaxy, for sure.

00:55:44.670 --> 00:55:47.880 align:middle line:84%
Don't forget, they had
already explored the galaxy.

00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:49.670 align:middle line:84%
They had been all
over the galaxy.

00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:52.960 align:middle line:84%
So we have all that
information at our disposal

00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:53.850 align:middle line:90%
of what they learned.

00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:54.960 align:middle line:90%
I mean think about it.

00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:58.580 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing, amazing stuff
that we probably have learned,

00:55:58.580 --> 00:56:00.710 align:middle line:90%
and we're keeping under wraps.

00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:04.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's kind of
the crime of it all, I suppose.

00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:07.650 align:middle line:84%
Technologies that could
help liberate the species,

00:56:07.650 --> 00:56:11.680 align:middle line:84%
the entire human population
so greatly and having it

00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:14.560 align:middle line:84%
being, for whatever reason,
quarantined or maybe exploited

00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:15.480 align:middle line:90%
by a few.

00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:16.230 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Exactly.

00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And our explosion
in biotechnology

00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:21.340 align:middle line:84%
did happen shortly
after they got back.

00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:24.860 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of what we learned from
them has probably been applied.

00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:27.140 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we can already
clone humans.

00:56:27.140 --> 00:56:29.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There seems to
be some evidence of that.

00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:31.590 align:middle line:90%
And let's go to Carl Sagan.

00:56:31.590 --> 00:56:35.960 align:middle line:84%
He had been briefed
about this, hadn't he?

00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And yet he kept such a straight
line on one hand and then,

00:56:39.210 --> 00:56:40.880 align:middle line:84%
on the other,
"Contact" comes out.

00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: He had to.

00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:42.439 align:middle line:90%
He had to.

00:56:42.439 --> 00:56:44.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So tell us
about his involvement,

00:56:44.590 --> 00:56:45.950 align:middle line:90%
what you feel about Carl Sagan.

00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:48.360 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: He was brought in
because they couldn't figure

00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:53.170 align:middle line:84%
out the-- the movements of
the planet around their sun

00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:55.320 align:middle line:84%
did not seem to
equate to what we

00:56:55.320 --> 00:57:00.800 align:middle line:84%
know of as our rules of
planetary revolution.

00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:04.760 align:middle line:84%
They wanted Sagan's
viewpoint on that.

00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote a 60-page
brief on his view of it.

00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And that brief was included
in the final report,

00:57:15.730 --> 00:57:18.320 align:middle line:90%
which was created in 1980.

00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:21.720 align:middle line:90%
They came back in '78.

00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And they wrote up the final,
after a year of isolation,

00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:28.520 align:middle line:84%
after a year of creating
the 3,000 page book,

00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:29.870 align:middle line:90%
they created that final report.

00:57:29.870 --> 00:57:31.260 align:middle line:90%
And he signed it.

00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:33.520 align:middle line:84%
His signature is
on that as well.

00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:35.770 align:middle line:84%
So he was heavily
involved in that.

00:57:35.770 --> 00:57:38.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he came to
embrace a lot of what he--

00:57:38.570 --> 00:57:41.320 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: But publicly, he never
acknowledged that we ever--

00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:42.153 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Privately.

00:57:42.153 --> 00:57:43.390 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Right.

00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:44.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, he never did.

00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:48.860 align:middle line:84%
Yet he did the film-- I mean,
he wrote the book, "Contact."

00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:51.740 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yeah, that's right.

00:57:51.740 --> 00:57:52.640 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And that was his
way of revealing

00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:59.690 align:middle line:84%
what he knew because that was
really a revelation, that book,

00:57:59.690 --> 00:58:01.760 align:middle line:90%
from an astronomy scientist.

00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:03.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:58:03.590 --> 00:58:05.350 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:58:05.350 --> 00:58:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: But his
laboratory at Cornell

00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:14.630 align:middle line:84%
was getting a lot of
funding from NASA.

00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:19.350 align:middle line:84%
So he could not publicly
go into talking about UFOs

00:58:19.350 --> 00:58:24.250 align:middle line:84%
but privately-- And he
and Stanton Friedman

00:58:24.250 --> 00:58:26.610 align:middle line:90%
debated that issue.

00:58:26.610 --> 00:58:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And he said publicly
that probably we'd

00:58:29.970 --> 00:58:31.050 align:middle line:90%
never been visited.

00:58:31.050 --> 00:58:33.176 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, isn't that
the beauty of fiction?

00:58:33.176 --> 00:58:35.340 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yeah.

00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:37.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We can let all
our little secrets out.

00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:38.050 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: That's right.

00:58:38.050 --> 00:58:39.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
that's what's occurred,

00:58:39.530 --> 00:58:41.071 align:middle line:84%
"Close Encounters
of the Third Kind,"

00:58:41.071 --> 00:58:45.040 align:middle line:84%
many, many other Hollywood
films and then right

00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:47.140 align:middle line:90%
down to "Contact" with Sagan.

00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:50.050 align:middle line:84%
So right now, if
we-- I mean, I'm sure

00:58:50.050 --> 00:58:53.860 align:middle line:84%
people's curiosity has been more
than peaked in these last two

00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:55.680 align:middle line:90%
conversations.

00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:59.520 align:middle line:84%
Your book, I love it, "Secret
Journey to the Planet Serpo."

00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:02.010 align:middle line:84%
Aside from your book, are
there any other documents

00:59:02.010 --> 00:59:06.510 align:middle line:84%
we can go to now to get
the fullness of that story?

00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:08.630 align:middle line:84%
I know that 3,000
page document is not

00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:11.790 align:middle line:84%
going to be made available
to the public, is it?

00:59:11.790 --> 00:59:13.510 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Well, I'm
working now on a way

00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:15.740 align:middle line:84%
to try and get it through the
Freedom of Information Act.

00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:16.695 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I'll
be successful.

00:59:16.695 --> 00:59:18.130 align:middle line:90%
But I'm going to do my best.

00:59:18.130 --> 00:59:19.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
I'd be surprised,

00:59:19.010 --> 00:59:20.180 align:middle line:90%
but that would be great.

00:59:20.180 --> 00:59:22.840 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: If they would even
release maybe 10 photos,

00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:26.515 align:middle line:84%
I'd be delighted,
just 10 out of 3,000.

00:59:26.515 --> 00:59:27.890 align:middle line:84%
The only photo we
have is the one

00:59:27.890 --> 00:59:30.580 align:middle line:84%
I have in the book of
the two suns in the sky.

00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:33.210 align:middle line:90%
That's legit, I'm pretty sure.

00:59:33.210 --> 00:59:35.585 align:middle line:90%
But god, just think about it.

00:59:35.585 --> 00:59:37.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ah, no kidding.

00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:40.300 align:middle line:90%
So you've done a beautiful job.

00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:43.280 align:middle line:84%
As I was showing you, my book
is dog-eared, top and bottom,

00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:44.850 align:middle line:90%
almost every page.

00:59:44.850 --> 00:59:48.410 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to thank you,
and Bill Ryan and everyone,

00:59:48.410 --> 00:59:53.352 align:middle line:84%
Anonymous, all for bringing
us to this place where

00:59:53.352 --> 00:59:55.435 align:middle line:84%
we could have access to
this knowledge, when we're

00:59:55.435 --> 00:59:58.420 align:middle line:84%
right on the precipice
of this leap toward being

00:59:58.420 --> 01:00:02.170 align:middle line:84%
beyond global, intergalactic
in our understanding of life

01:00:02.170 --> 01:00:03.020 align:middle line:90%
in the cosmos.

01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And just as an
epilogue, these guys

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:08.770 align:middle line:84%
were supposedly paid
a good sum of money.

01:00:08.770 --> 01:00:10.913 align:middle line:90%
How many returned from Serpo?

01:00:10.913 --> 01:00:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Seven.

01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:14.129 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they were paid
a decent amount of money

01:00:14.129 --> 01:00:15.420 align:middle line:90%
so they could live a good life.

01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:17.440 align:middle line:90%
Their identities were gone.

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:21.360 align:middle line:84%
But they experienced high
levels of radiation poisoning.

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:25.470 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: The last one
died in Florida in 2002.

01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:26.360 align:middle line:90%
Seven came back.

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:28.940 align:middle line:10%
Three died.

01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:30.080 align:middle line:90%
One died on route to Serpo.

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:31.660 align:middle line:90%
Two died on Serpo.

01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:33.896 align:middle line:90%
And two decided to remain there.

01:00:33.896 --> 01:00:35.620 align:middle line:90%
So seven returned.

01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:37.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
couldn't understand.

01:00:37.970 --> 01:00:40.850 align:middle line:84%
They tried to analyze what this
radiation poisoning was about.

01:00:40.850 --> 01:00:43.510 align:middle line:84%
But as we said off
camera, different suns,

01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:46.420 align:middle line:84%
different sources of radiation
throughout the cosmos.

01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:47.420 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Different sun.

01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:50.195 align:middle line:84%
And each sun might have
its unique qualities,

01:00:50.195 --> 01:00:51.784 align:middle line:90%
its unique characteristics.

01:00:51.784 --> 01:00:52.700 align:middle line:90%
That would explain it.

01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:54.033 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So any final thoughts?

01:00:54.033 --> 01:00:55.570 align:middle line:90%
We're out of time.

01:00:55.570 --> 01:00:58.640 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: I think that the
Serpo story opens a door,

01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:01.960 align:middle line:84%
that if we could
truly admit to it,

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:06.580 align:middle line:84%
it would be tremendous in terms
of opening the whole story.

01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:09.540 align:middle line:84%
Because it was put with
the DIA and not the CIA,

01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:13.660 align:middle line:84%
it's a hole into the
information that we

01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:15.580 align:middle line:90%
need to really get into.

01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:18.212 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps, this will
start it, hopefully.

01:01:18.212 --> 01:01:19.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
wish you the best

01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:23.700 align:middle line:84%
of luck in your Freedom of
Information Act journey.

01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:24.726 align:middle line:90%
That should be fun.

01:01:24.726 --> 01:01:25.164 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: I'll need it.

01:01:25.164 --> 01:01:25.705 align:middle line:90%
I'll need it.

01:01:25.705 --> 01:01:26.564 align:middle line:90%
I'm not optimistic.

01:01:26.564 --> 01:01:28.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You might feel beaten
up by the end of that one.

01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:30.970 align:middle line:84%
But thank you for what
you've already done.

01:01:30.970 --> 01:01:32.750 align:middle line:84%
It was just absolutely
enthralling.

01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:33.840 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: It's been fun.

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:35.746 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad we did this.

01:01:35.746 --> 01:01:37.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's so
much more to this story.

01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:40.030 align:middle line:10%
You can find out about it
in the book, "Secret Journey

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:41.290 align:middle line:10%
to Planet Serpo."
