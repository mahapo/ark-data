00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:30.850 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
How would you feel

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.880 align:middle line:10%
to know that the film "Close
Encounters of the Third Kind"

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.290 align:middle line:10%
may well have been
based on real events?

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.840 align:middle line:84%
Hollywood has reportedly long
been used by covert agencies

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.380 align:middle line:84%
for slowly trickling
out future scenarios

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.190 align:middle line:90%
and genuine military projects.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.320 align:middle line:84%
It's an attempt to take the
shock factor out of a subject

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.020 align:middle line:84%
once the true
information reaches

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.240 align:middle line:84%
the public-- mental and
emotional conditioning,

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.640 align:middle line:90%
you might say.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.410 align:middle line:84%
Len Kasten is here today to talk
about a top-secret project that

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.030 align:middle line:84%
was reportedly at the base
of "Close Encounters."

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm so happy to have you
here because when I first

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.459 align:middle line:84%
heard about this
project a few years ago,

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:07.040 align:middle line:84%
I just got a feeling
this is the real deal,

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.650 align:middle line:84%
as wild and crazy as it
sounds-- but really not.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And when you think
about Spielberg and some

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.180 align:middle line:84%
of these high-end producers'
predictive programming,

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.950 align:middle line:84%
you might call it, has
been going on for decades

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.342 align:middle line:84%
now around the UFO
subject, right?

00:01:22.342 --> 00:01:24.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LEN KASTEN: Definitely,
since the '50s.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Since the 1950s.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.170 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Maybe even earlier.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.711 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:01:26.711 --> 00:01:29.074 align:middle line:84%
Now, before we go
into the background,

00:01:29.074 --> 00:01:30.490 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of
background that's

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.430 align:middle line:84%
going to really necessitate
a two-part conversation.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.600 align:middle line:84%
It's really, really
exciting stuff.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.650 align:middle line:90%
It has a lot of depth to it.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.730 align:middle line:84%
How did you first become
fascinated by this project?

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.100 align:middle line:10%
>>KASTEN: I frequently
attended the UFO Congress

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.210 align:middle line:10%
in Laughlin, Nevada.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.350 align:middle line:10%
I used to go every year for
a period about 14 years.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And at the one in
2005, I met Bill Ryan.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And I shared the shuttle ride
all the way from Laughlin

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.840 align:middle line:90%
to Las Vegas with him.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And the entire trip,
he talked about nothing

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.120 align:middle line:90%
but the Serpo story.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.340 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: And I was all ears.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.840 align:middle line:84%
I just couldn't
get enough of it.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.725 align:middle line:84%
I realized right away that
it was the real thing.

00:02:14.725 --> 00:02:15.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.320 align:middle line:90%
I did, too.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And yet you had to
really start digging

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.270 align:middle line:84%
deep to set up the framework
for why this project would

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.842 align:middle line:90%
have ever come to be.

00:02:23.842 --> 00:02:24.800 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yes, exactly.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.299 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, a
lot of deep politics.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.790 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Well, I came
to believe that Anonymous

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:29.634 align:middle line:90%
was the real thing.

00:02:29.634 --> 00:02:30.800 align:middle line:90%
That he had a story to tell.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.380 align:middle line:84%
That if he was
making it all up, he

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.280 align:middle line:84%
would be a science
fiction writer

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.530 align:middle line:84%
on the level of Isaac
Asimov or anyone like that,

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.450 align:middle line:84%
because it was such
a detailed and very,

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.360 align:middle line:84%
very-- the story was
very detailed in terms

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.150 align:middle line:84%
of what happened,
exactly what happened.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's just something
he couldn't have made up.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And not only that.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.040 align:middle line:84%
When you look at
the actual excerpts

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.330 align:middle line:84%
from those who were involved
directly in the project,

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.590 align:middle line:84%
there's a certain
level of the mundane,

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.010 align:middle line:84%
that if you were a
science fiction writer,

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.110 align:middle line:90%
you wouldn't bother with.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you definitely
pump up the juice.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.870 align:middle line:84%
Because it's observations
by military people

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.610 align:middle line:84%
that are not particularly
juicy in the moment

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.445 align:middle line:84%
but have a lot of
import later on.

00:03:17.445 --> 00:03:18.820 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Well,
particularly when

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.290 align:middle line:84%
you're dealing with the actual
diary of the team commander.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.120 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: That he wrote
while he was on the mission.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's
what I'm referring to.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: That kind of
detail, and especially the way

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.320 align:middle line:84%
it was his lingo,
and how he wrote it,

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.760 align:middle line:84%
and how you could tell he
was skipping certain things

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.530 align:middle line:84%
and taking shortcuts that
he would have taken if he

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.500 align:middle line:90%
was actually writing it down.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.590 align:middle line:90%
It became very convincing.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And in the
mindset of the day, and also

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.740 align:middle line:84%
in the language of someone
who isn't a writer.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:46.610 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Exactly.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:47.840 align:middle line:84%
He was a colonel
in the Air Force.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.870 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Right.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:49.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.960 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.180 align:middle line:90%
Well, we have a lot to cover.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.410 align:middle line:84%
I'd say, why don't we start
out-- the very beginning

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.850 align:middle line:84%
place is talk about--
a lot of our viewers

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.650 align:middle line:84%
have heard about
Project Blue Book.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.560 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk
about the Red Book

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.160 align:middle line:84%
and lay out the milieu
of the times that

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.340 align:middle line:84%
really started setting
up a couple decades later

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.870 align:middle line:90%
this event.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.980 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Well, Anonymous--
who revealed the story

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.200 align:middle line:84%
to the internet--
claims to have been

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.339 align:middle line:90%
the editor of the Red Book.

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:21.399 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, he
was the one that

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:24.920 align:middle line:84%
was required to brief
sitting presidents

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.170 align:middle line:90%
on the content of the Red Book.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.674 align:middle line:84%
He brought them
up to date and let

00:04:29.674 --> 00:04:30.840 align:middle line:90%
them know what was going on.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.640 align:middle line:84%
The Red Book is a story of all
UFO contacts since the '40s.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.960 align:middle line:84%
It's a book that's been being
kept by the intelligence

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.030 align:middle line:90%
community.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the Red
Book still-- it's

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.090 align:middle line:84%
in archive somewhere,
is what you're saying.

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.670 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yes.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.730 align:middle line:90%
It's within the DIA.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Compare or
contrast Project Blue Book

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.770 align:middle line:90%
to the Red Book.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:59.340 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Project Blue Book was
really not a genuine program.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.180 align:middle line:84%
If it hadn't been
for Ruppelt himself,

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.150 align:middle line:84%
who was very conscientious
in what he did,

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.210 align:middle line:84%
it wouldn't have had
any value at all.

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:12.100 align:middle line:84%
The Blue Book was supposedly
a record of all UFO sightings

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:17.820 align:middle line:84%
and contacts taken
by Air Force officers

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.350 align:middle line:84%
at every Air Force
base all over the world

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.220 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately sent
in to Blue Book.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.427 align:middle line:84%
And Ruppelt was the
editor at the time.

00:05:28.427 --> 00:05:29.510 align:middle line:90%
He was very conscientious.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.301 align:middle line:84%
He tried to do the
right thing, but I think

00:05:31.301 --> 00:05:33.200 align:middle line:84%
they came down on
him and ultimately--

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then the Condon Report
came out and then shot it down,

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:36.580 align:middle line:90%
pun intended.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:37.205 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yeah.

00:05:37.205 --> 00:05:38.959 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want
all of it known.

00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:39.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.840 align:middle line:90%
So that was kind of an--

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.760 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: But Hynek was
a consultant on that.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.520 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it was
kind of an attempt

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.110 align:middle line:84%
to pretend to do something
that would essentially evaluate

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.802 align:middle line:84%
the phenomena so that
maybe even the public

00:05:52.802 --> 00:05:54.260 align:middle line:84%
could understand
what was going on.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.950 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, it turned into a
bit of a sham by the end of it.

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:57.260 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yeah.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.560 align:middle line:90%
But the book is still out there.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And I would recommend anyone
who can get their hands on it--

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.700 align:middle line:84%
because it's an old book
by now-- should read it.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:03.658 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I agree.

00:06:03.658 --> 00:06:04.300 align:middle line:90%
That is good.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And so now the Red
Book was something

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.230 align:middle line:84%
that was being maintained
on the inside very closely

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:10.750 align:middle line:90%
by an intelligence agency.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.286 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: I think it was
originally with the CIA.

00:06:13.286 --> 00:06:14.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And then the DIA.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.050 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: And then the DIA.

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:21.944 align:middle line:84%
But Blue Book was not connected
to either intelligence agency.

00:06:21.944 --> 00:06:22.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:23.109 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:06:23.109 --> 00:06:23.682 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:06:23.682 --> 00:06:24.390 align:middle line:90%
But you're right.

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.320 align:middle line:84%
It is good to go back
and take a look at that.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.945 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yeah.

00:06:26.945 --> 00:06:29.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because the
cases are still valid.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.195 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Absolutely.

00:06:30.195 --> 00:06:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And as Stanton
Friedman has said,

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:37.472 align:middle line:84%
300 cases were
considered not resolved.

00:06:37.472 --> 00:06:38.430 align:middle line:90%
They weren't explained.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.179 align:middle line:84%
And those 300
cases are critical.

00:06:42.179 --> 00:06:42.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, back then you were
talking about Bill Ryan.

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And he and his
partner, Kerry Cassidy,

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.410 align:middle line:90%
had Project Camelot at the time.

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.180 align:middle line:90%
They later split in two.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.470 align:middle line:84%
Bill continued on with
Project Avalon by the time

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:00.720 align:middle line:84%
a lot of this information
started being released.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:05.604 align:middle line:84%
Why did Anonymous choose Project
Camelot/Avalon for the release

00:07:05.604 --> 00:07:06.520 align:middle line:90%
of this and Bill Ryan?

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.420 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: He did not.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:08.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How did this happen?

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:10.460 align:middle line:10%
How did they end up
in a situation to--

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.850 align:middle line:10%
>>KASTEN: He was a member of
what's called the UFO thread

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:16.750 align:middle line:10%
list, which, as I
explained in my book,

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:20.262 align:middle line:10%
consisted of about 150 insiders.

00:07:20.262 --> 00:07:22.470 align:middle line:84%
These were not just a
collection of people interested

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.290 align:middle line:90%
in UFOs and ET contact.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.290 align:middle line:84%
These people had all been
either in the military

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:29.140 align:middle line:90%
or the intelligence community.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:34.240 align:middle line:84%
They were in the know about
extraterrestrial activity,

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.740 align:middle line:84%
and Anonymous was a member
of that thread list.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.902 align:middle line:90%
And so was Bill Ryan.

00:07:39.902 --> 00:07:41.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What was
Bill Ryan's background

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:43.710 align:middle line:84%
that allowed him to be
on that thread list?

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: He'd just been an
investigator and a writer,

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.320 align:middle line:90%
a journalist, as far as I know.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:52.350 align:middle line:84%
But they chose him to do the
website because he volunteered

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:56.072 align:middle line:84%
for it, A. And B, they
felt he had the ability

00:07:56.072 --> 00:07:57.780 align:middle line:84%
to do it because he
was a very smart guy.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:58.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, a smart guy.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.110 align:middle line:84%
And so he had been doing enough
investigation, and that's why--

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:02.974 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And very
eloquent and very-- he

00:08:02.974 --> 00:08:04.950 align:middle line:90%
knew how to put it together.

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:07.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
is not something

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:11.720 align:middle line:84%
that was ever going to have been
released on mainstream news.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.860 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: I think the intent
and the hope by Anonymous

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:18.240 align:middle line:84%
was that it would eventually,
going through this medium,

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.630 align:middle line:90%
starting with the thread list.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what's happened.

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:27.358 align:middle line:84%
It's slowly filtered into the
mainstream, little by little.

00:08:27.358 --> 00:08:28.066 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:08:28.066 --> 00:08:29.691 align:middle line:84%
And that's an
appropriate way to do it.

00:08:29.691 --> 00:08:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of sites that are
considered alternative media

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:35.260 align:middle line:84%
still at this time have
been utilized in that way,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.970 align:middle line:84%
just like Hollywood's
been utilized

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:41.690 align:middle line:84%
to release depictions of
events that are actually real.

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:42.440 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Exactly.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.490 align:middle line:84%
What would have happened
if Anonymous had decided

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:45.965 align:middle line:90%
to release this to CBS News?

00:08:45.965 --> 00:08:46.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:47.790 align:middle line:84%
No one would have
ever heard of it.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:48.370 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: He would have
been laughed out of the--

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:49.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You bet.

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:50.530 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: So he did
it the right way.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:51.321 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:08:51.321 --> 00:08:52.710 align:middle line:90%
I would agree with that.

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:54.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, a moment ago,
we were talking

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:58.570 align:middle line:84%
about how initially Red Book may
have been overseen by the CIA,

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:02.720 align:middle line:84%
but then the DIA took it over,
Defense Intelligence Agency.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that agency--
when it came to be, and why.

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:13.020 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: That's a good subject
because the DIA was a creation

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.270 align:middle line:90%
of President Kennedy.

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:16.080 align:middle line:90%
Many people don't know that.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:20.820 align:middle line:84%
He and McNamara decided
to create a different kind

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.510 align:middle line:90%
of intelligence agency.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.310 align:middle line:84%
I think you know,
most people know,

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:26.870 align:middle line:84%
that Kennedy had his
problems with the CIA.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:36.370 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: So Kennedy, when he
was briefed on the Serpo story,

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:39.160 align:middle line:84%
he decided to put it in
the hands of the DIA.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.914 align:middle line:84%
And that decision was
the critical decision.

00:09:41.914 --> 00:09:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason
we have the story today.

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:45.800 align:middle line:84%
If he'd given it to
the CIA, the chances

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.130 align:middle line:90%
are it would've stayed buried.

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:52.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And as I understand,
Kennedy was also looking toward

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.057 align:middle line:90%
transparency, ultimately--

00:09:54.057 --> 00:09:54.640 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yes.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --on these stories.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:59.460 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if
you have read or heard

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.370 align:middle line:90%
the same story about Kennedy.

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:05.540 align:middle line:84%
But I had read at one
point that, as many sitting

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.560 align:middle line:84%
presidents had
done once they took

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.050 align:middle line:84%
office, of course the subject
of extraterrestrial contact

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:11.550 align:middle line:90%
came up.

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And in the case of
Carter, was supposedly

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:16.740 align:middle line:84%
told you are not in a
need-to-know position,

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.940 align:middle line:84%
and you will not be given
that information when

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:19.640 align:middle line:90%
he asked for it.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.090 align:middle line:90%
Clinton supposedly asked for it.

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:23.404 align:middle line:84%
My understanding is
Kennedy did as well.

00:10:23.404 --> 00:10:24.320 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yes, he did.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:24.870 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:25.685 align:middle line:90%
And he knew a lot.

00:10:25.685 --> 00:10:27.630 align:middle line:90%
He learned a lot.

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:30.155 align:middle line:84%
But he was missing some very
big pieces of the puzzle.

00:10:30.155 --> 00:10:33.010 align:middle line:90%


00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:36.979 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about Roswell,
I'll get into that.

00:10:36.979 --> 00:10:37.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.170 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:38.790 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: OK.

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.040 align:middle line:84%
But you know about
the Roswell crash.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:41.732 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:41.732 --> 00:10:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And that's
when the whole Serpo

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.020 align:middle line:84%
story started, because one of
the aliens survived the crash.

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:47.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And he was
sent to Los Alamos.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:54.150 align:middle line:84%
There was a tremendous,
tremendous language problem,

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:57.290 align:middle line:84%
because the Ebens did
not speak in any language

00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:00.160 align:middle line:84%
that any of our
experts could decipher.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And now with going back to
Kennedy for just a moment,

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:05.951 align:middle line:84%
you were making a
segue between Roswell

00:11:05.951 --> 00:11:07.700 align:middle line:84%
and what ultimately
happened with Kennedy.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:12.530 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Yes, because Kennedy
was briefed on Roswell.

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:17.320 align:middle line:84%
But he did not know
what transpired

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:24.084 align:middle line:84%
in the nine-year period from
Roswell to his entering office.

00:11:24.084 --> 00:11:24.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:28.260 align:middle line:90%
And do you-- I believe you do.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.160 align:middle line:84%
It's maybe a leading
question, maybe not-- also

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.310 align:middle line:84%
have a good amount of
respect for Philip Corso's

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:34.167 align:middle line:90%
book on the subject.

00:11:34.167 --> 00:11:35.250 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yes, definitely.

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:35.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:36.430 align:middle line:10%
I do, as well.

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:38.890 align:middle line:10%
So we're talking "The
Day After Roswell,"

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:41.830 align:middle line:10%
and it sounds like there
was a missing period.

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:45.950 align:middle line:84%
At least in his area of foreign
technologies in the Army,

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:49.700 align:middle line:84%
there was about a 13-year
gap, 12- or 13-year gap,

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.970 align:middle line:84%
between the crash and
being delivered these parts

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:55.670 align:middle line:84%
and pieces that were to
be reverse engineered

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:57.181 align:middle line:90%
into useful technology.

00:11:57.181 --> 00:11:58.680 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And those
parts and pieces

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.732 align:middle line:90%
were given to Corso in the '60s.

00:12:00.732 --> 00:12:01.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: By his
boss, General Trudeau.

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:06.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:11.730 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: But he did not know
any of what had happened,

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:12.700 align:middle line:90%
what had transpired.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.449 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Philip or
President Kennedy?

00:12:14.449 --> 00:12:15.740 align:middle line:90%
Which one are we talking about?

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:16.365 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Both.

00:12:16.365 --> 00:12:17.236 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:12:17.236 --> 00:12:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Corso did not
have a top-secret clearance.

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:24.790 align:middle line:84%
He was nine levels
above top secret.

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:26.910 align:middle line:84%
There are 33 levels
above top secret.

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:28.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like masonry.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:29.614 align:middle line:90%
No surprise. [LAUGHS]

00:12:29.614 --> 00:12:31.030 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: So he
was missing a lot.

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:31.654 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:31.654 --> 00:12:36.340 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: But Kennedy was
not told the story, either,

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:37.660 align:middle line:90%
of what had happened.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.119 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the
intervening years.

00:12:39.119 --> 00:12:39.784 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Right.

00:12:39.784 --> 00:12:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And that was a very
important period.

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's the critical period
in terms of the Serpo story.

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:45.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And so he passed this
on-- or he formed

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.390 align:middle line:84%
the Defense Intelligence
Agency, didn't he?

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:51.710 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yes, he did.

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:52.251 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:12:52.251 --> 00:12:55.230 align:middle line:84%
So now we have an
agency that is not

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:58.460 align:middle line:84%
the CIA, an antagonistic
relationship with Kennedy,

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.160 align:middle line:84%
but someone in
alignment with him.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.327 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to get
to the bottom of the story.

00:13:02.327 --> 00:13:04.076 align:middle line:84%
And not only that;
they're going to become

00:13:04.076 --> 00:13:05.200 align:middle line:90%
involved in the story.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.920 align:middle line:84%
Now let's pick it up
with those intervening

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:12.940 align:middle line:84%
years between Roswell and the
time Corso and Kennedy became

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:13.490 align:middle line:90%
aware.

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:15.120 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: OK.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.950 align:middle line:90%
One of the aliens survived.

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And they were eventually able
to communicate with that alien.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.140 align:middle line:90%
It was difficult, but they did.

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to know
more about where he

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.870 align:middle line:90%
was from, et cetera, of course.

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:30.310 align:middle line:90%
He was taken to Los Alamos.

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:35.519 align:middle line:84%
They set up a very complicated
little community for him.

00:13:35.519 --> 00:13:37.060 align:middle line:84%
They brought in
language specialists.

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:39.660 align:middle line:84%
They brought in physicians
who could take care of him,

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:41.832 align:middle line:84%
even though his physiology
was totally different.

00:13:41.832 --> 00:13:43.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I was going to say.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.429 align:middle line:84%
And language specialists
with squeaks and eeks and--

00:13:45.429 --> 00:13:46.470 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Right, exactly.

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:46.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:49.260 align:middle line:84%
They said it sounded like
high-pitched singing,

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:50.720 align:middle line:90%
is what it sounded like.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:55.250 align:middle line:84%
Just like-- actually in "Close
Encounters" they did, sure.

00:13:55.250 --> 00:14:01.030 align:middle line:84%
And they found out that he
knew about it a communications

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:03.400 align:middle line:90%
device that was on the craft.

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.496 align:middle line:84%
They had the
communications device,

00:14:05.496 --> 00:14:07.540 align:middle line:84%
but they couldn't
get it to work.

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:09.180 align:middle line:84%
The device was
able to communicate

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:12.100 align:middle line:90%
with his home planet.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.430 align:middle line:84%
For the five years which he
remained alive until 1952,

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:17.870 align:middle line:84%
they couldn't get it
to work-- until one

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:21.810 align:middle line:84%
of the scientists at Los Alamos
said, why don't we just bring

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:25.190 align:middle line:84%
it back to the craft and see
if it will work with the power

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:26.887 align:middle line:90%
source on the craft.

00:14:26.887 --> 00:14:28.595 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The power
source was the issue.

00:14:28.595 --> 00:14:32.950 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And it took an
earthling to discover that.

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:35.560 align:middle line:84%
Once that was done,
they got it to work.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Isn't that
interesting because the Eben

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:42.404 align:middle line:84%
himself took that for
granted, to the effect

00:14:42.404 --> 00:14:43.820 align:middle line:84%
that you would
never stop to think

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:46.550 align:middle line:84%
that it was anything but the
device that wasn't working.

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:47.785 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: I think he thought
that maybe they'd already tried

00:14:47.785 --> 00:14:48.220 align:middle line:90%
that, and it didn't--

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.324 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:14:50.324 --> 00:14:52.240 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And since they
couldn't communicate,

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.189 align:middle line:90%
he didn't know that.

00:14:54.189 --> 00:14:54.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:57.230 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to take it back
a little further, because I'm

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.970 align:middle line:84%
allowing this conversation--
which is leading up to the trip

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:04.810 align:middle line:84%
to Serpo itself-- to get into
the really mysterious and not

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:08.120 align:middle line:84%
well-understood roots
of what was going

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:13.600 align:middle line:84%
on militarily between
Germany and America and also

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.170 align:middle line:90%
politically.

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:16.660 align:middle line:84%
So we've already gotten into
the politics of Kennedy.

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:18.990 align:middle line:84%
He set up the Defense
Intelligence Agency.

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:22.820 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to go to a
man named Karl Haushofer.

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.202 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to lay
it-- take your time

00:15:25.202 --> 00:15:26.160 align:middle line:90%
to lay this foundation.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:26.868 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:15:26.868 --> 00:15:30.360 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Well, I renamed him
the Godfather of the Nazis

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:33.490 align:middle line:90%
because he really was.

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:36.540 align:middle line:10%
He was sent to Japan in
the late 19th century

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:39.970 align:middle line:10%
to help the Japanese develop
their artillery because he

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:43.700 align:middle line:10%
had helped win the French war.

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:47.450 align:middle line:10%
He was a hero in that war.

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:50.540 align:middle line:84%
He was there to help
the Japanese, who

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:54.730 align:middle line:84%
were using a lot of Western
aids to develop their army.

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:57.050 align:middle line:84%
And they became the
most modern army in Asia

00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:58.750 align:middle line:90%
as a result of that.

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:00.090 align:middle line:90%
So that's why he was sent there.

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:01.673 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
was his background?

00:16:01.673 --> 00:16:03.670 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Artillery and
Prussian discipline,

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:06.540 align:middle line:90%
how to put an army together.

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And the Japanese wanted
that at that time.

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:14.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This took him into
some really esoteric groups--

00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:15.820 align:middle line:84%
the Green Dragons,
the Black Dragons.

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:16.630 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Right.

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Because of his-- he was
greeted by the emperor

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.140 align:middle line:90%
when he got there.

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.480 align:middle line:84%
So he was greeted at
a very high level.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And since he was very
good at languages,

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:28.930 align:middle line:84%
he developed an ability
to speak Japanese quickly,

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:30.240 align:middle line:90%
as well as Korean.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.330 align:middle line:84%
He already had three
languages to his credit.

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:35.680 align:middle line:90%
He was a very smart guy.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.900 align:middle line:84%
That's what allowed
him to mix and mingle

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:41.920 align:middle line:84%
with the elite in the
Japanese hierarchy,

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:44.840 align:middle line:84%
because he was able
to speak Japanese

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:48.810 align:middle line:84%
and because they wanted
his ability in terms

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:51.530 align:middle line:90%
of developing their army.

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And so as a result
of that, they decided

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:55.840 align:middle line:84%
to make him a member of
the Green Dragon Society.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:59.830 align:middle line:90%


00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:05.660 align:middle line:84%
This was a very esoteric
and elite society.

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:08.240 align:middle line:84%
You could call it
a cult in Japan.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.079 align:middle line:84%
But the members of the
Green Dragon Society

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:13.849 align:middle line:84%
were at the very highest
levels of the Japanese military

00:17:13.849 --> 00:17:16.020 align:middle line:90%
and government hierarchy.

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:17.839 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So his
being initiated into

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:20.930 align:middle line:84%
that very secretive
society and elite

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:25.380 align:middle line:84%
society, what kind of an
impact would that then have

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:26.990 align:middle line:90%
on future events?

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:29.710 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Well
because he was trained

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:31.450 align:middle line:84%
in some of their
occult abilities--

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:37.130 align:middle line:84%
namely being able to see the
future to some degree-- he was

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:40.950 align:middle line:84%
only the third Westerner ever
to be allowed into the Green

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:41.820 align:middle line:90%
Dragon Society.

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:44.850 align:middle line:90%
So it was quite an honor.

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of
that connection,

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:53.860 align:middle line:84%
he learned a lot about what
the ultimate goals were

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:56.260 align:middle line:90%
of the Green Dragon Society.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And they were nothing less
than world domination,

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.490 align:middle line:90%
world conquest.

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:03.889 align:middle line:84%
That's what they had
in mind for the future.

00:18:03.889 --> 00:18:04.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:08.110 align:middle line:84%
He was viewing into a
particular potential trajectory

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:10.550 align:middle line:90%
into the future, right?

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:12.030 align:middle line:90%
And that was their desire.

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:17.620 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Japanese secret
societies, the Green Dragons,

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:24.020 align:middle line:84%
were actually anticipating
literally a world takeover.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:31.290 align:middle line:84%
They were projecting their plans
way out into the 50th century.

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:33.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
year was this?

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.861 align:middle line:90%
Which years, what time period?

00:18:35.861 --> 00:18:37.235 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Was he
brought into it?

00:18:37.235 --> 00:18:37.943 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:18:37.943 --> 00:18:40.230 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: 1890s.

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:42.840 align:middle line:84%
So he returned to Germany
in the early 20th century.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.630 align:middle line:90%


00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of that, he
was involved in World War I.

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:56.111 align:middle line:84%
And he was made a
general in World War I.

00:18:56.111 --> 00:18:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And because of what he had
learned in the Green Dragon

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:02.390 align:middle line:84%
Society, he was able to
predict enemy attacks-- timing,

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:03.750 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And even though the
Germans lost that war,

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:10.260 align:middle line:84%
he came out of it a
hero and well respected.

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And then comes Hitler.

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:14.920 align:middle line:90%
And he's part Jewish.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.290 align:middle line:90%
He's half Jewish himself.

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: No, he
wasn't half Jewish.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.080 align:middle line:90%
His wife was Jewish.

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.496 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: His wife
was Jewish, OK.

00:19:19.496 --> 00:19:20.320 align:middle line:90%
I thought he was.

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:20.620 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:21.190 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: He wasn't Jewish.

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:22.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: His wife was.

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:26.242 align:middle line:84%
And so that must have been,
obviously, as time went on,

00:19:26.242 --> 00:19:28.700 align:middle line:84%
difficult for both of them to
be in the position he was in.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:29.090 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Not really.

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:31.690 align:middle line:84%
Hitler made exceptions in
many cases where he could,

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:32.824 align:middle line:90%
where it was--

00:19:32.824 --> 00:19:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, he did.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.520 align:middle line:84%
But still,
psychologically that had

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.070 align:middle line:90%
to be a little bit difficult.

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Might have been, yeah.

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:39.060 align:middle line:90%
It might have been, yeah.

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:40.580 align:middle line:90%
But in any case, he knew a lot.

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And what the point
I made in my book

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:46.910 align:middle line:84%
was that he was sent back to
Germany because the Japanese,

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:49.740 align:middle line:84%
especially the Green
Dragons, wanted an alliance

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:53.560 align:middle line:84%
with Germany, because their
ultimate goal was the conquest

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:56.350 align:middle line:90%
of the Russian land mass.

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And coming at it
from both directions,

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:04.660 align:middle line:84%
they thought it would be
a certainty of success.

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:09.260 align:middle line:84%
So they really hoped that he
would find a leader in Germany

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:11.350 align:middle line:84%
that could bring in
a fascist regime,

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:13.940 align:middle line:84%
just as they were fascist
already because the emperor was

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.200 align:middle line:90%
the head of it.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And together they could
conquer the Eurasian land

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:20.090 align:middle line:90%
mass and Russia.

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:21.170 align:middle line:90%
Russia was the goal.

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:23.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But he
was also credited

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:26.865 align:middle line:84%
with convincing Hitler that
the Aryans were a master race.

00:20:26.865 --> 00:20:27.490 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yeah.

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:29.290 align:middle line:90%
He was the geopolitics.

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:30.577 align:middle line:90%
That was his subject.

00:20:30.577 --> 00:20:32.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now,
did this have to do

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.540 align:middle line:84%
with some innate knowledge,
some esoteric knowledge,

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:38.080 align:middle line:90%
some viewing into the future?

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.080 align:middle line:90%
Where did he come to that?

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.350 align:middle line:90%
Why did he come to that?

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.930 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Some of
that information

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:43.930 align:middle line:84%
may have been given to
him by the Green Dragons.

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:47.350 align:middle line:10%
But I believe that it
was he had studied it.

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:50.960 align:middle line:10%
In his studies, he had come up
with a lot of these theories.

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And he did have a degree, an
advanced degree in geopolitics.

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And he helped Hitler
write "Mein Kampf,"

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:03.940 align:middle line:84%
especially those portions that
had to do with geopolitics.

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:06.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And supposedly
the information

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:08.890 align:middle line:84%
about the Aryan
race was something

00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:13.370 align:middle line:84%
that was passed through
from Atlantean times.

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: That was going
around in Berlin and in Munich

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.890 align:middle line:90%
and in Vienna in those days.

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:20.260 align:middle line:84%
There were books and
magazines and papers about it.

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So he was
affected by that.

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:23.388 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Yeah, he was
affected by it, exactly.

00:21:23.388 --> 00:21:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:27.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, at the time,
there were craft.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:30.950 align:middle line:84%
There was high technology,
right, at this point in time.

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:34.490 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking-- this time
is still, as I understand it,

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:35.660 align:middle line:90%
pre-Roswell.

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:36.430 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Oh, yes.

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:37.450 align:middle line:90%
We're talking the 1920s.

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:38.116 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:38.116 --> 00:21:42.650 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Haushofer organized
trips to Tibet for the Nazis.

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:43.960 align:middle line:90%
And together they went there.

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:50.014 align:middle line:84%
And my belief and my
theory is that when

00:21:50.014 --> 00:21:51.680 align:middle line:84%
they went on those
trips, they linked up

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.920 align:middle line:90%
with the Green Dragons.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.660 align:middle line:84%
The Green Dragons
in turn were linked

00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:02.520 align:middle line:84%
with an underground
civilization that we might call

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:06.600 align:middle line:90%
the home of the Reptilians.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:10.380 align:middle line:84%
It was a large
underground territory

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:16.250 align:middle line:84%
stretching from Lake
Manasarovar in Tibet

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:19.030 align:middle line:90%
all the way to Banaras, India.

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And they called this
snake world popularly.

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:22.750 align:middle line:90%
The Indians did.

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:24.800 align:middle line:90%
People in India did.

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:26.870 align:middle line:84%
The home of the
Nagas, N-A-G-A-S.

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:28.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:30.340 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And that's
because it was

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:34.930 align:middle line:84%
populated by the Reptilians, who
were an extraterrestrial group.

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:37.532 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:22:37.532 --> 00:22:39.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The Green Dragons
were working hand in hand

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:41.317 align:middle line:90%
with them to develop technology.

00:22:41.317 --> 00:22:41.900 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yes.

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And the Green Dragons in turn
were working hand in hand

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:48.050 align:middle line:84%
with another group
called the Green Men.

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:49.970 align:middle line:84%
The Green Men were
really the esotericists.

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:51.520 align:middle line:90%
They had all the information.

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:54.890 align:middle line:84%
They were really the ones
connected with the Reptilians.

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And certain people have
testified to the fact

00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:00.700 align:middle line:84%
that wingless vehicles
were seen flying

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:03.500 align:middle line:84%
in and out of that
area of Tibet,

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:08.150 align:middle line:84%
because that's where the
Reptilians' home base was.

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:11.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there
was reportedly a--

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:15.120 align:middle line:84%
in essence a suicide
mission, joint mission

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.799 align:middle line:84%
between the Japanese
and the German.

00:23:16.799 --> 00:23:17.340 align:middle line:90%
This is pre--

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:18.674 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: That wasn't till 1946.

00:23:18.674 --> 00:23:20.048 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I'm saying.

00:23:20.048 --> 00:23:21.530 align:middle line:84%
Later on, this
happened, as well.

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:23.650 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that period of time.

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:26.220 align:middle line:84%
What kind of craft were
developed during that time

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:28.386 align:middle line:90%
and witnessed up to 1946?

00:23:28.386 --> 00:23:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: I just want
to make the point

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:35.080 align:middle line:84%
that the anti-gravity technology
came from the Reptilians.

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And Hitler executed a
pact with the Reptilians

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:44.170 align:middle line:84%
in 1933, through the
mediation of Haushofer,

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:46.730 align:middle line:90%
because he had the connections.

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:47.270 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:48.395 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To the Green Men.

00:23:48.395 --> 00:23:50.230 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: --it was
because of that pact

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:53.260 align:middle line:84%
that that technology started
to flow into Germany.

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:56.840 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, the Green
Men sent a contingent to Berlin

00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:00.435 align:middle line:84%
to work with the Nazi
scientists on those craft

00:24:00.435 --> 00:24:01.895 align:middle line:90%
and on anti-gravity technology.

00:24:01.895 --> 00:24:04.550 align:middle line:90%


00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:07.102 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they came
to develop the Haunebu.

00:24:07.102 --> 00:24:08.560 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't something
that originated

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:09.966 align:middle line:90%
with the German scientists.

00:24:09.966 --> 00:24:11.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
I'm bringing this up

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:14.150 align:middle line:84%
because that's what's always
been commonly thought,

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:16.050 align:middle line:84%
is that somehow they
had a downed craft.

00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:17.370 align:middle line:90%
They reverse engineered it.

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:18.971 align:middle line:84%
But this was pretty
sophisticated.

00:24:18.971 --> 00:24:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Well, one downed
craft, I don't think,

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:22.060 align:middle line:90%
would have done the trick.

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:22.930 align:middle line:90%
I read that.

00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:24.240 align:middle line:90%
That was the case.

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:27.060 align:middle line:84%
I think the science,
what they call,

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:29.970 align:middle line:84%
of the wonder weapons,
the German wonder weapons,

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:33.360 align:middle line:84%
were all given to them
by the Reptilians.

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And thus this
plethora of well-versed rocket

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:42.160 align:middle line:84%
scientists that
came out of Germany?

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Well, the
Reptilians didn't use rockets.

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:45.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:48.090 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: They were way
beyond rocket technology.

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:49.950 align:middle line:84%
They were talking about
anti-gravity discs

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:52.099 align:middle line:84%
and interplanetary
vehicles which they had.

00:24:52.099 --> 00:24:52.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.240 align:middle line:84%
This is slightly off
topic but maybe not.

00:24:55.240 --> 00:25:00.200 align:middle line:10%
Then during Project Paperclip,
when essentially the US

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:04.760 align:middle line:10%
took a lot of the top
scientists and such from Germany

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:08.380 align:middle line:10%
at the end of World War II--
people like Wernher von Braun,

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:11.466 align:middle line:10%
for example-- he
must have been aware

00:25:11.466 --> 00:25:13.465 align:middle line:10%
of the Green Men and these
various technologies.

00:25:13.465 --> 00:25:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: I think he was, yeah.

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:14.710 align:middle line:90%
I think he was.

00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:17.334 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about the others in
Paperclip, but I think he was.

00:25:17.334 --> 00:25:18.320 align:middle line:90%
And maybe Rudolph.

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:19.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because he's called
the godfather of rocket

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:20.280 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.405 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: He is the godfather
of rocket technology.

00:25:22.405 --> 00:25:24.060 align:middle line:90%
But he may have known about it.

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:27.664 align:middle line:84%
But it was Oberth
who really knew it.

00:25:27.664 --> 00:25:29.330 align:middle line:10%
And he's the one that
made the statement

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:31.890 align:middle line:10%
that we have been helped by
people from other worlds.

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:34.530 align:middle line:10%
He made that statement
in our technology.

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:40.282 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, I mean, of
course when you're doing deals

00:25:40.282 --> 00:25:41.990 align:middle line:84%
through the Green Men
with the Reptilians

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:43.406 align:middle line:84%
and all, you always
have to wonder

00:25:43.406 --> 00:25:46.760 align:middle line:90%
what the trade-offs are there.

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:49.400 align:middle line:84%
Was it indicated--
if they were giving

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:53.840 align:middle line:84%
the Germans and the Japanese
this very sophisticated

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:56.820 align:middle line:84%
anti-gravitational
propulsion, what were they

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:57.570 align:middle line:90%
getting in return?

00:25:57.570 --> 00:26:00.210 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Well, you
had fascism in Japan.

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:02.774 align:middle line:90%
Now you have fascism in Germany.

00:26:02.774 --> 00:26:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And now we have
an alliance called

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:08.230 align:middle line:84%
the Axis, which is the
alliance of the fascist powers,

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:11.770 align:middle line:84%
including Mussolini
and including Spain.

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:17.630 align:middle line:84%
It was an overt attempt
by fascist alliance

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:19.964 align:middle line:90%
to take over the planet.

00:26:19.964 --> 00:26:21.630 align:middle line:84%
They thought they had
it all worked out.

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:23.830 align:middle line:84%
They had the Japanese,
who were now controlled

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:25.690 align:middle line:90%
the seas with their navy.

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:28.250 align:middle line:84%
Now they had Hitler with
the blitzkrieg capability

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:30.542 align:middle line:84%
and his weapons, and the
krupp armaments, and so forth.

00:26:30.542 --> 00:26:32.291 align:middle line:84%
They thought they had
put it all together.

00:26:32.291 --> 00:26:34.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this would
innately give the Reptilians

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:36.290 align:middle line:90%
some clout around the place.

00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: The Reptilians
wanted to see,

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:41.890 align:middle line:84%
in my belief, a fascist
takeover of the planet.

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:43.820 align:middle line:90%
And we came very close to that.

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And if that had
happened, you and I

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:46.976 align:middle line:90%
would not be sitting here today.

00:26:46.976 --> 00:26:48.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, probably not.

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:49.070 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:52.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, OK, so that's
the background.

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And I want to get up
to that mission to Mars

00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:00.764 align:middle line:84%
because it starts timing out
with another telling event

00:27:00.764 --> 00:27:01.680 align:middle line:90%
during that same year.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.890 align:middle line:84%
So in the book it was termed
as almost a suicide mission

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:08.100 align:middle line:84%
to Mars, between
the jet that was

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:11.150 align:middle line:84%
manned by the Japanese
and the Germans.

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:12.710 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk a little
bit about that?

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:14.080 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yeah.

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:18.720 align:middle line:84%
According to Vladimir
Terziski, where

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.915 align:middle line:84%
I got my information
from, is a very smart guy,

00:27:20.915 --> 00:27:23.800 align:middle line:90%
Hungarian researcher.

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:24.734 align:middle line:90%
Speaks five languages.

00:27:24.734 --> 00:27:26.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How do
we spell his name

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:27.690 align:middle line:90%
if anyone wants to do a search?

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:29.860 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Terziski,
T-E-R-Z-I-S-K-I.

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:31.344 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:27:31.344 --> 00:27:33.260 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: I think his
first name was Vladimir.

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:33.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:35.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.700 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: That
mission-- by the time

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:40.590 align:middle line:84%
the war was over, the
Nazis had developed

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:43.760 align:middle line:84%
a very large anti-gravity
craft, a dreadnought.

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.210 align:middle line:90%
It was 200 feet in diameter.

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:48.670 align:middle line:90%


00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:51.580 align:middle line:84%
All of that technology
was taken to Antarctica

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:54.050 align:middle line:90%
as the war came to a close.

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:57.840 align:middle line:84%
It was all kept under
wraps by the SS.

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:01.020 align:middle line:84%
It was all under the
control of the SS.

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:03.140 align:middle line:84%
The Wehrmacht and
the German army

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:05.390 align:middle line:84%
were not even involved
with this development.

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:06.900 align:middle line:90%
It was all strictly Himmler.

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:10.330 align:middle line:90%


00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:12.320 align:middle line:84%
They developed
the Haunebu craft.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:15.650 align:middle line:84%
But the Haunebu craft were not
able to get involved in dog

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:17.530 align:middle line:90%
fights with Allied aircraft.

00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:19.479 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't
mount guns on them.

00:28:19.479 --> 00:28:21.062 align:middle line:84%
And once they did
mount a gun on them,

00:28:21.062 --> 00:28:23.830 align:middle line:84%
it changed the whole
dynamic of how they work.

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:25.470 align:middle line:90%
So they couldn't use them.

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:29.760 align:middle line:84%
But they did have a
rocket plane, a jet plane.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.710 align:middle line:90%
Did develop that.

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:34.810 align:middle line:84%
So as the war came
down to a close,

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:37.170 align:middle line:84%
they took all that
technology to Antarctica,

00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:41.070 align:middle line:84%
where they had created an
underground-- an under-ice base

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:42.300 align:middle line:90%
in Antarctica.

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:43.640 align:middle line:90%
And that's where it all went.

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, we
read novels about that.

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:47.320 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yeah.

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:48.631 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:48.631 --> 00:28:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this was
the real prize of Hitler,

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:53.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that he was--
this was something.

00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:56.130 align:middle line:84%
When did he set that in
motion, that original project

00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:56.710 align:middle line:90%
in motion?

00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:56.940 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: 1938.

00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:57.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 1938, OK.

00:28:57.790 --> 00:28:59.290 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: So they
started building--

00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:02.090 align:middle line:84%
realizing they started
building that Antarctic

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:05.125 align:middle line:84%
base before World
War II even started.

00:29:05.125 --> 00:29:05.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:08.120 align:middle line:84%
See, one of the novels
said that Hitler actually

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:11.709 align:middle line:84%
went to Antarctica,
rather than being killed,

00:29:11.709 --> 00:29:13.000 align:middle line:90%
or rather than killing himself.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.070 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Hitler
did-- I really believe

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:17.326 align:middle line:90%
Hitler did escape from Germany.

00:29:17.326 --> 00:29:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what one of
the books I read said, yeah.

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:20.840 align:middle line:10%
>>KASTEN: Yeah, and there's
a new book out right

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:23.310 align:middle line:10%
now called "Hitler in
Argentina" by somebody

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:27.130 align:middle line:10%
named Henry Cooper that
covers this in great detail.

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:29.320 align:middle line:84%
And Cooper has much
evidence that Hitler

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:34.410 align:middle line:84%
lived in Argentina at least
until 1955, maybe beyond.

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:35.952 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: "Hitler
in Argentina" by--

00:29:35.952 --> 00:29:36.660 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Cooper.

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:38.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Cooper.

00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:39.800 align:middle line:84%
You're sending people
on a lot of searches

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.445 align:middle line:84%
while they're watching
this, you know.

00:29:41.445 --> 00:29:42.153 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: I know.

00:29:42.153 --> 00:29:43.260 align:middle line:90%
I know, yeah.

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:47.720 align:middle line:84%
That's a-- that book was just
released about six months ago.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:48.441 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:29:48.441 --> 00:29:48.940 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:53.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, Haushofer and his
wife killed themselves.

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:55.260 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: They killed
themselves when

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:57.280 align:middle line:90%
they realized Germany had lost.

00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.680 align:middle line:90%
And they were Green Dragons.

00:29:58.680 --> 00:29:59.860 align:middle line:90%
They were not really German.

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And what a proper Green Dragon
does when they fail, is they--

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:03.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Suicide.

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:06.390 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: --slit their
stomach and hari-kari.

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:08.210 align:middle line:84%
He didn't do that;
they just took poison.

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:10.490 align:middle line:84%
But his wife also hanged
herself just to make sure she

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:11.790 align:middle line:90%
would die.

00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And they did that in 1946
after they had already

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:20.500 align:middle line:84%
been absolved of any guilt
by the Nuremberg tribunal.

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:22.751 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it was a matter
of Green Dragon protocol.

00:30:22.751 --> 00:30:24.833 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: They had nothing
to worry about anymore.

00:30:24.833 --> 00:30:25.852 align:middle line:90%
Nothing to worry about.

00:30:25.852 --> 00:30:27.060 align:middle line:90%
Why did they kill themselves?

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:28.220 align:middle line:90%
Because they had failed.

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:29.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
they had failed.

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:30.800 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: They
picked the wrong man.

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:34.880 align:middle line:90%
OK, now this story.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:39.230 align:middle line:84%
So Antarctica, here we
have an underground base.

00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And it was populated
with how many personnel?

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:44.150 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Thousands.

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:47.266 align:middle line:84%
The so-called lost
army, 250,000--

00:30:47.266 --> 00:30:48.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Lost ships.

00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:49.110 align:middle line:90%
Lost a lot of stuff.

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:50.940 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Soldiers
that never showed up.

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:56.310 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it was created
as a scientific base.

00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:57.950 align:middle line:84%
Hitler-- it was
never anticipated

00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:00.000 align:middle line:84%
that any segment of
the German population

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.220 align:middle line:90%
would go to live there.

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:04.890 align:middle line:84%
They only wanted the purest
Aryan people to live there

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:06.554 align:middle line:90%
and to breed a new race.

00:31:06.554 --> 00:31:08.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there were
about 40,000 of them.

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:09.040 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:09.990 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: There
were at that time.

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:10.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:11.815 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: At the time
was a city called

00:31:11.815 --> 00:31:13.910 align:middle line:90%
New Berlin under the ice.

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And it was from
that scientific base

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:22.740 align:middle line:84%
that they launched the
suicide mission to Mars.

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:27.584 align:middle line:84%
Because by 1946, Hitler
supposedly was already dead.

00:31:27.584 --> 00:31:28.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, supposedly.

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:32.030 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And
Germany was in ruins.

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why would they have
launched a suicide mission

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:34.970 align:middle line:90%
to Mars?

00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:37.300 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: It wasn't meant
to be a suicide mission,

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:39.660 align:middle line:90%
but it turned out that way.

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:44.800 align:middle line:84%
The men who were involved
in that mission-- which

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:49.166 align:middle line:84%
was a combined German,
Japanese crew, about 200-- it

00:31:49.166 --> 00:31:51.112 align:middle line:90%
was in a huge rocket.

00:31:51.112 --> 00:31:52.570 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't call
it a rocket ship.

00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:54.428 align:middle line:90%
It was a UFO type of craft.

00:31:54.428 --> 00:31:57.570 align:middle line:90%


00:31:57.570 --> 00:31:59.719 align:middle line:84%
They thought they
could come back.

00:31:59.719 --> 00:32:00.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:02.040 align:middle line:84%
So they were hopeful that
they were going to make this--

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:02.699 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yes.

00:32:02.699 --> 00:32:03.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, round trip.

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:05.448 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: But when
they-- they crashed on

00:32:05.448 --> 00:32:07.750 align:middle line:90%
Mars, and they couldn't return.

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:10.790 align:middle line:84%
But they knew that possibility
was a strong possibility,

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:13.010 align:middle line:90%
that it was a suicide mission.

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, if Haushofer
was remote viewing,

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:20.830 align:middle line:84%
and these various elite members
of the Japanese military

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:23.150 align:middle line:84%
were able to also remote
view, and remote view

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:26.790 align:middle line:84%
into the future, what had
they already seen, perhaps,

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:30.134 align:middle line:90%
on Mars by this time?

00:32:30.134 --> 00:32:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Well, you
know that Hitler was

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.050 align:middle line:90%
connected with the Reptilians.

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:35.199 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:35.199 --> 00:32:36.990 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Clearly the
Reptilians had a base

00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:40.180 align:middle line:90%
under-- in Antarctica, also.

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the Nazis
decided to put it there,

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:46.400 align:middle line:84%
adjacent to the Reptilian
base, because they were now

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:47.750 align:middle line:90%
buddies, friends.

00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:50.570 align:middle line:90%
And they were space scientists.

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:52.650 align:middle line:84%
Hitler's main
interest at that point

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:56.450 align:middle line:84%
was space exploration
and conquest.

00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:58.367 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because the
Earth wasn't big enough.

00:32:58.367 --> 00:33:00.450 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Well, the
Reptilians were into conquest.

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:01.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:02.530 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Not just
here, everywhere.

00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:03.488 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, gotcha.

00:33:03.488 --> 00:33:06.410 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And Hitler
bought into that,

00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:10.900 align:middle line:84%
figuring not only would
he conquer the planet,

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:15.632 align:middle line:84%
but that he had visions of
conquering other planets along

00:33:15.632 --> 00:33:16.340 align:middle line:90%
with his friends.

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:17.923 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So did
they think they maybe

00:33:17.923 --> 00:33:19.850 align:middle line:90%
had a shot at colonizing Mars?

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:20.760 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yes.

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:23.532 align:middle line:84%
And von Braun wrote about
Mars, "The Mars Project,"

00:33:23.532 --> 00:33:24.490 align:middle line:90%
very early in the game.

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:27.520 align:middle line:84%
He wrote it in 1952, a book
called "The Mars Project."

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:29.046 align:middle line:90%
And he had it all laid out.

00:33:29.046 --> 00:33:30.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I guess
what I'm asking

00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:35.000 align:middle line:84%
beyond that is had
anybody remote viewed it

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.240 align:middle line:84%
as to the potential that
it was already occupied,

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:40.785 align:middle line:84%
or had already been colonized,
or had its own inhabitants.

00:33:40.785 --> 00:33:42.295 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: By the Germans?

00:33:42.295 --> 00:33:42.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.352 align:middle line:90%
Germans or Japanese?

00:33:44.352 --> 00:33:45.310 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: I'm not sure.

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:47.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did they think it was
virgin territory at that time?

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:48.834 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: I think they did.

00:33:48.834 --> 00:33:49.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: They thought
that it had been destroyed.

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:56.770 align:middle line:84%
Civilization on Mars
had been destroyed.

00:33:56.770 --> 00:34:00.700 align:middle line:84%
Where in actuality,
there was a very large

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:03.330 align:middle line:84%
underground population
on Mars already.

00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:04.305 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:04.305 --> 00:34:05.680 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm
trying to get to.

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:06.390 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yes.

00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:11.823 align:middle line:84%
And they were populated mainly
by Martians but also by humans.

00:34:11.823 --> 00:34:12.739 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Humans, yes.

00:34:12.739 --> 00:34:12.989 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yeah.

00:34:12.989 --> 00:34:13.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:14.060 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:15.469 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to get that
part out in the clear.

00:34:15.469 --> 00:34:15.980 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Yeah, Bob
Dean said there's

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:17.400 align:middle line:90%
a city the size of Chicago.

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I was
at one of his talks.

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:20.280 align:middle line:90%
He was showing some of the--

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:20.946 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Right.

00:34:20.946 --> 00:34:21.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:22.100 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:25.767 align:middle line:84%
Now, there were people missing--
40,000 people, maybe more.

00:34:25.767 --> 00:34:26.350 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:28.770 align:middle line:84%
But roughly 40,000 people
missing because they

00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:30.460 align:middle line:90%
were in New Berlin.

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:32.880 align:middle line:84%
There were also U-boats
missing from Germany.

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:33.963 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yes, there were.

00:34:33.963 --> 00:34:35.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As I have
here, 54 U-boats missing

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:36.944 align:middle line:90%
during that period of time.

00:34:36.944 --> 00:34:38.187 align:middle line:90%
That's significant.

00:34:38.187 --> 00:34:38.770 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yes.

00:34:38.770 --> 00:34:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And they were the
new variety, the kind

00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:44.940 align:middle line:84%
that could travel underwater for
the entire trip from Germany.

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:49.040 align:middle line:84%
So they wouldn't be
found out or recognized

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:51.129 align:middle line:90%
by any of our Allied convoys.

00:34:51.129 --> 00:34:52.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And these
were-- let's see.

00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:57.010 align:middle line:84%
Where does Viktor Schauberger
come into the story?

00:34:57.010 --> 00:35:00.280 align:middle line:10%
>>KASTEN: Schauberger
was one of the scientists

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:02.364 align:middle line:10%
in Germany involved in
anti-gravity research

00:35:02.364 --> 00:35:03.030 align:middle line:10%
and development.

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And they actually helped develop
the flying saucers in Germany.

00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:12.060 align:middle line:84%
So he was a very important
person, and we knew it.

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:13.950 align:middle line:90%
We had identified him already.

00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:17.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he was--
supposedly had been using

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:20.460 align:middle line:84%
concentration camps to do
some of the building of the--

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: He used inmates from
the Mauthausen concentration

00:35:23.410 --> 00:35:26.440 align:middle line:84%
camp, who were really slave
laborers, who were worked

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:29.780 align:middle line:90%
to death, and beaten, starved.

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:32.520 align:middle line:84%
But there were a lot of
very intelligent scientists

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:33.980 align:middle line:90%
in those ranks, as well.

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:39.267 align:middle line:84%
And Schauberger took advantage
of that and used them.

00:35:39.267 --> 00:35:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about retrieved--

00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:42.308 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And by
the way, von Braun

00:35:42.308 --> 00:35:45.940 align:middle line:84%
knew about that too, about those
that were using concentration

00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:47.500 align:middle line:90%
camp inmates.

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:49.940 align:middle line:90%
He knew that at Peenemunde.

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:51.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
retrieved craft.

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:53.680 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about--
everyone knows of Roswell.

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:56.540 align:middle line:84%
But also preceding
Roswell was Sirocco.

00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:58.720 align:middle line:84%
Then San Diego,
1941, that's not one

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:00.920 align:middle line:90%
that most people have heard of.

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: The
crash in San Diego?

00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:02.540 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:03.260 align:middle line:90%
1941.

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:04.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that was the first one.

00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:05.340 align:middle line:90%
That was before Roswell, right?

00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:05.923 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:05.923 --> 00:36:08.380 align:middle line:90%


00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:10.410 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: The Navy
recovered that craft.

00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:12.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't have very much
information about it,

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:14.634 align:middle line:90%
but I do know that was the year.

00:36:14.634 --> 00:36:16.050 align:middle line:84%
That was six years
before Roswell.

00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:16.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Six years before.

00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:18.640 align:middle line:84%
And then there was
Sirocco, New Mexico,

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:20.610 align:middle line:84%
which was a couple
months before Roswell.

00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And I've already brought
up Lieutenant Corso.

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:27.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're leading
directly up to 1947 now.

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And then let's talk about what
was happening politically.

00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:36.260 align:middle line:84%
1981, President Reagan was
briefed regarding the extent

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:39.120 align:middle line:90%
of ET military contact.

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.217 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:36:40.217 --> 00:36:40.800 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yes.

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.132 align:middle line:90%
Yes, he was briefed on that.

00:36:42.132 --> 00:36:44.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, by the CIA.

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:49.087 align:middle line:84%
But Corso didn't come into
the picture until 1962.

00:36:49.087 --> 00:36:49.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, '62.

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:51.670 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Around the
same time as Kennedy.

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:52.955 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:36:52.955 --> 00:36:53.830 align:middle line:90%
Well, you know, yeah.

00:36:53.830 --> 00:36:55.705 align:middle line:84%
Let's backtrack a bit
for people who have not

00:36:55.705 --> 00:36:56.930 align:middle line:90%
read "Day After Roswell."

00:36:56.930 --> 00:36:59.200 align:middle line:84%
And let's just talk about
what he was delivered,

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:02.390 align:middle line:84%
and what came out of it, and
how the stuff was basically

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:04.760 align:middle line:84%
parted out to
independent contractors,

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.370 align:middle line:84%
military contractors
and private.

00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:07.870 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Before
we do that, let's

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:09.350 align:middle line:90%
talk about the Kingman event.

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:09.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:11.420 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Because I've
devoted a chapter.

00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:11.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:12.250 align:middle line:90%
Let's do.

00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:14.700 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: I've devoted a
chapter in my book to Kingman.

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:18.290 align:middle line:84%
The alien craft that
crashed at Kingman

00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:20.590 align:middle line:90%
had four live aliens in it.

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:24.220 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't really a
crash, it was a landing.

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was our
military realized after Roswell

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:32.820 align:middle line:84%
that that small aircraft
that crashed at Roswell

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:38.010 align:middle line:84%
could not have traveled
on an interstellar basis

00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:40.340 align:middle line:90%
from 39 lightyears away.

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:41.440 align:middle line:90%
It was too small.

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:43.300 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, they
concluded there must have

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:46.600 align:middle line:90%
been a mother ship in orbit.

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And they contacted
that mother ship.

00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And since they now were able
to communicate with the aliens'

00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:57.379 align:middle line:90%
home planet and in English.

00:37:57.379 --> 00:37:58.920 align:middle line:84%
They were using
English at that time.

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.740 align:middle line:84%
The aliens had learned to
speak English is what happened.

00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:02.156 align:middle line:84%
We could not learn
their language.

00:38:02.156 --> 00:38:04.700 align:middle line:90%
It was too difficult.

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:09.950 align:middle line:84%
They said to them, just
send down another one.

00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:11.440 align:middle line:90%
And they did do that.

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's the one that
landed in Kingman with four

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:17.010 align:middle line:90%
aliens, four Ebens, aboard.

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:19.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there
they met with--

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:24.210 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: There the military
took the craft on a tanker,

00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:29.420 align:middle line:84%
on a trailer that carried
tanks, to the Nevada test site.

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And the four aliens
went to Los Alamos.

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And while they
were at Los Alamos

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:39.040 align:middle line:84%
and we were tinkering with
the craft at Nevada test site,

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:41.360 align:middle line:84%
they realized they couldn't
make any progress with it--

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.310 align:middle line:84%
with back engineering
it, unless they

00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:45.380 align:middle line:90%
had the aliens to work with.

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:48.660 align:middle line:84%
So finally they said,
OK, bring them over.

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:50.660 align:middle line:84%
They knew they couldn't
communicate by language,

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:52.790 align:middle line:84%
but they figured
they could work it.

00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, that
made the difference.

00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:59.990 align:middle line:84%
The aliens started to
cooperate with our scientists.

00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:05.010 align:middle line:84%
Von Neumann was involved
at that point, also,

00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:10.710 align:middle line:84%
and we started to back
engineer the alien craft.

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:15.890 align:middle line:10%
And Bill Uhouse was one of the
engineers assigned to that.

00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:20.120 align:middle line:10%
I have a whole sequence
in my book about Bill.

00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:22.285 align:middle line:84%
His job was to
build a simulator so

00:39:22.285 --> 00:39:25.100 align:middle line:84%
that we could train
our pilots to work

00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:29.040 align:middle line:90%
with the back-engineered craft.

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:33.220 align:middle line:84%
That started in 1953, the year
after the alien from Roswell

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:34.480 align:middle line:90%
had died.

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:36.080 align:middle line:90%
He died in '52.

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:38.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about
the Kingman aliens?

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:43.360 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: The Kingman crash
was in 1953, the next year.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:45.445 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how
long did they live?

00:39:45.445 --> 00:39:47.570 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: As far as I know,
they lived a long time.

00:39:47.570 --> 00:39:49.770 align:middle line:84%
They were kept
there at Los Alamos,

00:39:49.770 --> 00:39:51.590 align:middle line:90%
and they were taken care of.

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:54.770 align:middle line:84%
By that time, we had a lot
of experience with them.

00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:59.109 align:middle line:84%
So we developed
anti-gravity technology

00:39:59.109 --> 00:40:00.150 align:middle line:90%
in that nine-year period.

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And by the time of Kennedy's
coming into office,

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:05.070 align:middle line:84%
we already have working craft,
according to Bill Uhouse.

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:08.350 align:middle line:84%
Bill Uhouse said we had them
working and traveling-- he felt

00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:12.670 align:middle line:90%
already traveling out in space.

00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:13.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:15.590 align:middle line:84%
Not just sightings
around planet Earth.

00:40:15.590 --> 00:40:17.300 align:middle line:84%
They were capable of
far more than that.

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:17.424 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: No.

00:40:17.424 --> 00:40:19.320 align:middle line:84%
They were actually
traveling into space.

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
the other technologies

00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:24.340 align:middle line:84%
were back-engineered more
for commercial purposes

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:27.580 align:middle line:84%
and military purposes, according
to Philip Corso's book.

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:30.840 align:middle line:10%
And he wasn't the only
person that received packets

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:33.809 align:middle line:10%
of these strange artifacts.

00:40:33.809 --> 00:40:36.350 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Well, Corso got in
the picture around the same time

00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:38.130 align:middle line:90%
as Kennedy, around 1962.

00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Trudeau had a file cabinet
full of small things

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.410 align:middle line:84%
that they had recovered
at the Roswell crash.

00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And he told Corso to take all
of this equipment, and seed

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:55.940 align:middle line:84%
various industries, and see
what we could make out of it.

00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:56.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A lot.

00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: That's how
the transist-- right.

00:40:57.650 --> 00:41:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going to say,
transistor radios, lasers.

00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:01.410 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Lasers.

00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:01.685 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Kevlar.

00:41:01.685 --> 00:41:02.320 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Night vision.

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:03.110 align:middle line:90%
All kinds of things.

00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:03.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All kinds of stuff.

00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.680 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Velcro, everything.

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:06.013 align:middle line:90%
A lot of stuff came out of that.

00:41:06.013 --> 00:41:06.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:07.610 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty cool.

00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:09.460 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: But that
didn't start till 1962.

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:13.280 align:middle line:84%
By that time, we had already
back engineered the alien craft

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:14.500 align:middle line:90%
at the Nevada test site.

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:16.420 align:middle line:90%
We had that working.

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:19.217 align:middle line:84%
So Corso was not privy
to that information,

00:41:19.217 --> 00:41:21.550 align:middle line:84%
because he didn't have a
clearance that was high enough.

00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:21.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:22.150 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: So he
didn't know about it.

00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:24.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I mean, everything
is so compartmentalised.

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:25.130 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Right.

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He had
his, as you say,

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:28.150 align:middle line:90%
filing cabinet full of stuff.

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.880 align:middle line:90%
He had to figure out--

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:28.930 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: That was his job.

00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:30.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --Bell Labs
or Rockwell, whoever

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:31.840 align:middle line:90%
he had to get it out to.

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:34.810 align:middle line:84%
He just got it out to the people
most appropriate to develop it.

00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:37.060 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And that speeded
up the computer development

00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:39.020 align:middle line:90%
tremendously, the transistor.

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:39.629 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:39.629 --> 00:41:40.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:41:40.170 --> 00:41:42.600 align:middle line:84%
Now let's move it
forward a little bit

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:44.965 align:middle line:84%
toward the '80s and
Ronald Reagan and Ronald

00:41:44.965 --> 00:41:45.840 align:middle line:90%
Reagan being briefed.

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:47.990 align:middle line:84%
I read the briefing
in your book.

00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, whoa, not a
lot in-depth searching there

00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:54.377 align:middle line:90%
on the part of the president.

00:41:54.377 --> 00:41:56.460 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Well, he was
technologically challenged,

00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:56.750 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:57.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:57.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:58.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:58.120 --> 00:41:59.911 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: He would just
eat his jelly beans

00:41:59.911 --> 00:42:01.850 align:middle line:84%
and listen to what
they were telling him.

00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:03.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What a
shame that that's

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.970 align:middle line:84%
the sitting president
when all of this

00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:07.080 align:middle line:84%
was happening-- not that
presidents have much

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:08.960 align:middle line:84%
to do with anything,
anyway, as we know.

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:13.480 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Well, by 1981, we had
already been to Serpo and back.

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:14.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And so he-- once he
was briefed, anyway,

00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:20.770 align:middle line:84%
was there ever a
point-- now this

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:23.430 align:middle line:84%
is in the '80s, where
we started understanding

00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:24.950 align:middle line:84%
that it was time
to start releasing

00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:26.840 align:middle line:84%
some of this information
to the public.

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:29.040 align:middle line:84%
Is that how Hollywood
became involved?

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:33.205 align:middle line:84%
Did they see that as the best
way to start conditioning us

00:42:33.205 --> 00:42:33.955 align:middle line:90%
as a civilization?

00:42:33.955 --> 00:42:34.860 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Yeah,
I think Hollywood

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:36.818 align:middle line:84%
was involved with that
from the very beginning,

00:42:36.818 --> 00:42:40.780 align:middle line:90%
from the '50s on.

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And after Spielberg
made "Close Encounters",

00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:44.640 align:middle line:84%
they realized he
was the perfect guy

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:48.000 align:middle line:84%
to use for the
acclimation from public--

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.220 align:middle line:84%
what they call the public
acclimation program because

00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:53.749 align:middle line:84%
of his movie-making
capabilities.

00:42:53.749 --> 00:42:54.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:58.180 align:middle line:90%
So by this time now, we're back.

00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:02.600 align:middle line:84%
We have craft that has been
to outer space and back.

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:04.270 align:middle line:90%
It's 1962.

00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:07.830 align:middle line:84%
We have a plethora
of high-tech devices

00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:09.220 align:middle line:90%
that are under development.

00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:11.480 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about the
nature of the relationship

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:15.690 align:middle line:84%
at that time between
the Ebens' home place

00:43:15.690 --> 00:43:17.940 align:middle line:90%
and what-- Los Alamos?

00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:20.360 align:middle line:90%
Dulce?

00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:21.410 align:middle line:90%
Where else?

00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:23.360 align:middle line:84%
What was happening with
this communication?

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:25.390 align:middle line:84%
What kind of deals
were being struck?

00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:27.348 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Well, the only
deals that were struck

00:43:27.348 --> 00:43:32.120 align:middle line:84%
were, that we agreed
to a exchange program.

00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And that was made before
Kennedy even came into office.

00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:41.220 align:middle line:84%
So once he came into office
in 1961, he was briefed on it

00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:45.189 align:middle line:84%
and asked, OK, the
whole exchange program,

00:43:45.189 --> 00:43:46.230 align:middle line:90%
which he did immediately.

00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:48.550 align:middle line:84%
Because the point
I made in my book

00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:52.200 align:middle line:84%
was that he wanted a
space triumph very badly

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:53.580 align:middle line:90%
after Sputnik.

00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:56.480 align:middle line:84%
He felt like we needed
to do something.

00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote a
letter to von Braun

00:43:58.050 --> 00:43:59.406 align:middle line:90%
asking him, what can we do?

00:43:59.406 --> 00:44:00.530 align:middle line:90%
How can we get to the moon?

00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:02.620 align:middle line:84%
What can-- can we create
a laboratory on the moon?

00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:04.610 align:middle line:90%
Anything.

00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:08.450 align:middle line:84%
Because the new frontier that
Kennedy talked about was space.

00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:10.290 align:middle line:90%
That was the new frontier.

00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And von Braun said yes, we can
get there and back by 1969.

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's when they went for it
big time, for the moon landing.

00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:24.120 align:middle line:84%
That's when Kennedy gave his
famous man on the moon speech

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:29.814 align:middle line:84%
to Congress, around that time
that von Braun had said OK.

00:44:29.814 --> 00:44:31.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet,
there was still

00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:38.450 align:middle line:84%
this ongoing feud, discord
between Kennedy and the CIA.

00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:39.150 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Right.

00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:41.409 align:middle line:84%
But Kennedy hadn't been
told about anything

00:44:41.409 --> 00:44:42.700 align:middle line:90%
but the Serpo exchange program.

00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:45.370 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know anything
about the nine years

00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:47.800 align:middle line:90%
that we had developed our own.

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:50.510 align:middle line:84%
All he knew was
that he was asked

00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:52.370 align:middle line:90%
to OK the exchange program.

00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And of course, he did,
even though he knew

00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:56.840 align:middle line:90%
he had to keep silent about it.

00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:58.697 align:middle line:84%
He could not release
it to the public.

00:44:58.697 --> 00:45:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it went
all the way to the top.

00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:01.630 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Right.

00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:04.980 align:middle line:84%
Yes, because MJ-12
made the rules then.

00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:07.830 align:middle line:90%
He didn't make the rules.

00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:10.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yet he had
created-- forgive me

00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:14.660 align:middle line:84%
for forgetting the name of it--
some kind of a space commission

00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:17.450 align:middle line:84%
or committee in the
government that his vice

00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:19.449 align:middle line:90%
president oversaw, right?

00:45:19.449 --> 00:45:21.990 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Yes, he made Johnson
the head of the space council.

00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:23.510 align:middle line:90%
That's correct.

00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yet when
he was assassinated,

00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:30.569 align:middle line:84%
Johnson knew nothing
about the project.

00:45:30.569 --> 00:45:33.110 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk a little bit more
about what was going on there?

00:45:33.110 --> 00:45:36.070 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: I guess MJ-12 read
the riot act to Kennedy,

00:45:36.070 --> 00:45:38.880 align:middle line:84%
and said this is strictly
for your knowledge only.

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:40.490 align:middle line:90%
You're not to tell your cabinet.

00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:42.490 align:middle line:84%
You're not to tell
the vice president.

00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:44.740 align:middle line:90%
You're not to tell anyone.

00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:45.480 align:middle line:90%
Just you.

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:46.500 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:49.380 align:middle line:84%
So when Kennedy
died, Johnson had

00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:50.940 align:middle line:84%
to be briefed on
the whole program,

00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:53.840 align:middle line:90%
and he had to re-approve it.

00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:57.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what was
his position on all of it?

00:45:57.390 --> 00:45:59.460 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: He said, fine.

00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:01.490 align:middle line:84%
If they arrive-- if
they get here, fine.

00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:03.650 align:middle line:84%
He didn't believe
it would happen.

00:46:03.650 --> 00:46:06.130 align:middle line:84%
He didn't believe it would
happen, that the aliens would

00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:08.289 align:middle line:90%
actually land here.

00:46:08.289 --> 00:46:08.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:14.540 align:middle line:84%
So now we've arrived at a time--
what year did they actually

00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:18.080 align:middle line:84%
begin to assemble
the crew, start

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:19.750 align:middle line:90%
looking for people on the crew.

00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk
about what happens after that

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:23.740 align:middle line:90%
in our second conversation.

00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:26.540 align:middle line:84%
But maybe just lay
the groundwork for us

00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:29.090 align:middle line:84%
a little bit on how
they went about finding

00:46:29.090 --> 00:46:31.080 align:middle line:90%
the correct people.

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:33.560 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: When they started
Project Crystal Knight, which

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:36.087 align:middle line:84%
was its new name now,
Project Crystal Knight.

00:46:36.087 --> 00:46:37.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Was the Serpo project.

00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:38.907 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yeah.

00:46:38.907 --> 00:46:39.990 align:middle line:90%
Kennedy gave the go-ahead.

00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:41.200 align:middle line:90%
So they started.

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:46.610 align:middle line:84%
They put ads in military
journals asking for volunteers

00:46:46.610 --> 00:46:48.550 align:middle line:90%
for a very special program.

00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:50.670 align:middle line:90%
They didn't reveal the details.

00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:54.700 align:middle line:84%
They didn't even mention
that it was a moon program.

00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:57.910 align:middle line:90%
They got about 600 responses.

00:46:57.910 --> 00:47:00.120 align:middle line:84%
Because they wanted
an all-military team.

00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:02.620 align:middle line:84%
They didn't care what branch
of the military they came from,

00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:05.190 align:middle line:84%
but they wanted them to
have military discipline

00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:08.440 align:middle line:84%
in their background for
this kind of a project.

00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:11.530 align:middle line:90%


00:47:11.530 --> 00:47:18.580 align:middle line:84%
They ultimately selected 16
people-- 12 original people

00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:21.930 align:middle line:84%
and four alternates
who would be trained

00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:25.947 align:middle line:90%
alongside the team of 12.

00:47:25.947 --> 00:47:26.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:26.530 --> 00:47:29.641 align:middle line:84%
And they were not given
certainly much information

00:47:29.641 --> 00:47:30.140 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: They were not
told about the real mission

00:47:32.070 --> 00:47:33.360 align:middle line:90%
until late in their training.

00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:35.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's so unfair
when you look back at it.

00:47:35.970 --> 00:47:37.252 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: It's horrible.

00:47:37.252 --> 00:47:38.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But they did.

00:47:38.210 --> 00:47:39.300 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: As I said
in my book, they

00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:40.841 align:middle line:84%
must have been
shaking in their boots

00:47:40.841 --> 00:47:44.000 align:middle line:84%
when they were told they
were going to a planet

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.650 align:middle line:90%
39 lightyears away for 10 years.

00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:47.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you think?

00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:50.339 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: And then one of them
decided he didn't want to go.

00:47:50.339 --> 00:47:51.130 align:middle line:90%
He said, no thanks.

00:47:51.130 --> 00:47:53.004 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, we're
going to talk about that.

00:47:53.004 --> 00:47:55.710 align:middle line:84%
This wasn't a project you backed
away from and just walked back

00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:57.140 align:middle line:90%
to your suburban life.

00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:58.370 align:middle line:90%
It didn't work like that.

00:47:58.370 --> 00:47:59.330 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: No, sorry.

00:47:59.330 --> 00:48:02.692 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
Leavenworth for 10 years.

00:48:02.692 --> 00:48:03.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, no.

00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:04.560 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: That's what
happens if you don't go.

00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:05.351 align:middle line:90%
He said, all right.

00:48:05.351 --> 00:48:05.970 align:middle line:90%
I'll go.

00:48:05.970 --> 00:48:06.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:08.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:08.900 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:14.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, at this time the
Reptilians, the Green Men,

00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:17.850 align:middle line:84%
the Japanese-- the whole
project between the Reptilians,

00:48:17.850 --> 00:48:21.500 align:middle line:84%
the Green Men, Green Dragon
Society, Japanese, and Germans,

00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:25.444 align:middle line:84%
Hitler, all that, that's been--
maybe it's gone underground.

00:48:25.444 --> 00:48:27.110 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that would be
a good thing to say.

00:48:27.110 --> 00:48:29.140 align:middle line:90%
It's gone underground.

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:30.309 align:middle line:90%
That's not part of this.

00:48:30.309 --> 00:48:30.850 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: No.

00:48:30.850 --> 00:48:32.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, so
what kind of a deal

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:34.810 align:middle line:90%
were the Ebens trying to cut?

00:48:34.810 --> 00:48:36.510 align:middle line:90%
I mean, was it a two-way street?

00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:39.350 align:middle line:84%
What had they hoped
to gain from us?

00:48:39.350 --> 00:48:42.909 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Ebens were just
being our friends, really.

00:48:42.909 --> 00:48:45.200 align:middle line:84%
They might have learned
something about nuclear energy,

00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:46.720 align:middle line:90%
but that's about it.

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:48.200 align:middle line:84%
We had nothing
else to teach them.

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:49.640 align:middle line:90%
They were way ahead of us.

00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:52.820 align:middle line:84%
In terms of propulsion,
in terms of biotechnology,

00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:54.080 align:middle line:90%
they were way ahead of us.

00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:54.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Cloning?

00:48:54.830 --> 00:48:57.230 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: They just want--
cloning, which they could do.

00:48:57.230 --> 00:49:01.800 align:middle line:84%
They just wanted to set up
a interplanetary alliance,

00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:02.400 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:05.310 align:middle line:90%
And we were thrilled with that.

00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:08.679 align:middle line:84%
This was our doorway
into the galaxy.

00:49:08.679 --> 00:49:10.220 align:middle line:84%
To have a base-- if
we could actually

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:12.770 align:middle line:84%
establish a base on
Serpo-- which I think we

00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:15.500 align:middle line:84%
did, by the way, even
though it's not in the book.

00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:18.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure we had
people there already.

00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:19.940 align:middle line:90%
Think of what we've learned.

00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:20.640 align:middle line:90%
Just think.

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:22.310 align:middle line:90%
It's astounding.

00:49:22.310 --> 00:49:25.730 align:middle line:90%
But they never abducted anybody.

00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:29.010 align:middle line:84%
They were never trying
to hurt us in any way,

00:49:29.010 --> 00:49:31.600 align:middle line:84%
even though at the beginning
when we found human body

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:32.517 align:middle line:90%
parts on their craft--

00:49:32.517 --> 00:49:33.391 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, yeah.

00:49:33.391 --> 00:49:34.250 align:middle line:90%
It was suspicious.

00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:35.129 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:49:35.129 --> 00:49:37.420 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: There was some
nervousness along those lines.

00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:39.870 align:middle line:84%
We thought they might
be flesh eaters.

00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:40.870 align:middle line:90%
Turned out they weren't.

00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:43.470 align:middle line:84%
They were just bringing
samples back to Serpo

00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:44.850 align:middle line:90%
to be analyzed for the DNA.

00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:48.172 align:middle line:84%
But we didn't even know
what DNA was at that time.

00:49:48.172 --> 00:49:49.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's right.

00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:50.260 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: 1964.

00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:51.218 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:49:51.218 --> 00:49:53.420 align:middle line:90%


00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: But they
just wanted to set up,

00:49:55.490 --> 00:49:57.030 align:middle line:84%
and we were very
happy to do that.

00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:58.420 align:middle line:90%
And they've become our friends.

00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And we now have a ongoing
relationship with the Ebens.

00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:04.095 align:middle line:90%
They're very nice entities.

00:50:04.095 --> 00:50:04.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:08.225 align:middle line:84%
You also hear the
Ebens' body structure

00:50:08.225 --> 00:50:11.920 align:middle line:84%
is very similar to what
we call the Greys, right?

00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And you also hear
opposing stories,

00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:18.000 align:middle line:84%
that the Greys have been
very actively involved

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.170 align:middle line:84%
in, you can call it,
other-dimensional contact,

00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:23.090 align:middle line:90%
abductions, and so forth, right?

00:50:23.090 --> 00:50:24.550 align:middle line:90%
>>KASTEN: Yes.

00:50:24.550 --> 00:50:28.676 align:middle line:84%
The Greys are allied with
the Reptilians, clearly.

00:50:28.676 --> 00:50:29.300 align:middle line:90%
That evidence--

00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:31.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Ebens, nothing
to do with these Greys--

00:50:31.650 --> 00:50:31.990 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Nothing
to do with them.

00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --even if they're all
similar body structures and so

00:50:34.650 --> 00:50:35.310 align:middle line:90%
forth.

00:50:35.310 --> 00:50:36.770 align:middle line:90%
Different groups.

00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:38.760 align:middle line:84%
>>KASTEN: Totally
different race.

00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:41.850 align:middle line:84%
We've been involved with at
least 11 different races,

00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:43.220 align:middle line:90%
according to Anonymous.

00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:45.850 align:middle line:90%
Anonymous said 11.

00:50:45.850 --> 00:50:47.530 align:middle line:84%
Other people, like
Bob Dean and others,

00:50:47.530 --> 00:50:49.820 align:middle line:84%
have said the number
is much higher.

00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:52.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
the real number is.

00:50:52.110 --> 00:50:56.570 align:middle line:84%
But Anonymous rattled off
eight different star systems

00:50:56.570 --> 00:50:59.400 align:middle line:90%
that we're dealing with.

00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:00.260 align:middle line:90%
It's in the book.

00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:01.645 align:middle line:90%
It's all in the book.

00:51:01.645 --> 00:51:05.030 align:middle line:84%
But the Ebens have
always been our friends.

00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And therefore we can
assume, I think very easily,

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:12.560 align:middle line:84%
that they have shared a lot
of that technology with us.

00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:16.589 align:middle line:84%
That means we have it
somewhere, under lock and key.

00:51:16.589 --> 00:51:17.380 align:middle line:90%
How could they not?

00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:18.900 align:middle line:90%
They've always been friendly.

00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:21.170 align:middle line:10%
They allowed us to
walk around their ship

00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:23.850 align:middle line:10%
while we were on
their way to Serpo.

00:51:23.850 --> 00:51:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And they told us how
the propulsion system

00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:27.675 align:middle line:90%
worked and everything.

00:51:27.675 --> 00:51:28.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thanks Len.

00:51:28.550 --> 00:51:30.091 align:middle line:10%
In our next
conversation, we're going

00:51:30.091 --> 00:51:32.320 align:middle line:10%
to talk about the extraordinary
story of preparing

00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:35.630 align:middle line:10%
12 human beings to live
a decade on a planet

00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:37.790 align:middle line:10%
some 39 lightyears away.

00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:40.210 align:middle line:84%
The adage that
ignorance is bliss

00:51:40.210 --> 00:51:42.080 align:middle line:90%
worked to their advantage.

00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:46.180 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
