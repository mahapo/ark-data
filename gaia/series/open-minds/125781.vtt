>>REGINA MEREDITH:
If you're like me,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.420 align:middle line:10%
you may have been
through all of the stages

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.820 align:middle line:10%
of chemtrail analysis,
from the shock

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.610 align:middle line:10%
of looking up and
realizing something

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.990 align:middle line:10%
isn't right to anger, and
perhaps even to apathy,

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.360 align:middle line:10%
when your questions are
not being validated.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.510 align:middle line:90%
And this is the question.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.130 align:middle line:84%
If it's happening, why isn't
anyone talking about it?

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, one weatherman
meteorologist is.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.910 align:middle line:90%
He took notice.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:49.980 align:middle line:90%
Scott Stevens.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.820 align:middle line:84%
Not only did he take the
study of chemtrails seriously

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.410 align:middle line:84%
full tilt, he made some
startling discoveries,

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.710 align:middle line:90%
and Scott's with us today.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And we've only
chatted off camera.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.310 align:middle line:84%
This is the first time we've
met you, but I have to say,

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.810 align:middle line:84%
in speaking with you
I found you incredibly

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.340 align:middle line:90%
lucid on the subject.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And so many times I thought,
these meteorologists,

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.210 align:middle line:84%
they're seeing this
stuff, aren't they

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.350 align:middle line:84%
noticing that it seems
to have something

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.050 align:middle line:90%
to do with weather patterns?

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And why isn't anyone
saying anything?

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.320 align:middle line:90%
So, we go to you, OK?

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.403 align:middle line:10%
>>SCOTT STEVENS: That's a
couple of good questions

00:01:21.403 --> 00:01:24.360 align:middle line:10%
because I was one
of those guys that,

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.270 align:middle line:10%
as I look at what's happened
in my discovery, my awakening

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.435 align:middle line:10%
period, which is coming
up on 15 years now,

00:01:31.435 --> 00:01:35.800 align:middle line:10%
that they have been in the
sky while I was on the air,

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.000 align:middle line:10%
that I can look at it.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.910 align:middle line:84%
I've always been an
avid photographer.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.810 align:middle line:84%
I can look back at
pictures from the '80s

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.660 align:middle line:84%
and see them in my
own photographs.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.725 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And in movies.

00:01:43.725 --> 00:01:46.520 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And so,
they've always been there.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And so, how do you
recognize that something

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.520 align:middle line:84%
has changed when in
your professional career

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.640 align:middle line:90%
they've always been there?

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.880 align:middle line:84%
This is how I was largely
able to dismiss it

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.470 align:middle line:90%
as it's just air traffic.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.290 align:middle line:84%
Oh, look at that cool
pattern up there.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.730 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:01.800 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that kind of cool?

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.133 align:middle line:84%
You should take a shot of it,
and that is the end of it.

00:02:04.133 --> 00:02:06.490 align:middle line:84%
That's the end of the
inquisitive part of it.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you
know, when I first

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.125 align:middle line:84%
started studying chemtrails,
which is in the year 2000,

00:02:12.125 --> 00:02:14.250 align:middle line:84%
when I moved to Sedona
because everyone was saying,

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.500 align:middle line:90%
hey, look at that stuff.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very heavily
sprayed community, one

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.310 align:middle line:84%
of the top three in the
country, was our understanding,

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.110 align:middle line:90%
by Carnicom.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.872 align:middle line:84%
You look at it-- and I started
taking pictures, like you did,

00:02:25.872 --> 00:02:27.330 align:middle line:84%
and all-- the thing
that you notice

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.620 align:middle line:84%
is we've always seen
the little matchstick

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.520 align:middle line:90%
trail of the normal emissions.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.600 align:middle line:84%
Those aren't normal, and they
haven't always been around.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.329 align:middle line:84%
We didn't see them
puffing up as kids.

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:39.620 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: I don't remember it.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.079 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, somewhere in the
'80s, as you say, it seems--

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:43.203 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Or even earlier.

00:02:43.203 --> 00:02:45.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or maybe earlier,
but it wasn't common.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.910 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't crisscrossing
every sky.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.170 align:middle line:84%
So, some of these
meteorologists-- and you

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.740 align:middle line:84%
are a meteorologist--
had to have noticed.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.050 align:middle line:84%
There is a direct correlation
between their presence

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.850 align:middle line:90%
and weather.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: There has to be.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.060 align:middle line:84%
I first came across the term, I
was probably reading rense.com.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.475 align:middle line:90%
You know, '97, '98 time period.

00:03:04.475 --> 00:03:06.350 align:middle line:84%
And I'm coming across
this story, chemtrails,

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.720 align:middle line:90%
weather modification.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, guys, come on, now.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You
conspiracy theorists.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.798 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Leave
the weather alone.

00:03:11.798 --> 00:03:12.810 align:middle line:90%
Please, leave it alone.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.480 align:middle line:90%
It's my sacred cow.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.750 align:middle line:90%
Don't mess with it.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.697 align:middle line:84%
And so, it was very
easy to wipe it away

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:19.780 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't
understand proper cloud names.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.113 align:middle line:90%
They didn't name them correctly.

00:03:21.113 --> 00:03:23.180 align:middle line:84%
They're out to kill
us all, and there's

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.420 align:middle line:84%
better ways to kill people
than dealing with contrails.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.600 align:middle line:84%
So, I was able to
really rationally,

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.891 align:middle line:84%
scientifically throw a lot
of those first websites

00:03:31.891 --> 00:03:33.390 align:middle line:84%
that I looked at
into the trash bin.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.270 align:middle line:84%
It was very, very easy
to do because they

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.030 align:middle line:84%
were so ignorant to
meteorological processes.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.420 align:middle line:84%
But that didn't
stop the stories.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Month after month, another
story, another picture.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.120 align:middle line:84%
Clifford Carnicom's
name started coming up.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.467 align:middle line:84%
Then there's a DC-9,
or an MD-80 now,

00:03:48.467 --> 00:03:50.800 align:middle line:84%
as it's called, with a full
trial coming off a wingspan,

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.510 align:middle line:84%
and I'm like, hm,
that's curious.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.860 align:middle line:90%
So, you put these notes.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
I always promised

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.140 align:middle line:84%
myself is not to throw away
any bit of information.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.100 align:middle line:84%
We're only here to create
a composite picture.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.340 align:middle line:84%
Each bit of information
goes up on the wall.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a pixel in the
picture with its own color

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.530 align:middle line:84%
and its own brightness,
the brightness

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.540 align:middle line:84%
depending on what I felt the
truthfulness or the clarity

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.755 align:middle line:90%
of the information was.

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:17.380 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to
build this picture,

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.430 align:middle line:84%
so I just kept
devouring information,

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.360 align:middle line:90%
trying to build knowledge.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.260 align:middle line:90%
By 2002, I had had enough.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.670 align:middle line:84%
I thought, I'll get to the
point where I've got a newsroom,

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.290 align:middle line:84%
I've got the live feeds,
and I can figure this out.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.207 align:middle line:90%
I can figure this thing out.

00:04:34.207 --> 00:04:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And then I came across
Lieutenant Colonel Bearden,

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.990 align:middle line:90%
Tom Bearden.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, Tome Bearden.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.970 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Tom
Bearden, cheniere.org.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We all found him
at some point on the journey.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.820 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: We did.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.180 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't interested
in the weather.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.580 align:middle line:90%
I was interested in free energy.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.090 align:middle line:84%
So, tell us how that
started dovetailing in.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.010 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Well, it
did because I figured

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.460 align:middle line:84%
if we could solve
our oil problem,

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.900 align:middle line:84%
we would solve our global
warming issue with CO2.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Get us off of fossil
fuels, and that issue,

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.210 align:middle line:84%
which I came to understand
was an illusion,

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.360 align:middle line:90%
would rectify itself.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.900 align:middle line:84%
So, we have the solutions in
all of these free energy devices

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.030 align:middle line:90%
to our CO2 problem.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And explain.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.735 align:middle line:84%
Tom Bearden is more or less
the godfather of free energy.

00:05:12.735 --> 00:05:14.920 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Scalar energetics
is what he called it.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and he was
putting the schematics

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.120 align:middle line:90%
for this stuff out free.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.360 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Way over my head.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But free.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:21.370 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yeah, they're there.

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For anyone who had
the ability to understand it.

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.452 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't trying to
withhold anything.

00:05:25.452 --> 00:05:27.160 align:middle line:84%
That was what was so
beautiful about him.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.784 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: He was in
army intelligence,

00:05:28.784 --> 00:05:31.270 align:middle line:84%
and so, he was coming
across satellite photographs

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.510 align:middle line:84%
of these massive chimneys,
as he called them,

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:38.350 align:middle line:84%
in the Soviet Arctic, venting
incredible plumes of steam.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.480 align:middle line:84%
So, they were venting
heat from some thing,

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.330 align:middle line:90%
some project, some technology.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And in his understanding,
it was scalar technology,

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.780 align:middle line:84%
and that as he dug
through his resources,

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.220 align:middle line:84%
and his understanding,
and his detective work,

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.790 align:middle line:84%
that the Soviets began
engineering weather over North

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.190 align:middle line:90%
America in 1976.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And I've got pictures of
chemtrails over the states--

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In '76.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.620 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: In '76.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.720 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm them going through
this is it us versus them?

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.450 align:middle line:84%
Are we dealing with this
east-west, American-eastern

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:12.250 align:middle line:90%
paradigm?

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.050 align:middle line:90%
So, who's doing it to whom?

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.460 align:middle line:90%
Still, that's a tangent.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, but
that's interesting

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.840 align:middle line:84%
because no one thought of
who's doing it to whom.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.430 align:middle line:84%
We've just assumed
it was domestic.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:22.444 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Exactly.

00:06:22.444 --> 00:06:24.110 align:middle line:84%
But then there's
supposed to be treaties

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.040 align:middle line:84%
saying you can't do
it to foreign lands.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.352 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't keep you from
doing it your own population.

00:06:30.352 --> 00:06:31.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Or having the
technology handed over

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:34.304 align:middle line:90%
to corporations--

00:06:34.304 --> 00:06:35.845 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To do it
to the population.

00:06:35.845 --> 00:06:37.386 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: To do it
to the population

00:06:37.386 --> 00:06:38.450 align:middle line:90%
with explicit permission.

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:39.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.488 align:middle line:84%
Before we even go any
further, this is probably

00:06:41.488 --> 00:06:43.422 align:middle line:90%
a preemptive question, but--

00:06:43.422 --> 00:06:44.380 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: I like them.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What do
you think is going

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:49.570 align:middle line:84%
on in terms of the
military industrial complex

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:50.600 align:middle line:90%
and chemtrails?

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.400 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yeah.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Who is--

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.484 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Who can afford
it is what it comes down to.

00:06:55.484 --> 00:06:57.150 align:middle line:84%
Who can afford the
hundreds of billions,

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.240 align:middle line:84%
if not great a trillion or
two, over the course of a--

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Hiring private
contractors to do it.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.770 align:middle line:84%
These are usually
unmarked craft.

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And the ones I have
seen in the early paperwork

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.910 align:middle line:84%
that I read is like we're
going in our own aircraft,

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:13.540 align:middle line:90%
our own airline, to do this.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.430 align:middle line:84%
But if we have Chemtrail
Air up there, then,

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.250 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, this fleet is
decidedly independent

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.350 align:middle line:84%
of this fleet, and who's
going to get the landing

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:25.270 align:middle line:84%
spaces at Kennedy,
at National Airport,

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:28.730 align:middle line:84%
at St. Louis, and
all these airplanes.

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:32.120 align:middle line:84%
So, what I learned very early
on was that we were dealing

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.782 align:middle line:84%
with planes that looked
like Southwest Airlines,

00:07:35.782 --> 00:07:37.490 align:middle line:84%
looked like United
Airlines, looked like,

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.390 align:middle line:84%
looked like, looked like, looked
like everything that we're

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:40.580 align:middle line:90%
familiar with.

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.650 align:middle line:84%
Because if they were B-52, if
they were C-4s, if they C-17s--

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:45.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They were commercial
craft that have been outfitted.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.550 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: They have to be.

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:46.940 align:middle line:90%
Disguised.

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:47.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.160 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Disguised.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And so, as long as people--
and we were very well aware

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.060 align:middle line:84%
of the dumbing down of
the population via all

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.020 align:middle line:84%
of the mechanisms
that are available.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.620 align:middle line:90%
We don't question anymore.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:01.205 align:middle line:84%
It's too painful to know,
so we just don't question.

00:08:01.205 --> 00:08:06.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and then as
researchers started uncovering,

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:11.200 align:middle line:84%
there were people who did
whistle blow a little bit.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.890 align:middle line:90%
Not a lot on chemtrails, oddly.

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:15.590 align:middle line:84%
Not very many pilots
dare spoke about it,

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.190 align:middle line:84%
but you'd hear from someone's
brother-in-law who'd

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:21.500 align:middle line:84%
sneak a picture to so-and-so
because he was involved,

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.840 align:middle line:84%
and we ended up with pictures
such as those nozzles

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.762 align:middle line:84%
underneath the aircraft
emitting this aerosol.

00:08:28.762 --> 00:08:30.470 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And I would
see those pictures

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.928 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, they're just
static electricity dissipaters.

00:08:32.928 --> 00:08:36.695 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, you could see
little nozzles squirting it.

00:08:36.695 --> 00:08:41.090 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And there's-- so, my
understanding is that we have

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:42.899 align:middle line:90%
Boeing, obviously, a part of it.

00:08:42.899 --> 00:08:44.190 align:middle line:90%
Airbus, obviously a part of it.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:47.980 align:middle line:84%
Lear Jet, Gulfstream, Cessna,
all of these aircraft companies

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:51.250 align:middle line:84%
get order books that we
need an aircraft built

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:53.085 align:middle line:90%
to this specification.

00:08:53.085 --> 00:08:55.210 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't have to be at the
regular commercial plant.

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.470 align:middle line:84%
We can have mirrored
facilities elsewhere.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.840 align:middle line:84%
Or they're built
to a specification

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.600 align:middle line:84%
and then delivered
to the end user which

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.090 align:middle line:90%
does the final modifications.

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they land
in very specific spots

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:07.930 align:middle line:84%
for refueling and
taking on the chemicals

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:09.530 align:middle line:84%
that it's not at
commercial airports.

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:11.340 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: That's
my big question.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.444 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No one can
find out where they land.

00:09:13.444 --> 00:09:14.860 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And I
don't know if I'm

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.520 align:middle line:84%
ready to speculate on the air
about what happens with them

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.680 align:middle line:84%
and where those base
of operations are.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.006 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why not speculate
if you call it speculation?

00:09:22.006 --> 00:09:24.602 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I think there's
other dimensional craft.

00:09:24.602 --> 00:09:25.669 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:09:25.669 --> 00:09:27.460 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: They don't
have to touch ground.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.410 align:middle line:84%
Why bring all of those
planes in and intermixed

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:31.700 align:middle line:90%
with an already busy populace?

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.540 align:middle line:84%
You've got terminals that
have to have passengers.

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:34.998 align:middle line:84%
You've got planes
waiting for them.

00:09:34.998 --> 00:09:36.568 align:middle line:90%
It's too complicated.

00:09:36.568 --> 00:09:37.443 align:middle line:90%
It's too complicated.

00:09:37.443 --> 00:09:38.515 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:09:38.515 --> 00:09:39.580 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: So, you
keep them airborne.

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because that
is the big question.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:42.350 align:middle line:84%
No one seems to
be able to answer

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:46.340 align:middle line:84%
where they land and refuel,
take on the stuff, and go from.

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I think
there are probably

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.570 align:middle line:84%
like Lockheed Martin
triangles, the ones

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:53.060 align:middle line:84%
that the planes are
robotically flown.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:55.520 align:middle line:84%
They come in, and it doesn't
look like that big of a craft,

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.150 align:middle line:84%
but once you get inside,
you're like, oh, my God,

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:57.750 align:middle line:90%
this is the biggest.

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:59.099 align:middle line:90%
You know, 15 football stadiums.

00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:01.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, you think it
may not even require landing

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:02.720 align:middle line:90%
terrestrially, so to speak.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:03.520 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Exactly.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.070 align:middle line:90%
And that could very well be.

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:05.930 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And it
keeps the secrets.

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:06.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, it does.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And also, I've interviewed
so many people,

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:12.090 align:middle line:84%
and it's fairly commonly
known that we've

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:14.160 align:middle line:84%
had the technology on
this planet to create

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.460 align:middle line:90%
those vehicles for a very long.

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:16.670 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: A long
time, a long time.

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:18.497 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so that's
your speculation.

00:10:18.497 --> 00:10:20.080 align:middle line:84%
We're labeling it
as such, and I think

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.375 align:middle line:90%
it's a very interesting theory.

00:10:21.375 --> 00:10:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to
get into your story.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:23.958 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yeah, right!

00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.210 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, there were
satellite images once

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.452 align:middle line:90%
upon a time of square clouds.

00:10:29.452 --> 00:10:31.160 align:middle line:84%
I want to get to that
part of your story.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.430 align:middle line:90%
What started peaking you?

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:35.100 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: It was 2003 and
'04, and I was dealing with

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:35.900 align:middle line:90%
accuracy.

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.580 align:middle line:84%
I had a responsibility to an
audience that chose me for--

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:39.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where
were you doing this?

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.096 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I was
in eastern Idaho.

00:10:41.096 --> 00:10:45.320 align:middle line:84%
I was in a station called KPVI,
and I ultimately was there just

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.965 align:middle line:90%
not quite 10 years.

00:10:46.965 --> 00:10:48.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
were a meteorologist?

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:49.270 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yeah.

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:50.155 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you were trained--

00:10:50.155 --> 00:10:52.170 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I went to the
University of Kansas.

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:53.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, all right.

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:53.540 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:54.390 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I got
into meteorology

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:55.640 align:middle line:90%
because of Boy Scouts.

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.640 align:middle line:84%
It was the Boy
Scout merit badge,

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.730 align:middle line:90%
and that was July of '78.

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:00.540 align:middle line:90%
I was 12 years old.

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.070 align:middle line:90%
I was looking through the book.

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:03.010 align:middle line:90%
What can I do?

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:04.520 align:middle line:90%
What can I do merit badge-wise?

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.600 align:middle line:90%
Weather.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.336 align:middle line:90%
Oh, easy, easy.

00:11:07.336 --> 00:11:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and
here you are today.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.168 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Pull this one out.

00:11:10.168 --> 00:11:11.700 align:middle line:90%
I got to do this one.

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.640 align:middle line:90%
So, that was how it all started.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And so, by the end of
that month of connecting

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.000 align:middle line:84%
with the local
television meteorologist,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.540 align:middle line:84%
building a weather station,
watching him three times a day,

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:26.050 align:middle line:84%
and doing my own weather log
and verifying his forecasts,

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:27.290 align:middle line:90%
I was hooked.

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:28.590 align:middle line:90%
I was hooked.

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:30.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You really took it on.

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:31.800 align:middle line:90%
You bought all the equipment.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.810 align:middle line:84%
You were a sky watcher
doing time lapse photography

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:37.000 align:middle line:90%
with multiple cameras.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: This
was my discovery,

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.990 align:middle line:84%
because after I realized Bill
Bearden's work was valid,

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:44.820 align:middle line:84%
that there were resonance
patterns in the sky that

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:49.060 align:middle line:84%
were changing the weather that
I was forecasting without me

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:50.760 align:middle line:90%
knowing how.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.500 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm expecting
an 8-inch snowfall.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.870 align:middle line:90%
I've got the road departments.

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:57.000 align:middle line:90%
I've got the ski resorts.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.330 align:middle line:90%
I've got the kids at school.

00:11:58.330 --> 00:11:59.380 align:middle line:90%
I've got the bus drivers.

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:00.450 align:middle line:90%
All these people watching me.

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:02.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's
right, depending on you.

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: You're the point of
information, the point source,

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:06.630 align:middle line:90%
and my goal was always to beat.

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:07.616 align:middle line:90%
The Weather Service.

00:12:07.616 --> 00:12:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Beat the Weather
Service while they try

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.960 align:middle line:90%
to beat the computer models.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.960 align:middle line:84%
So, they're beating the
computers, and I'm like,

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.501 align:middle line:84%
I see their end
result, and I'm like,

00:12:14.501 --> 00:12:16.730 align:middle line:90%
guys, guys, pull your heads out.

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:21.270 align:middle line:84%
This is what's going to happen,
and I had a pretty good record.

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:24.300 align:middle line:84%
But by early 2000s,
storms that should

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:26.340 align:middle line:84%
have been delivering
snow were not,

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.440 align:middle line:84%
and the West was
descending into drought.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.590 align:middle line:84%
Year after year after
year, the drought worsened

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:34.600 align:middle line:84%
because these storms
were coming ashore,

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.280 align:middle line:84%
and they were not delivering
the quantity of snow

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.780 align:middle line:84%
or the length of time that they
were supposed to be overhead

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:42.480 align:middle line:84%
and snowing went
from an 8-inch snow

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.140 align:middle line:84%
to an inch and a
half or a trace.

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.130 align:middle line:84%
I lived at Lake Tahoe for years,
and when I was living there,

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:52.900 align:middle line:84%
we got up to 30
feet of snow a year.

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:55.690 align:middle line:90%
Now, if they get 6 or 8 feet.

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:57.361 align:middle line:84%
And so, people say,
hey, things change.

00:12:57.361 --> 00:12:58.360 align:middle line:90%
Weather patterns change.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.540 align:middle line:90%
You're saying baloney.

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: No, weather
patterns do change,

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.320 align:middle line:84%
but they don't
change to that degree

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.900 align:middle line:84%
without some kind
of artificial input,

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:08.349 align:middle line:84%
and that was the delta,
the change in value.

00:13:08.349 --> 00:13:10.640 align:middle line:84%
Whether it was humidity,
whether it was wind direction,

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.340 align:middle line:84%
there was some delta
that I wasn't capturing.

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And so, as I had my
world view change,

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.110 align:middle line:84%
seeing satellite
imagery that just

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:21.800 align:middle line:84%
had these storms, this cold
front up in Montana just sliced

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.600 align:middle line:84%
and diced, I'm like,
there's nothing

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.640 align:middle line:90%
about this that's right.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.440 align:middle line:90%
Nothing!

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How did you
continue during your job?

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I had
to have patience.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.010 align:middle line:84%
I had to have great
patience with myself,

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:33.130 align:middle line:84%
and to be honest
with you, it was

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:35.320 align:middle line:90%
like getting sucker punched.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.350 align:middle line:84%
You come back from
that event, you're

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:40.630 align:middle line:84%
like, I can't do this
anymore because I don't know

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:42.350 align:middle line:90%
if I'm telling you the truth.

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:44.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't have the
conviction in my forecast

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:46.370 align:middle line:84%
because there's
something else going on

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:49.030 align:middle line:90%
that I can't discuss with you.

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And so, there's a direct
attack on your ability

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:55.449 align:middle line:84%
to be integrous
with your audience.

00:13:55.449 --> 00:13:57.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And your
credibility, ultimately.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.040 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Exactly.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And that is made forecast
by forecast by forecast,

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:04.332 align:middle line:84%
one person at a time, and that's
how you build an audience.

00:14:04.332 --> 00:14:05.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.544 align:middle line:90%
So now you've discovered this.

00:14:06.544 --> 00:14:08.960 align:middle line:84%
You don't feel like you're in
integrity because you really

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.710 align:middle line:84%
can't accurately forecast
because of this delta or an X

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:12.650 align:middle line:90%
factor.

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:14.320 align:middle line:90%
Now, you brought up Tom Bearden.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.570 align:middle line:84%
You brought up the word
"scalar waves" a few times.

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:19.452 align:middle line:84%
I think you need to explain
to the audience the nature.

00:14:19.452 --> 00:14:22.035 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: What I wanted to do
was find these waves in action.

00:14:22.035 --> 00:14:24.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, tell
people what these waves

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:25.790 align:middle line:90%
are before you-- yeah.

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: What they
do is they open a void.

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:30.770 align:middle line:84%
I understand that there
is one set of waves

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:33.230 align:middle line:84%
that you can literally--
in Bearden's work,

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:34.740 align:middle line:84%
you have to cross
the wave patterns,

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:36.440 align:middle line:84%
and in this
interference pattern,

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.330 align:middle line:84%
there can be
endothermic, meaning

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:42.260 align:middle line:84%
pulling heat out of a zone of
interference, or exothermic,

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:43.290 align:middle line:90%
adding heat in.

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:46.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's where our
free energy devices come in.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.741 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Thank
you, that would have

00:14:47.741 --> 00:14:50.210 align:middle line:84%
solved our CO problem that
started me down this road

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:51.720 align:middle line:90%
in the first place.

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:55.180 align:middle line:84%
So, what I was seeing
in Idaho as these winter

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.589 align:middle line:84%
storms were coming
ashore, that the storm

00:14:57.589 --> 00:14:58.630 align:middle line:90%
should have started snow.

00:14:58.630 --> 00:14:59.610 align:middle line:90%
Should have started snowing.

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:00.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, come on,
come on come on.

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:02.533 align:middle line:84%
Should have been
here three hours ago,

00:15:02.533 --> 00:15:04.500 align:middle line:84%
and the line of the
western edge of the snow

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:05.980 align:middle line:90%
just wouldn't happen.

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:09.220 align:middle line:84%
So, I'd leave the 10
o'clock newscast, get home,

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:10.090 align:middle line:90%
and I'm waiting.

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:10.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm waiting.

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:11.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm watching the radar.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.920 align:middle line:84%
It should have started
8, 9, 10 hours ago.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.810 align:middle line:84%
I got to go to
bed at some point.

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:17.640 align:middle line:84%
I'd get up, go outside,
let the dogs out,

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:21.810 align:middle line:84%
and I would hear
planes, low and slow.

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:23.350 align:middle line:90%
WTF?

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:24.750 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing here?

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:28.370 align:middle line:84%
1:00 in the morning, no planes,
commercial plane, big planes,

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:31.816 align:middle line:90%
what are they doing here?

00:15:31.816 --> 00:15:33.520 align:middle line:90%
Data point.

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And so then, by August of '04,
I saw a beautiful blue August

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:44.120 align:middle line:84%
afternoon, a 747, bright green
paint scheme, low overhead,

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.545 align:middle line:90%
trail, horizon to horizon.

00:15:45.545 --> 00:15:46.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, oh, there we go.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:47.770 align:middle line:90%
That's a chemtrail.

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:48.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm a believer.

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:49.080 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it now.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: By moonlight,
you can see them clearly.

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:51.200 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: You can.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.970 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: So that winter,
I bought four cameras, two

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:56.345 align:middle line:90%
computers, time lapse software.

00:15:56.345 --> 00:15:59.430 align:middle line:84%
I would come home from the
evening news at 10 o'clock

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:01.460 align:middle line:84%
and render the movies
and just watch,

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:05.490 align:middle line:84%
because I figured if there were
something that was happening

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:08.060 align:middle line:84%
in the time lapse, that I
could then deliver a better

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:09.540 align:middle line:90%
forecast to my people.

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:13.170 align:middle line:84%
But what I found was that these
planes were not just up there

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:14.854 align:middle line:90%
willy nilly flying around.

00:16:14.854 --> 00:16:16.270 align:middle line:84%
They were not out
there doing what

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:18.510 align:middle line:84%
is now termed solar radiation
management, creating

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:21.050 align:middle line:84%
a blanket of clouds to
inhibit the sun from warming

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:22.180 align:middle line:90%
the planet any further.

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:24.380 align:middle line:84%
It was the farthest
thing from that.

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:27.610 align:middle line:84%
There was incredible
precision in these flights.

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:30.577 align:middle line:84%
A plane would fly,
leave a break.

00:16:30.577 --> 00:16:32.160 align:middle line:84%
Maybe part of the
whole trail wouldn't

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.900 align:middle line:90%
stay illuminated or visible.

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.370 align:middle line:84%
But then what was
most fascinating

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:38.265 align:middle line:84%
was another plane would come
along and hit that exact spot.

00:16:38.265 --> 00:16:39.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That break.

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:41.650 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: That break,
or the exact end of it,

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:44.100 align:middle line:84%
or it would come
through at an angle.

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:45.660 align:middle line:84%
So what I then
realized, that they're

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.755 align:middle line:84%
using these waves,
these resonance waves,

00:16:47.755 --> 00:16:48.555 align:middle line:90%
in the atmosphere.

00:16:48.555 --> 00:16:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, let's
stop for a moment.

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:52.260 align:middle line:84%
Most people are
thinking, wait a minute,

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.790 align:middle line:84%
I thought they were
spraying aerosols,

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:57.630 align:middle line:84%
and you're saying they're
using resonant waves.

00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:00.400 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's talk about the
projection of those scalar

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:04.630 align:middle line:84%
waves versus the aerosol, and
then how the two come together.

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:07.800 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Let's use the
analogy of shingling a roof.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:10.140 align:middle line:84%
If you want to shingle
the roof correctly,

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:11.910 align:middle line:90%
you've got to have chalk lines.

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:14.579 align:middle line:84%
So, the guys go up there,
and at the interval

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:16.450 align:middle line:84%
that they want to lay
down the shingles,

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:17.859 align:middle line:90%
they'll snap a chalk line.

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:20.880 align:middle line:84%
Snap a chalk line so they'll
leave a residue in the sky,

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.740 align:middle line:84%
so they know where to
put down the shingle

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:23.884 align:middle line:90%
so you get a straight line.

00:17:23.884 --> 00:17:25.800 align:middle line:84%
The same thing is happening
in the atmosphere.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, the straight
line are the scalar waves,

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:30.380 align:middle line:84%
or the shingles are
the scalar waves?

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:32.170 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: The scalar
waves need to have

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:35.079 align:middle line:84%
some kind of orientation
before they're

00:17:35.079 --> 00:17:36.370 align:middle line:90%
introduced into the atmosphere.

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:38.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, you're
saying that the laying down

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:42.565 align:middle line:84%
of the chemtrail itself is the
linear plane where the scalar

00:17:42.565 --> 00:17:43.940 align:middle line:84%
energy is going
to be introduced.

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:45.890 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: That's
the sightline, pulse.

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:46.690 align:middle line:90%
Sightline, pulse.

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:47.360 align:middle line:90%
Sightline, pulse,

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because this
is the part of the story

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.316 align:middle line:90%
you never hear of.

00:17:49.316 --> 00:17:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Nope, because
we're so concerned about it's

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.290 align:middle line:90%
fallout, what's in them?

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:53.730 align:middle line:90%
Uh-uh.

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:54.582 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:17:54.582 --> 00:17:55.434 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:17:55.434 --> 00:17:55.860 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.425 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No one's
brought it up before.

00:17:57.425 --> 00:17:58.840 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And there's
even been movies.

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.080 align:middle line:84%
One of Michael Murphy's, "Why
In The World Are They Spraying."

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:01.760 align:middle line:90%
But it was largely--

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.218 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They don't talk about
the notion of scalar waves.

00:18:04.218 --> 00:18:05.691 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: So
they're missing it.

00:18:05.691 --> 00:18:08.190 align:middle line:84%
They're missing it entirely,
and there's still another topic

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:10.195 align:middle line:90%
that we talked about earlier.

00:18:10.195 --> 00:18:11.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: On the phone or here?

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:12.055 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: On the phone.

00:18:12.055 --> 00:18:12.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, bring it up.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:14.039 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: That was orgone.

00:18:14.039 --> 00:18:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We did, and we're
going to get to the orgone,

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:17.250 align:middle line:90%
but I have a question.

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:19.460 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we're getting there.

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:21.090 align:middle line:90%
I have another question.

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:23.540 align:middle line:84%
One thing I've seen
in Sedona, I mean,

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:25.040 align:middle line:84%
when I first moved
there in 2000,

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.776 align:middle line:90%
the skies were cobalt blue.

00:18:26.776 --> 00:18:28.150 align:middle line:84%
That's why everybody
moved there.

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:30.720 align:middle line:84%
You don't get that many
cobalt blue days now.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:31.920 align:middle line:90%
You get a lot of chemtrail--

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:32.740 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Mushy.

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:33.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mushy days.

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:42.530 align:middle line:84%
But when it is clear enough,
I see these gray black lines

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:46.820 align:middle line:84%
that often are at the
front edge a chemtrail,

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:49.900 align:middle line:84%
and I'll see them going
horizontally down as well.

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:51.100 align:middle line:90%
Have you seen the those?

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:51.440 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Often.

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.856 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
what do you think

00:18:52.856 --> 00:18:53.997 align:middle line:90%
those gray black lines are?

00:18:53.997 --> 00:18:55.330 align:middle line:90%
They don't appear to be aerosol.

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:56.290 align:middle line:90%
They don't spread out.

00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:59.030 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: No, and initially
they were called black beams.

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:01.092 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so no
one's talked about them.

00:19:01.092 --> 00:19:02.300 align:middle line:90%
I want to know what they are.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:03.133 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Geometry.

00:19:03.133 --> 00:19:03.940 align:middle line:90%
They're shadows.

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:04.740 align:middle line:90%
They're shadows.

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:06.250 align:middle line:84%
You have a point
light, point source.

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:07.791 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, in a good
studio you don't

00:19:07.791 --> 00:19:09.560 align:middle line:84%
have a single point
of light to broadcast,

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.700 align:middle line:84%
but if you've got
the sun here, you've

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.270 align:middle line:84%
got a plane here
with the trail here,

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:16.770 align:middle line:84%
then you're going to have
a shadow cast down here.

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:17.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ah!

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:19.916 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And if
you've got a particulate

00:19:19.916 --> 00:19:22.020 align:middle line:84%
of at least a minimum
density, you're

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:24.440 align:middle line:84%
going to see the
sides, either side,

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.530 align:middle line:84%
of the shadow
illuminated, so you're

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:28.616 align:middle line:84%
going to see a dimming
effect in that shadow.

00:19:28.616 --> 00:19:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:31.970 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And if
you're looking up,

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:34.457 align:middle line:84%
and the sun's there,
the plane's shadow

00:19:34.457 --> 00:19:36.040 align:middle line:84%
has got to be within
about a 20 degree

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.180 align:middle line:84%
spread either side of
where that chemtrail is.

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:39.030 align:middle line:90%
Of that trail.

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:39.720 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't have to be a chemtrail.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.390 align:middle line:90%
It's just a trail shadow.

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:40.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's always
been a mystery.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:41.680 align:middle line:84%
I always wondered
what those were.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:42.170 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Shadow, shadow.

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:43.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, that's
not either one.

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:44.490 align:middle line:84%
That's simply an
effect of those.

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:46.323 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: In a time
lapse, you'll see them.

00:19:46.323 --> 00:19:49.400 align:middle line:84%
You'll see them in time lapse,
left and right, left and right.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.150 align:middle line:84%
Oh, there it is, there
it is, there it is.

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:52.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right, OK.

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:55.010 align:middle line:84%
So, now by 2005,
you're understanding

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:56.430 align:middle line:90%
now they're sculpting weather.

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:58.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's talk about your
journey at this point,

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:02.686 align:middle line:84%
once you realized weather
patterns were being sculpted.

00:20:02.686 --> 00:20:04.760 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Let's go
back one year to 2004.

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.930 align:middle line:84%
I was on the air,
and Florida was

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:10.060 align:middle line:84%
being hammered by hurricanes,
one after the other

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:11.110 align:middle line:90%
after the other.

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:14.445 align:middle line:84%
And they virtually exhausted
the alphabet with named storms

00:20:14.445 --> 00:20:15.320 align:middle line:90%
that particular year.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.635 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I remember.

00:20:16.635 --> 00:20:19.940 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And a guy by
the name of George Ure,

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:22.930 align:middle line:84%
he runs a website called
urbansurvival.com,

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:24.754 align:middle line:84%
and he was a former
news director.

00:20:24.754 --> 00:20:25.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:28.700 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I liked
his Peoplenomics blog.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.627 align:middle line:84%
And so, it was kind
of like bugout.

00:20:30.627 --> 00:20:32.210 align:middle line:84%
This is what's
happening economically.

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And then he had another
guest, Clif High, who does--

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.364 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know Clif High.

00:20:35.364 --> 00:20:37.115 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Yeah, his
Half Past Human work.

00:20:37.115 --> 00:20:39.370 align:middle line:90%
So I was fascinated with it.

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And so, George in October
of '04 openly questioned.

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:46.210 align:middle line:84%
You know, hurricane
season is still raging.

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:49.054 align:middle line:84%
Quote, "Might any of these
have any scalar signatures

00:20:49.054 --> 00:20:51.095 align:middle line:84%
or related to scalar
weather control technology?"

00:20:51.095 --> 00:20:52.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He asked
that question?

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: He asked
that question publicly.

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:55.430 align:middle line:90%
I read it.

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
obviously, obviously,

00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:01.190 align:middle line:84%
and I can show you the resonance
patterns that they're creating.

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:03.500 align:middle line:84%
Then I sat with that
thing the whole day.

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.140 align:middle line:90%
Do I write him?

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:06.460 align:middle line:90%
Do I write him?

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:10.140 align:middle line:84%
Do I come out and share
what I've learned?

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And so, by the time I got
home from the late news,

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.564 align:middle line:90%
I was like I got to write him.

00:21:15.564 --> 00:21:16.730 align:middle line:90%
Let's just see what happens.

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:20.040 align:middle line:84%
I'll just write it and see
if it's worthy of sending.

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:22.450 align:middle line:84%
So, like four hours
later, I'd attached

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:26.730 align:middle line:84%
pictures, and radar, and
satellite, and just basically

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:29.230 align:middle line:84%
a five-page dossier
and sent it to him.

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:31.590 align:middle line:84%
He published it
the next morning.

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:32.690 align:middle line:90%
And I knew it.

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:34.690 align:middle line:84%
If I knew it, how long
would I stay employed?

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:35.260 align:middle line:90%
How long?

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:36.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:36.770 align:middle line:90%
Would you stay employed?

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:37.550 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: How
long will it last?

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:38.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:40.100 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: The
answer was 11 months.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:40.900 align:middle line:90%
11 months.

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.479 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did the
station call you on it?

00:21:43.479 --> 00:21:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: No, because
I didn't necessarily

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:47.690 align:middle line:84%
consultant them before I
sent the-- I just did it.

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:49.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, did they
find out what you were up to?

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:49.890 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yeah, fairly quickly.

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:52.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And were they upset
with you for having done so?

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:54.106 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Within 24
hours, my general manager

00:21:54.106 --> 00:21:55.050 align:middle line:90%
was getting questions.

00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:57.120 align:middle line:90%
Does he work there?

00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:00.810 align:middle line:84%
I Yes, he does, and he's one
of our most valued employees.

00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:01.610 align:middle line:90%
So, he had to.

00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:05.450 align:middle line:84%
He had the back me up right
out of the gate, and he did.

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:06.250 align:middle line:90%
He did.

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:08.500 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, we
came to an agreement

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:11.350 align:middle line:84%
that Scott, this is a passion
of yours, and it's important.

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:13.330 align:middle line:90%
Just do it on your time.

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:14.150 align:middle line:90%
Fine, fine.

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:14.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That was nice.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.110 align:middle line:90%
That was very considerate.

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:18.110 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Give me that
freedom, and thank you.

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:19.660 align:middle line:84%
His name was Bill Fouch,
and he's a good man.

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not many
news directors

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:21.300 align:middle line:90%
will actually do that.

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:22.100 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: No.

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No less, I
mean, general managers.

00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:26.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so kudos to him.

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:30.310 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's talk about
those vector points

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:33.090 align:middle line:84%
and what is actually happening
there when you introduce

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:35.057 align:middle line:90%
the subject of scalar waves.

00:22:35.057 --> 00:22:37.140 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Because the
vector points and satellite

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:41.650 align:middle line:84%
imagery will emerge as, well,
they'll show up as holes.

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:43.660 align:middle line:84%
You look at any
visible satellite

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:47.170 align:middle line:84%
imagery on close inspection,
and if the resolution is about 1

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:48.630 align:middle line:84%
kilometer-- this
is for those that

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:51.130 align:middle line:84%
know and want to go looking on
their own-- you'll see holes,

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:52.960 align:middle line:90%
usually a pair of holes.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And if you end up
under those holes,

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:56.510 align:middle line:84%
you'll see the cloud
patterns actually

00:22:56.510 --> 00:23:01.240 align:middle line:84%
change depending on where
they are and cardinal points

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.850 align:middle line:90%
on these holes.

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:06.982 align:middle line:84%
So, what I realized is that
they're using-- exactly.

00:23:06.982 --> 00:23:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm
drawing all this now.

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:09.230 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: They'll
use these holes.

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They look like
feathers and zippers.

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:11.770 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Um-hum.

00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:14.830 align:middle line:84%
They'll use these holes and
rotate them around one another,

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:17.090 align:middle line:84%
and then the storm
is wrapped around

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:19.760 align:middle line:90%
between these two anchor holes.

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:23.150 align:middle line:84%
Being in the Pacific
Northwest, our keen interest

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:25.510 align:middle line:84%
is what's happening
in the Pacific.

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And as you see, what's called
an extra tropical cyclone

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:31.880 align:middle line:84%
or a regular closed low
showing up in the Pacific,

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.920 align:middle line:84%
it should have a circular
opening or a circular point.

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.580 align:middle line:90%
They're all squares now.

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:42.700 align:middle line:84%
They're all elongated squares
with these holes at the end.

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And chemtrails are not
isolated to just where

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:47.110 align:middle line:90%
you are seeing them.

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:48.730 align:middle line:90%
They're a global phenomenon.

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:50.580 align:middle line:84%
You can go way out
into the Pacific.

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:52.560 align:middle line:84%
Hurricane Sandy,
for example, which

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:56.770 align:middle line:84%
had a dramatic impact
on the 2012 elections.

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:58.250 align:middle line:90%
Impacted them directly.

00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:01.660 align:middle line:84%
There's a material
return on that storm,

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:03.910 align:middle line:84%
and our concerned with climate
change, global warming,

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:05.409 align:middle line:84%
we've got to do
something to protect

00:24:05.409 --> 00:24:08.170 align:middle line:84%
the shores, especially of one
of our most expensive cities,

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:10.610 align:middle line:84%
New York, and New
Jersey, and Connecticut.

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:16.176 align:middle line:84%
So, I get an email nine days
ahead of its eventual landfall.

00:24:16.176 --> 00:24:18.300 align:middle line:84%
They're going to bring
Sandy ashore to [INAUDIBLE],

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:20.780 align:middle line:90%
and I'm like, oh, no, no, no.

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:24.510 align:middle line:84%
I looked at the models, and only
one curled Hurricane, Sandy,

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:26.497 align:middle line:90%
into the mid-Atlantic coast.

00:24:26.497 --> 00:24:27.330 align:middle line:10%
So, I wrote it back.

00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:29.550 align:middle line:10%
I said, it's a
possibility, but it really

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:31.620 align:middle line:10%
looks like it's going
to just go out to sea.

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:33.590 align:middle line:84%
So then I wind back,
wind back, wind back.

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:36.366 align:middle line:84%
OK, what's the impulse that
will eventually capture Sandy?

00:24:36.366 --> 00:24:39.550 align:middle line:84%
I find it just coming into
view over the far, far

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:41.460 align:middle line:90%
Western Bering Strait.

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.070 align:middle line:84%
Click over to
water vapor imagery

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:45.260 align:middle line:84%
because these
trails are hugely--

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:48.190 align:middle line:84%
they're ionizable salts,
and they're desiccants.

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:49.190 align:middle line:90%
They pick up water.

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:52.759 align:middle line:84%
And I see that place
hammered with trails.

00:24:52.759 --> 00:24:54.550 align:middle line:84%
Go back and forth, look
at the [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:55.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Traced it.

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:58.250 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And I'm like, oh,
they're going to do something.

00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:00.041 align:middle line:84%
They're going to use
this thing, and that's

00:25:00.041 --> 00:25:01.230 align:middle line:90%
exactly what happened.

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:03.070 align:middle line:84%
It's all the way
as it transitioned

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:05.020 align:middle line:84%
across the far north
Gulf of Alaska,

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:07.530 align:middle line:84%
down into the Western states,
across the Gulf of Mexico,

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:09.734 align:middle line:84%
then arced out across
South Carolina.

00:25:09.734 --> 00:25:14.550 align:middle line:84%
It pulled, literally just like
two balls with a rubber band,

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:16.690 align:middle line:90%
just swung back ashore.

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:19.590 align:middle line:90%
So that was an engineered event.

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:23.770 align:middle line:84%
That was an engineered
event to a political end.

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:26.250 align:middle line:84%
And so, Defense
Secretary William Cohen

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:29.190 align:middle line:84%
back in '97 talks about
"others," quote unquote,

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:34.470 align:middle line:84%
"the infallible others" using
electromagnetic technology

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:37.230 align:middle line:90%
as a form of eco-terrorism.

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:38.930 align:middle line:90%
And so, that's how I look at it.

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:40.660 align:middle line:84%
Weather control is
just eco-terrorism.

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:41.580 align:middle line:90%
Who's your target?

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:43.038 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we
talked about this.

00:25:43.038 --> 00:25:46.620 align:middle line:90%
He who owns the weather wins.

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:48.970 align:middle line:84%
Before when we were
talking on the phone doing

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:51.790 align:middle line:84%
original research a
couple weeks ago or so,

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:54.150 align:middle line:84%
you were talking about this
all started back during,

00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:56.600 align:middle line:84%
essentially, World
War II, so give us

00:25:56.600 --> 00:26:00.080 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of that
background about the psyche

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.570 align:middle line:84%
around the subject of owning
or controlling weather,

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:03.970 align:middle line:90%
and then we'll move forward.

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:05.560 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Battles.

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:09.216 align:middle line:84%
Major battles are won or
lost because of weather.

00:26:09.216 --> 00:26:11.830 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's the
Siege of Stalingrad,

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:13.740 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the
Battle of the Bulge,

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:17.500 align:middle line:84%
whether it's D-day, whether you
can see your target with B-29s

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.930 align:middle line:84%
as you're over
Hiroshima or Nagasaki.

00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:22.120 align:middle line:90%
Weather controls war.

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:25.800 align:middle line:84%
Who wins, who loses, how
long it takes to win or lose,

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:29.380 align:middle line:84%
or to have your
opponent submitted.

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And if you could have
the weather on your side,

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:36.315 align:middle line:84%
it is, as this Air Force paper
says, a force multiplier.

00:26:36.315 --> 00:26:38.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Why go
out hunting deer

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:43.950 align:middle line:84%
with a shotgun when you
can have a sniper rifle?

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:46.170 align:middle line:90%
And that's the difference.

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And the chemtrails
are the laser sight.

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:52.556 align:middle line:84%
There still is a kinetic
weapon, and that's the bullet.

00:26:52.556 --> 00:26:54.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, let's
move it forward.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.690 align:middle line:84%
You said the word
"eco-terrorism."

00:26:56.690 --> 00:27:00.340 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about events
that are well-known

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:04.820 align:middle line:84%
and the ways in which those
storms changed our reality.

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:05.840 align:middle line:90%
We can go to Katrina.

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.190 align:middle line:90%
We can go to any number of them.

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:08.450 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: That's the one
I'm most well-known for.

00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
know that one was--

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:12.284 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: That's the one that
got me fired, was Katrina.

00:27:12.284 --> 00:27:14.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yep.

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:17.200 align:middle line:84%
Yes, so, let's go ahead
and talk about that.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.690 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Because
it was a big event.

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Katrina was a big,
changing event.

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.420 align:middle line:84%
There were great--
and this is all

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:26.940 align:middle line:84%
because some aspects
of what was happening

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:29.370 align:middle line:84%
in the Cabinet of the Bush
administration are now known.

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:32.030 align:middle line:84%
We've got handwritten
notes from Karl Rove

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:34.800 align:middle line:90%
that martial law was the goal.

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.150 align:middle line:90%
That was the goal.

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:38.670 align:middle line:84%
So if they had to blow
levies, even if the hurricane

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:40.470 align:middle line:84%
didn't make landfall
on New Orleans

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:42.420 align:middle line:84%
but was still 90
miles farther east,

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:44.620 align:middle line:84%
that the winds barely got
to hurricane strength,

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:46.579 align:middle line:84%
but yet we still had to
flood out the 9th Ward.

00:27:46.579 --> 00:27:48.161 align:middle line:84%
We still had to
create the conditions.

00:27:48.161 --> 00:27:49.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To get FEMA going.

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:50.770 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: To get the FEMA in.

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
this law called--

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:54.980 align:middle line:84%
we have this point of
crystallization that can then

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:56.450 align:middle line:90%
multiply out from there.

00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:58.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's look at it
from a weather point of view.

00:27:58.110 --> 00:27:58.420 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:00.128 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: There's
still one other thing,

00:28:00.128 --> 00:28:02.290 align:middle line:90%
and that is human nature.

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And more often than not,
because of the evolvement

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:07.880 align:middle line:84%
of the race over the
last couple of centuries,

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:11.340 align:middle line:84%
is we're more inclined to help
one another rather than stab

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:14.200 align:middle line:84%
one another in the back when
these kind of events happen,

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.890 align:middle line:84%
and that is the randomizing
effect that they are not

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:17.690 align:middle line:90%
counting on.

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:18.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's correct.

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:19.280 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It is the goodness--

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of human.

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:21.470 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: --that lies
within each of us.

00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:22.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:23.730 align:middle line:90%
Boy, they don't get that one.

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:24.510 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: No, they don't.

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
can't calculate for it.

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:27.210 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: No.

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:30.290 align:middle line:84%
They can't, and they have
tried, and tried, and tried,

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:31.840 align:middle line:84%
and tried, and can't
get it to catch.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:32.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, OK.

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:34.846 align:middle line:90%
So FEMA showed up.

00:28:34.846 --> 00:28:36.470 align:middle line:84%
Not very effectively,
but no showed up.

00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:37.175 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: No, by design.

00:28:37.175 --> 00:28:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, by
design, not effectively.

00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:40.890 align:middle line:90%
Left people literally stranded.

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:45.930 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: In the hot Superdome,
waiting for chaos to erupt.

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And no, people end up
helping each other as best

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:51.879 align:middle line:84%
they could to the limits of
the resources that they had.

00:28:51.879 --> 00:28:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, the
local government is saying,

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:56.410 align:middle line:84%
guys, you know,
you promised help.

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:57.950 align:middle line:90%
Where is it?

00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until it
got publicly uncomfortable

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:03.860 align:middle line:84%
for the administration to
then let loose the National

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:05.860 align:middle line:84%
Guard, let loose
FEMA, to let loose

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:09.220 align:middle line:84%
the resources that were held
intentionally in reserve.

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And I could see, looking at
the pattern of that hurricane,

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:15.500 align:middle line:84%
that there was this technology,
these resonant patterns,

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:19.205 align:middle line:84%
these sacred geometric
patterns all over Katrina.

00:29:19.205 --> 00:29:20.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I was asking you.

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:22.560 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: All over.

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:26.950 align:middle line:84%
Pentagrams, hexagrams, all of
this other resonance pattern.

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, I think,
at the base of creation,

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:35.270 align:middle line:84%
at the base where the
manifest is yet unseen,

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:38.020 align:middle line:84%
there is this sacred
geometry, and it

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:41.500 align:middle line:84%
manifests in this realm
via boundary layers

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:44.450 align:middle line:84%
that these chemtrails get
juice, that this technology

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:47.210 align:middle line:90%
that they use stimulates.

00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And this was some of
the big resistance

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:52.974 align:middle line:84%
in the wake of Katrina going
big and my getting out there

00:29:52.974 --> 00:29:53.890 align:middle line:90%
on the national stage.

00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:54.880 align:middle line:90%
Because I did BBC.

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.590 align:middle line:90%
I did Lou Dobbs.

00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:59.840 align:middle line:84%
I had Salt Lake sat trucks
up in front of the house.

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:03.350 align:middle line:84%
I had all of that attention,
and the regular meteorologists,

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:05.070 align:middle line:84%
the guys over here
in Boulder at NCAR,

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:07.740 align:middle line:84%
National Center for Atmospheric
Research, how can this happen?

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:11.700 align:middle line:84%
They're stuck in thermodynamics,
that the heat and the humidity

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:16.110 align:middle line:84%
has to be present within the
parcel of atmosphere for effect

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:18.270 align:middle line:90%
to happen, and that's bull.

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:19.070 align:middle line:90%
That's bull.

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And when you begin to understand
how the esoteric and the unseen

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:25.030 align:middle line:84%
realm can be brought
into this realm,

00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:29.290 align:middle line:84%
then the quantity of energy
becomes not a problem.

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:30.980 align:middle line:90%
Not a problem.

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:34.460 align:middle line:84%
Then you can stimulate
a category 1 hurricane

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:36.810 align:middle line:90%
to a category 4 in 18 hours.

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:41.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you, or do you,
still watch to that extent

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:44.600 align:middle line:84%
where you can predict
more or less where

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:48.046 align:middle line:84%
some kind of cataclysmic
event might occur?

00:30:48.046 --> 00:30:49.730 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yeah.

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:50.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:52.050 align:middle line:84%
Although to be honest
with you, there's

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:53.341 align:middle line:90%
a fatigue that's got to set in.

00:30:53.341 --> 00:30:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I understand that.

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:56.812 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: It's
just like, why, why?

00:30:56.812 --> 00:30:58.270 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
use it to whatever

00:30:58.270 --> 00:30:59.510 align:middle line:90%
ends they are that they have.

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:00.468 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I understand.

00:31:00.468 --> 00:31:03.530 align:middle line:84%
There's a point at which all
of that passion and the warrior

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:04.830 align:middle line:90%
just starts getting worn down.

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Like yeah, I mean, I've
pointed it out, guys,

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:08.060 align:middle line:84%
but what are we
going to do about it?

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:08.890 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: What
can we say again?

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:10.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, what are
we going to do about it.

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:12.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's talk about
some of the end effects.

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:15.540 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
drought in the west,

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:20.247 align:middle line:84%
and let's talk about El Nino
and what should have been,

00:31:20.247 --> 00:31:22.080 align:middle line:84%
could have been, what's
happening right now.

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.900 align:middle line:90%
Right now we're in the winter.

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:25.700 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Deep.

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:28.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Deep winter,
so let let's talk

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:31.450 align:middle line:84%
about that and any
other aspect of how

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:34.950 align:middle line:84%
this weather, this
manipulation of weather,

00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:37.015 align:middle line:84%
can affect very large
global economies.

00:31:37.015 --> 00:31:39.350 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I honestly
thought that this

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:41.840 align:middle line:84%
would have been the end
of the California drought,

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.770 align:middle line:84%
that their pattern
in eco-terrorism

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:46.580 align:middle line:90%
is to slam the biosphere.

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:48.890 align:middle line:90%
Too hot, too cold.

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:51.360 align:middle line:90%
Too dry, too wet.

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And in between those
extremes, there

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:57.220 align:middle line:84%
is only a sliver of peace,
and in that sliver of peace

00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:00.210 align:middle line:84%
is where prosperity
and production happens.

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And so, we're
either too stressed

00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:02.780 align:middle line:84%
because we're
dealing with floods,

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:05.071 align:middle line:84%
we're bailing out basements,
we can't get the crops in,

00:32:05.071 --> 00:32:06.350 align:middle line:90%
we can't get the crops out.

00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:08.850 align:middle line:90%
We can't, we can't, we can't.

00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And then when it's too dry, you
go, please, will it harvest?

00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:12.290 align:middle line:90%
Will it mature?

00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:13.870 align:middle line:90%
Will it, will it, will it?

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And so, what could be
an abundant crop ends up

00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:19.250 align:middle line:90%
being at 85% productive.

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And then there's this 15% that
has to come out of storage,

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:25.380 align:middle line:84%
or is of such low quality that
it ends up being animal food,

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:29.070 align:middle line:90%
or is laden with pesticide.

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:32.500 align:middle line:84%
So, there's always a reason
why they do what they do,

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.830 align:middle line:84%
but I really thought
that El Nino would have

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:36.077 align:middle line:90%
had the rivers running high.

00:32:36.077 --> 00:32:37.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
everything you could see--

00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:39.440 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Would have
pointed that direction.

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Would have pointed
that direction, and what

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:43.010 align:middle line:90%
are you seeing instead?

00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:45.540 align:middle line:84%
This is, I think
last I saw, seventh,

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:48.000 align:middle line:84%
maybe it slipped to eighth,
largest economy in the world,

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:48.800 align:middle line:90%
California.

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:50.120 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: All by its lonesome.

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:51.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All by its lonesome.

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:52.975 align:middle line:90%
It's a country unto itself.

00:32:52.975 --> 00:32:54.180 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: In so many ways.

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:55.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In so many ways.

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:55.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm from there.

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:57.020 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:58.360 align:middle line:90%
In so many ways.

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:00.260 align:middle line:84%
They say all the fruits
and nuts rolled west.

00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:01.060 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Right.

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:03.310 align:middle line:90%
And the shells are left.

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:06.582 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, looking at
it from a natural point

00:33:06.582 --> 00:33:08.290 align:middle line:84%
of view of what El
Nino should have been,

00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:09.580 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about
what's happened.

00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:10.370 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: It should
have been raining.

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:12.244 align:middle line:84%
The rain should have
started in late October,

00:33:12.244 --> 00:33:14.700 align:middle line:84%
and the jet stream is
in no configuration

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:17.270 align:middle line:84%
even close to what a typical
El Nino would have been.

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:18.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
they're getting rain

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:20.290 align:middle line:90%
but it's not even close.

00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:22.970 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: It's not even El
Nino rains because that would

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:26.430 align:middle line:84%
require the high pressure ridge
that's been over the Great

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:29.460 align:middle line:84%
Basin to Utah, Western
Colorado, back into California

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:32.500 align:middle line:84%
to give up the ghost and go
migrate to the Carolinas.

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.610 align:middle line:90%
That has not happened.

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:36.100 align:middle line:84%
When that gives
up and moves east,

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:38.683 align:middle line:84%
that allows the Canadian vortex
that's usually over the Hudson

00:33:38.683 --> 00:33:42.470 align:middle line:84%
Bay to migrate west, and then
that sets up the entire Pacific

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:45.580 align:middle line:84%
to hammer the western
US so you end up

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:49.490 align:middle line:84%
getting an entire winter, winter
and a half, worth of moisture.

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:52.786 align:middle line:84%
And that ridge is
locked in place.

00:33:52.786 --> 00:33:53.910 align:middle line:90%
It's in the mountains west.

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:56.650 align:middle line:84%
It'll give up the ghost
for 24, 48, 72 hours tops.

00:33:56.650 --> 00:33:58.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Enough to
give a window of rain.

00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.730 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And then
the "press" can

00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:01.230 align:middle line:84%
say we're getting
our El Nino rains,

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:03.130 align:middle line:84%
but when you look
back at climatology

00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:06.334 align:middle line:84%
and how much is actually come,
we're still shy of even normal.

00:34:06.334 --> 00:34:08.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it
was supposed to be,

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.735 align:middle line:84%
what, 25 to 100
inches was predicted?

00:34:10.735 --> 00:34:11.699 align:middle line:90%
What have they gotten?

00:34:11.699 --> 00:34:13.290 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Not near that.

00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:14.090 align:middle line:90%
Not near that.

00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:17.210 align:middle line:84%
Most of the places aren't
10 to 15 inches yet.

00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:24.288 align:middle line:84%
And usually, how January goes
is how the winter is going end.

00:34:24.288 --> 00:34:28.060 align:middle line:84%
You get a-- I've
seen enough of them

00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:30.510 align:middle line:84%
that usually if you
don't get it by January,

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:32.652 align:middle line:84%
you're just limping through
the rest of the winter.

00:34:32.652 --> 00:34:34.219 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Instead,
what we have is

00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:36.190 align:middle line:84%
a lot of really chilly
patterns in the west.

00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:38.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, here we have
the warm patterns

00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:41.060 align:middle line:84%
that everybody's been writing
about on the East Coast, 70

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:43.000 align:middle line:84%
degrees at winter
on the East Coast,

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.570 align:middle line:84%
where in Sedona,
every day I woke up,

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:47.800 align:middle line:84%
it was under 30 degrees
for quite a while.

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.799 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: So, we'll get
the illusion of winter.

00:34:49.799 --> 00:34:52.880 align:middle line:84%
We'll get the illusion of El
Nino but without the meat,

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:55.500 align:middle line:84%
without the substance that needs
to come out of the mountains

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:56.850 align:middle line:90%
when the melt begins in April.

00:34:56.850 --> 00:34:58.475 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In order
to keep that economy

00:34:58.475 --> 00:34:59.602 align:middle line:90%
and that produce flowing.

00:34:59.602 --> 00:35:01.060 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And it's
not sustainable

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:02.351 align:middle line:90%
with these precipitation rates.

00:35:02.351 --> 00:35:04.220 align:middle line:90%
It's simply not sustainable.

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And so, you see these
orchards being pulled up

00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:10.970 align:middle line:84%
by machinery, tree after
tree after almond tree being

00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:12.414 align:middle line:90%
pulled up.

00:35:12.414 --> 00:35:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And it hurts because I like
my almonds, I really do.

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: My dad, we had
almond farms as kids.

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:20.143 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I like
them, I really do.

00:35:20.143 --> 00:35:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
price of them, which

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:23.820 align:middle line:84%
has become a real
staple globally,

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:28.470 align:middle line:84%
especially in the Americas,
has, well, almost doubled.

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:31.420 align:middle line:84%
The prices have almost doubled
as a result of poor production.

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:32.461 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: And it has to.

00:35:32.461 --> 00:35:34.730 align:middle line:84%
That's just basic economics,
supply and demand.

00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And I don't buy them
to the rate that I

00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:39.140 align:middle line:90%
used to even just last year.

00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:40.290 align:middle line:90%
Just, I don't.

00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:43.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's look at it more
from what people commonly call

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:46.720 align:middle line:90%
a conspiratorial point of view.

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:48.367 align:middle line:84%
What's going on,
in your opinion?

00:35:48.367 --> 00:35:49.950 align:middle line:84%
You've thought about
this a long time.

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:50.390 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: I have.

00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:51.806 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've
studied it a lot.

00:35:51.806 --> 00:35:53.820 align:middle line:84%
This is really your
life, is figuring out

00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:55.550 align:middle line:90%
why are they doing this?

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:58.600 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: It comes down
to anticipating an endgame.

00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:01.840 align:middle line:84%
Because I know in their
mind, in their world,

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:06.550 align:middle line:84%
there has to be a way
out of this program,

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:10.550 align:middle line:84%
and there is a truth of either
CO2 is keeping the planet warm,

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:13.420 align:middle line:84%
and we need to institute a
program, a geoengineering

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:15.595 align:middle line:84%
program, to counter
this warming, which

00:36:15.595 --> 00:36:17.720 align:middle line:84%
now hasn't really been
evident for nearly 20 years.

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:20.426 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I just read an article
on a mini ice age coming.

00:36:20.426 --> 00:36:23.357 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And that's the
view that I subscribe to,

00:36:23.357 --> 00:36:24.940 align:middle line:84%
is that that's what
we're headed into.

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
politically, let's go there.

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:31.310 align:middle line:90%
Carbon credits.

00:36:31.310 --> 00:36:32.735 align:middle line:90%
The climate conference in Paris.

00:36:32.735 --> 00:36:35.440 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Who gets money
from carbon credits?

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:36.770 align:middle line:90%
Who benefits?

00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:37.570 align:middle line:90%
Wall Street.

00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:38.475 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:38.475 --> 00:36:39.433 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Wall Street.

00:36:39.433 --> 00:36:42.790 align:middle line:84%
So, we had this illusory
need to trade carbon credits.

00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:44.594 align:middle line:84%
Can I trade your
breath for a mine,

00:36:44.594 --> 00:36:45.760 align:middle line:90%
or do we just-- [BREATHING].

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:46.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And who's
going to lose?

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:48.670 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Yeah, who's going
to-- there's always a loser.

00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:49.550 align:middle line:84%
There's always
somebody who pays.

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:50.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Who's going
to lose on those trades?

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Yep, then
it's the cattle.

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:53.225 align:middle line:90%
It's us.

00:36:53.225 --> 00:36:54.025 align:middle line:90%
It's us.

00:36:54.025 --> 00:36:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, you
pretty much subscribe

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:59.960 align:middle line:84%
to the whole global
warming thing.

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:02.720 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Trust me, I talked
to third, and fourth, and fifth,

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.490 align:middle line:84%
and sixth graders
while I was on the air.

00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:06.770 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I did that.

00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:07.790 align:middle line:90%
I did that schtick.

00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:08.590 align:middle line:90%
I did it.

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:11.240 align:middle line:90%
I did my duty to the mainstream.

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:12.640 align:middle line:90%
I did it.

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And once I came-- well, it
changed my worldview in '04.

00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:20.270 align:middle line:84%
If they're playing
with the weather,

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:24.152 align:middle line:84%
the baseline of what's
really happening is lost.

00:37:24.152 --> 00:37:24.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:27.031 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: We don't know
what's really happening.

00:37:27.031 --> 00:37:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: that's correct.

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:29.450 align:middle line:90%
Perfect answer.

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:30.950 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: So, how do
you say it's warming?

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:32.340 align:middle line:90%
How do you say it's cooling?

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And the sun is profoundly
signaling ice age.

00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:36.590 align:middle line:90%
It's going quiet.

00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:38.770 align:middle line:90%
That is very, very clear.

00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:43.090 align:middle line:84%
So, the only conclusion, then,
that this program is being

00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:46.410 align:middle line:90%
used for is to keep us warm.

00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:49.780 align:middle line:84%
It's only there to keep us warm
and to create these big issues

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:52.340 align:middle line:84%
so we'll voluntarily "please
tax me so we don't have any more

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:54.370 align:middle line:90%
tornadoes, please!

00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:56.400 align:middle line:90%
God, this has got to stop!

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:57.330 align:middle line:90%
Tax me!"

00:37:57.330 --> 00:38:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they want us
beaten into submission to,

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:03.520 align:middle line:84%
so we'll willingly bring
upon geoengineering rather

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:06.080 align:middle line:84%
than to say, well, we've really
been doing it all this time,

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:10.770 align:middle line:84%
and then Sierra Club and
National Environmental Defense

00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:13.412 align:middle line:84%
Fund all have to throw up this
feign of, oh, my God, you know,

00:38:13.412 --> 00:38:14.620 align:middle line:90%
you're going to mess with it.

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:15.994 align:middle line:84%
You don't know
what you're doing.

00:38:15.994 --> 00:38:18.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, yeah, we've been
doing it for 60 years.

00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:19.300 align:middle line:90%
You didn't know that.

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But aren't these
groups fully aware of that,

00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:22.605 align:middle line:90%
do you think?

00:38:22.605 --> 00:38:24.060 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: I don't know.

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:26.560 align:middle line:84%
Publicly, they are
not, and they are not

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:28.177 align:middle line:90%
willing to go there, either.

00:38:28.177 --> 00:38:29.510 align:middle line:90%
They're not willing to go there.

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:31.940 align:middle line:84%
So, I quit writing checks
to them 10 years ago.

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:33.170 align:middle line:90%
You guys are frauds.

00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:35.990 align:middle line:84%
Top to bottom, you're frauds,
because if you won't even

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:39.240 align:middle line:84%
look at this issue, what's
the point of supporting you?

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:40.250 align:middle line:90%
It's so apparent.

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:41.050 align:middle line:90%
It's so apparent.

00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:42.508 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so,
now it's changed.

00:38:42.508 --> 00:38:44.860 align:middle line:84%
The language isn't so much
global warming anymore

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:45.661 align:middle line:90%
as climate change.

00:38:45.661 --> 00:38:46.460 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Sure.

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:47.320 align:middle line:90%
Define that for me.

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:48.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
what does that mean?

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:50.870 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, if you're changing the
weather all over the planet

00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:53.510 align:middle line:84%
willfully, we do
have climate change.

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:55.460 align:middle line:84%
You could stop playing
with it, and then we

00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:57.650 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't need to have
all of your intervention,

00:38:57.650 --> 00:38:59.780 align:middle line:84%
and your carbon
credits, and so forth.

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:01.550 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And that's
another question

00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:03.216 align:middle line:84%
that I would like to
know the answer to,

00:39:03.216 --> 00:39:07.460 align:middle line:84%
is what would happen if
we stopped cold turkey?

00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:08.700 align:middle line:90%
Planes didn't fly at all.

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:09.950 align:middle line:90%
All the technology turned off.

00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:10.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Have you
ever modeled it?

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:11.900 align:middle line:90%
What would happen?

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:13.810 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: What would happen.

00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:16.770 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea, and I
don't know that they know,

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:19.560 align:middle line:84%
and they might be
terrified to find out.

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:20.360 align:middle line:90%
Terrified.

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:21.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:22.880 align:middle line:84%
They've been
controlling it so long.

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:24.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, at least
they can predict

00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:27.126 align:middle line:84%
what's going to happen because
they're going to create it.

00:39:27.126 --> 00:39:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And I've seen enough
breaks and trails, and smears

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:32.460 align:middle line:84%
and trails, that other planes
come along precisely, and mark

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:33.630 align:middle line:90%
out dispersion patterns.

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:35.800 align:middle line:84%
So, these planes are
doing a ballet in the sky

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:38.600 align:middle line:84%
so they know exactly,
I mean, exactly what's

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.490 align:middle line:84%
happening with the
atmosphere, top to bottom.

00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:41.290 align:middle line:90%
Top to bottom.

00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:44.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, why do we
have these natural disasters

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:46.327 align:middle line:84%
continuing to occur in
third world nations?

00:39:46.327 --> 00:39:47.410 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: They want them.

00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:48.270 align:middle line:90%
They want them.

00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:50.186 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because they
have so little strength

00:39:50.186 --> 00:39:52.699 align:middle line:84%
and play in the larger
picture, often, anyway?

00:39:52.699 --> 00:39:54.240 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Yes and
no, and now that's

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:55.640 align:middle line:90%
going another rabbit hole.

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:56.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, let's.

00:39:56.610 --> 00:39:57.880 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: You're too willing.

00:39:57.880 --> 00:39:59.212 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:39:59.212 --> 00:40:00.100 align:middle line:90%


00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:05.150 align:middle line:84%
It comes down to another
aspect of human nature,

00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:08.370 align:middle line:84%
that we are not just
physical beings, that there's

00:40:08.370 --> 00:40:09.540 align:middle line:90%
an energetic part of us.

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:10.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:12.760 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And either
we're in a good space.

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:16.350 align:middle line:84%
We are in love and
contentment and gratitude,

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:17.780 align:middle line:90%
or we are in despair.

00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:18.600 align:middle line:90%
We are in fear.

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:21.410 align:middle line:90%
We are in a mode of flight.

00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And they're very different
energetic profiles,

00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:27.460 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to attract
different entities depending

00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:29.280 align:middle line:90%
on what you exude.

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:31.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
talking about entities

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:33.520 align:middle line:84%
as in interdimensional or
other than human entities.

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:34.320 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Sure.

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:35.620 align:middle line:90%
All life feeds on life.

00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:36.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: So, plants feed off
the minerals, animals feed off

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:42.780 align:middle line:84%
the plants, and we feed off
that other, higher animal form

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:45.040 align:middle line:84%
plus the plants, so we're
at the top of that pyramid.

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.520 align:middle line:90%
Or are we?

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:48.620 align:middle line:90%
What's just above us?

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And now we're in
the unseen realms

00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:52.620 align:middle line:84%
where the occult is very,
very popular and very, very

00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:55.715 align:middle line:84%
powerful, and that's where the
elites have their play day.

00:40:55.715 --> 00:40:57.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
that's where you're

00:40:57.090 --> 00:41:01.630 align:middle line:84%
talking about using human
emotions, thought forms and so

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:04.622 align:middle line:84%
forth, as a type
of fuel or food.

00:41:04.622 --> 00:41:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: What's the difference
between a day in Cleveland

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:11.240 align:middle line:84%
that is sunny and 55 in January
versus one that is cloudy?

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:13.190 align:middle line:84%
You've got sleet
that's 34 degrees,

00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:15.550 align:middle line:84%
and there's a north
wind off the lake?

00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:17.455 align:middle line:84%
There's a very different
energetic profile.

00:41:17.455 --> 00:41:19.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And obviously,
throughout history there

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.000 align:middle line:84%
have always been
changes in the weather.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:21.320 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Obviously.

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have your winter,
and you have your summer.

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.680 align:middle line:84%
You have your happy days, and
you have your rainy, sad days.

00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:25.430 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: We feel them.

00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:28.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we feel them,
and you're saying that this is

00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:32.750 align:middle line:84%
being amplified so that
we can have more of a--

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:33.550 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Feast.

00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:34.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Feast.

00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:35.920 align:middle line:84%
They, whoever they
are, might have

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:38.530 align:middle line:84%
more of a feast on
these downward spiraling

00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:40.192 align:middle line:90%
emotions of despair.

00:41:40.192 --> 00:41:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, it's not
just being depressed

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:42.920 align:middle line:90%
because it's a rainy day.

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:43.660 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: It's much
bigger than that.

00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:44.676 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: People are in despair.

00:41:44.676 --> 00:41:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Yeah, it's
bigger than that.

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:47.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:50.379 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And
economically, there's

00:41:50.379 --> 00:41:51.670 align:middle line:90%
an agenda as well with warfare.

00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:52.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I'm saying.

00:41:52.330 --> 00:41:54.150 align:middle line:84%
That's why I brought
up California

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:57.645 align:middle line:84%
and the starving of the seventh
largest economy in the world.

00:41:57.645 --> 00:41:59.270 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And it is
a beautiful state.

00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:00.070 align:middle line:84%
It is a beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful state.

00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:00.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's so gorgeous.

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:02.205 align:middle line:90%
Everything is in California.

00:42:02.205 --> 00:42:03.250 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Everything is.

00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:04.944 align:middle line:84%
And who wouldn't
want to be there?

00:42:04.944 --> 00:42:06.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now,
let's go into this.

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:09.120 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about now
we're down the rabbit hole.

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:11.880 align:middle line:84%
The one thing about California
and the West in general,

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:16.300 align:middle line:84%
and someone might take
exception to my saying this,

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:21.170 align:middle line:84%
but these are, to me, the most
creative zones on the planet.

00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:21.970 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Agreed.

00:42:21.970 --> 00:42:25.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And part of it, like
my family, no one's from there.

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:27.720 align:middle line:84%
My parents each went to look
for their own pot of gold

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:30.700 align:middle line:84%
when they were young, and met
each other in San Francisco,

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:31.520 align:middle line:90%
and had me.

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:33.310 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm a first
generation Californian,

00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:35.970 align:middle line:84%
but there weren't
a lot of people

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:37.610 align:middle line:90%
in California at that time.

00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:39.120 align:middle line:90%
So, everyone left their family.

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:39.915 align:middle line:90%
They left their tradition.

00:42:39.915 --> 00:42:40.360 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: They immigrated.

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:41.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They immigrated.

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.967 align:middle line:84%
It was a mass immigration
west, domestic immigration.

00:42:43.967 --> 00:42:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Of talent, of talent.

00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:48.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: of people looking
for something better.

00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:50.560 align:middle line:84%
They were leaving
behind restriction,

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:52.600 align:middle line:84%
and the creativity
that came out of that

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:56.220 align:middle line:84%
in this next generation, and
now even subsequent generations,

00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:58.630 align:middle line:84%
is very free
spirited compared to,

00:42:58.630 --> 00:43:00.530 align:middle line:84%
really, anywhere
else on the planet.

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:01.356 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Agreed.

00:43:01.356 --> 00:43:02.156 align:middle line:90%
Agreed.

00:43:02.156 --> 00:43:04.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, what happens
when you take that population,

00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:09.310 align:middle line:90%
and they are in despair?

00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:10.914 align:middle line:84%
The creative zones
of the planet?

00:43:10.914 --> 00:43:12.580 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: They move
to the front range.

00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:14.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You can keep moving--

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.700 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yeah, you can.

00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:15.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you're
talking about--

00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:17.290 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Millions of people.

00:43:17.290 --> 00:43:18.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Millions of people.

00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:19.530 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Upwards of
40 million in the state.

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:20.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's coming
close to 40 million people.

00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:21.912 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Very close.

00:43:21.912 --> 00:43:23.370 align:middle line:84%
I think there are
other things that

00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:26.210 align:middle line:84%
are going to happen in
and around California,

00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:29.805 align:middle line:84%
and the elite always telegraph
these messages ahead of time.

00:43:29.805 --> 00:43:31.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, let's talk
about the telegraphing.

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:33.210 align:middle line:90%
What are we being told?

00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:36.070 align:middle line:84%
What's hiding in plain
sight for those who can see?

00:43:36.070 --> 00:43:37.780 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Get away
from the coast.

00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:41.500 align:middle line:84%
I think they're really
telling people to come inland.

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:45.100 align:middle line:84%
I firmly, firmly, firmly
believe that it's not

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:48.720 align:middle line:90%
the time to be on the coast.

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:51.820 align:middle line:84%
I was personally directed
through similar experiences

00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:56.110 align:middle line:84%
with those very near me to
be high in the mountains.

00:43:56.110 --> 00:43:58.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I get
the same messaging,

00:43:58.230 --> 00:44:01.720 align:middle line:84%
and I'm in a nice, pretty
stable place up there Sedona,

00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:05.650 align:middle line:84%
in the rocks at 4,500 feet,
but it because of that.

00:44:05.650 --> 00:44:07.611 align:middle line:84%
Yet, my loved ones
are on the coast.

00:44:07.611 --> 00:44:09.610 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And so, why
are people in California?

00:44:09.610 --> 00:44:11.020 align:middle line:90%
What draws them there?

00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
the other aspect

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:14.840 align:middle line:84%
that we've all had
many, many past lives,

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:17.230 align:middle line:84%
and we tend to
repeat patterns from

00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:19.250 align:middle line:90%
those previous experiences.

00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And there are
other civilizations

00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:24.500 align:middle line:84%
which have adored the
water, were right there,

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:26.511 align:middle line:90%
and then it all ended.

00:44:26.511 --> 00:44:27.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And?

00:44:27.330 --> 00:44:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And they're
those same people.

00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:31.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, from
that point of view.

00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:34.680 align:middle line:84%
That's what I was going
to say as an overlay.

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:40.550 align:middle line:84%
Some of the remnants of the
even earliest Lemurian cultures,

00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:44.540 align:middle line:84%
some of that energy, and spirit,
and reincarnations of entities

00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:46.645 align:middle line:90%
exists all along the West Coast.

00:44:46.645 --> 00:44:47.910 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yep, all along.

00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And one of the other
experiences that my partner had

00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:53.390 align:middle line:84%
was that they're like
lemmings to the sea.

00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:54.690 align:middle line:90%
Lemmings to the sea.

00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:56.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which is natural.

00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:57.415 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: It is
natural, but they have

00:44:57.415 --> 00:44:58.230 align:middle line:90%
to be given their experience.

00:44:58.230 --> 00:44:58.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
it was beautiful.

00:44:58.800 --> 00:44:59.965 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: And it still is.

00:44:59.965 --> 00:45:01.048 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is beautiful.

00:45:01.048 --> 00:45:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: It still
is, but that doesn't

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:04.760 align:middle line:84%
mean the elite
can't make it more

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:06.945 align:middle line:84%
and more uncomfortable
for those to stay there.

00:45:06.945 --> 00:45:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And those that are like, OK,
you know, I kind of give up.

00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:12.295 align:middle line:84%
I give up on the hustle, the
bustle, the expense of it.

00:45:12.295 --> 00:45:13.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, outrageous.

00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:16.150 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: The cost of living
there on so many levels

00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:19.590 align:middle line:84%
and choose to go
somewhere else, and I

00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:20.844 align:middle line:90%
think that's what's underway.

00:45:20.844 --> 00:45:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how
much time there is.

00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:25.320 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how much time.

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:27.870 align:middle line:84%
But I think because
you and I have

00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:32.630 align:middle line:84%
had those instincts-- I grew
up in Idaho listening to KFI

00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:35.669 align:middle line:84%
and-- obviously KNBR
in San Francisco.

00:45:35.669 --> 00:45:36.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: San Francisco, right.

00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:40.100 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And I adored
California, and I wanted to go,

00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:40.900 align:middle line:90%
wanted to go.

00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:41.775 align:middle line:90%
I really, really did.

00:45:41.775 --> 00:45:44.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah, I was
there through all of it,

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:46.470 align:middle line:90%
the leading edge of all of it.

00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And there is something
that is still--

00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:53.780 align:middle line:84%
for the adventurous
of spirit and mind,

00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:56.230 align:middle line:84%
it's still an incredible
draw, but as you say,

00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:59.180 align:middle line:84%
the people, and my family and
friends who are still there,

00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:01.440 align:middle line:84%
there is a fatigue that's
starting to set in.

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:06.590 align:middle line:84%
The crowding, the notion that
resources are becoming scarcer.

00:46:06.590 --> 00:46:07.550 align:middle line:90%
The almond crops.

00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:08.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, everybody's
drinking almond milk

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:09.890 align:middle line:84%
because they're
allergic to dairy.

00:46:09.890 --> 00:46:11.335 align:middle line:90%
Boom, it's doubled in price.

00:46:11.335 --> 00:46:12.920 align:middle line:84%
All of these things
are happening

00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:15.440 align:middle line:84%
to dampen the spirit there,
and that's what I'm getting to,

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:19.920 align:middle line:84%
is this as a spiritual issue,
this wet weather modification

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:21.345 align:middle line:90%
and its effect on our spirit.

00:46:21.345 --> 00:46:22.500 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It is.

00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's just,
again, one of their tools

00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:28.000 align:middle line:84%
where they're telegraphing
those that can hear,

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.900 align:middle line:84%
those that can see,
that it's time to leave.

00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:32.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, what
do you see-- well,

00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:34.950 align:middle line:84%
as you say many, mountain
tops, go up high.

00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:35.320 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yeah, mountain tops.

00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:36.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm at 8,000 feet.

00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:36.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you're Crestone.

00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:37.190 align:middle line:90%
You're way up there.

00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:39.340 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: To be honest
with you, I'm way up high.

00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And that was a series of
inner visions given to someone

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:46.399 align:middle line:84%
I know very closely, and his
mom kept coming till to him

00:46:46.399 --> 00:46:47.940 align:middle line:84%
and said you need
to find this place.

00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:50.810 align:middle line:90%
You need to find this place.

00:46:50.810 --> 00:46:53.325 align:middle line:84%
And found it, and
moved there in '10.

00:46:53.325 --> 00:46:55.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and that's
how I feel about Sedona.

00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:57.541 align:middle line:84%
It's like that's
my landing place.

00:46:57.541 --> 00:46:58.790 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It's your treasure.

00:46:58.790 --> 00:47:00.164 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
where I'm supposed

00:47:00.164 --> 00:47:03.190 align:middle line:84%
to be through these
times, and it pains me

00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:05.710 align:middle line:84%
because of all the people I
love that are on the coast.

00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:08.330 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I love the food
in San Francisco, and then

00:47:08.330 --> 00:47:08.690 align:middle line:90%
the people.

00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:09.415 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's my own city.

00:47:09.415 --> 00:47:10.030 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:11.095 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It's a playground.

00:47:11.095 --> 00:47:12.000 align:middle line:90%
It's already a playground.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know it is but there
is something else going on.

00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say
that even going back

00:47:17.170 --> 00:47:21.880 align:middle line:84%
to San Francisco, which
I do all the time,

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:23.650 align:middle line:84%
there's a different
energy there now.

00:47:23.650 --> 00:47:27.310 align:middle line:90%
It is becoming darker.

00:47:27.310 --> 00:47:28.119 align:middle line:90%
Have you seen that?

00:47:28.119 --> 00:47:30.410 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I had a dream
about San Francisco, recently.

00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:31.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tell us.

00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:33.350 align:middle line:84%
Tell us because I'm
feeling it every time I go.

00:47:33.350 --> 00:47:34.180 align:middle line:90%
It makes me sad.

00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:36.200 align:middle line:84%
It's not the happy day
it was when I was a kid.

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:37.420 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And it has
kind of a freaky end.

00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:38.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I don't mind.

00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:41.380 align:middle line:84%
Just share with us because if we
have friends and family, maybe

00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:42.690 align:middle line:84%
we can get them to
come be with us.

00:47:42.690 --> 00:47:43.856 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: I was in a plane.

00:47:43.856 --> 00:47:46.460 align:middle line:84%
It was a commercial
plane, and we're

00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:47.800 align:middle line:90%
coming into San Francisco.

00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And two lady pilots,
both black, and there's

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:53.720 align:middle line:84%
another black lady sitting
maybe two seats in front of me.

00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:56.324 align:middle line:84%
And I came into the
dream in this experience,

00:47:56.324 --> 00:47:57.740 align:middle line:84%
and I gave the
lady in front of me

00:47:57.740 --> 00:48:01.170 align:middle line:84%
a kiss to give forward to the
pilot, just an appreciation

00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:02.670 align:middle line:84%
for doing the great
things they do.

00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Their
skill and talent.

00:48:03.090 --> 00:48:03.965 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Thank you.

00:48:03.965 --> 00:48:06.160 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for getting
me there safely.

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:08.470 align:middle line:84%
But then parts of this
plane start coming apart,

00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:10.280 align:middle line:90%
and people are sucked out.

00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:13.480 align:middle line:84%
Up front, up front, up
front, and then the plane's

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:16.800 align:middle line:84%
coming into this flare to
land into San Francisco.

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:19.220 align:middle line:84%
Two guys to my side and to
the back, part of the plane

00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:21.710 align:middle line:84%
opens up, and they
get sucked out of it.

00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:22.890 align:middle line:90%
Guys, sorry!

00:48:22.890 --> 00:48:24.330 align:middle line:90%
Didn't make it.

00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:26.830 align:middle line:84%
The plane lands,
and we're trying

00:48:26.830 --> 00:48:28.670 align:middle line:90%
to get towards the tarmac.

00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:32.590 align:middle line:84%
I look out the windows, and
there are bodies everywhere.

00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:35.740 align:middle line:84%
Mothers clutching kids,
and the whole thing

00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:37.322 align:middle line:90%
had this cast of gray.

00:48:37.322 --> 00:48:39.780 align:middle line:84%
All the color was gray, and
there were a few people walking

00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:41.880 align:middle line:84%
around, but they really
didn't know where to go

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:43.496 align:middle line:90%
and what to do.

00:48:43.496 --> 00:48:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And so, we just kind of have
this quick little discussion

00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:48.110 align:middle line:84%
on the plane and decide
it's not safe to stay.

00:48:48.110 --> 00:48:49.620 align:middle line:90%
We cannot disembark here.

00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:52.890 align:middle line:84%
Despite the condition of the
aircraft, we needed to go.

00:48:52.890 --> 00:48:55.660 align:middle line:84%
It was decided we'd
go north to Portland.

00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And so, she applies the
throttle to the plane,

00:48:57.730 --> 00:49:00.190 align:middle line:90%
and we're not moving.

00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:01.110 align:middle line:90%
We're not moving.

00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:03.190 align:middle line:84%
So, she turns it
hard to the right,

00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:04.750 align:middle line:84%
and we realize
that we're dragging

00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:08.500 align:middle line:84%
this ladder, this yellow
ladder, this embarking,

00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:12.330 align:middle line:84%
disembarking ladder, and we're
tangled up on the wheels.

00:49:12.330 --> 00:49:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Somebody volunteers to get
off and disentangle it.

00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:18.060 align:middle line:84%
That happens, he
gets back on safely.

00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:19.100 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:21.504 align:middle line:84%
And then we throttle
forward to get airborne.

00:49:21.504 --> 00:49:22.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To Portland.

00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:23.628 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: To go to Portland.

00:49:23.628 --> 00:49:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And I know these
planes usually fly

00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:27.660 align:middle line:84%
with no more fuel
than an hour extra,

00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:29.995 align:middle line:84%
so Portland would
have been a stretch.

00:49:29.995 --> 00:49:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking
Sacramento would

00:49:31.370 --> 00:49:32.410 align:middle line:90%
have been a much safer move.

00:49:32.410 --> 00:49:33.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Much safer, yeah.

00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:34.860 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: But way
too low in elevation.

00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:36.360 align:middle line:84%
Not that Portland
isn't, but we just

00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:39.739 align:middle line:84%
decided Portland was
the better place to go.

00:49:39.739 --> 00:49:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's crazy because
there was a lot of energy.

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:44.160 align:middle line:84%
There was a job for me that
showed up in San Francisco,

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:47.880 align:middle line:84%
and all the wind for me to
want to have that opportunity

00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:48.680 align:middle line:90%
is gone.

00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:49.980 align:middle line:90%
I have no desire.

00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:50.925 align:middle line:90%
No desire.

00:49:50.925 --> 00:49:52.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:49:52.310 --> 00:49:55.280 align:middle line:84%
About three or four years
ago, I was there with my son,

00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:59.740 align:middle line:84%
and I said, you know, I
just have this sad feeling.

00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:01.960 align:middle line:84%
We're looking out
from China Basin.

00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:03.450 align:middle line:84%
We're looking out
on all of this,

00:50:03.450 --> 00:50:07.260 align:middle line:84%
and I've grown up with this, and
it's so deep in the my fabric.

00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:11.000 align:middle line:84%
It's my city, and it makes me
teary still thinking about it,

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.760 align:middle line:84%
that this just isn't
going to continue.

00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:14.640 align:middle line:90%
I don't know when.

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:15.360 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It's unsustainable.

00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:17.068 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it's
not going to continue,

00:50:17.068 --> 00:50:19.930 align:middle line:84%
and it was a very sad feeling,
really visceral feeling,

00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:23.330 align:middle line:84%
that whether it's now, whether
it's 10 years, whether it's

00:50:23.330 --> 00:50:27.370 align:middle line:84%
100 years in the future, this
beautiful thing was not going

00:50:27.370 --> 00:50:30.250 align:middle line:90%
to be there in the same way.

00:50:30.250 --> 00:50:32.630 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I'm feeling
we're at a point where

00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:33.855 align:middle line:90%
it's weeks to months.

00:50:33.855 --> 00:50:34.655 align:middle line:90%
Weeks to months.

00:50:34.655 --> 00:50:37.162 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:50:37.162 --> 00:50:39.245 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Things are that
close, weeks to months.

00:50:39.245 --> 00:50:40.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:42.590 align:middle line:90%
Well, we'll tuck that one away.

00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:44.712 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And the
other thing is nobody--

00:50:44.712 --> 00:50:45.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No one knows.

00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:47.180 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: --goes
before their time.

00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:48.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No one goes
before-- exactly.

00:50:48.850 --> 00:50:51.062 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's got a
built-in expiration date,

00:50:51.062 --> 00:50:53.270 align:middle line:84%
and it's not going to happen
if it's not supposed to.

00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:54.590 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: It doesn't
matter if you smoke or not.

00:50:54.590 --> 00:50:55.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're right.

00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:56.575 align:middle line:90%
I'm a big subscriber.

00:50:56.575 --> 00:50:57.580 align:middle line:90%
I've written about that.

00:50:57.580 --> 00:50:58.570 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:50:58.570 --> 00:51:01.340 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: The day comes, and
you'll be glad when it comes.

00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:02.460 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, I'm outta here.

00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:03.260 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:04.218 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:51:04.218 --> 00:51:06.653 align:middle line:84%
So, that's built-in on
a soul contract level,

00:51:06.653 --> 00:51:09.370 align:middle line:84%
so we shouldn't be
freaked out over that.

00:51:09.370 --> 00:51:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: That's a
big point of contention

00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:14.216 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people
don't believe that.

00:51:14.216 --> 00:51:15.840 align:middle line:84%
They don't have that
understanding yet.

00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:18.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They think they're
at the whim of something else.

00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:19.250 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Yes, of
an anti-aging drug,

00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:21.416 align:middle line:84%
or if do this, or do that,
I'm going to live longer,

00:51:21.416 --> 00:51:23.890 align:middle line:84%
and that is one of the biggest
illusions that you can have.

00:51:23.890 --> 00:51:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors, the
whole medical industry,

00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:27.410 align:middle line:90%
holds that over people's head.

00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:28.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know, and
it's always shocking

00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:30.750 align:middle line:84%
when some long distance
runner and trainer that's

00:51:30.750 --> 00:51:32.894 align:middle line:84%
done everything right
drops dead at 40.

00:51:32.894 --> 00:51:34.060 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Hello, time's up.

00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:34.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:35.858 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Soul's gone.

00:51:35.858 --> 00:51:38.737 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, now, you brought
something up a little bit ago.

00:51:38.737 --> 00:51:39.536 align:middle line:90%
We just--

00:51:39.536 --> 00:51:40.460 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Few minutes left?

00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we only
have a few minutes left.

00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:45.090 align:middle line:84%
Part of it for you is
you moved to Crestone.

00:51:45.090 --> 00:51:47.750 align:middle line:84%
You kind of disconnected
from the economic system

00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:50.770 align:middle line:84%
because you could see
this is all interwoven.

00:51:50.770 --> 00:51:54.290 align:middle line:84%
Whatever this control is that
feeds on despair is interwoven.

00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:56.290 align:middle line:84%
And so, for you, you went
a different direction.

00:51:56.290 --> 00:51:58.320 align:middle line:84%
We only have like three
or four minutes left.

00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
direction you've gone.

00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:02.030 align:middle line:84%
How hard was it to
wean yourself off

00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:05.110 align:middle line:84%
of mainstream life, television,
having your audience to where

00:52:05.110 --> 00:52:05.910 align:middle line:90%
you are now?

00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:07.451 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I'll do
that very quickly.

00:52:07.451 --> 00:52:08.361 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:08.361 --> 00:52:09.985 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Psychologically,
spiritually.

00:52:09.985 --> 00:52:11.070 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yeah.

00:52:11.070 --> 00:52:12.220 align:middle line:90%
But I was itchy.

00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:13.620 align:middle line:84%
I knew something
else was coming.

00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:16.320 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely knew, and I'd
even told my general manager

00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:18.690 align:middle line:84%
that I wouldn't renew
contract at the end.

00:52:18.690 --> 00:52:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And I was only going
to be 41 in 2007,

00:52:21.570 --> 00:52:22.980 align:middle line:90%
but I can't do this anymore.

00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:25.050 align:middle line:84%
I can't. there's
something else coming.

00:52:25.050 --> 00:52:27.410 align:middle line:84%
But when I moved
to Colorado, I had

00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:29.380 align:middle line:84%
met somebody who'd be
very important my life,

00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:32.499 align:middle line:84%
and he was made known
through his inner experiences

00:52:32.499 --> 00:52:34.540 align:middle line:84%
about a product called
ORMUS, or something called

00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:37.750 align:middle line:84%
ORMUS, Orbitally Re-arranged
Monoatomic Elements.

00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:40.400 align:middle line:84%
So, we started
Blue Water Alchemy,

00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:44.530 align:middle line:84%
and that has been kind of
where the energy has gone.

00:52:44.530 --> 00:52:47.500 align:middle line:84%
The planet gives us
everything we need.

00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:50.550 align:middle line:84%
There isn't anything that has
to be manufactured chemically

00:52:50.550 --> 00:52:52.660 align:middle line:90%
to keep us alive and healthy.

00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:55.990 align:middle line:84%
The planet gives
everything we need to us.

00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:57.819 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It does,
and do you know what?

00:52:57.819 --> 00:52:59.610 align:middle line:84%
When you said that, it
just occurred to me,

00:52:59.610 --> 00:53:01.710 align:middle line:84%
one big area we were
going to talk about

00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:03.410 align:middle line:90%
and didn't was orgone.

00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:05.710 align:middle line:84%
We were going to talk
about Wilhelm Reich.

00:53:05.710 --> 00:53:07.130 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: There's so much more.

00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:09.671 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wilhelm Reich and so
forth, and we didn't go there,

00:53:09.671 --> 00:53:11.280 align:middle line:84%
but the fact is the
technologies that

00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:15.415 align:middle line:84%
are being used for harm exist
and can be used to reverse it,

00:53:15.415 --> 00:53:16.215 align:middle line:90%
and for good.

00:53:16.215 --> 00:53:19.292 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And there's
never truly a drought.

00:53:19.292 --> 00:53:21.000 align:middle line:84%
California could be
saturated with water.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.392 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He was drought
busting in Israel.

00:53:23.392 --> 00:53:25.350 align:middle line:84%
Back in the day, they
were using those devices.

00:53:25.350 --> 00:53:25.920 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: North Africa.

00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:27.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: North Africa.

00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:31.000 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Water basins that
hadn't been filled in centuries

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.030 align:middle line:84%
were puddles for
years that lasted.

00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:36.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, why haven't
really taken that on?

00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:38.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if whoever
they are doesn't, why

00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:40.002 align:middle line:90%
hasn't it been taken on?

00:53:40.002 --> 00:53:42.210 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: When the leadership
of the planet changes,

00:53:42.210 --> 00:53:44.635 align:middle line:90%
that will happen, and not until.

00:53:44.635 --> 00:53:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you think
our consciousness is

00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:48.370 align:middle line:90%
at a point where we're ready?

00:53:48.370 --> 00:53:50.520 align:middle line:84%
Look at the crazy stuff
happening here in America

00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:52.139 align:middle line:90%
with these elections coming up.

00:53:52.139 --> 00:53:54.180 align:middle line:84%
Do you think we're getting
ready for a big shift?

00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:54.490 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: I do.

00:53:54.490 --> 00:53:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Because I do.

00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I know
it's going to happen.

00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:56.940 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely know
it's going to happen.

00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:58.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I believe
people are good.

00:53:58.070 --> 00:53:59.180 align:middle line:90%
They're tired, but they're good.

00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:01.200 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I weep for
the day that it begins,

00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:04.340 align:middle line:84%
and it'll be such
a relief to know

00:54:04.340 --> 00:54:08.550 align:middle line:84%
that there is this bright day
to where we have our potential

00:54:08.550 --> 00:54:12.320 align:middle line:84%
and our future back, that it
is there, and it is still ours,

00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:13.850 align:middle line:90%
and it is still within reach.

00:54:13.850 --> 00:54:16.825 align:middle line:84%
It has never not been within
reach but we've been told we

00:54:16.825 --> 00:54:17.290 align:middle line:90%
can't, we can't, we can't.

00:54:17.290 --> 00:54:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We just got
hoodwinked there for a while.

00:54:18.170 --> 00:54:18.770 align:middle line:90%
We weren't looking for it.

00:54:18.770 --> 00:54:20.103 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: A couple generations.

00:54:20.103 --> 00:54:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, a
couple generations.

00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:24.065 align:middle line:84%
We weren't prepared
for it, and now we are.

00:54:24.065 --> 00:54:25.490 align:middle line:90%
Now we're educating ourselves.

00:54:25.490 --> 00:54:27.770 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And so, the Nikola
Tesla's will come back.

00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:28.685 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You bet.

00:54:28.685 --> 00:54:29.930 align:middle line:10%
>>STEVENS: They'll be here.

00:54:29.930 --> 00:54:33.240 align:middle line:10%
In fact, they're probably
already in body right now,

00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:37.310 align:middle line:10%
waiting for the ability to
become who they're destined

00:54:37.310 --> 00:54:38.590 align:middle line:10%
to become in this time.

00:54:38.590 --> 00:54:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I believe that.

00:54:39.850 --> 00:54:40.360 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: I do, too.

00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:41.943 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we're
on the same page

00:54:41.943 --> 00:54:43.290 align:middle line:90%
on just about everything.

00:54:43.290 --> 00:54:45.240 align:middle line:84%
That's been a fun
little conversation.

00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:47.422 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
coming here and sharing

00:54:47.422 --> 00:54:48.380 align:middle line:90%
your perspective on it.

00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:48.560 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: My pleasure.

00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:50.726 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is just a
little different than some

00:54:50.726 --> 00:54:53.417 align:middle line:84%
of the other perspectives
on geoengineering.

00:54:53.417 --> 00:54:54.750 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: There's so much more.

00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:55.708 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So much more.

00:54:55.708 --> 00:54:58.760 align:middle line:84%
OK, maybe it requires a
followup conversation.
