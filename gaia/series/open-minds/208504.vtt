>>SEAN OLAOIRE:
Reincarnation is probably

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.760 align:middle line:84%
the most important element
in the trajectory of a soul

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.080 align:middle line:90%
in its learning to grow.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.250 align:middle line:84%
You can't be prejudiced if
you subscribe to reincarnation

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.350 align:middle line:84%
and you realize that
whatever position I'm

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.140 align:middle line:84%
in now as a white,
Irish male, I've

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.060 align:middle line:84%
been in all of the
other configurations

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.210 align:middle line:90%
in past lifetimes.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.320 align:middle line:84%
So to be prejudiced against
anybody in any configuration

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.390 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely meaningless.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And Moses is probably the
most important liberator

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.440 align:middle line:90%
that never existed.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.010 align:middle line:84%
He has influenced more people
to strive for their freedom

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.960 align:middle line:90%
than any character in history.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
purpose of the story.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.490 align:middle line:84%
It's not about facts,
factual history.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.460 align:middle line:84%
It's about creating a
hero who can help them

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.080 align:middle line:84%
in present
difficulties to survive

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.280 align:middle line:90%
what they're going through.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Life is a game that
God is playing.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.620 align:middle line:84%
I sometimes say that life is a
dream that the ego is having,

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.080 align:middle line:84%
and the ego is a dream
that the soul is having,

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.180 align:middle line:84%
and the soul is a dream
that spirit is having,

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.210 align:middle line:84%
and spirit is a dream
that source is having.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.100 align:middle line:84%
So we live within nested dreams,
and it's God dreaming this.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.600 align:middle line:90%


00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: It's going
to be a wonderfully wild ride.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.690 align:middle line:10%
The back cover of father
Sean Olaoire's book,

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.900 align:middle line:10%
"Setting God Free," begins
with "A priest, a scientist,

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.120 align:middle line:10%
and a psychologist
walk into a bar."

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.580 align:middle line:84%
The upshot is that he
is a Catholic priest,

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.680 align:middle line:90%
a psychologist, and a scientist.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And the place he's come to
resonates very deeply for me.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.050 align:middle line:84%
For one, the God
the Old Testament

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.120 align:middle line:84%
may not be the jealous
and angry entity

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.100 align:middle line:84%
the Old Testament
depicts, rather,

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.090 align:middle line:84%
the shadow side of ourselves,
the people who wrote the Bible.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.500 align:middle line:90%
Sean, welcome so much.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.670 align:middle line:90%
I've been with you before.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.060 align:middle line:90%
I've had on my other show.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just so, I think,
enchanted with not only

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.762 align:middle line:84%
the depth of your
knowledge, because we're

00:01:58.762 --> 00:02:00.970 align:middle line:84%
going to explain why you
have such depth of knowledge

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.870 align:middle line:84%
in a moment, but also your
ability to tell stories.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's because you're
a natural storyteller.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.784 align:middle line:90%
And I call you The Druid.

00:02:08.784 --> 00:02:10.419 align:middle line:84%
When anyone hears
me talk about you,

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.130 align:middle line:84%
I say, oh, yeah,
the druid's coming.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.990 align:middle line:90%
So first of all, Sean, welcome.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.320 align:middle line:90%
>>OLAOIRE: Thanks a million.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.403 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's talk
about your own background

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:21.370 align:middle line:84%
growing up in Ireland and being
the eldest son of an eldest

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.047 align:middle line:84%
son of an eldest son,
and how Grandfather Jim

00:02:25.047 --> 00:02:25.880 align:middle line:90%
came into your life.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.830 align:middle line:90%
>>OLAOIRE: OK.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.190 align:middle line:84%
So I'm the firstborn
of my parents,

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.840 align:middle line:84%
and both parents
are the firstborns

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.560 align:middle line:90%
in their own families.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.030 align:middle line:10%
So I was actually raised by my
grandparents for the first six

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.000 align:middle line:10%
years because my father was
the eldest of his family

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.390 align:middle line:10%
and his youngest brother,
Noel, who is my uncle,

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.140 align:middle line:10%
is two months younger than me.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.560 align:middle line:84%
So I was born in
October 1946, and he

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.570 align:middle line:90%
was born in December 1946.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.430 align:middle line:10%
So my grandmother
wanted a companion

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.150 align:middle line:10%
for her youngest child,
so she persuaded my mother

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.160 align:middle line:10%
to give me up temporarily.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.210 align:middle line:10%
The temporary lasted
for six years.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And so I lived with my
grandparents, my father's

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.970 align:middle line:84%
parents, and my
great grandmother,

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.510 align:middle line:84%
whom I called Muddy, for the
first six years of my life.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And then, subsequently, I lived
with the other grandparents,

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.620 align:middle line:90%
where I met Daddy Jim.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.820 align:middle line:84%
So Muddy, my great grandmother,
was like a Christian mystic.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.280 align:middle line:84%
For her, Mother
Mary was more real

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.140 align:middle line:84%
than you are to me
right now, Regina.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.060 align:middle line:84%
So she would talk out
loud to Mother Mary

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.280 align:middle line:84%
and I'd be privy to
these conversations.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And then from age six until for
the next four or five years,

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.630 align:middle line:84%
I lived with my
grandfather, Daddy Jim,

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.420 align:middle line:84%
who was a druid, a great
fiddler, a great organist--

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.030 align:middle line:84%
played the concert flute, the
tin whistle, the clarinet,

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.200 align:middle line:90%
the squeeze box.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And he was a great
storyteller, so he filled me up

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.130 align:middle line:84%
with all the old
Irish mythology.

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.990 align:middle line:84%
So between the
two of them, I got

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.262 align:middle line:84%
this great
cross-fertilization of kind

00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:52.840 align:middle line:84%
of mystical Christianity
and Druidical

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.670 align:middle line:90%
mythology from ancient Ireland.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.940 align:middle line:84%
So that was kind of the
background for the first 10

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:57.740 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so you're a
natural born storyteller.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.490 align:middle line:84%
>>OLAOIRE: I love
telling stories.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.365 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you do.

00:04:01.365 --> 00:04:02.410 align:middle line:90%
You tell them so well.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:03.210 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.280 align:middle line:84%
So you decided at some point
to become a Catholic priest.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.680 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's talk about that
journey all the way to Africa.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.623 align:middle line:84%
>>OLAOIRE: So at age 18,
I entered the seminary,

00:04:13.623 --> 00:04:15.540 align:middle line:84%
and I was actually really
embarrassed about it

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.910 align:middle line:90%
because it was a real school.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.285 align:middle line:84%
I was good in school, but I
was really good at athletics,

00:04:20.285 --> 00:04:22.660 align:middle line:84%
and I was really embarrassed
about going to the seminary.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.150 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like
wussy thing to do.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.990 align:middle line:90%
But I knew I needed to it--

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's like what you
do if you can't do sports.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.532 align:middle line:90%
You go into the seminary.

00:04:27.532 --> 00:04:28.410 align:middle line:90%
>>OLAOIRE: Exactly.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.060 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't even tell
my parents that I

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.810 align:middle line:90%
was joining the priesthood.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.150 align:middle line:84%
So I come from a
fairly poor family.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.750 align:middle line:84%
So I needed to do a
full physical in order

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.087 align:middle line:84%
to qualify to be
accepted in the seminary.

00:04:39.087 --> 00:04:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And so, I go to my
mother one day and I say,

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.570 align:middle line:90%
I need 10 shillings.

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And 10 shillings
is like, maybe, $6.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And she said, what do you
need 10 shillings for?

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.678 align:middle line:84%
I said, I need to
go to the doctor.

00:04:49.678 --> 00:04:50.595 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with you?

00:04:50.595 --> 00:04:52.260 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing wrong with me.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.310 align:middle line:84%
Why are you going to
the doctor if there's

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.268 align:middle line:90%
nothing wrong with you?

00:04:54.268 --> 00:04:55.943 align:middle line:90%
I need to do a full physical.

00:04:55.943 --> 00:04:57.360 align:middle line:84%
Why are you doing
a full physical?

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.020 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm going to go to the
seminary in three months time.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.520 align:middle line:84%
So that was the
first I brought it--

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.853 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The first-- [CHUCKLES]

00:05:02.853 --> 00:05:05.220 align:middle line:84%
>>OLAOIRE: So I went to the
seminary, then, at age 18.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And part of the
seminary training

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.870 align:middle line:84%
was to attend the National
University of Ireland.

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.960 align:middle line:84%
So I did a Bachelor of Science
degree and a double major

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.540 align:middle line:84%
in pure mathematics and
mathematical physics.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And then in the seminary, I
studied philosophy, theology,

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.120 align:middle line:84%
scripture, and
community development.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.120 align:middle line:84%
I spent eight years
there, and then at age 26,

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.875 align:middle line:90%
I was released on Africa.

00:05:25.875 --> 00:05:28.237 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHING] You
were released on Africa.

00:05:28.237 --> 00:05:29.945 align:middle line:84%
Now why did you decide
to go on a mission

00:05:29.945 --> 00:05:31.720 align:middle line:90%
rather than staying in Ireland?

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.520 align:middle line:90%
>>OLAOIRE: Exactly.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.170 align:middle line:84%
I knew I didn't want to
be a priest in Ireland

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:35.010 align:middle line:90%
for some reason.

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.610 align:middle line:84%
I was fascinated with
the sense of adventure.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.190 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to live in
kind of exciting places,

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.050 align:middle line:84%
in very, very
primitive conditions,

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.480 align:middle line:90%
which Africa was at that stage.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.290 align:middle line:84%
So, talking about 1964
when I joined the seminary.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And so I wanted to
be in a kind of a--

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.900 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to live in the jungle,
or in the desert, or a place

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.430 align:middle line:84%
where there was
wildlife and where

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.040 align:middle line:90%
people hadn't heard of Christ.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And I was going to kind
of save these lost souls

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.100 align:middle line:84%
and bring them to
heaven with me.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHING] How naive.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:04.830 align:middle line:90%
>>OLAOIRE: Very naive.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how
long did that last?

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.890 align:middle line:84%
So here you are 26,
you end up in Africa.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:09.690 align:middle line:90%
>>OLAOIRE: Yeah.

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:10.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, you were in Kenya.

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:11.610 align:middle line:90%
>>OLAOIRE: In Kenya, yeah.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:12.777 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You were in Kenya.

00:06:12.777 --> 00:06:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And you're there to convert
the Native people, right?

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:16.350 align:middle line:90%
>>OLAOIRE: Right.

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:17.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How'd that go?

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:19.253 align:middle line:84%
>>OLAOIRE: Well,
it's very interesting

00:06:19.253 --> 00:06:22.050 align:middle line:84%
because I'm always fascinated
by folklore and mythology

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:23.010 align:middle line:90%
and proverbs.

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.215 align:middle line:84%
And actually, in
fact, the second

00:06:25.215 --> 00:06:28.080 align:middle line:84%
to last year in high
school between my junior

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.280 align:middle line:84%
and senior years, I spent
the three months vacation

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.710 align:middle line:84%
in a place in Ireland,
a little village

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:39.300 align:middle line:84%
called [IRISH],, which Irish
is the Native language there.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And I was collecting proverbs
from the old people there,

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.757 align:middle line:90%
and I collected 432 Proverbs.

00:06:44.757 --> 00:06:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
an old man said to me,

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.520 align:middle line:84%
he said, if Christianity
had never come to Ireland,

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.263 align:middle line:84%
we could live according
to the proverbs.

00:06:52.263 --> 00:06:53.430 align:middle line:90%
And he was absolutely right.

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:54.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The native proverbs.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.170 align:middle line:90%
>>OLAOIRE: The native proverbs.

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.500 align:middle line:84%
>>OLAOIRE: Because the
archived wisdom of a culture

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.115 align:middle line:84%
is their stories,
proverbs, and mythology.

00:07:01.115 --> 00:07:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And so if you
really want to know

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.907 align:middle line:84%
the wisdom of any group of
people, look at their proverbs.

00:07:04.907 --> 00:07:08.020 align:middle line:84%
The proverbs are like, the
distillation of the stories,

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:11.370 align:middle line:84%
so the stories can be epics,
taking days even to tell.

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.500 align:middle line:84%
But the proverbs are
the distillation.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.317 align:middle line:84%
And so as soon as I hit
Kenya and I began to learn--

00:07:16.317 --> 00:07:18.900 align:middle line:84%
I had the privilege of learning
for different Kenyan languages

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.600 align:middle line:84%
and delving into the mythology
of peoples I worked with--

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.190 align:middle line:84%
I began to realize
as I collected

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:26.250 align:middle line:84%
the proverbs of
Kenya, that I could

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:27.810 align:middle line:90%
say the same thing about Kenya.

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:31.080 align:middle line:84%
That if Christianity
had never come to Kenya,

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.030 align:middle line:84%
they could live according
to the proverbs.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:36.060 align:middle line:84%
So that was a real kind
[NON-ENGLISH] for me, a 180,

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:41.490 align:middle line:84%
a realization that my job
was not to convert Africa

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:44.910 align:middle line:84%
to Christianity, it was to
cross-fertilize different

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:46.200 align:middle line:90%
wisdom traditions.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I became what
Camus would subsequently

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:51.450 align:middle line:84%
call a Gnostic
intermediary, somebody

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:53.910 align:middle line:84%
who is well-versed in two
very different systems

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:57.040 align:middle line:84%
and cross fertilize them
to their mutual benefit.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.150 align:middle line:84%
So that I saw was
my job, to learn

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:04.080 align:middle line:84%
the mythology, the language,
the folklore, the proverbs,

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.950 align:middle line:84%
and to share the wisdom
of my Catholic upbringing

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:09.510 align:middle line:84%
with them, so that
we could develop

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:12.750 align:middle line:84%
a kind of a hybrid in
which people could create

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:16.140 align:middle line:84%
a cosmology drawing on very
many different wisdom traditions

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:19.020 align:middle line:84%
instead of being just narrowly
focused on a single tradition.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So just
to distill it down,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.460 align:middle line:84%
what do you feel you
brought that best

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:25.620 align:middle line:90%
served the public there?

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And what did they bring to
you that best served you

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:29.993 align:middle line:90%
in the expansion of knowledge?

00:08:29.993 --> 00:08:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>>OLAOIRE: Well,
it's interesting.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:34.140 align:middle line:84%
In fairness to the missionary
endeavor in general,

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:37.830 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't just about converting
people to Christianity.

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Catholic missionaries
particularly

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:42.750 align:middle line:84%
were very, very involved in
agriculture, in medicine,

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:46.130 align:middle line:84%
in education, in famine
relief, in water production.

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:47.880 align:middle line:84%
So I was involved
in all those areas

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.730 align:middle line:84%
and really trying to
ameliorate the living

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:53.140 align:middle line:84%
conditions under which
most people live there.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And so Christianity was part
of the package in a sense,

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.930 align:middle line:84%
but it wasn't the main thrust
in any sense of the word.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:00.540 align:middle line:90%
So what I was bringing was--

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was
really humanitarian.

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:03.270 align:middle line:90%
>>OLAOIRE: Very much so.

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:07.980 align:middle line:84%
So I was bringing a possibility
of improving life, improving

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.530 align:middle line:84%
longevity, saving little
children from dying very, very

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.890 align:middle line:84%
early, as well as
the wisdom tradition

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:15.030 align:middle line:90%
that I was brought up in.

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:18.810 align:middle line:84%
What they taught me was Africa
has this extraordinary ability

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:20.590 align:middle line:90%
to laugh at life.

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And they have this
extraordinary self-confidence.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:28.440 align:middle line:84%
I have never in my life met an
African with a poor self-image,

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.578 align:middle line:84%
unless they were trained by
Europeans, unless they went

00:09:31.578 --> 00:09:33.870 align:middle line:84%
through a European education
system, in which they were

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:35.760 align:middle line:90%
taught to kind of self-doubt.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.100 align:middle line:84%
But I've never met an
African who wasn't--

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.100 align:middle line:84%
you could ask him anything,
can you do x, absolutely.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.090 align:middle line:90%
Can you film this?

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:42.890 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:44.310 align:middle line:90%
Can you can fix a car?

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:45.630 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:46.480 align:middle line:90%
They never say no.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.540 align:middle line:84%
They're willing
to give it a shot.

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:49.410 align:middle line:84%
So there's a supreme
self-confidence--

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:50.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's beautiful.

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:50.910 align:middle line:84%
>>OLAOIRE: --as
well as self-esteem.

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:52.110 align:middle line:90%
So I learned that.

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:54.660 align:middle line:84%
Also, literally
their family values,

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.400 align:middle line:84%
that family is really,
really important

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.040 align:middle line:84%
in Africa and the
ability to survive

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.990 align:middle line:90%
in all kinds of circumstances.

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:03.600 align:middle line:84%
For a long time, I
was running a hostel

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.260 align:middle line:84%
for physically disabled
children, mainly polio kids.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And I never heard
any one of these kids

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.700 align:middle line:84%
ever complain about
their circumstances.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.773 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we had a soccer
team, and these kids

00:10:13.773 --> 00:10:15.690 align:middle line:84%
were using crutches,
running around the field,

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:17.310 align:middle line:90%
trying to kick a soccer ball.

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And one little kid was
on his hands and knees,

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.630 align:middle line:84%
walking on his hands
and knees, and trying

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:23.230 align:middle line:90%
to head the ball in the ground.

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And so they would
never complain.

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:27.450 align:middle line:84%
So the ability, the
extraordinary ability

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:31.080 align:middle line:84%
to survive, whatever
vicissitude life threw at them,

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.060 align:middle line:90%
and to laugh through it.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:35.210 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so I learned all
those things from Africa.

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:36.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We are far
from that plumb line.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.563 align:middle line:84%
That's been educated
right out of us.

00:10:38.563 --> 00:10:39.480 align:middle line:90%
>>OLAOIRE: Absolutely.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Another thing
you learned, and I've

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.080 align:middle line:84%
learned from previous
conversations with you,

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:47.340 align:middle line:84%
is about the whole notion of
reincarnation, which was not

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:51.000 align:middle line:84%
something at the time that
you necessarily gave weight to

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.200 align:middle line:90%
as a Catholic priest.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And this comes up in
your life as turning out

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:56.190 align:middle line:90%
to be rather important.

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:57.840 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.040 align:middle line:84%
Because you turn into
essentially a renegade

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:00.840 align:middle line:90%
or rebel.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:01.710 align:middle line:90%
>>OLAOIRE: Yes, very much so.

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:03.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about how

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:05.940 align:middle line:84%
that happened before we start
going into your book, which

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.330 align:middle line:90%
is just amazing.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:10.170 align:middle line:84%
So how did you learn
about reincarnation

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:11.575 align:middle line:90%
through the Africans?

00:11:11.575 --> 00:11:13.200 align:middle line:84%
>>OLAOIRE: So the
people that I lived--

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.700 align:middle line:84%
I lived with three different
Kalenjin tribes, that Kipsigis,

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.310 align:middle line:90%
the Tugen, the Nandi.

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And all of them had
this fascinating system

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.730 align:middle line:84%
where a child was given three
different names at birth.

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:26.320 align:middle line:84%
The first name had to do with
the circumstances of the birth.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.610 align:middle line:84%
So if I asked a child, for
instance, [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:34.810 align:middle line:84%
what is your name, and she
says to me, [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:36.810 align:middle line:84%
I knew immediately she
was born during a famine,

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:37.830 align:middle line:90%
just by the name.

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:40.140 align:middle line:84%
If I asked a little
boy, [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:43.363 align:middle line:84%
what is your name, and he
said to me [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:11:43.363 --> 00:11:45.780 align:middle line:84%
I knew immediately that there
was a lot of problems around

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:47.250 align:middle line:84%
the birth and that people
were fussing about,

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:48.780 align:middle line:90%
that it was a dangerous time.

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:50.380 align:middle line:84%
So the circumstances
of the birth

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:51.880 align:middle line:84%
were the first thing
that was given.

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:54.030 align:middle line:84%
So I knew immediately
the circumstances.

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:57.390 align:middle line:84%
The second name was called
the [NON-ENGLISH] name,

00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:00.630 align:middle line:84%
[NON-ENGLISH],, and it was the
name that only the mother could

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:01.740 align:middle line:90%
use of the child.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.780 align:middle line:84%
And if the child was
being obstreperous,

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.310 align:middle line:84%
the mother would
use a special name,

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:07.590 align:middle line:84%
and the child would
immediately quiet down.

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:10.020 align:middle line:84%
I saw warriors come back
from cattle raids, you know,

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:13.020 align:middle line:84%
fired up at the battle
of a cattle safari,

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:15.032 align:middle line:84%
and the mother would use
the [NON-ENGLISH] name,

00:12:15.032 --> 00:12:16.740 align:middle line:84%
and the boy would
quiet down immediately.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.090 align:middle line:90%
That was the second name.

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And the third name, they
would bring an elder

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.300 align:middle line:84%
from the tribe to name
all of the ancestors

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:25.770 align:middle line:90%
of this particular baby.

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And when the baby
sneezed, they said, ah,

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:29.800 align:middle line:84%
that's the ancestor
who is coming back.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.920 align:middle line:84%
So they're recycling,
they're coming back.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought this was
just a really interesting,

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:35.260 align:middle line:90%
quaint custom.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:36.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.100 align:middle line:84%
But it ended up taking on
more meaning than that.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.392 align:middle line:90%
>>OLAOIRE: Much deeper meaning.

00:12:39.392 --> 00:12:43.200 align:middle line:84%
I came to the States in 1987
to pursue a PhD in psychology.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And early on, I did a
seminar with a woman

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:51.150 align:middle line:84%
called Barbara Findesein on
what's called perinatal issues.

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And it was based on
Stan Groff's work on--

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:54.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Stanley Groff?

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.640 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and I interviewed
him many, many years ago

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.370 align:middle line:84%
and went through
the workshop that--

00:12:58.370 --> 00:12:59.472 align:middle line:90%
>>OLAOIRE: Exactly.

00:12:59.472 --> 00:13:00.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, I went through
this workshop,

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:04.020 align:middle line:84%
and the idea was that he
talked about this idea

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:07.320 align:middle line:84%
of basic perinatal
matrices, which was a belief

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.500 align:middle line:84%
system that there are four
critical stages to the birth

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:11.410 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:14.820 align:middle line:84%
I think the first may have been
the contractions as they begin.

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.800 align:middle line:84%
The second is the
baby turning to engage

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.000 align:middle line:90%
the head in the birth canal.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000 align:middle line:84%
The third is squeezing
through the birth canal,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.610 align:middle line:84%
and the fourth is coming out,
I think, umbilical cord cut,

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:24.930 align:middle line:90%
and all these bright lights.

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And he claimed that adult
neurotic behavior correlates

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.180 align:middle line:84%
very closely to the particular
period at which the child

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.070 align:middle line:84%
experienced the most difficulty
during the birthing process.

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:38.910 align:middle line:84%
So I'm expecting I'm
going to experience this.

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And everybody in
the group, there

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.910 align:middle line:84%
were 23 of us doing
this workshop,

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:43.680 align:middle line:84%
everybody in the group
had the experience

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.993 align:middle line:84%
of experiencing a difficulty
during their own birth process.

00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:49.410 align:middle line:84%
And I'm expecting the same
thing when it comes to my turn.

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:52.740 align:middle line:84%
Instead, I had this experience
of being a young Tibetan

00:13:52.740 --> 00:14:02.530 align:middle line:84%
woman giving birth to
our firstborn child.

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And it was so real, I literally
had pains in my thighs

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.000 align:middle line:84%
for four or five
days afterwards.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And this totally rocked me,
because it was an experience.

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And I know from
epistemology that

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:14.830 align:middle line:90%
are three ways we know stuff.

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:17.440 align:middle line:84%
The first one is an
authority figure tells us,

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.740 align:middle line:90%
and we believe them.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:20.890 align:middle line:84%
The second one is we
experienced it for ourselves.

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And the third one is we
figure stuff out on our own.

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And so here was an
experience I could not doubt.

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:28.540 align:middle line:90%
It was absolutely real.

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And subsequently
through self-hypnosis

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.290 align:middle line:84%
and through visionary
experiences,

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:35.780 align:middle line:84%
I have recovered memories
from 11 other lifetimes.

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:38.920 align:middle line:84%
And so I had no doubt whatsoever
that for a whole bunch

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.770 align:middle line:84%
of reasons, psychological
reasons, theological reasons,

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:44.980 align:middle line:84%
sociological reasons,
reincarnation

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:47.350 align:middle line:84%
is probably the most
important element

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:51.280 align:middle line:84%
in the trajectory of a soul
in its learning to grow,

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.980 align:middle line:84%
because you can't
be prejudiced if you

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:55.540 align:middle line:90%
subscribe to reincarnation.

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.535 align:middle line:84%
And you realize that
whatever position I'm

00:14:57.535 --> 00:15:00.430 align:middle line:84%
in now as a white,
Irish male, I've

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:02.350 align:middle line:84%
been in all of the
other configurations

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:03.500 align:middle line:90%
in past lifetimes.

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.610 align:middle line:84%
So to be prejudiced against
anybody in any configuration

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:08.560 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely meaningless.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And the best way I know
to let go of prejudice

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:13.120 align:middle line:90%
is to come to the realization--

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.020 align:middle line:90%
I don't just--

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:16.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't just kind of think, what
is it like to be that person,

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:20.800 align:middle line:84%
to be female, or to be a
slave in Africa in the 1300s,

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:25.870 align:middle line:84%
or to be a shaman in North
America in the 9th century,

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:28.370 align:middle line:84%
but to have been in those
places and experienced life

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:30.580 align:middle line:84%
from those places, I
can't be prejudiced

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.590 align:middle line:84%
at this stage from
being Catholic, or being

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:33.640 align:middle line:90%
Irish, or being male.

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:34.970 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make any sense.

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:36.760 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know of any
other way that-- it

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:39.910 align:middle line:84%
solves so many theological
problems, so many sociological

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:42.100 align:middle line:84%
problems, so many
psychological problems,

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.488 align:middle line:84%
and it does away completely
with prejudices of all kinds.

00:15:44.488 --> 00:15:46.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think that's why
I resonated so deeply when

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.460 align:middle line:84%
I first heard some
of your homilies

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:51.200 align:middle line:84%
online when another interviewee
he turned me onto you a while

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.000 align:middle line:90%
back.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.473 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you've
got to meet this guy.

00:15:54.473 --> 00:15:56.140 align:middle line:84%
I think he would make
a great interview.

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And then after we did our
first interview on my site,

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:00.610 align:middle line:84%
I started hearing
from other people.

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:02.050 align:middle line:90%
And they remembered you.

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:07.060 align:middle line:84%
One lady said, I met him
in Lourdes in the '70s.

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:08.050 align:middle line:90%
I never forgot him.

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And everybody kept having
this impression of you

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:17.980 align:middle line:84%
as this kind of exquisite
thinker, as a philosopher,

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:19.390 align:middle line:90%
and as an inspiration.

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:22.480 align:middle line:84%
So I've since been lucky enough
to have conversations with you

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.700 align:middle line:84%
and find out more about
your thinking on this.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:26.710 align:middle line:84%
But this very part
of you that is

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:29.470 align:middle line:90%
that open to ultimate truths.

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:31.600 align:middle line:84%
This reincarnation thing,
we'll talk about a little

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.090 align:middle line:84%
later, because it did get you
in trouble with the Church.

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:35.740 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And we've always
heard it bandied

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:40.810 align:middle line:84%
about that reincarnation was
part of the original documents,

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:45.400 align:middle line:84%
but was removed ostensibly for
reasons of maintaining power

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.400 align:middle line:90%
over the people.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And when we go back
to epistemology,

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:50.830 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
from God on high

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:52.780 align:middle line:84%
and learning from
authority figures.

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:54.520 align:middle line:84%
And this takes us
right into your book.

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:54.920 align:middle line:90%
>>OLAOIRE: Right.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.212 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's start
going into "Setting God Free."

00:16:57.212 --> 00:16:59.110 align:middle line:84%
What made you decide
to write that?

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:00.970 align:middle line:90%
And then, I'll just set it up.

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:02.170 align:middle line:90%
You write it as a trial.

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:03.400 align:middle line:90%
You're always on trial.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.260 align:middle line:84%
The God of the Old
Testament's on trial.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And you have some very
snappy figures in this.

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And a couple of them
kind represent you

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:13.960 align:middle line:84%
in the court case, mugging
it up for the jury,

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:17.380 align:middle line:84%
trying to get laughs out of the
jury in doing their analysis.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:18.339 align:middle line:90%
It's very funny.

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:20.510 align:middle line:84%
But it's very scholarly
at the same time.

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:24.319 align:middle line:84%
So why did you decide to
write "Setting God Free"?

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:27.190 align:middle line:84%
>>OLAOIRE: So I
began to see that,

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:29.830 align:middle line:84%
as people read through the
Hebrew scriptures particularly,

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:32.380 align:middle line:84%
and indeed some parts of
the New Testament even,

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:34.510 align:middle line:84%
there are these what are
euphemistically called

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:36.020 align:middle line:90%
"the difficult passages."

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:36.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>>OLAOIRE: Difficult
as in genocidal maniac,

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:43.090 align:middle line:84%
pathological liar,
covenant breaker, you know?

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:44.710 align:middle line:90%
And you kind of skip over those.

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And typically, on a
Sunday, the readings

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.640 align:middle line:84%
that are presented
to the community

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.280 align:middle line:84%
are a select group of
readings from the scriptures,

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.680 align:middle line:84%
and they ignore or leave
out the other pieces.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:57.640 align:middle line:84%
And I began to see, how can
you just skip over these pieces

00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.670 align:middle line:84%
and not acknowledge that
this book, both the Hebrew

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:02.710 align:middle line:84%
scriptures and the
Christian scriptures,

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:06.460 align:middle line:84%
have been used to justify
all kinds of inquisitions,

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:10.240 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of conquistadores,
all kinds of crusades,

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:14.020 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of pogroms against
particularly the Jewish nation.

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:15.977 align:middle line:84%
And I began to
realize, you know,

00:18:15.977 --> 00:18:18.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have to go right
through this and find out,

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:19.900 align:middle line:90%
is there a third explanation?

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.180 align:middle line:84%
The first explanation is
this guy is a total maniac,

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:22.980 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And there's no point
in believing in him.

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And the second point is,
there is no God whatsoever.

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:30.700 align:middle line:84%
So we're faced between a
choice between the devil

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:31.720 align:middle line:90%
and the deep blue sea.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.670 align:middle line:84%
You either subscribe
to this God,

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:36.460 align:middle line:84%
and you develop a fear-based
dogmatic religion,

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:37.990 align:middle line:84%
or you cast this
God away and you

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:40.930 align:middle line:84%
create a world of
atheism, meaninglessness,

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:43.490 align:middle line:84%
that it came from nothing
and is going nowhere.

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:44.950 align:middle line:90%
The soul is a mirage.

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:47.410 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is
simply an epiphenomenon

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:49.690 align:middle line:84%
of biochemical activities
in the brain, you know,

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:51.770 align:middle line:84%
and it's going nowhere
really quickly.

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And so we're caught
between these two pieces.

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And it reminded me of this,
the Stockholm syndrome.

00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:01.690 align:middle line:84%
It was an event that happened
in 1973 in Sweden, where

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:04.300 align:middle line:84%
bank robbers took four
hostages, and they're

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:05.890 align:middle line:90%
held hostage for several days.

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the police
break in and set them free.

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:10.720 align:middle line:84%
But when they're freed,
the hostages refuse

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.490 align:middle line:84%
to give evidence
against the captors

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:15.790 align:middle line:84%
because they have
somehow, to relieve

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:17.980 align:middle line:84%
some form of
cognitive dissonance,

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:20.800 align:middle line:84%
they had to align with the
belief systems of the captors.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.930 align:middle line:84%
But much more importantly,
I just found out,

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:26.080 align:middle line:84%
the police were so brutal
in freeing these people,

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:29.020 align:middle line:84%
the police seem to have little
interest in the captives

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:31.550 align:middle line:84%
and all the interest in
capturing the criminals.

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And so the captors have felt
so badly done by the police,

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:38.980 align:middle line:84%
that they refused to give
evidence against their captors.

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:41.140 align:middle line:84%
Now I see that we're
caught in the same bind.

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:44.380 align:middle line:84%
We're either caught with a kind
of a fundamentalist, fear-based

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:47.200 align:middle line:84%
theology that's afraid
to upset this God,

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.520 align:middle line:90%
and so we cling on to him.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And the alternative is
to abandon this God,

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:52.060 align:middle line:84%
and there's nothing
to replace it.

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:52.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.150 align:middle line:84%
>>OLAOIRE: There's this
atheism of meaninglessness

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:56.320 align:middle line:90%
in our times.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And I began to feel, there must
be a third way through this.

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.460 align:middle line:84%
It can't be just these
two alternatives.

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:03.250 align:middle line:84%
So I decided, I was
going to through this,

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:04.930 align:middle line:84%
I was going to
harvest this book.

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:07.330 align:middle line:90%
And it was to call in experts--

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:11.200 align:middle line:84%
Bible scholars, archaeologists,
psychologists, contract

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.820 align:middle line:84%
lawyers, mythologists--
to try to find out,

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:16.540 align:middle line:84%
is there a third
way of harvesting

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:19.240 align:middle line:84%
this extraordinary
cache of material

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.640 align:middle line:84%
to find out what it
really represents

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.290 align:middle line:84%
and that it could
be inspirational

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:24.680 align:middle line:90%
when it's done in this case.

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.710 align:middle line:84%
So that was the
reason for the book.

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:29.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you,
first of all, you just

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:30.490 align:middle line:90%
have a little bit of it.

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:32.980 align:middle line:84%
When we did our other
interview, I said,

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:35.650 align:middle line:84%
people think you're saying
"guide" when you're saying God.

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:36.940 align:middle line:90%
It's your Irish accent.

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:38.770 align:middle line:84%
So you've been saying
God the whole time?

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:39.220 align:middle line:90%
>>OLAOIRE: OK.

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:40.210 align:middle line:90%
And source.

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:41.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I can hear
just-- yes, source.

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:42.110 align:middle line:90%
That works.

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:44.420 align:middle line:84%
Source, because that's the
other term that you use.

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:46.070 align:middle line:84%
So what is your--
so, first of all,

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:48.580 align:middle line:84%
start with, what is
your definition of God?

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.710 align:middle line:84%
>>OLAOIRE: So when
I think about it,

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:52.510 align:middle line:84%
I see this
extraordinary transition

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:54.560 align:middle line:84%
since Homo sapiens
sapiens evolved, which

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.200 align:middle line:90%
is about 70,000 years ago.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.120 align:middle line:84%
So we had hominids
for millions of years,

00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.980 align:middle line:84%
and then we had Homo
sapiens beginning

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:02.500 align:middle line:84%
about 300,000 years
ago, but Homo sapiens

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:03.730 align:middle line:90%
didn't have language.

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Only 70,000 years ago,
Homo sapiens sapiens

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:07.900 align:middle line:90%
developed language.

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And language is the ability
to manipulate symbols

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:15.790 align:middle line:84%
intracranially and give rise to
the spoken word that represents

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:17.480 align:middle line:90%
the ideology of the mind.

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:20.440 align:middle line:84%
So once we developed that,
the first use to which

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.760 align:middle line:90%
we put it was storytelling.

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:25.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I see there
were four eras in this.

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.120 align:middle line:84%
We began to ask the
questions, who put us here?

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.740 align:middle line:90%
Who's responsible for all this?

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:31.150 align:middle line:90%
Where did we come from?

00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And where do we go when we
die, when we shuffle off

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:34.960 align:middle line:90%
this mortal coil?

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.718 align:middle line:84%
So the first era is, I call
the era of the theologians.

00:21:37.718 --> 00:21:39.760 align:middle line:84%
These were people who
began to try to figure out,

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:40.780 align:middle line:90%
who are the gods?

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.850 align:middle line:84%
It was always plural
at that stage.

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:43.650 align:middle line:90%
Who are they?

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:44.525 align:middle line:90%
Where do they reside?

00:21:44.525 --> 00:21:45.520 align:middle line:90%
What's their schtick?

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.950 align:middle line:84%
So I would call it the
era of the theologians.

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:49.840 align:middle line:84%
The second was the
era of the priests.

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.660 align:middle line:84%
They now have figured out
some kind of a theology.

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:55.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, they want a
relationship with these gods.

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:58.460 align:middle line:84%
So they create prayer and
ritual of various kinds.

00:21:58.460 --> 00:21:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's the era
of the priests.

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:02.080 align:middle line:84%
The third era is the
era of the prophets.

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:03.880 align:middle line:84%
There are now
individual people who

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.940 align:middle line:84%
purport to represent the
viewpoint of these gods

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:09.400 align:middle line:84%
and to speak on behalf of
these gods to the nation.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.130 align:middle line:84%
They're prophets, so they
speak on behalf of the gods.

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And the fourth one
are the mystics

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.390 align:middle line:84%
who, they don't
speak about the gods,

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:18.040 align:middle line:84%
and they're not
speaking to the gods,

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:19.998 align:middle line:84%
and they're not speaking
on behalf of the gods.

00:22:19.998 --> 00:22:22.000 align:middle line:90%
They're speaking as God.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.280 align:middle line:84%
Because they realize
that ultimately,

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.080 align:middle line:90%
there is only source.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.510 align:middle line:84%
I've said famously before
that everything that exists

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:30.010 align:middle line:90%
is simply God in drag.

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:32.260 align:middle line:84%
We are holographic
fractals of source.

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And so source in the
isness, it is the part

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:39.550 align:middle line:84%
that the mystics
realize, you can't even

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:42.290 align:middle line:84%
speak about it because
it's an ineffable reality.

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:43.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:43.900 align:middle line:84%
>>OLAOIRE: You
can experience it.

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:44.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Incomprehensible.

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:45.958 align:middle line:84%
>>OLAOIRE: Totally
incomprehensible

00:22:45.958 --> 00:22:47.320 align:middle line:90%
and inarticulatable.

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:50.230 align:middle line:84%
You can experience it,
but you cannot articulate.

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:52.810 align:middle line:10%
And so the ultimate position
is not even the mystic.

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:54.835 align:middle line:10%
There's a fifth group,
and that's the non-

00:22:54.835 --> 00:22:57.370 align:middle line:10%
[NON-ENGLISH] mystic who
won't open her mouth at all,

00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:01.030 align:middle line:10%
and just experience what it is
and radiate the isness of God

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:03.010 align:middle line:10%
through the way in which
she lives her life.

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:06.370 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so apart from that,
any descriptor of God

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:07.995 align:middle line:84%
is going to have
to be parabolic,

00:23:07.995 --> 00:23:11.380 align:middle line:84%
in other words story
form, myth or parable,

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:12.370 align:middle line:90%
in our storytelling.

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:14.620 align:middle line:84%
That's the only way we can
engage with this experience

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:15.460 align:middle line:90%
of the divine.

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:16.668 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you for that.

00:23:16.668 --> 00:23:19.180 align:middle line:84%
So we have your understanding,
and we can go from there

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:20.860 align:middle line:90%
as a platform.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.350 align:middle line:84%
So when you get into
the trial, is McDermott

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:27.040 align:middle line:84%
the name of the chief
witness for the prosecution?

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:30.200 align:middle line:84%
He's kind of like you, and he's
hamming it up for the jury,

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.000 align:middle line:90%
not understanding.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.458 align:middle line:84%
The court's not
impressed that he's

00:23:32.458 --> 00:23:35.350 align:middle line:84%
trying to get laughter and
consensus from the jurors.

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:38.230 align:middle line:84%
But basically, some of the
stories in the Old Testament

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:40.240 align:middle line:84%
are so absurd, there
is no other track

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.830 align:middle line:90%
you could take in handling this.

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:45.670 align:middle line:84%
So you applied psychology,
mathematics, and such

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:47.050 align:middle line:90%
to the scriptures.

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:49.630 align:middle line:84%
So we're only going to be able
to grab a couple of pieces out

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:51.190 align:middle line:90%
because of time constraints.

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:54.230 align:middle line:84%
But let's just look at
Exodus, the story of Exodus,

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:55.030 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:55.600 align:middle line:90%
>>OLAOIRE: Right.

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.520 align:middle line:84%
So you take the story
of Exodus, for instance,

00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.190 align:middle line:84%
and purportedly, according
to the scriptures,

00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:05.020 align:middle line:84%
603,550 military Israelites
escaped from Egypt.

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:08.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you think that there
are men between the ages of 20

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:09.170 align:middle line:90%
and 60, perhaps--

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:11.820 align:middle line:84%
So there are boys before
that and there are older men

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:12.620 align:middle line:90%
after that.

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And then there are all
the females in the group.

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:17.200 align:middle line:84%
So you're talking about a group
of at least 2 million people

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.200 align:middle line:84%
allegedly escaped from the
greatest empire of the day, who

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.680 align:middle line:84%
controlled Egypt, who controlled
the entire Sinai Peninsula.

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And they're wandering
the desert for 40 years

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:29.410 align:middle line:84%
unbeknownst to these
Egyptians, and God

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:31.690 align:middle line:84%
kills at the first
born of all Egyptians

00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:33.400 align:middle line:90%
to set the Israelites free.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.890 align:middle line:84%
Now I've calculated,
the mathematician in me.

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:38.110 align:middle line:84%
If they were
socially distancing,

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:40.600 align:middle line:84%
so there's 2 million
people escape from Egypt,

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:44.030 align:middle line:84%
it's 263 miles from
Cairo to Jerusalem.

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:47.320 align:middle line:84%
So if they're walking 10 abreast
and they're socially distancing

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.020 align:middle line:84%
6 feet apart, the
first group is going

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:53.892 align:middle line:84%
to be in Jerusalem before
the last group leaves home.

00:24:53.892 --> 00:24:54.850 align:middle line:90%
So that's the kind of--

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: 100% It
wouldn't go unnoticed.

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:58.270 align:middle line:84%
>>OLAOIRE: It
wouldn't go unnoticed.

00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:01.330 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian army-- and that
period of Egyptian history,

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:04.390 align:middle line:84%
allegedly, this event took
place in the year 1250 BCE.

00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And after 40 years before they
enter the Promised Land in 1210

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:11.260 align:middle line:84%
BCE, Egypt controlled all
the territory up to Turkey

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:13.630 align:middle line:84%
in the North and
Mesopotamia in the East.

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:16.165 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, the
2 million people

00:25:16.165 --> 00:25:18.040 align:middle line:84%
wandering around the
desert with their flocks

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.230 align:middle line:90%
escaped their notice.

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Now in the meantime, God is
so upset with these people

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:25.870 align:middle line:84%
that, they're constantly
kvetching and complaining

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:28.000 align:middle line:84%
about him, that he
decides that of all those

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.190 align:middle line:84%
who leave Egypt,
only two people are

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:34.540 align:middle line:84%
going to make it into the land
of Canaan, Caleb and Joshua.

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:37.480 align:middle line:84%
So you've got 2 million bodies
scattered all over the Sinai

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:38.530 align:middle line:90%
Peninsula.

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:43.900 align:middle line:84%
Now in 1967, when the Israelis,
when four Arab nations attacked

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Israel, and in six days
Israel defeated it,

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.520 align:middle line:84%
and they recaptured
the Sinai Peninsula,

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:52.540 align:middle line:84%
and a deluge of
Israeli archaeologists

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:55.615 align:middle line:84%
descended on the Sinai to
find evidence of the Exodus,

00:25:55.615 --> 00:25:57.490 align:middle line:84%
and they went through
with a fine tooth comb,

00:25:57.490 --> 00:26:00.800 align:middle line:84%
they didn't find a single animal
bone or a single human bone.

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And particularly
around Mount Sinai,

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:04.930 align:middle line:84%
where they had encamped
allegedly for two years

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:07.287 align:middle line:84%
and where Moses is
given the Covenant,

00:26:07.287 --> 00:26:08.870 align:middle line:84%
they camped there
for about two years,

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:10.660 align:middle line:84%
there wasn't a single
bone of a donkey,

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:13.420 align:middle line:84%
or a cow, a human being,
anywhere to be found.

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:15.477 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't that
it was so long ago,

00:26:15.477 --> 00:26:16.810 align:middle line:90%
they couldn't find the evidence.

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:19.030 align:middle line:84%
They found evidence of
previous civilization,

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:22.390 align:middle line:84%
previous nomadic pastoralists,
who passed through the area

00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:25.300 align:middle line:84%
because their equipment is
so sensitive at this stage.

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And many of the towns which
allegedly the escapees

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:31.030 align:middle line:84%
demolished in the
process, they didn't even

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:33.820 align:middle line:84%
exist at that stage for
hundreds of years afterwards.

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
is the implication

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:39.860 align:middle line:84%
to both Christian and Jewish
doctrine and the belief

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:40.660 align:middle line:90%
systems?

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:42.490 align:middle line:84%
>>OLAOIRE: And that is where
I brought in the mythologist.

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:44.115 align:middle line:84%
This is the important
piece of it here.

00:26:44.115 --> 00:26:46.720 align:middle line:84%
They looked at the
defense, how do you

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.620 align:middle line:90%
defend Yahweh in this instance?

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:50.860 align:middle line:84%
The realization
was that you can't

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:54.130 align:middle line:84%
understand the Bible until
you understand storytelling.

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And the objective of
storytelling is threefold.

00:26:56.860 --> 00:27:00.332 align:middle line:84%
Stories allow you to survive
in the present moment,

00:27:00.332 --> 00:27:02.540 align:middle line:84%
no matter what the vicissitudes
that your experience.

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:05.590 align:middle line:84%
It allows you to survive
the present circumstances.

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:07.600 align:middle line:84%
It gives you an
explanation for the past.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:10.390 align:middle line:84%
So you either recall
past events or you even

00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:12.040 align:middle line:90%
make up past events.

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:15.980 align:middle line:84%
And it gives you the hope that
you'll survive into the future.

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:20.440 align:middle line:84%
So all the great storytellers,
they create origin myths.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:23.210 align:middle line:84%
We have it in Ireland, the
Tuatha Dé Danann of Ireland.

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:23.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:25.827 align:middle line:84%
>>OLAOIRE: Going back thousands
of years before the Celts,

00:27:25.827 --> 00:27:26.800 align:middle line:90%
our creation myth.

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:28.690 align:middle line:90%
So we create creation myths.

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:31.150 align:middle line:84%
The Big Bang is a creation
myth that science has created.

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:33.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe for a
moment in the Big Bang.

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:36.880 align:middle line:84%
The Big Bang was a
song God made clapping,

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.370 align:middle line:84%
and she gave birth
to the cosmos.

00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:38.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:40.365 align:middle line:84%
>>OLAOIRE: That's
what the Big Bang is.

00:27:40.365 --> 00:27:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And we'll find that
out at some stage.

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:43.960 align:middle line:84%
So we have to create
stories that give us

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:45.610 align:middle line:90%
a sense of where we came from.

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:49.623 align:middle line:84%
And we have to create
great heroes and heroines

00:27:49.623 --> 00:27:51.040 align:middle line:84%
to give us inspiration
that we can

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.990 align:middle line:90%
survive present difficulties.

00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:54.910 align:middle line:84%
So the myth of the
exodus is actually

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:59.830 align:middle line:84%
fashioned during a real
period in Hebrew history

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:05.620 align:middle line:84%
from 589 BC to 539 BC, when
the last two tribes of Israel

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:07.240 align:middle line:90%
are in exile in Babylon.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.640 align:middle line:84%
Babylon has overcome the
great Assyrian Empire,

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:12.160 align:middle line:84%
which had demolished the 10
Northern tribes of Israel

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:14.290 align:middle line:90%
in the year 721 BCE.

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:16.600 align:middle line:84%
There are only two tribes
left, Benjamin and Judah.

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:19.142 align:middle line:84%
And now it looks like they're
going to be demolished as well.

00:28:19.142 --> 00:28:21.082 align:middle line:84%
So at this stage,
they pull together

00:28:21.082 --> 00:28:23.290 align:middle line:84%
all the stories they've had
from the Northern kingdom

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:24.790 align:middle line:84%
and the Southern
kingdom, in which

00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:26.350 align:middle line:90%
God has given different names.

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:29.350 align:middle line:84%
In the South, he's called
Yahweh, [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:32.620 align:middle line:84%
In the North, he's called
Elohim, and Elohim is a plural.

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:34.690 align:middle line:90%
It means the powerful ones.

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:36.917 align:middle line:90%
It's not even a singular noun.

00:28:36.917 --> 00:28:38.500 align:middle line:84%
They bring together
all these stories,

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:40.420 align:middle line:84%
and they combine them
into what will then

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:43.690 align:middle line:84%
be called the Pentateuch, which
is Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus,

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:45.430 align:middle line:90%
Numbers, and Deuteronomy.

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And they will invent a
character called Moses.

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:50.080 align:middle line:84%
They need a liberator,
and Moses is probably

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:53.080 align:middle line:84%
the most important liberator
that never existed.

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:56.740 align:middle line:84%
He has influenced more people
to strive for their freedom

00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:58.660 align:middle line:90%
than any character in history.

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
purpose of the story.

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:03.190 align:middle line:90%
It's not about factual history.

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:06.130 align:middle line:84%
It's about creating a
hero who can help them

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:07.750 align:middle line:84%
in present
difficulties to survive

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:09.370 align:middle line:90%
what they're going through.

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:11.890 align:middle line:84%
And they create this myth
of an exodus from Egypt

00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:16.190 align:middle line:84%
that allegedly happened
between 1250 BCE and 1210 BC,

00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:19.480 align:middle line:84%
and they're creating
it in 539 BCE.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And at this stage,
Osiris the Great,

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:25.450 align:middle line:84%
who is the emperor of Persia,
has overthrown the Babylonians

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:27.610 align:middle line:84%
and is setting the
Israelites free to go back

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:29.050 align:middle line:90%
into the land of Israel.

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:31.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, in actual fact,
only 50,000 went back.

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:33.730 align:middle line:84%
Most of them opted
to stay in Babylon.

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:35.938 align:middle line:84%
But now they're
facing a real exodus,

00:29:35.938 --> 00:29:37.480 align:middle line:84%
and they're going
to have to go back,

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.010 align:middle line:84%
and they're going
to have to rebuild

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:44.045 align:middle line:84%
the temple, which was destroyed
by Nebuchadnezzar in 589 BCE.

00:29:44.045 --> 00:29:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And so, they will have
to start from scratch.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.010 align:middle line:84%
So they're going to
need a real exodus,

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:50.288 align:middle line:84%
so they invent this
exodus story for Moses,

00:29:50.288 --> 00:29:52.330 align:middle line:84%
and it gives them the
courage and the inspiration

00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:53.450 align:middle line:90%
to do what they did.

00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:57.455 align:middle line:84%
And now 2,500 years later, their
people are still flourishing.

00:29:57.455 --> 00:29:58.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That makes sense.

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:02.110 align:middle line:84%
There's like, songs of war,
to be able to bond together

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:05.700 align:middle line:84%
and find your purpose and move
forward into a challenging

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:06.500 align:middle line:90%
circumstance.

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:07.910 align:middle line:90%
So it makes perfect sense.

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:10.210 align:middle line:84%
The other part of this,
too, is the Egyptians

00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:12.730 align:middle line:84%
were known to be
meticulous record keepers.

00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:16.780 align:middle line:84%
So all of these events, having
their firstborn sons slain,

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:20.140 align:middle line:84%
all of this would have shown up
somewhere in Egyptian records.

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:23.480 align:middle line:84%
Because they did keep record,
and a lot of those still exist.

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.240 align:middle line:84%
There is no mention
of any of this.

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:29.140 align:middle line:84%
So the exodus is a fabrication
to help people much later,

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:33.670 align:middle line:84%
700 years or so down the line,
contend with an actual movement

00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:35.410 align:middle line:90%
back toward their land, right?

00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:35.965 align:middle line:90%
>>OLAOIRE: Very important.

00:30:35.965 --> 00:30:36.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:36.790 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:37.480 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:38.380 align:middle line:90%
OK, thank you.

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And along these
journeys in these books,

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:46.390 align:middle line:84%
massive amount of sacrifice,
bloodshed, hardship, horrible,

00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:48.970 align:middle line:84%
horrible acts of a
mean and angry God.

00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:51.790 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about that,
because as you get further

00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:57.970 align:middle line:84%
into the book, and I encourage
everyone to read this book,

00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:03.550 align:middle line:84%
it lays waste to, taking
on a dogmatic fashion, any

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:05.080 align:middle line:90%
of these texts any longer.

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:07.030 align:middle line:84%
Because what you're
doing is pointing

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:09.130 align:middle line:84%
a way towards
something much more

00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:12.050 align:middle line:84%
gracious and kind and
compelling in the end,

00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:16.873 align:middle line:84%
which is starting a new way of
seeing spirit, beyond religion.

00:31:16.873 --> 00:31:18.040 align:middle line:90%
So that's where it's headed.

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:20.230 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, as you're
deconstructing all of this,

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:24.430 align:middle line:84%
talk a little bit about the
bloodshed, the bloodthirst

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:26.440 align:middle line:84%
of the gods, and what
you feel that was

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:28.390 align:middle line:90%
depicting of the human shadow.

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:30.250 align:middle line:84%
>>OLAOIRE: And so
in the book itself,

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:33.130 align:middle line:84%
I divided this kind of
pathological genocidal

00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:34.240 align:middle line:90%
divinity.

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.600 align:middle line:84%
I looked at individual murders
for which he was responsible,

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:41.200 align:middle line:84%
and then mass murders of his own
people, and then mass murders

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:44.120 align:middle line:84%
of other people, and then
even genocidal efforts.

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And so again and
again and again,

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:48.310 align:middle line:84%
he's killing individuals
among his chosen people

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:52.840 align:middle line:84%
for some kind of a
failure to keep his law.

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:55.720 align:middle line:84%
So, for instance, he's asked
Moses to go back into Egypt

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:56.890 align:middle line:90%
to set his people free.

00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And on the way back,
Moses is married

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:03.250 align:middle line:84%
to a non-Jewish woman at the
time, and he has two sons.

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And God attempts to kill
Moses on the way back to Egypt

00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:08.200 align:middle line:84%
because he hasn't
circumcised her sons.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.942 align:middle line:84%
Now the fact is,
circumcision didn't

00:32:09.942 --> 00:32:11.650 align:middle line:84%
arrive for hundreds
of years after Moses'

00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:12.910 align:middle line:90%
putative existence.

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And so his wife, a woman called
Zipporah, has to take a knife

00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:18.610 align:middle line:84%
and circumcise the
two boys on the spot

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:20.300 align:middle line:90%
to save God from killing Moses.

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:21.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:22.900 align:middle line:90%
Don't get us into that one.

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:24.180 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:26.670 align:middle line:84%
Circumcision, what
was that about

00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:29.940 align:middle line:84%
and why was that carried over
into the Christian world?

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And why does this
persist to this day?

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:37.740 align:middle line:84%
>>OLAOIRE: I joke sometimes
that it's an amazing thing

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:39.360 align:middle line:84%
that people were
prepared to trade,

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:42.730 align:middle line:84%
that God was prepared to trade
a covenant for foreskins.

00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:43.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:46.500 align:middle line:84%
>>OLAOIRE: What kind of a
fetish he had, I have no idea.

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
what was the point?

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:50.100 align:middle line:90%
I just don't get this still.

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:51.120 align:middle line:90%
I never have.

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:52.942 align:middle line:84%
>>OLAOIRE: Obviously,
circumcision

00:32:52.942 --> 00:32:54.900 align:middle line:84%
came at a much later
stage in human development

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:56.740 align:middle line:84%
and was practiced
actually by the peoples

00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:58.360 align:middle line:90%
among whom I lived as well.

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:00.070 align:middle line:84%
So for whatever reasons,
it came out of--

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:00.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In Kenya?

00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>>OLAOIRE: Oh, yeah.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:01.740 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:02.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:03.720 align:middle line:90%
So what was the purpose there?

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.700 align:middle line:84%
>>OLAOIRE: It was
an initiation rite.

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:08.280 align:middle line:84%
So it happened for boys at
the beginning of puberty.

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:10.110 align:middle line:84%
And it was a trial
that they could

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:14.670 align:middle line:84%
endure that kind of physical
assault without crying out.

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And so it was basically
many, many different peoples

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:20.910 align:middle line:84%
throughout human history have
put young boys, particularly,

00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:24.120 align:middle line:84%
in situations of being
in danger of dying

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:27.300 align:middle line:84%
to prove their kind of their
virility and their strength,

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:28.620 align:middle line:90%
that they wouldn't cry.

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:30.450 align:middle line:90%
And so this was one such custom.

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Now that's kind of
retroactively put back--

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To do it to
a two-day-old baby?

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:35.700 align:middle line:90%
Tender little baby?

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:38.283 align:middle line:84%
>>OLAOIRE: Yes, and to pretend
that it doesn't hurt the child.

00:33:38.283 --> 00:33:39.540 align:middle line:90%
It's utterly ridiculous.

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:42.030 align:middle line:84%
But initially, it was
a rite of initiation,

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:44.670 align:middle line:84%
and it's still practiced
in Kenya as such.

00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:47.550 align:middle line:84%
Young boys at age 12 or 13 are
taken off for a few months,

00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:49.530 align:middle line:84%
and they're inducted
into warriorhood,

00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:51.960 align:middle line:84%
and they undergo this
trial to see if they

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.460 align:middle line:90%
are fit for being warriors.

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:54.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:56.070 align:middle line:90%
But that was just one instance.

00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:59.310 align:middle line:84%
God kills 3,000
people for dancing

00:33:59.310 --> 00:34:01.740 align:middle line:84%
naked around a golden
calf after Moses

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:05.040 align:middle line:84%
is locked on the mountain for
40 days to get the Covenant.

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:12.080 align:middle line:84%
At one stage, God kills
the two sons of Aaron.

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.710 align:middle line:90%
They're newly ordained priests.

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:17.739 align:middle line:84%
And on their first day as being
priests, they mess up a ritual

00:34:17.739 --> 00:34:18.989 align:middle line:90%
and God kills the two of them.

00:34:18.989 --> 00:34:21.580 align:middle line:90%


00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And Aaron, the father,
and God says to him,

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.650 align:middle line:84%
don't cry, and don't
touch those dead bodies.

00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:26.587 align:middle line:90%
I'll kill you as well.

00:34:26.587 --> 00:34:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And people
were still trying

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:29.370 align:middle line:90%
to get in his good favor.

00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:30.780 align:middle line:90%
>>OLAOIRE: Exactly.

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:33.989 align:middle line:84%
There's one passage
in the Second book

00:34:33.989 --> 00:34:35.730 align:middle line:90%
of Chronicles in Chapter 14.

00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Ridiculous story,
that God allegedly

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:40.620 align:middle line:90%
killed 1 million Ethiopians.

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:41.969 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what misdemeanor.

00:34:41.969 --> 00:34:44.171 align:middle line:90%
He killed 1 million Ethiopians.

00:34:44.171 --> 00:34:45.254 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is laughable.

00:34:45.254 --> 00:34:46.296 align:middle line:90%
>>OLAOIRE: Yeah, totally.

00:34:46.296 --> 00:34:48.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so the way that
the prosecution reduces it

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:51.360 align:middle line:84%
through their star
witness is hysterical.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:52.860 align:middle line:84%
I just have to say,
it's hysterical,

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:54.420 align:middle line:90%
as he counts this all up, right?

00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's based
on your personality

00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:58.320 align:middle line:90%
and your storytelling.

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:00.700 align:middle line:84%
Now as we get on in the
book I don't want to-- we

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:02.700 align:middle line:84%
can't go into too many
of these, because there's

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.620 align:middle line:84%
a lot of-- there are
a lot of examples,

00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:06.240 align:middle line:84%
scholarship, units
of measurement.

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:08.500 align:middle line:90%
Noah's Ark is very interesting.

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:10.867 align:middle line:84%
You said it gives a whole
new meaning to poop deck.

00:35:10.867 --> 00:35:12.150 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:13.170 align:middle line:90%
Noah's Ark itself.

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:14.970 align:middle line:84%
Although we know
there was a deluge.

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And so let's go on now to
what you were trying to--

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:19.830 align:middle line:84%
what you're trying
to move past and move

00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:21.752 align:middle line:84%
toward in the latter
part of the book.

00:35:21.752 --> 00:35:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And I want to read a
couple of things you said.

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:25.575 align:middle line:90%
So now we get into--

00:35:25.575 --> 00:35:26.700 align:middle line:90%
not even the New Testament.

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:28.602 align:middle line:84%
We're getting into
Yeshua or Jesus.

00:35:28.602 --> 00:35:30.060 align:middle line:84%
You say personally,
I don't believe

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:31.830 align:middle line:84%
that Jesus was a
Christian, nor did he

00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:33.180 align:middle line:90%
come to found a new religion.

00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:35.340 align:middle line:84%
Rather he came to
fan into flames,

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:39.990 align:middle line:84%
the mystical embers that lie
at the heart of each one of us.

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
what you're doing.

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>>OLAOIRE: Absolutely.

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:43.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In your
lifetime as well.

00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:44.527 align:middle line:90%
>>OLAOIRE: Absolutely.

00:35:44.527 --> 00:35:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you say in a
very well-articulated way that

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:50.640 align:middle line:84%
religion as we know
it really now--

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:53.390 align:middle line:84%
you as a Catholic priest say,
we need to get rid of it.

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:54.330 align:middle line:90%
>>OLAOIRE: Absolutely.

00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:56.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's
start talking about what

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:56.998 align:middle line:90%
you're building toward.

00:35:56.998 --> 00:35:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And then let me read one
more of your statements.

00:35:59.080 --> 00:35:59.640 align:middle line:90%
>>OLAOIRE: Sure.

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:00.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:01.007 align:middle line:90%
This is what you said.

00:36:01.007 --> 00:36:03.780 align:middle line:90%
"To avoid the ages old cycle.

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:05.820 align:middle line:90%
And this is the ages-old cycle.

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:07.920 align:middle line:84%
Someone has a
spiritual experience.

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.800 align:middle line:84%
A charismatic prophet
then shows up.

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.967 align:middle line:90%
Then we develop community.

00:36:12.967 --> 00:36:14.550 align:middle line:84%
Then there's the
death of the prophet.

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:16.920 align:middle line:84%
Then organizations
and oligarchy.

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:20.130 align:middle line:84%
Then theology, dogma, crusades
against any outsiders,

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:23.470 align:middle line:84%
inquisitions against insiders,
and voila, a new prophet."

00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>>OLAOIRE: Yes.

00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:26.535 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's how the
cycle has gone historically.

00:36:26.535 --> 00:36:27.030 align:middle line:90%
>>OLAOIRE: Yes.

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:28.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just talk
about that for a moment

00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:29.992 align:middle line:84%
and why we've got
to let this go.

00:36:29.992 --> 00:36:31.200 align:middle line:90%
>>OLAOIRE: So I've seen this.

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.408 align:middle line:84%
This is true not just of
religions, and certainly not

00:36:33.408 --> 00:36:34.710 align:middle line:90%
just of the Christian religion.

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:36.540 align:middle line:84%
I've seen it in
all organizations,

00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:39.780 align:middle line:84%
that what starts off as
an extraordinary insight,

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:43.240 align:middle line:84%
as a way of reaching out to
help suffering humanity, very,

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:44.040 align:middle line:90%
very quickly--

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.870 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's built
around some kind

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:48.720 align:middle line:84%
of a charismatic individual
who attracts, you know,

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.250 align:middle line:90%
followers of some kind.

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:53.070 align:middle line:84%
And almost inevitably,
he's killed,

00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:55.290 align:middle line:84%
a Martin Luther King
figure or a Mahatma Gandhi

00:36:55.290 --> 00:36:56.550 align:middle line:90%
figure or a Jesus figure.

00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:57.480 align:middle line:90%
They're killed.

00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:59.520 align:middle line:84%
Then, there is an
organization grows up

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.620 align:middle line:84%
around the memory
of this individual.

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:03.510 align:middle line:84%
The organization is
taken over by some kind

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:06.010 align:middle line:84%
of a self-appointed oligarchy,
who now put themselves

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:06.810 align:middle line:90%
in charge.

00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:11.070 align:middle line:84%
They now begin very, very
slowly to change the teaching.

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:13.650 align:middle line:84%
It's like, the
original prophet said,

00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:16.020 align:middle line:84%
we need to march
towards the East.

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:19.110 align:middle line:84%
The next guy says, well, he
didn't actually mean the East.

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:21.433 align:middle line:90%
He meant the North, Northeast.

00:37:21.433 --> 00:37:22.600 align:middle line:90%
So let's shift a little bit.

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:23.790 align:middle line:90%
That's what he actually meant.

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:25.050 align:middle line:84%
The next guy comes
and along and says,

00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:26.790 align:middle line:84%
he didn't actually
mean North Northeast.

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:29.040 align:middle line:84%
He meant North, so
we shift to North.

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.780 align:middle line:84%
The next guy says,
well, actually, he

00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:33.030 align:middle line:84%
was talking actually
about going Northwest.

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:34.697 align:middle line:84%
That's really what
he was talking about.

00:37:34.697 --> 00:37:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And the guy the next day
says, actually, there

00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:37.900 align:middle line:90%
was a miscalculation.

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:38.700 align:middle line:90%
He meant West.

00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:39.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:41.270 align:middle line:84%
>>OLAOIRE: And then we're
180 degrees out of it.

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's what happens
in organizations.

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And it happens in every
organization of human beings.

00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:48.840 align:middle line:90%
It goes through these stages.

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And some new prophet
arises to call us back,

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:54.660 align:middle line:84%
like a Francis of Assisi
in the 1200s, who's

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:57.300 align:middle line:84%
calling the
Christian church back

00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:59.850 align:middle line:84%
into the message and the
vision of Jesus Christ.

00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And within 200 years,
the group that he founds,

00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:05.130 align:middle line:84%
the Franciscans, are in
charge of the Inquisition.

00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:08.170 align:middle line:84%
They're pulling people apart,
literally, on the rack.

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And so again and
again, and I see

00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:14.550 align:middle line:84%
this tendency of human beings
to have great movements

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:17.440 align:middle line:90%
shredded by organizations.

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:19.465 align:middle line:90%
So if you want the--

00:38:19.465 --> 00:38:21.840 align:middle line:84%
for that I can say something
else about that if you wish.

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:22.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Please go ahead.

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:23.875 align:middle line:84%
We have a few
minutes left, and I

00:38:23.875 --> 00:38:26.250 align:middle line:84%
wanted to get to you about
the subject of temptation

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:27.060 align:middle line:90%
and perfection.

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:27.860 align:middle line:90%
>>OLAOIRE: Sure.

00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:31.950 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I did in
Kenya was I lived in an area

00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:34.710 align:middle line:84%
where there was constant
famine, a semi-desert area.

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:37.270 align:middle line:84%
And so water production
was a huge issue for me.

00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:40.050 align:middle line:84%
I spent a lot of time
creating water projects

00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:41.520 align:middle line:90%
to bring water to villages.

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:43.620 align:middle line:90%
And mostly very successfully.

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:46.060 align:middle line:84%
But on two occasions, I
remember, one occasion,

00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:48.960 align:middle line:84%
we piped water over a
two-year project from a source

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:50.730 align:middle line:90%
to a village.

00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:53.220 align:middle line:84%
And we turned on the
water in the village

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:55.230 align:middle line:84%
square in the morning
two years into the work,

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:56.860 align:middle line:90%
and nothing comes out.

00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:58.110 align:middle line:90%
And we go back along the pipe.

00:38:58.110 --> 00:39:00.210 align:middle line:84%
It's just PVC piping,
plastic piping.

00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And a warrior from
a different tribe

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:04.350 align:middle line:84%
who didn't get a
water project had just

00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:06.990 align:middle line:84%
traversed the pipe with a
spear, sticking holes in it

00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:09.520 align:middle line:84%
all the ways, and the
water just spouting out.

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And so in the second project,
we had piped water successfully,

00:39:13.770 --> 00:39:15.180 align:middle line:90%
and we turned on the water.

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:16.440 align:middle line:90%
It flowed copiously.

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:17.580 align:middle line:90%
Everybody drank from it.

00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And two days later, everybody
was down with dysentery,

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:22.620 align:middle line:84%
because the source from which
we were taking the water

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:23.940 align:middle line:90%
was polluted.

00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And that became a
great image for me,

00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:28.590 align:middle line:84%
that the pipes represent
the systems as we create,

00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:31.470 align:middle line:84%
and the water represents the
people who staff the systems.

00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:33.990 align:middle line:84%
If you've got good systems
with corrupt people,

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:35.880 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
poison the consumer.

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:37.795 align:middle line:84%
If you've got bad
systems with good people,

00:39:37.795 --> 00:39:39.420 align:middle line:84%
the consumer-- the
product doesn't even

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:40.470 align:middle line:90%
reach the consumer.

00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:41.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:44.340 align:middle line:84%
>>OLAOIRE: So it has to
be both a good structure

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:45.240 align:middle line:90%
and good people.

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:49.200 align:middle line:84%
So there has to be a commitment
on behalf of the people

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.390 align:middle line:84%
to transform themselves
as individuals

00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:55.080 align:middle line:84%
and to create systems that
reflect that transformation.

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:56.858 align:middle line:84%
But you can't have
one and not the other.

00:39:56.858 --> 00:39:58.650 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, they'll just
corrupt each other.

00:39:58.650 --> 00:39:59.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're right.

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:00.645 align:middle line:84%
>>OLAOIRE: And so
whether we're talking

00:40:00.645 --> 00:40:03.420 align:middle line:84%
about revamping
our medical models,

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:05.910 align:middle line:84%
or our educational systems,
or our religious systems,

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:09.300 align:middle line:84%
it needs to be both a commitment
on the part of the individuals

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:11.970 align:middle line:84%
to self-transformation
and a commitment

00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:13.770 align:middle line:84%
to transform the
systems that deliver

00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:15.580 align:middle line:90%
the commodity to the consumer.

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:16.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think
it's fair to say globally,

00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:18.492 align:middle line:84%
we're in desperate
need of both sides

00:40:18.492 --> 00:40:22.295 align:middle line:84%
to transform in all of the
ways you just spoke of.

00:40:22.295 --> 00:40:23.670 align:middle line:84%
You wrote something,
and I wanted

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:24.640 align:middle line:90%
to talk to you about this.

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's a kind
of a non-sequitur,

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:27.540 align:middle line:84%
but we only have a
few minutes left,

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:30.360 align:middle line:84%
and you and I are going to have
more conversations, including

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.540 align:middle line:84%
a series of conversations about
the nature of good and evil

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:35.610 align:middle line:84%
in the very truest
sense of the word,

00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:37.210 align:middle line:90%
which I can't wait for that.

00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:41.670 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, you have here, we're
going to talk about temptation.

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:43.710 align:middle line:84%
"Without temptation,
we would be robots,

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:45.630 align:middle line:90%
pre-programmed to be good.

00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:49.320 align:middle line:84%
One who is unconsciously
good is simply lucky.

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:53.460 align:middle line:84%
One who is unconsciously
evil is simply asleep.

00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:57.450 align:middle line:84%
One who is consciously
evil is pathological,

00:40:57.450 --> 00:41:01.680 align:middle line:84%
and one who is consciously
good is enlightened,"

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:05.550 align:middle line:84%
which is an entirely new
definition of enlightenment,

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:08.220 align:middle line:84%
thinking we're going
to somehow transcend

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:09.870 align:middle line:84%
into another dimension,
and we'll just

00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:11.820 align:middle line:90%
be gossamer in appearance.

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:13.570 align:middle line:90%
That's not what it's about.

00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:17.100 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about this, and
our, especially in New Age

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:20.570 align:middle line:84%
communities, this seeking
perfection isn't--

00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:22.320 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
even the right journey,

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:23.910 align:middle line:90%
to seek perfection.

00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:25.943 align:middle line:84%
I would like you
to talk about it.

00:41:25.943 --> 00:41:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>>OLAOIRE: So the
word perfection,

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:30.300 align:middle line:84%
Jesus says in the New
Testament, he says,

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:32.940 align:middle line:84%
you must be perfect as your
Heavenly Father is perfect.

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, what
does that mean?

00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And the New Testament
is written in Greek.

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And the word that
used for perfection

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:41.730 align:middle line:84%
is the word telos, from which we
get the English word theology.

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:44.185 align:middle line:84%
And theology means to be
attracted toward a goal.

00:41:44.185 --> 00:41:45.060 align:middle line:90%
That's what it means.

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:47.130 align:middle line:84%
So perfection consists
in being committed

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:49.410 align:middle line:84%
to the purpose for
which I incarnated.

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:53.400 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing got to do with
a stainless steel sinlessness.

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:55.270 align:middle line:90%
Nada to do with that.

00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:59.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's very related then to
the world of sin, for instance.

00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:01.770 align:middle line:84%
Again in the New
Testament, the word sin

00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:04.380 align:middle line:84%
is a metaphor that's
taken from archery.

00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:06.930 align:middle line:84%
It means literally
just to miss the mark.

00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:09.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, missing the mark
is hugely important

00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:12.270 align:middle line:84%
because the essence
of learning is

00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:15.760 align:middle line:84%
repetition and feedback,
the two aspects, repetition

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:16.560 align:middle line:90%
and feedback.

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:18.810 align:middle line:84%
You learn things by hearing
it again and again and again.

00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:20.760 align:middle line:84%
You learn to ride a bicycle
by doing it again and again

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.830 align:middle line:84%
and again, and you
improve your performance

00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:24.970 align:middle line:84%
by the feedback from
your previous efforts.

00:42:24.970 --> 00:42:26.930 align:middle line:84%
So if you're playing
darts, for instance,

00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:29.222 align:middle line:84%
if you go to an English pub,
and they're throwing darts

00:42:29.222 --> 00:42:32.670 align:middle line:84%
at a dartboard, and I were to
hang a sheet across the middle

00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:35.640 align:middle line:84%
of the room and say, you have to
throw the darts over the sheet,

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:37.602 align:middle line:84%
and you can't actually
see the dart board.

00:42:37.602 --> 00:42:39.060 align:middle line:84%
And now know you're
throwing darts,

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:40.960 align:middle line:84%
and you have no idea
where they land.

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:42.690 align:middle line:84%
There is no way you
can improve your aim.

00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:44.670 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
throw a dart, you say,

00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:47.460 align:middle line:84%
oh I'm throwing too far
to the left or too high.

00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:48.630 align:middle line:90%
I can adjust my aim.

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:52.770 align:middle line:84%
So sin is the system whereby
we are given feedback

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:55.350 align:middle line:84%
from our previous efforts
to improve our aim.

00:42:55.350 --> 00:42:58.170 align:middle line:84%
So perfection is being
committed to improving

00:42:58.170 --> 00:43:01.230 align:middle line:84%
my aim by doing better each
time I see where my dart lands.

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:04.800 align:middle line:84%
So both sin and perfection
are misunderstood completely

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:06.190 align:middle line:90%
in the Christian scriptures.

00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:08.730 align:middle line:84%
It's a feedback
mechanism in which

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:11.700 align:middle line:84%
the soul is committed to
picking itself up again

00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:12.750 align:middle line:90%
and again and again.

00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:14.220 align:middle line:90%
We're like an acorn.

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:16.200 align:middle line:84%
An acorn is
committed to becoming

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:18.600 align:middle line:84%
an oak tree capable of
dropping acorns itself.

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And that process takes
an acorn 50 years.

00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:24.090 align:middle line:84%
It is 50 years
before an acorn can

00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:27.540 align:middle line:84%
become an oak tree capable
of dropping other acorns,

00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:29.040 align:middle line:84%
but it's committed
to that process.

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And no matter where
you put an acorn,

00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:33.810 align:middle line:84%
it will try its best
to send on a root

00:43:33.810 --> 00:43:36.330 align:middle line:84%
and create a tree that
will produce acorns.

00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:38.400 align:middle line:84%
That's what perfection

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.317 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love that.

00:43:39.317 --> 00:43:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And that makes perfect
sense to me, is continuing.

00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Don't let anything get in your
way of continuing on the path

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.220 align:middle line:84%
that you've chosen for
yourself in this lifetime.

00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:49.680 align:middle line:84%
The lessons you've chosen,
the love you've chosen,

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:51.210 align:middle line:84%
the people and the
character, cast

00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:52.800 align:middle line:90%
of characters you've chosen.

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:54.300 align:middle line:90%
Just keep trying.

00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And like you say in
this previous one,

00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:58.680 align:middle line:84%
that new definition of
enlightenment, the one who

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:02.260 align:middle line:84%
is consciously good, meaning
you're working at it,

00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:03.060 align:middle line:90%
is enlightened.

00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:03.450 align:middle line:90%
>>OLAOIRE: Absolutely.

00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:04.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is enlightenment.

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:05.310 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:44:05.310 --> 00:44:05.610 align:middle line:90%
>>OLAOIRE: Thanks.

00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's very
human, it's very us,

00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:09.240 align:middle line:90%
and it's very achievable.

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:10.995 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I want
to read this one other

00:44:10.995 --> 00:44:11.947 align:middle line:90%
you wrote as a teaser.

00:44:11.947 --> 00:44:14.280 align:middle line:84%
This whole subject that we're
going to be talking about,

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:16.260 align:middle line:84%
the nature of good
and evil, we get

00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:18.135 align:middle line:84%
the subject of free will
as humans into this.

00:44:18.135 --> 00:44:19.177 align:middle line:90%
>>OLAOIRE: Yes, yes, yes.

00:44:19.177 --> 00:44:21.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let me read this
and have you respond to it, OK?

00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:25.860 align:middle line:84%
You wrote, this is page 276,
"free will is the sticky part.

00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:28.830 align:middle line:84%
It necessitates there being
choices among which to decide.

00:44:28.830 --> 00:44:30.840 align:middle line:84%
But the choice
originally was not

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:33.180 align:middle line:84%
between good and
pre-existing evil,

00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:37.140 align:middle line:84%
rather, where to land on
the spectrum of service

00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:41.160 align:middle line:84%
to self at one end and service
to other on the other."

00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:43.830 align:middle line:84%
That is the most
perfect definition

00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:47.310 align:middle line:84%
I've seen about the
implications of free will.

00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:48.657 align:middle line:90%
>>OLAOIRE: Thank you.

00:44:48.657 --> 00:44:49.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So there you go.

00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at all
of these various conflicts

00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:56.250 align:middle line:84%
and these stories in the Bible
and so forth, a lot of it,

00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:59.670 align:middle line:84%
it really falls down to, was
this done for service to self

00:44:59.670 --> 00:45:02.970 align:middle line:84%
or was this done for
service to other?

00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:05.983 align:middle line:84%
So any final thoughts
now on the book and what

00:45:05.983 --> 00:45:07.150 align:middle line:90%
you're trying to do with it?

00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:09.567 align:middle line:84%
I know people have started
trying to get in touch with you

00:45:09.567 --> 00:45:11.190 align:middle line:84%
from around the
world about, how do

00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:14.010 align:middle line:84%
we set up truly conscious
groups of people

00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:15.052 align:middle line:90%
to move forward together?

00:45:15.052 --> 00:45:16.760 align:middle line:84%
>>OLAOIRE: It's a
great question, Regina.

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:18.330 align:middle line:84%
Because that's where
the future lies.

00:45:18.330 --> 00:45:20.252 align:middle line:84%
The future is not going
to be megachurches.

00:45:20.252 --> 00:45:22.710 align:middle line:84%
The future is not going to be
handouts from the government.

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:24.127 align:middle line:84%
The future is not
going to be kind

00:45:24.127 --> 00:45:28.690 align:middle line:84%
of jabs that protect us from all
kinds of COVID in the future.

00:45:28.690 --> 00:45:32.010 align:middle line:10%
The future is small communities
working together, sharing

00:45:32.010 --> 00:45:34.620 align:middle line:10%
their skills and
their resources,

00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:36.840 align:middle line:10%
and then networking
internationally

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:38.250 align:middle line:10%
with each other.

00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:41.100 align:middle line:10%
The time of the mega
groupings, the time

00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:44.070 align:middle line:10%
of the WHO making
health decisions,

00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:45.960 align:middle line:10%
or the International
Monetary Fund

00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:48.180 align:middle line:10%
making financial
decisions, or the Vatican

00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:51.530 align:middle line:10%
making religious decisions,
that's long since gone.

00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:54.400 align:middle line:84%
It's no longer
serving its purposes.

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:56.640 align:middle line:84%
We're on the verge of a
breakthrough, in which we

00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:00.870 align:middle line:84%
realize that we have to
disidentify with what I call

00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:04.890 align:middle line:84%
the "role self," which is
just the place I'm playing

00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:07.860 align:middle line:84%
in this incarnation, and
re-identify with the soul

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:10.590 align:middle line:84%
self, which is the eternal part
of me, which was never born

00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:12.520 align:middle line:84%
and which will never
die until finally I

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:14.970 align:middle line:90%
emerge with the source self.

00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:17.250 align:middle line:84%
Because ultimately,
you know, life

00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:19.770 align:middle line:90%
is a game that God is playing.

00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:25.170 align:middle line:10%
I sometimes say that life is a
dream that the ego is having.

00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And the ego is a dream
that the soul is having.

00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:29.730 align:middle line:84%
And the soul is a dream
that spirit is having,

00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:32.880 align:middle line:84%
and spirit is a dream
that source is having.

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:37.230 align:middle line:84%
So we live within nested dreams,
and it's God dreaming this.

00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:39.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's beautiful.

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:41.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, you said one thing
that got my attention,

00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:43.030 align:middle line:84%
but we don't have
time to talk about it.

00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:44.380 align:middle line:90%
And that is-- well, many things.

00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:46.710 align:middle line:84%
But we were talking about
where we come together

00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:49.900 align:middle line:84%
as individuals, offering our
unique talents and skills.

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:51.660 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
I'm concerned about

00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:54.270 align:middle line:84%
is right now, we've
become so technological

00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:57.060 align:middle line:84%
that the young people
coming up are plenty bright,

00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:59.130 align:middle line:84%
but they're not having
to be forced away

00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:00.880 align:middle line:90%
into developing skill sets.

00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:03.510 align:middle line:84%
So there seems to
be a lack of skills

00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:05.280 align:middle line:84%
that are developing
in the youngest

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:07.230 align:middle line:84%
generation, the
Zoomers right now,

00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:10.020 align:middle line:84%
where you might
have known how to do

00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:12.210 align:middle line:84%
many things by the age
of 10 once upon a time.

00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:15.480 align:middle line:84%
So somehow, I think
the technology is also

00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:18.030 align:middle line:84%
part of this block to
our being able to develop

00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:20.040 align:middle line:84%

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:21.552 align:middle line:90%
