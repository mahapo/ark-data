[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:08.258 --> 00:00:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DANIEL DUKE: There
were a lot of stories.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.150 align:middle line:84%
People would wonder how
Jesse could rob a bank

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.536 align:middle line:90%
in one state on the same day--

00:00:13.536 --> 00:00:16.036 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: As they're
getting robbed somewhere else.

00:00:16.036 --> 00:00:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: --or in two different
states on the same day, yeah.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.993 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of time,
they would split up.

00:00:18.993 --> 00:00:20.535 align:middle line:84%
It was the same old
guerrilla tactics

00:00:20.535 --> 00:00:22.710 align:middle line:90%
that they learned in the war.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.840 align:middle line:84%
Ties back in with
what you had mentioned

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.700 align:middle line:90%
about his need for celebrity.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.365 align:middle line:84%
He loved it, and
they enjoyed it.

00:00:28.365 --> 00:00:30.690 align:middle line:84%
It was almost
taunting with people.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.970 align:middle line:84%
They would rob a
train, and women

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.620 align:middle line:90%
would ask for their autograph.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.020 align:middle line:84%
After, they just-- they
didn't rob women and they

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.960 align:middle line:84%
didn't rob men who
had calloused hands.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.780 align:middle line:84%
The family story was that
Jesse changed his name

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.110 align:middle line:84%
to James Lafayette Courtney,
which was one of his cousins,

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.280 align:middle line:84%
and he lived out his life in
Texas as a peaceable farmer.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.110 align:middle line:84%
But he still went
on robbing sprees.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.240 align:middle line:84%
Only when he would come
back, he would always

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.020 align:middle line:84%
come back a different route
from that which he left.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.875 align:middle line:84%
And the other part of it, just
Jesse, he's a mystery that--

00:01:01.875 --> 00:01:03.690 align:middle line:90%
the book's not closed on Jesse.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.580 align:middle line:84%
Much of it has
finally been solved,

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.220 align:middle line:84%
but there's still a lot
of-- a lot to be found.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.495 align:middle line:90%


00:01:12.495 --> 00:01:14.830 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It's been said
that Americans always

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.410 align:middle line:10%
seem to fall for a
billionaire on horseback.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.500 align:middle line:10%
Something about an
unapologetic grab for power.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.120 align:middle line:84%
We've even venerated
characters that

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.270 align:middle line:84%
would normally be relegated
to dark chapters of history.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.090 align:middle line:84%
One such character is
the outlaw Jesse James.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.110 align:middle line:84%
His great, great grandson Daniel
Duke is here with us today

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.540 align:middle line:84%
to take a deeper look into
the character of a man who

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.910 align:middle line:84%
amassed large amounts
of wealth in the day,

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.320 align:middle line:90%
but through robbery.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.325 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Daniel.

00:01:39.325 --> 00:01:39.970 align:middle line:90%
>>DANIEL DUKE: Thanks.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is a
little different story

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.630 align:middle line:84%
for our audience, but I
thought it was interesting

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.335 align:middle line:84%
because we got to
look at-- right now,

00:01:46.335 --> 00:01:47.710 align:middle line:84%
I think in these
times, we've got

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.340 align:middle line:84%
to look at our own character,
and something about us

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.460 align:middle line:90%
loves this kind of raw power.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.610 align:middle line:84%
Something as Americans, we
just love this, and the tales

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.765 align:middle line:84%
and the number of songs that
are dedicated to Jesse James--

00:02:01.765 --> 00:02:02.598 align:middle line:90%
it's unfathomable.

00:02:02.598 --> 00:02:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And then you take a look at what
all happened, and you think,

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.100 align:middle line:90%
why?

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.040 align:middle line:90%
So, welcome.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Thank you.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's talk why
you started doing the research

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.470 align:middle line:84%
to write these books about
your great-great grandfather

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.497 align:middle line:84%
and your mom's role
in all of this.

00:02:16.497 --> 00:02:18.580 align:middle line:84%
Because women are going
to factor into this story.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:19.380 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: OK.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, my late mother,
she passed in 2015.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.570 align:middle line:10%
Her name was Betty
Dorsett Duke, and she

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.870 align:middle line:10%
spearheaded the family
research on Jesse

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.980 align:middle line:10%
and ended up changing history--

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.350 align:middle line:10%
established history.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.110 align:middle line:10%
History had claimed
that Jesse died in 1882,

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.130 align:middle line:10%
and that's the end.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, shot by one of
his fellow gang members.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.770 align:middle line:84%
Then that itself rhymes with
a lot of historical tales.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.740 align:middle line:90%
Betrayed by your own comrade.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, all cultures seem
to have stories similar to that

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.210 align:middle line:90%
and it fit perfect.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.520 align:middle line:84%
But my mother--
our late mother--

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.250 align:middle line:84%
she grew up hearing
family stories

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.950 align:middle line:84%
of Jesse James faking
his death, came to Texas,

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.750 align:middle line:84%
and he was her
great grandfather.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And then she'd go
to school and hear

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.920 align:middle line:84%
the stories, the
historical version of it

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.810 align:middle line:90%
where he was killed in 1882.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.240 align:middle line:84%
So she wanted to prove
once and for all which

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.760 align:middle line:84%
one was right, the family
stories or history.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And it just started a long, long
journey of gathering evidence

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.790 align:middle line:84%
and photos, writing letters,
and a lot of genealogy,

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.895 align:middle line:84%
just to try to uncover
the truth on the story.

00:03:24.895 --> 00:03:26.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And she
was a strong woman,

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.450 align:middle line:84%
she carried a lot
of responsibility.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And I only bring that up because
she's a few generations out,

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.420 align:middle line:84%
but this was same for
Jesse James' mom, which

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.620 align:middle line:90%
we'll get into in a moment.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.667 align:middle line:90%
She was a strong woman.

00:03:37.667 --> 00:03:38.500 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: That's true.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's-- we'll talk
about the culture that created

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.630 align:middle line:84%
those kind of really strong
women who just defended her

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.120 align:middle line:90%
clan and her sons to the day--

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.557 align:middle line:90%
well, every day of her life.

00:03:50.557 --> 00:03:51.390 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: That's true.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.848 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about
the environment of the times.

00:03:53.848 --> 00:03:56.290 align:middle line:84%
I think this is going to be
a really lovely, interesting

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.960 align:middle line:84%
history lesson for a lot of
people who don't officially

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.460 align:middle line:84%
study history and
don't have degrees

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.740 align:middle line:90%
in it regarding the Civil War.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.930 align:middle line:84%
Talking about what was
happening in the South

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.670 align:middle line:84%
and what was happening
in the North,

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.260 align:middle line:84%
and because Jesse James
was more a-- a supporter

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.480 align:middle line:84%
of the Confederacy,
we need to look

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.310 align:middle line:84%
at how the South perceived what
was being taken away from them,

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.674 align:middle line:90%
understanding the times.

00:04:19.674 --> 00:04:21.279 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: OK.

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, at the beginning
of the Civil War,

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.960 align:middle line:84%
before it actually
started, there

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.080 align:middle line:84%
was fighting of free
state versus slave state.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, the South
made most of their money--

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.800 align:middle line:84%
and it was usually the wealthy
families that had slaves,

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.870 align:middle line:84%
but they made most
of their money

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.360 align:middle line:90%
from slavery and agriculture.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And they needed slaves to
produce as much agriculture

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.420 align:middle line:84%
as they were selling, or
they thought they needed it.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I would
say in many cases,

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.360 align:middle line:84%
they probably needed
their level of--

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.590 align:middle line:90%
their comfort level.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.140 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want to
see that drop, so--

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And to make a long
story short, I

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.360 align:middle line:84%
think the average
person saw it--

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.200 align:middle line:84%
and in a lot of cases, I
think the churches helped.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.310 align:middle line:90%
Churches on both sides.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.280 align:middle line:84%
In the North, the churches would
preach to their congregations

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.270 align:middle line:90%
that-- freedom.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.820 align:middle line:84%
In the South, it was
liberty and "they're trying

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.950 align:middle line:90%
to take our way of life."

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.430 align:middle line:90%
And both sides--

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.040 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of churches
helped stir that up.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Telling people in the South just
to come, and people probably,

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.800 align:middle line:84%
I would say, looked
at it as their liberty

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.610 align:middle line:90%
was getting taken.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And they were
defending a way of life

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.980 align:middle line:84%
that we all agree
today was very immoral.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and it's
interesting because the kinds

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.310 align:middle line:84%
of wealth that the North had
versus what the South had--

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.080 align:middle line:84%
and as you say,
very agriculturally

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.490 align:middle line:90%
based in the South.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.170 align:middle line:84%
But you know, whether it was
cotton, tobacco, or whatever,

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.530 align:middle line:84%
but these are staples of
society and these were

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:48.740 align:middle line:90%
things that could be traded.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.510 align:middle line:90%
So we're looking at--

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.330 align:middle line:90%
and I have to say this.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.850 align:middle line:84%
OK, first of all
slavery, has been

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.890 align:middle line:84%
a reality throughout
human history,

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:02.980 align:middle line:84%
where some humans feel they
have the right to use and take

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.630 align:middle line:90%
advantage of other humans.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.270 align:middle line:84%
And this has happened
all over the globe,

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.880 align:middle line:84%
is still existing to this
day, was happening then.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And we look at it, and we
think, that's horrible.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.750 align:middle line:84%
But then we-- then, when it
comes to little compromises

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.090 align:middle line:84%
we have to make,
like I'm going to buy

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.070 align:middle line:84%
those shoes from a sweatshop
where a 10-year-old made them.

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Exactly.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And so this--

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.110 align:middle line:84%
I bring it up
because there's a lot

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.130 align:middle line:84%
of unacknowledged moral
issue involved in all

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.225 align:middle line:90%
of this across the board.

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:34.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Exactly, exactly.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And I love that
example because you

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.010 align:middle line:84%
can look at the price of a
shirt, and it's a good shirt,

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:42.620 align:middle line:84%
it's a brand name,
it's quality made.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.930 align:middle line:84%
And people tend to, oh, it's
on the other side of the world.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.010 align:middle line:84%
So you're distanced from it,
and it's not in your face,

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.510 align:middle line:90%
so the guilt factor isn't there.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:51.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.600 align:middle line:90%
But it was in our face.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: It was.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In the Civil War.

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.665 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: That's true.

00:06:54.665 --> 00:06:57.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So Civil War went
on, we saw what happened,

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.950 align:middle line:90%
we saw how that all turned out.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.570 align:middle line:84%
However, we're going to get
to Missouri, which is where

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:04.130 align:middle line:90%
Jesse and his family were from.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And Missouri was kind of the
Western outpost for the Civil

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:10.460 align:middle line:84%
War, and where everybody
kind of landed.

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.180 align:middle line:84%
And it had both Unionists
and Confederates there.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.100 align:middle line:84%
A lot of fighting in
the state of Missouri.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.890 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk
about what condition

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:21.685 align:middle line:90%
it left those people who were--

00:07:21.685 --> 00:07:23.560 align:middle line:84%
some of whom were fighting
in the war, others

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.830 align:middle line:84%
whose brothers or fathers
were sympathizers,

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:30.130 align:middle line:84%
and they're all jacked up,
now they're feeling ravaged.

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.690 align:middle line:84%
Jesse, I think, was 16 years
old when the war ended.

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:33.490 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Yeah.

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, he was very young.

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.960 align:middle line:84%
Today he would be
considered a child soldier.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.554 align:middle line:84%
So he's on the farm working,
and he was plowing the farm.

00:07:41.554 --> 00:07:43.721 align:middle line:84%
The way it went, Frank was
off with the Confederacy.

00:07:43.721 --> 00:07:44.929 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's his brother.

00:07:44.929 --> 00:07:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: And Frank was--
yes his older brother.

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:51.340 align:middle line:84%
So Frank was out, he had joined
the regular Confederate forces.

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And some red legs from-- and
they called them red legs.

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:56.530 align:middle line:90%
This was a pro--

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:57.998 align:middle line:90%
an abolitionist backed--

00:07:57.998 --> 00:07:58.915 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Northerners.

00:07:58.915 --> 00:08:01.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: Yeah, free
state backers.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.850 align:middle line:84%
They were in Kansas, and
there had been fighting.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people don't
realize the fighting between--

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.820 align:middle line:84%
the red legs, or free
state versus slave state

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.560 align:middle line:84%
on the Missouri-Kansas
border had

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:17.520 align:middle line:84%
been going for almost 10 years
before the Civil War started.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.100 align:middle line:84%
So there was already
a lot of tension,

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.200 align:middle line:84%
and you'd have a group
of guerrilla fighters

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:26.550 align:middle line:84%
from Kansas raid Missouri,
and then Missouri would--

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:29.460 align:middle line:84%
they'd gather up a posse and
ride back and raid the camp.

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:30.420 align:middle line:84%
It was just tit for
tat, back and forth.

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:31.965 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was kind
of Hatfields and McCoys.

00:08:31.965 --> 00:08:32.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Yeah, it was.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.929 align:middle line:90%
It was like a feud.

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- then there
was always a couple--

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:39.960 align:middle line:84%
with any story, there's
always some extreme cases

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:43.170 align:middle line:84%
where somebody got carried
away and killed someone,

00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:44.460 align:middle line:90%
or any kind of other.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:48.330 align:middle line:84%
You can name the
atrocity, it happened.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:52.140 align:middle line:84%
When Jesse got involved, he
was plowing on the farm out

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:55.050 align:middle line:84%
in the field, and a group
of union-backed guerrillas--

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.320 align:middle line:84%
Kansas Jayhawkers--
rode onto the farm.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.650 align:middle line:84%
They strapped him to his
plow and severely beat him,

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:03.390 align:middle line:84%
and left him
strapped to the plow.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:06.180 align:middle line:84%
After they were done beating
him, they wrote on to the house

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.820 align:middle line:84%
where they found his
mother, who some say

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.740 align:middle line:90%
was pregnant at the time.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.110 align:middle line:90%
And it's-- the accounts vary.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.840 align:middle line:84%
Some accounts claim they
lashed her to a tree,

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.820 align:middle line:84%
stripped her, lashed
year to a tree

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.890 align:middle line:84%
and severely whipped
her with a horse whip.

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And then they hung his
stepfather, Dr. Reuben Samuel,

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:23.490 align:middle line:90%
until--

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:25.470 align:middle line:84%
he didn't die, but
he was severely

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:27.150 align:middle line:90%
brain damaged from that--

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.055 align:middle line:90%
from that day forward.

00:09:29.055 --> 00:09:31.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now Frank
wasn't present for that.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.288 align:middle line:90%
Now Frank was away, right?

00:09:32.288 --> 00:09:33.205 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't on the farm.

00:09:33.205 --> 00:09:35.747 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: They allegedly rode on
to the farm looking for Frank.

00:09:35.747 --> 00:09:37.122 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
because Frank was

00:09:37.122 --> 00:09:38.340 align:middle line:90%
involved in some activities.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:42.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: That's
right, that's right.

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:44.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This was-- this was
kind of a rough way to go,

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:47.610 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking now a lot
of mercenaries at this point.

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:49.650 align:middle line:84%
It's like, hey,
we're ticked off,

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:51.965 align:middle line:84%
we lost, we're going
to go get ours.

00:09:51.965 --> 00:09:54.090 align:middle line:84%
We didn't win the war, but
we're going to get ours.

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:54.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Exactly.

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:57.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, and then you had
the retaliation from the North,

00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.430 align:middle line:90%
from the union.

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:02.115 align:middle line:84%
OK, so it gets really
convoluted, so continue here.

00:10:02.115 --> 00:10:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: So the war starts, and
Frank, Jesse's older brother,

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.600 align:middle line:84%
had joined the regular
Confederate forces,

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.500 align:middle line:90%
and Jesse wanted to join.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.500 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't take him
because he was too young,

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.540 align:middle line:90%
so-- and he was furious.

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And at that age, he
just wanted revenge.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.640 align:middle line:84%
So he found a group
who would take him,

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.375 align:middle line:84%
and that was
Quantrill's Guerrillas.

00:10:22.375 --> 00:10:23.250 align:middle line:90%
And these guys were--

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:23.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're rough.

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:25.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: --were
like special forces

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.660 align:middle line:84%
these days, only without--
they made their own rules

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:27.990 align:middle line:90%
pretty much.

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:29.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Weren't they
call Quantrill's Raiders?

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:32.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: Quantrill's Raiders,
some called them guerrillas.

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:34.810 align:middle line:90%
It was different names.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:36.480 align:middle line:90%
They supposedly had a flag.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.260 align:middle line:84%
It was made for them
later in the war,

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.140 align:middle line:84%
but it was a black
flag with the letter Q.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.620 align:middle line:84%
Some said it stood for
Quantrill's; others

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:47.730 align:middle line:84%
said no quarter, because they
gave no quarter to any soldier.

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:49.500 align:middle line:84%
There is a lot of
varying accounts,

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.140 align:middle line:84%
but they were said that they
didn't give-- they would

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.690 align:middle line:90%
kill any male of fighting age.

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:57.060 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at
how young Jesse was--

00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:01.590 align:middle line:84%
they were killing people
Jesse's age, early teens on up.

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And so they killed a
lot a lot of people.

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And they were actually very
skilled at what they did,

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:10.275 align:middle line:84%
which is where Jesse
and the gang later had--

00:11:10.275 --> 00:11:12.930 align:middle line:84%
they learned everything--
they learned about bank

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:14.460 align:middle line:90%
robbing in the Civil War.

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:15.585 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In the Civil War.

00:11:15.585 --> 00:11:16.793 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Yeah, and they just--

00:11:16.793 --> 00:11:19.450 align:middle line:84%
they used-- utilized those
tactics for their outlaw

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:20.250 align:middle line:90%
career.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.208 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, somewhere
in here-- and tell me,

00:11:22.208 --> 00:11:24.180 align:middle line:84%
I might be getting
these things confused.

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:27.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, weren't the Federales,
the federal agents,

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.820 align:middle line:90%
looking for Frank?

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:31.030 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Yes, they were.

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:31.470 align:middle line:90%
After the Civil war ended--

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:32.655 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that was
part of what was called

00:11:32.655 --> 00:11:34.410 align:middle line:90%
the Bushwhackers of the day.

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:34.575 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: That's right.

00:11:34.575 --> 00:11:34.700 align:middle line:90%
They were called--

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:35.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they're
the bushwhackers.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:36.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Exactly.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.620 align:middle line:84%
They were Quantrill's
Guerrillas,

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.255 align:middle line:90%
some called them Bushwhackers.

00:11:39.255 --> 00:11:40.755 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot
of different names.

00:11:40.755 --> 00:11:42.135 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you didn't
want to mess with them.

00:11:42.135 --> 00:11:43.755 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: That's
right, that's right.

00:11:43.755 --> 00:11:45.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So people-- a lot
of people died-- people died.

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:46.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: People died.

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:48.072 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they're
looking for him.

00:11:48.072 --> 00:11:50.675 align:middle line:90%
And is-- now at one point--

00:11:50.675 --> 00:11:52.300 align:middle line:84%
how do you say the
mother's name again?

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:52.430 align:middle line:90%
Zo--

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:53.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Zerelda.

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:54.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Zerelda.

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:55.260 align:middle line:90%
Zerelda.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.000 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about his
mom for a moment.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, Zerelda, from what I
read in different accounts,

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:03.000 align:middle line:84%
was considered a very
commanding woman--

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.770 align:middle line:90%
6-foot tall for the day.

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:06.540 align:middle line:90%
People were much tinier then.

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:09.915 align:middle line:84%
6 feet tall and had a
very masculine will.

00:12:09.915 --> 00:12:11.130 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: She did.

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:12.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She was from Kentucky.

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:13.363 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: That's true.

00:12:13.363 --> 00:12:15.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now let's talk
about that influence

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.430 align:middle line:84%
on Jesse and Frank, because
those women were tough.

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:19.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Yeah.

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:22.590 align:middle line:84%
She grew up, and she actually
came from a well-to-do family,

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:23.670 align:middle line:90%
very well educated.

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:25.380 align:middle line:84%
She grew up-- much
of her life was

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:28.890 align:middle line:84%
spent at a Catholic school
for women, or four girls.

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And she met her husband, Robert
Sallee James, later on in life.

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:37.290 align:middle line:84%
They met and got married,
but before that, she'd

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:40.530 align:middle line:84%
also spent part of her life
in the Black Horse Tavern

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:43.080 align:middle line:90%
which was owned by her uncle.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And that was, I believe,
where some of the rough edges

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:46.710 align:middle line:90%
came in.

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:50.250 align:middle line:84%
So she'd seen-- I would
imagine she'd seen

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:51.930 align:middle line:90%
a little bit of everything.

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:55.170 align:middle line:84%
Fights, gunfights,
and everything else.

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:58.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well she was
fiercely protective

00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:59.370 align:middle line:90%
of her family and her boys.

00:12:59.370 --> 00:12:59.945 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: That's true.

00:12:59.945 --> 00:13:02.528 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I'll give a quote
toward the end of this of what

00:13:02.528 --> 00:13:04.620 align:middle line:90%
she swore to, to the aunt.

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:06.575 align:middle line:90%
She-- these were her boys.

00:13:06.575 --> 00:13:10.380 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: She was 6-foot tall.

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:13.590 align:middle line:84%
Once she-- as an adult,
she was 6-foot tall.

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.500 align:middle line:84%
They said she was so strong
she could knock a man out

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:17.610 align:middle line:90%
with one hit.

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, they had
to have known that somehow.

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:22.500 align:middle line:84%
She had to have knocked
a few people out for that

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.670 align:middle line:90%
to get around.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:26.730 align:middle line:90%
And she was very, very open--

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:29.790 align:middle line:84%
well, she wasn't
shy about expressing

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:32.700 align:middle line:84%
her opinion regarding
politics or anything else.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:34.860 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people claim she
was a hard-- you know,

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:36.818 align:middle line:84%
"that woman is hard to
deal with," and at the--

00:13:36.818 --> 00:13:38.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, they used
the term mannish a lot.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: And at the time,
women didn't do that.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: And that wasn't-- but
when she's big enough to knock

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:47.415 align:middle line:84%
a man out, I guess they
had to put up with it.

00:13:47.415 --> 00:13:49.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now this
gets into another part.

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:52.320 align:middle line:84%
Now just straighten me
out on the timeline here.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.290 align:middle line:84%
At one point when they
came looking, didn't she--

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:57.382 align:middle line:84%
wasn't there an
explosion in her house?

00:13:57.382 --> 00:13:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And she lost an arm, we
have a picture of that.

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:01.813 align:middle line:84%
She lost an arm, and she could
probably still take someone

00:14:01.813 --> 00:14:02.730 align:middle line:90%
on with the other one.

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:06.460 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: That's-- yeah, she--

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:09.450 align:middle line:84%
it was later on in Jesse's
career when they were--

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:12.270 align:middle line:84%
Jesse and Frank were
robbing in the James Gang.

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:14.550 align:middle line:84%
The Pinkertons got
involved, and there

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:18.395 align:middle line:84%
was a Pinkerton who was looking
to blow the whole thing wide

00:14:18.395 --> 00:14:19.195 align:middle line:90%
open.

00:14:19.195 --> 00:14:20.775 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, tell us about
who the Pinkertons were.

00:14:20.775 --> 00:14:21.575 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: OK.

00:14:21.575 --> 00:14:22.860 align:middle line:90%
There were a detective agency.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:25.710 align:middle line:84%
During the Civil
War, Allen Pinkerton,

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:28.710 align:middle line:84%
who was the head of it had-- he
and some of his men had served

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:29.670 align:middle line:90%
as--

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:31.290 align:middle line:84%
it was before the
Secret Service,

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:34.320 align:middle line:84%
and they protected people like
Abraham Lincoln and others--

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.130 align:middle line:90%
generals.

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:35.617 align:middle line:90%
So they--

00:14:35.617 --> 00:14:37.075 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kind of
let Abraham down.

00:14:37.075 --> 00:14:38.730 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Yeah, they did.

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:42.420 align:middle line:84%
So they're-- they were
skilled at their job,

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:44.740 align:middle line:84%
and their motto was
"we never sleep."

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:47.040 align:middle line:84%
They-- they, like
hound dogs, they'd

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.170 align:middle line:84%
get on the trail and
they'd catch their man.

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And they never caught
Jesse or Frank.

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And it seemed to me they
were getting desperate,

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:57.040 align:middle line:90%
they wanted to catch their men.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's claimed-- it
was claimed at the time

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:03.885 align:middle line:84%
that they thought Jesse and
Frank were in the house,

00:15:03.885 --> 00:15:05.280 align:middle line:90%
in their mother's home.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And it was just in reality,
Jesse's mother was there.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:13.650 align:middle line:84%
Her nine-year-old son, which was
Jesse and Frank's half brother,

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:16.950 align:middle line:90%
Archie Peyton Samuel and her--

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:19.170 align:middle line:90%
her husband, Dr. Reuben Samuel.

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:22.140 align:middle line:84%
So in the middle of the
night, the Pinkertons

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.565 align:middle line:84%
lit what they called--
they called it Greek fire.

00:15:24.565 --> 00:15:26.940 align:middle line:84%
It was said to have been a
torch, it was actually a bomb.

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Later on in history,
not-- actually,

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:33.330 align:middle line:84%
I think it was in the '90s it
was proven that it was actually

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:34.980 align:middle line:90%
a bomb they threw in the house.

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:37.890 align:middle line:84%
So they threw a bomb
in, it woke Zerelda up,

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:39.510 align:middle line:90%
and it woke everybody up.

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:42.990 align:middle line:84%
They were all in the living
room by the fireplace,

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:45.120 align:middle line:84%
Zerelda was trying to
move it with a shovel

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.490 align:middle line:84%
into the fireplace,
and it exploded.

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:51.570 align:middle line:84%
It took her left arm off,
it killed her son, Archie,

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:55.290 align:middle line:84%
and mangled the right hand I
believe it was of her husband

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:56.750 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Reuben Samuel.

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:59.055 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How did this
stoke Frank and Jesse?

00:15:59.055 --> 00:16:01.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: They wanted blood.

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:05.160 align:middle line:84%
They didn't-- they're said to
have killed their neighbor who

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.390 align:middle line:84%
was spying on them
for the Pinkertons.

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:10.050 align:middle line:84%
It was a man who
didn't like them,

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:12.180 align:middle line:84%
he'd always-- he'd
been spying on them,

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:16.170 align:middle line:84%
and after that, that
was-- he met his end.

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:18.720 align:middle line:84%
When that happened,
it's interesting.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.350 align:middle line:90%
We have Jesse's daily journal.

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:22.790 align:middle line:84%
It was-- it's not
so much a diary,

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:25.290 align:middle line:84%
because he didn't talk about
his feelings, he just plotted--

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:25.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I wouldn't think.

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:27.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: --the facts down.

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.000 align:middle line:90%
But he--

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the diaries, what
would be the nature of an entry

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:32.470 align:middle line:90%
by Jesse?

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:34.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: It would be,
"went to the store,

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:38.360 align:middle line:90%
bought calico for $0.15, flour."

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.850 align:middle line:84%
Or like when he
detailed the trip

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:43.880 align:middle line:84%
he took with the
boys, and several--

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.047 align:middle line:84%
and he named them by name,
several of the known gang

00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:46.847 align:middle line:90%
members.

00:16:46.847 --> 00:16:48.110 align:middle line:90%
They went on a robbing spree.

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:52.250 align:middle line:84%
They jumped a train, went to
Shreveport, hopped a riverboat,

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:55.558 align:middle line:84%
and then the whole-- everywhere
they had gone in that trip,

00:16:55.558 --> 00:16:56.600 align:middle line:90%
there had been robberies.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.760 align:middle line:84%
He didn't say he
robbed anything, but--

00:16:58.760 --> 00:16:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He didn't
want to leave evidence.

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.555 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: But there
were robberies.

00:17:00.555 --> 00:17:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And an interesting point
about that, before I forget.

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:05.690 align:middle line:84%
While he was writing,
making entries

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:08.210 align:middle line:84%
in the journal on
that robbing spree,

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:12.080 align:middle line:84%
he was in Louisiana and
he stayed the night at--

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:14.960 align:middle line:84%
at the House of a man
named Gervais Fontenot.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.710 align:middle line:84%
And Gervais Fontenot--
I thought, well,

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:18.050 align:middle line:90%
this is an interesting name.

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like-- I researched
everyone associated with them.

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:23.960 align:middle line:84%
So in doing research
for Gervais,

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.819 align:middle line:84%
I found that he was
a retired US Marshal,

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:26.637 align:middle line:90%
and I thought why would Jesse--

00:17:26.637 --> 00:17:27.319 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Whoa.

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:27.980 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, why would he do that?

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: --stay with
a retired US Marshal?

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:30.530 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't make sense.

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:33.320 align:middle line:90%
But it went further.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.420 align:middle line:84%
Gervais Fontenot
was also the nephew

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:38.420 align:middle line:84%
of Jean Lafitte, the
famous pirate Jean Lafitte.

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds-- I thought,
oh my god, this is insane.

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:43.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, pirates
and in the old West,

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:45.010 align:middle line:84%
bank robbers had
a lot in common.

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:48.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: It almost--
to me, it helped maybe

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:52.910 align:middle line:84%
feed the idea of a bigger
network than just Jesse.

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:53.750 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:54.535 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:17:54.535 --> 00:17:55.825 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: Yeah, it was
very interesting.

00:17:55.825 --> 00:17:58.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you said--
you were talking off camera

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:00.410 align:middle line:84%
and you said, interestingly,
a lot of the robberies

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:02.900 align:middle line:84%
took place in the South,
where he was a Southerner.

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:04.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that was
his affiliation.

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:05.900 align:middle line:90%
So why was that?

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: Well, I'd been asked
that question a lot by people.

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.460 align:middle line:84%
Why, if he fought
for the South, why

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:11.660 align:middle line:90%
was he robbing in the South?

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And what a lot of people
don't realize is after the end

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:18.410 align:middle line:84%
of the Civil War, most
of the banks and a lot

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:23.390 align:middle line:84%
of professional-- attorneys,
judges, banks, they couldn't--

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:25.730 align:middle line:84%
former Confederates couldn't
hold those positions

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:26.530 align:middle line:90%
for a while.

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:27.980 align:middle line:90%
It was during Reconstruction.

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the banks were
run by Northern interests,

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:32.300 align:middle line:90%
which is why--

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.940 align:middle line:84%
which would explain why they
were hitting those banks.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:38.450 align:middle line:84%
Just, they felt-- they
were bitter to begin with,

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:41.990 align:middle line:84%
they'd lost the war, they didn't
get their way, and on top of it

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:45.520 align:middle line:84%
the banks were being operated
by their old enemies.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And what better
place to hit than--

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:50.187 align:middle line:84%
So these are jacked
up youth, too.

00:18:50.187 --> 00:18:52.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these guys are still
pretty young, in their 20s.

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And so he wants to make
a name for himself,

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:56.220 align:middle line:90%
he wants to amass some wealth.

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.630 align:middle line:84%
He can't seem to find a
way to do it legitimately.

00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: Yeah, and the fact
that Quantrill's Guerrillas

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.180 align:middle line:90%
were outlawed.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:04.322 align:middle line:84%
They never were granted
amnesty like the rest

00:19:04.322 --> 00:19:05.405 align:middle line:90%
of the Confederate forces.

00:19:05.405 --> 00:19:07.488 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and that's
important to know, too.

00:19:07.488 --> 00:19:12.500 align:middle line:84%
Even war crimes-- if you were in
the military, those were-- they

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.060 align:middle line:90%
were granted amnesty.

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.787 align:middle line:84%
But if you went
beyond that, and you

00:19:15.787 --> 00:19:17.495 align:middle line:84%
went into the mercenary
side, no amnesty.

00:19:17.495 --> 00:19:17.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: No amnesty.

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:18.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You were hunted down.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:19.415 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: No quarter.

00:19:19.415 --> 00:19:20.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No quarter.

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:23.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: And so the war
never really ended for him,

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:23.870 align:middle line:90%
which was--

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:26.015 align:middle line:90%
I can see-- they were young.

00:19:26.015 --> 00:19:27.583 align:middle line:90%
They weren't getting amnesty.

00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:30.125 align:middle line:84%
So you're branded an outlaw,
and I can see where they would--

00:19:30.125 --> 00:19:31.445 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why not just
keep the gig going?

00:19:31.445 --> 00:19:31.970 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Exactly.

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:32.675 align:middle line:90%
Live up to your name.

00:19:32.675 --> 00:19:34.133 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's
talk about the gig.

00:19:34.133 --> 00:19:36.510 align:middle line:84%
It was mostly robbing
stagecoaches, trains,

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:37.310 align:middle line:90%
and banks.

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:38.420 align:middle line:90%
That was their gig.

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:40.825 align:middle line:84%
And then in the movies and
everything else portrays that.

00:19:40.825 --> 00:19:41.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Yeah, yeah.

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:46.340 align:middle line:84%
So they were productive, I
mean, in terms of the take.

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:52.412 align:middle line:84%
They knocked over
some pretty well--

00:19:52.412 --> 00:19:54.120 align:middle line:84%
well moneyed banks
and such, for example.

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:56.203 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get
into that in just a moment,

00:19:56.203 --> 00:19:58.430 align:middle line:84%
but let's talk about the--
let's talk about some

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:00.110 align:middle line:84%
of the crimes that
were committed

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:02.480 align:middle line:84%
in terms of where-- the
locations and what the booty

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.280 align:middle line:90%
was.

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:06.770 align:middle line:84%
Because later in
life, he supposedly

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:09.710 align:middle line:84%
was seen by people that visited
their home and relatives.

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:12.365 align:middle line:84%
Had buckets of gold
and all kinds of stuff.

00:20:12.365 --> 00:20:13.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Yeah.

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.980 align:middle line:84%
Liberty, Missouri was one
of their first robberies.

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:17.082 align:middle line:90%
And that was--

00:20:17.082 --> 00:20:18.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That one.

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:21.815 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: I think it was over
$60,000 they got from that.

00:20:21.815 --> 00:20:25.040 align:middle line:84%
That also is where
a tragedy happened.

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.170 align:middle line:84%
Joseph Wymore, I
believe was his name.

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:28.610 align:middle line:90%
I may have that wrong--

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:30.650 align:middle line:84%
there are so many names
involved in the story.

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:33.232 align:middle line:84%
But it was a young
man, was in the street

00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:34.940 align:middle line:84%
while they were riding
away from the bank

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:36.690 align:middle line:90%
and they'd yelled at him, move.

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:37.490 align:middle line:90%
He didn't move.

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:40.550 align:middle line:90%
So Cole Younger just shot him.

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:42.430 align:middle line:90%
Got him out of-- made him--

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:44.430 align:middle line:90%
ended it, and they got away.

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:46.013 align:middle line:84%
So it was a bank
robbery and a murder.

00:20:46.013 --> 00:20:46.972 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And a murder.

00:20:46.972 --> 00:20:48.545 align:middle line:84%
Now, in that bank
robbery-- this is

00:20:48.545 --> 00:20:50.420 align:middle line:84%
where we get into another
part of the legend.

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:53.150 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
the romanticized,

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:55.760 align:middle line:84%
you know, billionaire on
horseback part of our psyche

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:58.040 align:middle line:90%
that likes to romanticize this--

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:01.785 align:middle line:84%
he was given the PR
title of a Robin Hood.

00:21:01.785 --> 00:21:02.585 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Yeah.

00:21:02.585 --> 00:21:04.418 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about how that happened

00:21:04.418 --> 00:21:06.065 align:middle line:90%
and who created that story.

00:21:06.065 --> 00:21:09.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: Yeah, well there
was a news reporter

00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:11.480 align:middle line:84%
named John Newman
Edwards, who was

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.160 align:middle line:90%
a former Confederate himself.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And he was bitter, and
I think that he was also

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:19.940 align:middle line:84%
known to be a heavy drinker,
and he embellished a lot.

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And on top of that, I guess the
alcohol would just add to the--

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:24.440 align:middle line:90%
fuel to the fire.

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:27.140 align:middle line:84%
But he sided with
Jesse and the gang,

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:29.110 align:middle line:84%
and he looked at
them as knights.

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:31.330 align:middle line:84%
You know, avenging
angels or knights.

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And that-- and the
knight part actually

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.430 align:middle line:84%
goes back to the
billionaire on horseback.

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:42.400 align:middle line:84%
It reminds me, everybody
seems to love the tragic hero.

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.065 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it was the
knight-- like King Arthur's

00:21:45.065 --> 00:21:45.940 align:middle line:90%
knights, for example.

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:49.120 align:middle line:84%
Lancelot, he was a great
man, he was a great knight.

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:52.150 align:middle line:84%
Skilled, honorable,
but he had his flaws.

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's the tragedy
of the whole thing.

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like
human nature just--

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.117 align:middle line:90%
just magnified.

00:22:01.117 --> 00:22:01.917 align:middle line:90%
And people--

00:22:01.917 --> 00:22:03.375 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And maybe
it's us-- maybe

00:22:03.375 --> 00:22:06.340 align:middle line:84%
it's us either avoiding,
or trying to contend with,

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:09.277 align:middle line:84%
or trying to make excuses for,
even, our own shadow side.

00:22:09.277 --> 00:22:10.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: That's true.

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:11.902 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The things
that we'll put up with

00:22:11.902 --> 00:22:13.210 align:middle line:90%
and that we'll perpetuate.

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:14.500 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: That's exactly right.

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:18.010 align:middle line:84%
What-- they're doing what
most people wished they could

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:19.480 align:middle line:90%
or would do, but couldn't.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.280 align:middle line:90%
Just wouldn't do.

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:23.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I mean
just the sheer guts

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:26.410 align:middle line:84%
and stealthfulness it
took for these guys

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:28.930 align:middle line:84%
to get away with
this for that long.

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:33.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't know who isn't
intrigued with this bank heist.

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.760 align:middle line:84%
These shows do great on
Netflix and all that.

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Everyone loves a good bank
heist where the guys get away

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:43.250 align:middle line:84%
with it, because you've bonded
with their personalities

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:44.050 align:middle line:90%
and such.

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:46.210 align:middle line:84%
So this story is no
different, but the fact

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:48.580 align:middle line:84%
is, he was created
as a Robin Hood.

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:50.555 align:middle line:84%
So this fellow made
him into a Robin Hood.

00:22:50.555 --> 00:22:51.355 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: He did.

00:22:51.355 --> 00:22:53.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I mean,
that wasn't exactly true.

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:56.080 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one thing that
Jesse really enjoyed

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.070 align:middle line:90%
was the publicity.

00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:57.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: He did.

00:22:57.870 --> 00:22:59.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about that, because he'd

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:01.480 align:middle line:90%
leave behind his calling card.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:02.355 align:middle line:90%
Jesse's been here.

00:23:02.355 --> 00:23:04.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: That's true,
he had calling cards.

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And when I found out
about that, my mother

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:08.500 align:middle line:90%
used to die laughing about that.

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:11.260 align:middle line:84%
They would rob a
train, and women would

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.300 align:middle line:90%
ask for their autograph after.

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:14.860 align:middle line:84%
They just-- they
didn't rob women

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:17.900 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't rob men
who had calloused hands.

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:20.290 align:middle line:84%
So if you were a working
man, they'd leave you alone,

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:22.140 align:middle line:90%
and they left the ladies alone.

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:24.203 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So women would
ask for their autographs

00:23:24.203 --> 00:23:25.495 align:middle line:90%
because they'd read about them?

00:23:25.495 --> 00:23:26.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Yeah, and a lot--

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:30.490 align:middle line:84%
by that time, his-- they
were celebrities in a sense.

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And it was almost like, wow,
I got robbed by a celebrity,

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:38.710 align:middle line:84%
and they just-- and they didn't
take the ladies' money, so--

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:40.858 align:middle line:84%
but if the man didn't
have calloused hands,

00:23:40.858 --> 00:23:43.150 align:middle line:84%
they'd take their money,
didn't have a problem with it.

00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:45.602 align:middle line:84%
They looked at them
as bankers, and yeah.

00:23:45.602 --> 00:23:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They weren't
making an honest living.

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:48.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Exactly, exactly.

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:49.630 align:middle line:90%
So they were--

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:50.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like they were
making an honest living.

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:52.472 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Yeah, as if they were.

00:23:52.472 --> 00:23:53.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The irony.

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:55.960 align:middle line:84%
Well let's talk about
that Liberty Bank robbery.

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:58.300 align:middle line:84%
I wrote this down
because basically,

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:00.760 align:middle line:84%
that bank-- so we'll talk
about the reality what happened

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.410 align:middle line:90%
with the Liberty Bank robbery.

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:05.050 align:middle line:84%
So the bank was forced
to call in all loans.

00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:07.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a
tremendous hardship.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.300 align:middle line:84%
They also ended up,
after the bank closed--

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.940 align:middle line:90%
they were forced to close.

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:15.672 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, after they
called in the loans I guess,

00:24:15.672 --> 00:24:17.380 align:middle line:84%
that's where most of
the money came from.

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:20.810 align:middle line:84%
But they were only able to pay
the depositors basically $0.60

00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:21.610 align:middle line:90%
on the dollar.

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:26.805 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of hard working, poor
people lost a lot of money.

00:24:26.805 --> 00:24:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: They lost
a lot of money.

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:29.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This was not
a Robin Hood thing.

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:30.848 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: It hurt the
community as a whole.

00:24:30.848 --> 00:24:32.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It hurt the community.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.575 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, here we have
this other-- the legendary kind

00:24:35.575 --> 00:24:37.075 align:middle line:84%
of information being
peddled, right?

00:24:37.075 --> 00:24:37.875 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:37.875 --> 00:24:40.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so now
here we go into where

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:43.730 align:middle line:84%
the story changes, the
traditional story about what

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:44.530 align:middle line:90%
happened to him.

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:46.300 align:middle line:84%
First of all, how
many big heists

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:48.250 align:middle line:84%
did they pull off,
and then do you

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:50.815 align:middle line:84%
have any idea of just the
sheer volume of heists?

00:24:50.815 --> 00:24:53.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: Off top of my head,
they pulled off a lot of heists,

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:56.550 align:middle line:90%
and it varied sometimes.

00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:59.680 align:middle line:10%
Later in their career, it was
a lot less money in some cases,

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.810 align:middle line:10%
but then other
times, they took--

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:03.490 align:middle line:10%
it was an undisclosed
amount of money.

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:05.710 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't listed
as that, usually.

00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:10.000 align:middle line:84%
But it's hard to tell
exactly how much was taken.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.958 align:middle line:84%
For one example,
and-- well, I don't

00:25:11.958 --> 00:25:13.750 align:middle line:84%
want to get off on a
rabbit hole with that.

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:18.340 align:middle line:84%
But the Ocobock Brothers
Bank in Corydon, Iowa--

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:21.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember how much
they took, but that dealt--

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:25.330 align:middle line:84%
it seemed in the background
with a lot more--

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:28.480 align:middle line:84%
there was-- it went a lot
deeper than just a bank robbery.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.340 align:middle line:84%
There was a man
named Henry Clay Dean

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:31.930 align:middle line:90%
who was a Southern supporter.

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:34.690 align:middle line:84%
They called him a copperhead,
and you can read about--

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:39.100 align:middle line:84%
Mark Twain just, he
described him as a filthy man

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:41.800 align:middle line:90%
with a voice like a volcano.

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.930 align:middle line:84%
His oratory skills
were legendary,

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:46.240 align:middle line:84%
and he would draw people
from 50 miles around.

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.725 align:middle line:84%
Well, when they robbed
the bank, Henry Clay Dean

00:25:48.725 --> 00:25:49.600 align:middle line:90%
happened to be there.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.840 align:middle line:84%
He'd drawn everybody to
a different side of town

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:54.610 align:middle line:84%
from the bank, the
opposite end of town.

00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:56.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So he-- they
were in collusion.

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:56.820 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Yeah.

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:58.510 align:middle line:84%
They're all over
here, the brother--

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:00.850 align:middle line:84%
the James Gang rides
in, just waltzes in,

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:04.000 align:middle line:84%
takes the money, no trouble,
nobody to chase them.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.500 align:middle line:84%
Jesse even rode by with
the gang and said, hey,

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:07.450 align:middle line:90%
the bank got robbed.

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:11.485 align:middle line:84%
And people shushed them because
they wanted to hear the speech.

00:26:11.485 --> 00:26:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't realize it was
actually true until after Jesse

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:15.660 align:middle line:90%
and them were long gone.

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:16.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We told you.

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:16.980 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Yeah.

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:18.930 align:middle line:90%
He walked by, talk about bold.

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:20.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, that's bold.

00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:21.295 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of what
he did was bold.

00:26:21.295 --> 00:26:23.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: That to me, it ties back
in with what you had mentioned

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:25.820 align:middle line:90%
about his need for celebrity.

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:27.730 align:middle line:84%
He loved it, and
they enjoyed it.

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:31.187 align:middle line:84%
So it was-- it was almost
taunting with people.

00:26:31.187 --> 00:26:32.020 align:middle line:90%
Catch me if you can.

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:33.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, how many people
were in the gang, by the way?

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:35.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: It varies.

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:36.330 align:middle line:90%
There were at times--

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:39.390 align:middle line:84%
and their gang
would also split up.

00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:41.520 align:middle line:84%
Like his cousin
Wood Hite, who we

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:45.720 align:middle line:84%
believe is the man in the
grave portrayed as Jesse--

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.795 align:middle line:90%
he would lead robberies.

00:26:47.795 --> 00:26:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And there were a
lot of stories--

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:52.380 align:middle line:84%
people would wonder how Jesse
could rob a bank in one state

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:53.577 align:middle line:90%
on the same day--

00:26:53.577 --> 00:26:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As their gang
robs somewhere else.

00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:56.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: Or in two different
states on the same day, yeah.

00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:58.368 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of time,
they would split up.

00:26:58.368 --> 00:26:59.910 align:middle line:84%
It was the same old
guerrilla tactics

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:01.410 align:middle line:90%
they learned in the war.

00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:04.170 align:middle line:84%
You hit multiple
targets, split up, and--

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:07.560 align:middle line:84%
and it confuses
those chasing you.

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:12.300 align:middle line:84%
So now we get to the
Minnesota bank robbery

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:15.690 align:middle line:84%
where the story starts becoming
interesting, even more so,

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:17.100 align:middle line:90%
because we're getting into--

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.650 align:middle line:84%
there are different claims
about when his identity changed.

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:21.390 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
fake identity now.

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:23.520 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: OK.

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:27.120 align:middle line:90%
In 1871, he came to Texas.

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.090 align:middle line:84%
It was shortly-- it was right
after the Ocobock Brothers Bank

00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:33.250 align:middle line:84%
robbery, and that was
up in Corydon, Iowa.

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:35.910 align:middle line:84%
He went toward--
he rode West to--

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:38.040 align:middle line:84%
and the gang usually
would split up

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:40.500 align:middle line:84%
after a robbery,
which also helped

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.350 align:middle line:90%
confuse people, their pursuers.

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:46.380 align:middle line:84%
But he, we know,
went to Nebraska

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:48.540 align:middle line:84%
and then he rode South
straight to Texas.

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:49.530 align:middle line:90%
It took a while.

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:53.040 align:middle line:84%
He got into Texas, met
Thomas Hudson Barron,

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:56.370 align:middle line:84%
his future father-in-law
in-- outside of Fort Worth,

00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:59.190 align:middle line:84%
and then they both-- they
split up at different places,

00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:00.600 align:middle line:90%
and they'd come back together.

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And they met at the Barron
ranch near-- south of Waco.

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:06.330 align:middle line:90%
And that's when he--

00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:08.760 align:middle line:84%
his name-- before
he got there, he

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:12.000 align:middle line:84%
had taken the name of one of
his cousins, James Lafayette

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.385 align:middle line:84%
Courtney, and that cousin
was very hard to find.

00:28:16.385 --> 00:28:18.690 align:middle line:10%
You can find reference
of him here and there,

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:21.750 align:middle line:10%
but he just kind of disappears
off the pages of history.

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:24.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So by the
time they go back up,

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.800 align:middle line:84%
and they're robbing
this bank in Minnesota--

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:30.000 align:middle line:90%
I have it here as 1876.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.710 align:middle line:84%
After that, they
went to Tennessee.

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:34.062 align:middle line:84%
Was he going by the name of
Courtney then, at that time?

00:28:34.062 --> 00:28:35.020 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: He was, he was.

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:35.420 align:middle line:90%
And I don't--

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:37.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So was he not leaving
his calling card of Jesse James

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:38.130 align:middle line:90%
anymore?

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: No.

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And when they robbed
Minnesota, he wasn't there.

00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:43.590 align:middle line:90%
We don't believe he was there.

00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:45.420 align:middle line:84%
The history states he
was there, and that's

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:47.040 align:middle line:90%
the end of the James Gang.

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.200 align:middle line:90%
And it was, in a big part--

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:49.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's
talk about that too.

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:50.500 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: OK.

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:53.130 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we believe Wood
Hite, his first cousin who

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:54.900 align:middle line:84%
bore a strong
resemblance to him,

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:57.660 align:middle line:84%
was leading the
robbery in Minnesota,

00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:00.960 align:middle line:84%
and that's where the younger
brothers met their end.

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.030 align:middle line:84%
That was the end
of their career.

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And Wood Hite got away,
but it wasn't Jesse.

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:08.190 align:middle line:90%
It was Wood and Frank.

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:11.370 align:middle line:90%
And they got away.

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:14.272 align:middle line:84%
And that's in
Northfield, Minnesota.

00:29:14.272 --> 00:29:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And right after the
robbery, where does Frank--

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:18.000 align:middle line:90%
where does Frank, whose knees--

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.520 align:middle line:84%
his knees had-- I think
he had a bullet lodged

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:21.930 align:middle line:90%
in one of his knees.

00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:23.910 align:middle line:90%
He'd been shot up.

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:25.620 align:middle line:90%
Where does he go after that?

00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:28.875 align:middle line:84%
Instead of a doctor
in that region,

00:29:28.875 --> 00:29:32.940 align:middle line:84%
he rode all the way to
Texas and was met in Texas.

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:36.780 align:middle line:84%
And there's even old news
articles about Frank,

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:40.800 align:middle line:84%
right after the robbery, was
found in Texas at a doctor

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.570 align:middle line:90%
in Waco who removed the bullet.

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor would
never come forward.

00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:45.900 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to find the doctor.

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:50.640 align:middle line:84%
He never would come
forward, understandably so.

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is just
something filtering in my head.

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:54.973 align:middle line:84%
Does this have anything
to do with what was called

00:29:54.973 --> 00:29:56.280 align:middle line:90%
the Northfield Minnesota raid?

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Yeah.

00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:59.280 align:middle line:90%
That was right after that.

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.500 align:middle line:84%
Right during that--
well after the raid,

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:04.360 align:middle line:90%
that's when Frank rode to Waco.

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:05.160 align:middle line:90%
Not while--

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that raid was
one that supposedly involved

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:07.740 align:middle line:90%
Jesse James?

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:08.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Yeah.

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:10.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, so that's that.

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Yeah.

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:13.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now this was
serious, because now they're

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.090 align:middle line:90%
being hunted.

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:16.320 align:middle line:90%
Seriously hunted after this.

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:17.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: They were.

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.423 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They'd been
pushing it for years.

00:30:19.423 --> 00:30:21.465 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's talk about
what happened after that.

00:30:21.465 --> 00:30:23.548 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: Well, and the
backstory on the Northfield,

00:30:23.548 --> 00:30:25.410 align:middle line:84%
Minnesota robbery,
one of the generals,

00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:27.630 align:middle line:84%
one of the most hated
northern generals--

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:31.200 align:middle line:84%
Silver Spoons Butler I think
is what they called him.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.255 align:middle line:90%
He had gone through Louisiana.

00:30:33.255 --> 00:30:35.370 align:middle line:84%
He had even, according
to some reports,

00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:39.300 align:middle line:90%
burned a barn with slaves in it.

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:40.350 align:middle line:90%
I mean, things like that.

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:42.640 align:middle line:84%
He just went through
Louisiana, rape, raid.

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:43.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Cruel.

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Just a--

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:44.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Cruel.

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:45.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: --campaign of terror.

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And there was bad
done on both sides.

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:52.330 align:middle line:84%
But Butler knew the
owners of the bank,

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:55.530 align:middle line:84%
and I think he may have been
on the board of the Northfield

00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:56.820 align:middle line:90%
Minnesota Bank.

00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And he was tied in with a
more powerful family who

00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:01.380 align:middle line:90%
had ties to the Rockefellers.

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:03.980 align:middle line:84%
It was real
interesting trying to--

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:07.680 align:middle line:84%
researching the back, the people
who dealt-- who owned the bank.

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And I wondered how much
that had to do with them.

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.620 align:middle line:84%
Why would they choose
a target so far out

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:14.540 align:middle line:90%
of their normal range?

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:15.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, why?

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:15.810 align:middle line:90%
That's what I was wondering.

00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: And I had a feeling
it had to do-- something

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:18.510 align:middle line:90%
to do with Butler.

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:18.937 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:31:18.937 --> 00:31:21.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: And maybe a deeper
interest, I'm not sure.

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:22.458 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Was that a big take?

00:31:22.458 --> 00:31:23.750 align:middle line:90%
A lot of booty out of that one?

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: It should
have been, but it

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:26.175 align:middle line:84%
wasn't, because they
were ready for him.

00:31:26.175 --> 00:31:27.315 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They were
ready for him, yeah.

00:31:27.315 --> 00:31:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: Somehow
they'd got tipped off.

00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:30.172 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:30.172 --> 00:31:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about the
official story of what

00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:33.660 align:middle line:90%
happened to Jesse James.

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:35.970 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
family's story about what

00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:38.640 align:middle line:84%
happened to him, and get
further into Wood Hite.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: OK.

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:42.090 align:middle line:90%
Well the official story--

00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:44.715 align:middle line:84%
just the historical
story is Jesse James--

00:31:44.715 --> 00:31:48.090 align:middle line:84%
most of it, where he was born
and during the Civil War,

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:50.310 align:middle line:90%
is the same as our story.

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:53.640 align:middle line:90%
After the Civil War, he joined--

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:56.130 align:middle line:84%
they formed a gang,
their first robbery

00:31:56.130 --> 00:31:58.590 align:middle line:84%
was Liberty, Missouri
in the career.

00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:02.100 align:middle line:84%
Where it differs
is in 1882, history

00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:05.280 align:middle line:84%
states that Bob
and Charlie Ford,

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:07.820 align:middle line:84%
who were part of
the new James Gang

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:11.645 align:middle line:84%
after the disaster at
Northfield Minnesota--

00:32:11.645 --> 00:32:15.950 align:middle line:84%
they got together and shot
Jesse in the back of the head

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:16.910 align:middle line:90%
at his home--

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:20.107 align:middle line:84%
his alleged home in
St. Joseph, Missouri.

00:32:20.107 --> 00:32:21.690 align:middle line:84%
They shot him in the
back of the head,

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:23.273 align:middle line:84%
they thought they'd
be heroes and they

00:32:23.273 --> 00:32:25.520 align:middle line:90%
were going to get a big reward.

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:30.292 align:middle line:84%
And that-- they ended up being
demonized and just cowards.

00:32:30.292 --> 00:32:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Then there were songs
written about them.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.640 align:middle line:84%
"The Dirty Little Coward
Who Shot Mr. Howard."

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And Howard was allegedly
Jesse's alias at the time

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:40.415 align:middle line:84%
while he was living in
St. Joseph, Missouri.

00:32:40.415 --> 00:32:42.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:44.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: So that--
that's basically

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:46.700 align:middle line:84%
the end of the historical
story of Jesse.

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:49.695 align:middle line:84%
Now the family's story was
that he changed his name,

00:32:49.695 --> 00:32:50.495 align:middle line:90%
came to Texas.

00:32:50.495 --> 00:32:54.065 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now he's Howard,
not Courtney anymore.

00:32:54.065 --> 00:32:56.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: Well, during--
that Howard name

00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:01.070 align:middle line:84%
was actually his cousin,
Wood Hite, his alias.

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And Wood Hite was killed, and
his body passed off as Jesse.

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:09.920 align:middle line:84%
That was what our research
ended up uncovering,

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:14.120 align:middle line:84%
but the family story was
that Jesse changed his name

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:17.330 align:middle line:84%
to James Lafayette Courtney,
which was one of his cousins,

00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:21.620 align:middle line:84%
and he lived out his life in
Texas as a peaceable farmer.

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:23.420 align:middle line:84%
But he still went
on robbing sprees.

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:25.580 align:middle line:84%
Only when he would come
back, he would always

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:29.090 align:middle line:84%
come back a different route
from that which he left.

00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And he was just another--
he's a peaceable farmer.

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:33.445 align:middle line:90%
But people in his area--

00:33:33.445 --> 00:33:33.905 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Part time robber.

00:33:33.905 --> 00:33:34.705 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Yeah.

00:33:34.705 --> 00:33:36.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, and the
interesting thing--

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:38.810 align:middle line:84%
there are so many
side stories on this.

00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:41.390 align:middle line:84%
Like, after the Civil War, a
lot of Quantrill's Guerrillas,

00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:43.080 align:middle line:90%
they weren't granted amnesty.

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:44.690 align:middle line:84%
Many of them had
changed their names

00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:47.660 align:middle line:84%
and they all lived-- not
all of them, but many

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:49.667 align:middle line:84%
of them lived in the
Blevins, Texas area.

00:33:49.667 --> 00:33:50.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:51.712 align:middle line:84%
Because that's where
the family ended up.

00:33:51.712 --> 00:33:53.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: Yeah, and some
of those guys themselves

00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:55.400 align:middle line:84%
would go on robbing
trips with Jesse.

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:57.255 align:middle line:84%
Not every time,
but occasionally,

00:33:57.255 --> 00:33:58.380 align:middle line:90%
if they needed extra money.

00:33:58.380 --> 00:33:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If they
need some cash.

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:03.410 align:middle line:84%
OK, so where-- so Jessie was
there in Blevins supposedly

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:04.715 align:middle line:90%
when--

00:34:04.715 --> 00:34:07.027 align:middle line:84%
when the others were
killed up North.

00:34:07.027 --> 00:34:08.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Yeah, he was in Blevins.

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10.790 align:middle line:84%
In his diary-- according
to his journal,

00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:13.560 align:middle line:84%
he was in Blevins
during that robbery.

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:15.780 align:middle line:84%
I thought-- which really
threw us off at first,

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:16.580 align:middle line:90%
and we started--

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:20.510 align:middle line:84%
that was before we'd realized
Wood Hite was actually

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:22.489 align:middle line:84%
the one at the
robbery and not Jesse.

00:34:22.489 --> 00:34:24.739 align:middle line:84%
And they bore a
strong resemblance,

00:34:24.739 --> 00:34:26.150 align:middle line:90%
they just weren't--

00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:27.920 align:middle line:90%
it was Wood Hite and not Jesse.

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And Wood was Jesse's
first cousin.

00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:35.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so the
official story is he's dead,

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:37.553 align:middle line:84%
but he's not, and you
have some pictures of--

00:34:37.553 --> 00:34:38.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Oh yeah, we've got--

00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:39.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --the coffin.

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:40.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: And that was the thing.

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:42.590 align:middle line:84%
When mom stumbled
across this, we

00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:44.510 align:middle line:90%
were looking at family photos.

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't just say, oh this
is Jesse, I'll write a book.

00:34:48.990 --> 00:34:53.840 align:middle line:84%
We went to-- she went to three
highly qualified experts one

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:55.429 align:middle line:90%
was the Texas Parks--

00:34:55.429 --> 00:34:57.139 align:middle line:84%
Texas Department
of Public Safety,

00:34:57.139 --> 00:34:59.210 align:middle line:90%
who are like the state police.

00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:01.670 align:middle line:84%
The other was the
Austin Police Department

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:04.430 align:middle line:84%
photographic forensics
lab, and the third

00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:06.590 align:middle line:84%
was called at the
time Visionics.

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:08.450 align:middle line:90%
They were facial leaders--

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:11.090 align:middle line:84%
world leaders in facial
recognition technology.

00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:12.740 align:middle line:90%
And all three groups--

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:15.410 align:middle line:84%
not paid at all, they did
it on their own time--

00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:17.300 align:middle line:84%
agreed those were
the same photos.

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:20.870 align:middle line:84%
The historical photos of
Jesse and our family photos.

00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:24.500 align:middle line:84%
So we went further,
and even Jesse's mom--

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:28.350 align:middle line:84%
the DPS highlighted her dress,
unlike in historical photos

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:29.150 align:middle line:90%
and family photos.

00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:31.317 align:middle line:84%
She was wearing the same
dress, had the same missing

00:35:31.317 --> 00:35:32.802 align:middle line:90%
arm, same facial features--

00:35:32.802 --> 00:35:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You would
choose the photos up here.

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: --everything.

00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:34.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:36.860 align:middle line:84%
So we had that, and
mom thought god,

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:38.360 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
be so happy when

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:41.660 align:middle line:84%
they know Jesse wasn't killed
like everybody thought he was.

00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And that was the last
thing a group in Missouri

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:45.998 align:middle line:90%
wanted to hear.

00:35:45.998 --> 00:35:47.540 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want to
hear that at all.

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:48.790 align:middle line:90%
They thought it was changing--

00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:52.310 align:middle line:84%
I have a feeling, and
this is just my opinion.

00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:55.940 align:middle line:84%
I thought they had $7 million a
year coming into their little--

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:58.910 align:middle line:84%
their museum every
year from tourism,

00:35:58.910 --> 00:36:01.345 align:middle line:84%
and I think that may
have played a role.

00:36:01.345 --> 00:36:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, and it's
like any museum you go to.

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:05.060 align:middle line:84%
They don't want the
history changed.

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:07.580 align:middle line:84%
They're making the money
off of their own history.

00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:09.095 align:middle line:90%
That's understandable, yeah.

00:36:09.095 --> 00:36:11.738 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: But-- and
then after that, she

00:36:11.738 --> 00:36:12.780 align:middle line:90%
didn't let that stop her.

00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:14.330 align:middle line:84%
She wrote her
first book, she had

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:17.900 align:middle line:84%
an article in "Texas Monthly,"
then she wrote a second book.

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And after that
book came out, she

00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:21.500 align:middle line:84%
ended up getting death
threats from people

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:23.690 align:middle line:90%
who were connected to--

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:26.240 align:middle line:84%
or they knew people at
the museum in Missouri.

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to
mention their names,

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:31.655 align:middle line:84%
but the FBI fortunately stepped
in and put an end to that.

00:36:31.655 --> 00:36:32.937 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:32.937 --> 00:36:34.520 align:middle line:84%
Let me-- there's--
oh gosh, I hope I--

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: Which goes
back into the tough--

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:36.616 align:middle line:90%
I didn't mean to--

00:36:36.616 --> 00:36:37.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, no.

00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:37.850 align:middle line:90%
You go ahead.

00:36:37.850 --> 00:36:39.590 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Like strong women, mom--

00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:43.070 align:middle line:84%
and the interesting thing to
me, Zerelda had her left arm--

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:44.690 align:middle line:90%
you know, it was blown off.

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:47.240 align:middle line:90%
Mom's left arm was--

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:49.603 align:middle line:84%
she'd crushed her
elbow and her arm was--

00:36:49.603 --> 00:36:51.770 align:middle line:84%
she always carried-- it was
just interesting, almost

00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:53.033 align:middle line:90%
like history rhyming in a way.

00:36:53.033 --> 00:36:54.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, almost
like-- yeah, I hear ya.

00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: And she was a
very strong character,

00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:57.680 align:middle line:90%
much like Zerelda.

00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Not as strong as the Zerelda,
and definitely not as tall,

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:01.080 align:middle line:90%
but she was a very strong lady.

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:02.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She was
a strong character

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:03.818 align:middle line:90%
and she brought this forward.

00:37:03.818 --> 00:37:05.360 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to say,
right here I thought

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:07.640 align:middle line:84%
I'd put down-- which is
interesting, because it talks

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:10.190 align:middle line:84%
about the need for
publicity, but also

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:12.470 align:middle line:90%
this desire for grandeur.

00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:13.790 align:middle line:90%
This is a quote you have there.

00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:14.990 align:middle line:90%
"We're not thieves.

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:16.400 align:middle line:90%
We're bold robbers.

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm proud of the name.

00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Alexander the Great
was a bold robber,

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:23.450 align:middle line:84%
as was Napoleon
and Julius Caesar.

00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:25.357 align:middle line:84%
And he's proud to
be among them."

00:37:25.357 --> 00:37:26.440 align:middle line:90%
That's how he saw himself.

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.423 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: That's true.

00:37:27.423 --> 00:37:29.465 align:middle line:84%
There's a little narcissism
in there, I wold say.

00:37:29.465 --> 00:37:31.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, a little
bit of narcissism in there.

00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:33.530 align:middle line:90%
So here we have your mom.

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:35.540 align:middle line:90%
So now this is happening.

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:37.637 align:middle line:84%
These guys are buried
away in Blevins.

00:37:37.637 --> 00:37:39.845 align:middle line:84%
According to your family,
Jesse lived to be what age?

00:37:39.845 --> 00:37:41.135 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: 97 years old.

00:37:41.135 --> 00:37:42.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 97.

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:44.200 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: He died in 1943.

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:46.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 1943.

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:49.175 align:middle line:84%
Now, he also is said to
have had eight children.

00:37:49.175 --> 00:37:50.670 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Yeah, seven children.

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:51.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Seven?

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:52.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Well, that we know of.

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:55.100 align:middle line:90%
There's another that may be his.

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:56.145 align:middle line:90%
That's a mystery.

00:37:56.145 --> 00:37:57.020 align:middle line:90%
It's still a mystery.

00:37:57.020 --> 00:38:01.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what he did do
is he amassed a massive amount

00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:02.752 align:middle line:90%
of wealth to buy land.

00:38:02.752 --> 00:38:03.627 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: That's right.

00:38:03.627 --> 00:38:06.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so what
I do understand is,

00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:08.210 align:middle line:84%
he may not have been a
Robin Hood, it appears.

00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:09.765 align:middle line:90%
But he did share with his kids.

00:38:09.765 --> 00:38:10.565 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: He did.

00:38:10.565 --> 00:38:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so when they
reached marriageable age,

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:16.500 align:middle line:84%
they would each inherit their
own land and their own home.

00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:17.375 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: That's right.

00:38:17.375 --> 00:38:19.042 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
how they continued.

00:38:19.042 --> 00:38:22.550 align:middle line:90%
Now where in there is your line?

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:25.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: His daughter
Ida married my grand--

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:27.350 align:middle line:90%
she was my great grandmother.

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:30.920 align:middle line:84%
She married-- well,
she married Dorsett--

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:32.150 align:middle line:90%
a Mr. Dorsett anyway.

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:34.442 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember his name
right off the top of my head,

00:38:34.442 --> 00:38:36.590 align:middle line:84%
and that's going to drive
me crazy all day, sorry.

00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:39.680 align:middle line:84%
But his daughter Ida
married Mr. Dorsett

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:43.270 align:middle line:84%
and they had my grandfather,
who had my mother.

00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:45.365 align:middle line:84%
So it was my
grandfather's grandfather.

00:38:45.365 --> 00:38:46.953 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're
still in Texas.

00:38:46.953 --> 00:38:48.245 align:middle line:90%
So your family stayed in Texas.

00:38:48.245 --> 00:38:49.045 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Yeah.

00:38:49.045 --> 00:38:53.050 align:middle line:84%
About probably 45 to 50
miles from where Jesse lived.

00:38:53.050 --> 00:38:55.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So they say--

00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:56.900 align:middle line:90%
I mentioned this earlier--

00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:02.330 align:middle line:84%
that witnesses in the day said
he had just buckets of gold

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:03.650 align:middle line:90%
while sitting around.

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:04.640 align:middle line:90%
Anyone could see.

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think he had one
of his sons counting

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:09.230 align:middle line:90%
the cash that he also had.

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:11.540 align:middle line:84%
Wanted to count it
on a regular basis,

00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:13.540 align:middle line:84%
probably to reinforce his
own ego at this point,

00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:16.082 align:middle line:84%
because clearly he had enough
money to do whatever he wanted.

00:39:16.082 --> 00:39:17.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: In a way,
and I don't know

00:39:17.570 --> 00:39:19.100 align:middle line:90%
why he had Byron doing that.

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:21.380 align:middle line:84%
One of the sons,
Byron, he-- there

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:23.630 align:middle line:84%
was a steamer
trunk full of cash,

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:26.330 align:middle line:84%
and Byron would have to
count it on a regular basis.

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:28.070 align:middle line:84%
Like you said, that
always amazed me.

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:30.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I
think about it in--

00:39:30.590 --> 00:39:32.330 align:middle line:84%
as he was growing
older, maybe it

00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:34.510 align:middle line:84%
was just to reinforce his
own legacy and his mind.

00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:35.490 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: It could have been.

00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:36.290 align:middle line:90%
It could have been.

00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And maybe, I don't know if
he was trying to teach Byron.

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:40.340 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why-- why Byron?

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:43.550 align:middle line:84%
Why didn't he make the
others do the same thing?

00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:45.050 align:middle line:90%
It was always Byron.

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:47.330 align:middle line:90%
So Byron had to count the cash.

00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:52.490 align:middle line:84%
Byron ended up stealing-- or
there's a lot of family stories

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:54.950 align:middle line:84%
that turn into arguments
with some of the older family

00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:55.750 align:middle line:90%
members.

00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:59.480 align:middle line:84%
But they-- Byron had
wanted some money,

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:01.580 align:middle line:84%
and his dad wouldn't
give it to him,

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:03.470 align:middle line:90%
so he burned his barn down.

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And it was just things like
that, like a spoiled brat.

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And he threw a tantrum
and burned his barn,

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:10.640 align:middle line:90%
which is a little extreme.

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:13.160 align:middle line:84%
But I guess--
apparently extremism

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:15.965 align:middle line:84%
ran in that line of those
several generations.

00:40:15.965 --> 00:40:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is there--
are there some lines

00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:20.360 align:middle line:84%
of the family that
kind of still have

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.835 align:middle line:84%
wealth, that were able to
parlay it and accumulate more?

00:40:22.835 --> 00:40:23.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Yeah, there were.

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:24.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Without robbing banks?

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:26.872 align:middle line:84%
I'm assuming there are no
more bank robbers in the lot.

00:40:26.872 --> 00:40:27.770 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: No, no.

00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:29.480 align:middle line:90%
No more bank robbers.

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:32.480 align:middle line:84%
One branch of the family
had a lot of money,

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:33.500 align:middle line:90%
but they also had--

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Jesse had gone around buying
land, as you'd mentioned.

00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of that land that
he'd bought up in north Texas

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:42.810 align:middle line:84%
not far from Lubbock ended up
having oil under it later on.

00:40:42.810 --> 00:40:44.893 align:middle line:84%
So the kids he bought--
he gave that to--

00:40:44.893 --> 00:40:46.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Became oil barons.

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:46.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Yeah.

00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:46.786 align:middle line:90%
They had--

00:40:46.786 --> 00:40:48.369 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Robber
barons to oil barons.

00:40:48.369 --> 00:40:49.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Yeah.

00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:51.170 align:middle line:84%
But they had sold
a lot of that land,

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:52.730 align:middle line:84%
but they're still
getting royalties.

00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:55.272 align:middle line:84%
And that-- things
get fuzzy on that.

00:40:55.272 --> 00:40:57.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if they
found some of the treasure

00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:58.990 align:middle line:90%
and just didn't report it, or--

00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what I
wanted to ask you about next.

00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:01.370 align:middle line:90%
Did he bury--

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:02.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: He buried a lot.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:02.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --of the treasure?

00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:03.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: He buried a lot.

00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:04.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They saw
the buckets, but there

00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:05.855 align:middle line:90%
was stuff under the ground.

00:41:05.855 --> 00:41:06.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Yeah.

00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:10.200 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there were-- yeah, the
13 buckets with gold and silver

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:11.000 align:middle line:90%
in them.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.850 align:middle line:84%
He'd buried-- those
were above ground,

00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:15.980 align:middle line:84%
I think they were
covered with hog fat.

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Just lard that they
used for cooking.

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:20.510 align:middle line:90%
And that went to his--

00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:23.030 align:middle line:84%
his widow, which
was his third wife.

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:25.790 align:middle line:90%


00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:27.020 align:middle line:90%
He left that in the will.

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:27.820 align:middle line:90%
She got it.

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And half of his children wrote
the state and any politician

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:35.660 align:middle line:84%
they could, trying to get
those lard buckets back.

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, how
silly does that sound?

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:40.820 align:middle line:84%
He gave her 13 buckets of
lard, and we want it back.

00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And it seems a little trite, but
the reason-- it had gold in it.

00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:45.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It had
other stuff, yeah.

00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:48.260 align:middle line:90%
Hard to lift, heavy lard.

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:50.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: Yeah, he had
left a lot of land.

00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And then some of those
same families, that branch

00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:54.740 align:middle line:90%
of the family--

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:57.170 align:middle line:84%
and of course, it
was also the times.

00:41:57.170 --> 00:41:58.670 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want
to admit, they were

00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:03.140 align:middle line:84%
ashamed of having a
known outlaw as their dad

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:04.460 align:middle line:90%
or their grandfather.

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And they just wouldn't--
you didn't talk about that,

00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:09.700 align:middle line:84%
whereas today, it sounds
interesting and cool.

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:11.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Historically,
interesting.

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: They didn't want
anything to do with it,

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:15.133 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't have a problem
taking this money either.

00:42:15.133 --> 00:42:16.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:16.910 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm sure.

00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:19.850 align:middle line:84%
OK, so in the book it talks
about Templar treasures

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:22.340 align:middle line:90%
and uses the word freemasonry.

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:24.170 align:middle line:84%
What is the actual
link, because it seemed

00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:25.295 align:middle line:90%
like it's kind of nebulous.

00:42:25.295 --> 00:42:27.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Yeah, well, Jesse--

00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:30.050 align:middle line:84%
passed down along
with the family photos

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:33.140 align:middle line:84%
there was a treasure map,
and it wasn't your typical--

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:36.440 align:middle line:84%
you think treasure map, and
it's like a dotted line leading

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:40.010 align:middle line:84%
to an X 40 paces from an
oak tree or something.

00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:41.670 align:middle line:84%
This one was
completely different.

00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:44.330 align:middle line:84%
He wrote in code, which
was easy to break.

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:45.630 align:middle line:90%
He would substitute letters--

00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:49.460 align:middle line:84%
numbers for letters
and reverse or forward.

00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:50.510 align:middle line:90%
He would switch it up.

00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:53.917 align:middle line:84%
But it was like so much in gold
buried here, so much in silver,

00:42:53.917 --> 00:42:56.000 align:middle line:84%
and he even buried
greenbacks-- what they called--

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.125 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Greenbacks, yeah.

00:42:57.125 --> 00:42:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: --paper
money at the time.

00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:02.900 align:middle line:84%
But it was a geometric
design, and there

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:06.380 align:middle line:84%
was no topographical
markers even mentioned.

00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:08.250 align:middle line:84%
So we had no clue
as to where it was.

00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:09.740 align:middle line:90%
Nobody had found it.

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And I got to-- so I
started with that.

00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:15.380 align:middle line:84%
I was researching that, and I
knew that he was a Freemason,

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:16.871 align:middle line:90%
and it was--

00:43:16.871 --> 00:43:19.190 align:middle line:90%
it was stumbling into something.

00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:23.630 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea how
far it would lead.

00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Just from thinking it might
be a saddlebag of treasure,

00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:31.820 align:middle line:84%
to amounts of treasure
that Jesse had never--

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:34.372 align:middle line:84%
he'd never even robbed
that much money.

00:43:34.372 --> 00:43:35.330 align:middle line:90%
There was a guy named--

00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:37.310 align:middle line:84%
mom had written her
first book, and a man

00:43:37.310 --> 00:43:39.560 align:middle line:84%
named George came
out of the shadows.

00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:41.051 align:middle line:90%
He was a Freemason.

00:43:41.051 --> 00:43:44.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where was this
Freemasonry located?

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:46.892 align:middle line:84%
I mean, where did
they begin that path?

00:43:46.892 --> 00:43:47.975 align:middle line:90%
Was that in Missouri, or--

00:43:47.975 --> 00:43:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: Jesse-- and see,
that's a good question.

00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:52.730 align:middle line:84%
Jesse was a Freemason
under his alias,

00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:54.920 align:middle line:84%
but we don't know if
he was a Freemason

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:55.340 align:middle line:90%
before that or after that.

00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:56.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's
what I'm saying is,

00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:57.410 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of nebulous,
the whole thing.

00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:58.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Yeah, it's kind of hard.

00:43:58.910 --> 00:44:00.740 align:middle line:84%
I would love to
find a lodge where

00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:02.600 align:middle line:84%
the part of the membership
said Jesse James.

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:03.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Jesse James, yeah.

00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:03.570 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: That would be awesome.

00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:04.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it would.

00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:06.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: But then they might
not want to put that out there.

00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:08.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure, sure.

00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:10.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: And I myself
am a Freemason.

00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:13.010 align:middle line:84%
I joined just after
all the research I did.

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:15.180 align:middle line:90%
But Jesse had joined.

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:17.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if it was under
his alias or his real name.

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.420 align:middle line:84%
Now according to
Freemasonry, you can't--

00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:21.800 align:middle line:90%
you can't go under an alias.

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:23.690 align:middle line:90%
You join under your real name.

00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:25.700 align:middle line:84%
But I'd say that was a
special circumstance.

00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:27.770 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't telling everybody
who he really was,

00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:31.010 align:middle line:84%
and back then it was so
easy to hide your identity.

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:32.960 align:middle line:90%
So back to the Freemasonry part.

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:35.870 align:middle line:84%
He was a Freemason, a lot of
the guerillas around him--

00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:39.080 align:middle line:84%
former guerillas-- were
Freemasons as well.

00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:42.290 align:middle line:84%
They had treasure, and
that gets real murky too.

00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:45.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure where they
got all the gold they had.

00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:47.570 align:middle line:90%
This man named George--

00:44:47.570 --> 00:44:52.350 align:middle line:84%
when Jesse was old, like in his
late 80s, George was around 12,

00:44:52.350 --> 00:44:53.600 align:middle line:90%
13 years old.

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:57.980 align:middle line:84%
George was hired by Jesse
to move 700 bars of gold,

00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:00.140 align:middle line:90%
each about 15 pounds each.

00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:04.460 align:middle line:84%
So it was big, heavy ingots
of gold, and it was 700 bars.

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:05.810 align:middle line:90%
If you look at the history--

00:45:05.810 --> 00:45:07.620 align:middle line:84%
the known history of
all the robberies,

00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:09.170 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't amount to that much.

00:45:09.170 --> 00:45:10.375 align:middle line:90%
That's a-- a fortune.

00:45:10.375 --> 00:45:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So he-- they tapped
into some other treasure.

00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:15.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: Yeah, it came
from somewhere else,

00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:16.100 align:middle line:90%
which is what got me on it.

00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:17.142 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Somewhere else.

00:45:17.142 --> 00:45:18.080 align:middle line:90%
So that and that map--

00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:20.780 align:middle line:84%
that odd kind of
geometric map is

00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:22.585 align:middle line:90%
what took you down that road.

00:45:22.585 --> 00:45:23.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: So we had that map.

00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:26.090 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know where it
was, but it was rumored

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:27.410 align:middle line:90%
it was at Jesse's house.

00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:28.940 align:middle line:90%
Somewhere on his property.

00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:31.940 align:middle line:84%
Then George told us-- he drew
my mother and I a map where--

00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:34.760 align:middle line:84%
and he was a Freemason,
a Scottish Rite Freemason

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:36.320 align:middle line:90%
and a World War II vet.

00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And he-- it sounds
like a typical treasure

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:40.880 align:middle line:84%
story-- drew us the map, and
a few years later, he died.

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:44.390 align:middle line:84%
But he told us exactly where it
was, and when we went to find--

00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:45.920 align:middle line:90%
to locate it, we were so happy.

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:47.920 align:middle line:84%
We though, oh, we're going
to get some treasure.

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:49.760 align:middle line:84%
It was on Fort
Hood Military Base.

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:53.030 align:middle line:84%
It's an army base down
there between Waco--

00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:54.117 align:middle line:90%
near Temple, Texas.

00:45:54.117 --> 00:45:56.700 align:middle line:84%
So we thought, yeah, we're not
going on a base and doing that.

00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:58.475 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, that's
not going to happen.

00:45:58.475 --> 00:46:00.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: But that gave
us another location.

00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And around the same
time, a former attorney

00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:06.776 align:middle line:84%
general for the state of
Texas, Waggoner Carr--

00:46:06.776 --> 00:46:10.190 align:middle line:84%
he was friends with LBJ, and
there's a lot of other things

00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:11.510 align:middle line:90%
he'd been involved with.

00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:14.000 align:middle line:90%
But he was interested in Jesse.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.230 align:middle line:90%
He had his driver--

00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:17.450 align:middle line:84%
after a couple of years
of talking to mom,

00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:23.510 align:middle line:84%
he had his driver take my mother
and I to several locations

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:26.480 align:middle line:84%
where large caches of
treasure had been recovered.

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:30.050 align:middle line:84%
One of them he told us was
recovered by the Texas rangers,

00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:33.500 align:middle line:84%
or the Texas rangers
oversaw the recovery.

00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And when we asked what they
did with it, he wouldn't say.

00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:38.480 align:middle line:84%
He didn't-- it
just stopped there.

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:40.910 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, OK,
we know not to--

00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:43.130 align:middle line:84%
he was an important man,
I didn't want to push it

00:46:43.130 --> 00:46:44.150 align:middle line:90%
and neither did mom.

00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:46.340 align:middle line:84%
But he showed us
the locations, which

00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:48.990 align:middle line:90%
gave me several more points.

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And when you lay
the-- there was--

00:46:51.530 --> 00:46:54.228 align:middle line:84%
this is where it goes into
another part of the story.

00:46:54.228 --> 00:46:56.645 align:middle line:84%
There was a group called the
Knights of the Golden Circle.

00:46:56.645 --> 00:46:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, no, those guys
were a little nebulous, too.

00:46:59.430 --> 00:47:00.230 align:middle line:90%
I looked at that.

00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:01.147 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: They were odd.

00:47:01.147 --> 00:47:04.053 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They were looking to
promote slavery 1,200 miles.

00:47:04.053 --> 00:47:04.970 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Massive scale.

00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Into the
West Indies, Mexico.

00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:09.478 align:middle line:84%
They were down--
they were definitely

00:47:09.478 --> 00:47:10.520 align:middle line:90%
doubling down on slavery.

00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:13.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: They wanted to take
northern South America, all

00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:17.770 align:middle line:84%
of Central America,
the South in the US,

00:47:17.770 --> 00:47:19.460 align:middle line:84%
and make Havana,
Cuba their capital.

00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:20.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:47:20.330 --> 00:47:23.065 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about how Jesse's
life intersects with that.

00:47:23.065 --> 00:47:24.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: Well now,
a lot of people

00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:27.530 align:middle line:84%
claim Jesse was a part of the
Knights of the Golden Circle

00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:29.780 align:middle line:84%
along with Albert Pike
and several other people.

00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:31.190 align:middle line:90%
And then Albert Pike--

00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:34.370 align:middle line:84%
most people-- he was a
33rd degree Freemason.

00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:36.320 align:middle line:90%
And I don't think--

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:38.180 align:middle line:84%
there's no proof
that he was part

00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:39.680 align:middle line:84%
of the Knights of
the Golden Circle.

00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:41.330 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't shock
me if either of them

00:47:41.330 --> 00:47:45.260 align:middle line:84%
were, because the Knights of the
Golden Circle during the Civil

00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:49.310 align:middle line:84%
War were kind of like
Secret Service in a way.

00:47:49.310 --> 00:47:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And they did a lot
of covert operations

00:47:52.310 --> 00:47:54.050 align:middle line:90%
to slow down northern forces.

00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:56.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, after the Civil War,
their goals supposedly

00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:58.490 align:middle line:84%
changed to amassing
as much wealth

00:47:58.490 --> 00:48:00.320 align:middle line:84%
as they could, any
way they could,

00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:04.160 align:middle line:84%
to re-fund a second Civil
War and gain their dream

00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:06.890 align:middle line:90%
of having a slave empire.

00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And we'd all agree
that's not good.

00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:11.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if Jesse
was a part of that.

00:48:11.250 --> 00:48:12.710 align:middle line:90%
There's no proof that he was.

00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of groups like
to lump people in just

00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:18.170 align:middle line:84%
to give themselves some
kind of credibility.

00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:19.435 align:middle line:90%
It could be either way.

00:48:19.435 --> 00:48:21.757 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we get
to this point now.

00:48:21.757 --> 00:48:23.090 align:middle line:90%
First of all, I have a question.

00:48:23.090 --> 00:48:24.650 align:middle line:84%
Have you been approached
for movie rights

00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:26.045 align:middle line:90%
to redo the Jesse James story?

00:48:26.045 --> 00:48:27.215 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: No, not yet.

00:48:27.215 --> 00:48:29.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm just
thinking, that seems

00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:30.420 align:middle line:84%
to me like that's going to come
down the road at some point.

00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:31.462 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: And I feel like--

00:48:31.462 --> 00:48:32.300 align:middle line:90%
I hope I'm not--

00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:34.492 align:middle line:84%
I hope I'm keeping this
in line with your answers,

00:48:34.492 --> 00:48:36.200 align:middle line:84%
because it is a
confusing story at times.

00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:36.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I know.

00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:38.877 align:middle line:84%
And because you're going
on what evidence you found.

00:48:38.877 --> 00:48:40.640 align:middle line:90%
Other people have their stories.

00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:41.935 align:middle line:90%
Everyone had a story.

00:48:41.935 --> 00:48:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And you're trying to
piece it together.

00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:45.180 align:middle line:90%
So this is interesting.

00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:48.410 align:middle line:84%
I find it interesting, but
I find it really interesting

00:48:48.410 --> 00:48:51.140 align:middle line:84%
what's in us that loves
this kind of stuff.

00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:53.063 align:middle line:84%
That's to me the most
interesting part of it.

00:48:53.063 --> 00:48:54.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: Well, the Knights
of the Golden Circle

00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:56.330 align:middle line:90%
had a treasure template.

00:48:56.330 --> 00:48:58.160 align:middle line:84%
Some treasure, and I
thought OK, I don't

00:48:58.160 --> 00:48:59.510 align:middle line:90%
know how true this is or not.

00:48:59.510 --> 00:49:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And this came down
later, it came--

00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:03.620 align:middle line:90%
I finally stumbled on that.

00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:05.720 align:middle line:84%
I overlaid that
over all the spots

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:09.110 align:middle line:84%
that George and Waggoner
Carr and several others

00:49:09.110 --> 00:49:12.200 align:middle line:84%
had mentioned, and Jesse's
house in the center.

00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:15.650 align:middle line:84%
Everything lined up perfectly,
you just needed the scale.

00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:17.210 align:middle line:90%
And that gave me the scale.

00:49:17.210 --> 00:49:21.020 align:middle line:84%
It turns into a grid system
that covers the Americas.

00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:23.240 align:middle line:84%
It's not on every
part of the Americas,

00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:26.130 align:middle line:84%
but if there's a treasure
associated with them,

00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:27.455 align:middle line:90%
it's on that template.

00:49:27.455 --> 00:49:28.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:30.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, the treasure
was never found.

00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:31.825 align:middle line:84%
The rest of the stuff
was never found, right?

00:49:31.825 --> 00:49:32.305 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: That's right.

00:49:32.305 --> 00:49:33.222 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To this day.

00:49:33.222 --> 00:49:36.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: Well, there's been a
lot found, but that's usually--

00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:37.900 align:middle line:90%
people keep that under wraps.

00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:40.330 align:middle line:84%
If somebody found it, most of
them wouldn't say anything.

00:49:40.330 --> 00:49:42.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But some of it-- a
lot of it's on private property.

00:49:42.090 --> 00:49:44.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: That's true, and
there's a lot out there still,

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:45.820 align:middle line:90%
I believe.

00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:47.470 align:middle line:84%
But the ones that
have been found,

00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:49.150 align:middle line:84%
people keep quiet, just because
the government will take it.

00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:49.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, yeah.

00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:51.250 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to
report it to the IRS.

00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:52.330 align:middle line:90%
Well, very good.

00:49:52.330 --> 00:49:54.830 align:middle line:84%
Any final thoughts on this--
this is just a fascinating

00:49:54.830 --> 00:49:55.630 align:middle line:90%
story--

00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:56.890 align:middle line:90%
before we sign off here?

00:49:56.890 --> 00:49:58.703 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Oh, god, final thoughts.

00:49:58.703 --> 00:49:59.620 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing story.

00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:01.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your final
thoughts about Jesse,

00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:04.810 align:middle line:84%
and your own feeling about this
man and your family lineage.

00:50:04.810 --> 00:50:07.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DUKE: Well, first of all,
you mentioned strong women.

00:50:07.690 --> 00:50:10.948 align:middle line:84%
Without the women in his life,
and in my life, none of this

00:50:10.948 --> 00:50:11.990 align:middle line:90%
would have ever happened.

00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:15.400 align:middle line:10%
My mom's the one that
opened this story wide open.

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:17.980 align:middle line:10%
She's the one who
proved a lot of this.

00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:20.620 align:middle line:10%
I found a lot on the
Jesse side of it,

00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:23.110 align:middle line:10%
but mom did most of
the work on that.

00:50:23.110 --> 00:50:25.070 align:middle line:84%
My sister and I
helped her research,

00:50:25.070 --> 00:50:26.210 align:middle line:90%
she was credible for that.

00:50:26.210 --> 00:50:28.750 align:middle line:90%
And as for Jesse, his--

00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:33.340 align:middle line:84%
women fell into-- she molded
his life in a large way.

00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:35.800 align:middle line:84%
His father left when
he was a young child,

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:38.335 align:middle line:90%
so he was molded by his mother.

00:50:38.335 --> 00:50:41.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And his mother
said to her dying day,

00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:44.300 align:middle line:84%
she said "I have the
two most devoted sons

00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:45.175 align:middle line:90%
a mother could have."

00:50:45.175 --> 00:50:46.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: She was proud of them.

00:50:46.070 --> 00:50:48.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so she was
very proud of her sons.

00:50:48.070 --> 00:50:50.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: That's true.

00:50:50.410 --> 00:50:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And the other part
of it was just Jesse.

00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:54.220 align:middle line:10%
He's a mystery that--

00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:56.020 align:middle line:10%
the book's not closed on Jesse.

00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:57.940 align:middle line:10%
Much of it has
finally been solved,

00:50:57.940 --> 00:50:59.520 align:middle line:10%
but there's still a lot of--

00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:00.432 align:middle line:10%
a lot to be found.

00:51:00.432 --> 00:51:01.765 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, keep on digging.

00:51:01.765 --> 00:51:03.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: I will.

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:04.635 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you so much.

00:51:04.635 --> 00:51:06.260 align:middle line:84%
I appreciate your
sharing this with us,

00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:07.468 align:middle line:90%
it's been a fascinating ride.

00:51:07.468 --> 00:51:08.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DUKE: Thank you.

00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:09.220 align:middle line:90%
It's my pleasure.

00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:11.050 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: To dial into
the story further,

00:51:11.050 --> 00:51:13.510 align:middle line:10%

books on Jesse James

00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:14.710 align:middle line:10%
