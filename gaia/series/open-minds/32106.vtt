>> Regina Meredith: While most

00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:24.158 align:middle line:84%
of us watch the world's events
unfold on TV or the internet,

00:00:24.158 --> 00:00:26.360 align:middle line:84%
from the comfort of our
homes, there are those

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.828 align:middle line:90%
who live it, on the ground.

00:00:27.828 --> 00:00:30.998 align:middle line:84%
Chris Sadde grew-up in Beirut,
touched by extreme poverty

00:00:30.998 --> 00:00:33.067 align:middle line:90%
and war as a daily reality.

00:00:33.067 --> 00:00:35.770 align:middle line:84%
The heartbreak of it all
inspired a deep compassion

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.272 align:middle line:84%
for his fellow human,
which catapulted him

00:00:38.272 --> 00:00:40.007 align:middle line:84%
into a lifelong commitment
to peace.

00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:43.144 align:middle line:84%
His journey began at the age of
six, and he's here with us today

00:00:43.144 --> 00:00:46.647 align:middle line:84%
to tell us that even the deepest
wounds can be healed when love

00:00:46.647 --> 00:00:49.083 align:middle line:90%
and action are used together.

00:00:49.083 --> 00:00:50.784 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:00:52.186 --> 00:00:53.454 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: I know I've
heard so much about your work

00:00:53.454 --> 00:00:54.855 align:middle line:84%
through your work through
your dear friend and one

00:00:54.855 --> 00:00:57.258 align:middle line:84%
of our favorite interviewees,
Andrew Harvey.

00:00:57.258 --> 00:00:59.293 align:middle line:84%
He said you have
to bring Chris in,

00:00:59.293 --> 00:01:01.328 align:middle line:90%
and so and I'm so glad we did.

00:01:01.328 --> 00:01:03.796 align:middle line:84%
What profound work you've
done throughout your lifetime.

00:01:03.796 --> 00:01:05.199 align:middle line:90%
>> Chris Sadde: Thank you.

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:06.567 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: But let's
-- I would like everyone to get

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:09.003 align:middle line:84%
to know you, but you have a
very interesting personal story.

00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:10.504 align:middle line:90%
So you grew-up in Beirut?

00:01:10.504 --> 00:01:11.705 align:middle line:90%
>> Chris Sadde: Yes.

00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: In a
very wealthy environment.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.575 align:middle line:90%
>> Chris Sadde: Yes.

00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:15.342 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: In
a mixed neighborhood,

00:01:15.342 --> 00:01:16.977 align:middle line:90%
both Christian and Muslim.

00:01:16.977 --> 00:01:18.078 align:middle line:90%
>> Chris Sadde: Exactly.

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:19.413 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
Can you please explain

00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:22.449 align:middle line:84%
to us what your life was like
and your reality was like?

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:23.584 align:middle line:90%
>> Chris Sadde: Well, growing

00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:26.153 align:middle line:84%
up in Beirut was a very
interesting experience.

00:01:26.153 --> 00:01:29.557 align:middle line:84%
First of all, Lebanon is a
democracy, so that it's one

00:01:29.557 --> 00:01:32.860 align:middle line:84%
of the few democracies in the
Middle East, alongside Israel.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:39.867 align:middle line:84%
So that spirit of freedom
and democracy was ingrained

00:01:39.867 --> 00:01:41.835 align:middle line:90%
in me at a very young age.

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:45.873 align:middle line:84%
I was taught by my father and
my mother how important it is

00:01:45.873 --> 00:01:49.242 align:middle line:84%
to protect freedom and
to protect democracy.

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:54.281 align:middle line:84%
Also, it was an experience of
being in a situation in the area

00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:58.284 align:middle line:84%
that was quite violent from
the perspective that the war

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:01.889 align:middle line:84%
with Israel and the tension in
the Arab countries and so forth.

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:03.857 align:middle line:90%
So I grew-up with that.

00:02:03.857 --> 00:02:05.993 align:middle line:84%
And then, I mean I
grew-up in a situation

00:02:05.993 --> 00:02:07.995 align:middle line:90%
where wealthy neighborhoods

00:02:07.995 --> 00:02:11.599 align:middle line:84%
and poor neighborhoods were very
intertwined, so you would cross

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.468 align:middle line:84%
from street to street and then
you would see wealthy houses

00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:16.303 align:middle line:84%
and then you would see
people who are living

00:02:16.303 --> 00:02:18.372 align:middle line:84%
in a more struggling
environment.

00:02:18.372 --> 00:02:22.443 align:middle line:84%
So I grew-up seeing all of that
and being aware of all of that.

00:02:22.443 --> 00:02:25.145 align:middle line:84%
And then we had a big
Palestinian refugee camp

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:29.116 align:middle line:84%
in Beirut that was maybe
around 20 minutes walking

00:02:29.116 --> 00:02:32.151 align:middle line:84%
from my house, and I could see
that, I could see the plight

00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:34.388 align:middle line:84%
of the refugees and the
suffering of the refugees.

00:02:34.388 --> 00:02:40.628 align:middle line:84%
So at a very young age I saw
both, people living at ease,

00:02:40.628 --> 00:02:42.930 align:middle line:84%
comfort, and I saw
people struggling,

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.167 align:middle line:84%
I saw people being educated
and people not being educated,

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:48.836 align:middle line:90%
and that did impact me a lot.

00:02:48.836 --> 00:02:49.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
That's very different.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:50.871 align:middle line:90%
In America you tend

00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:52.773 align:middle line:84%
to see things a little
bit more segregated.

00:02:52.773 --> 00:02:54.041 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes, yes.

00:02:54.041 --> 00:02:55.476 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And the first time
I had really seen the kind

00:02:55.476 --> 00:02:58.579 align:middle line:84%
of environment you're talking
about was when I was in India,

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.247 align:middle line:84%
where I'd see beautiful
homes ...

00:03:00.247 --> 00:03:00.748 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes.

00:03:00.748 --> 00:03:01.849 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: ...

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:02.683 align:middle line:84%
and right across the
street from something

00:03:02.683 --> 00:03:04.418 align:middle line:90%
that was really just a falling

00:03:04.418 --> 00:03:06.353 align:middle line:84%
down little shanty
with no electricity.

00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:07.755 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes.

00:03:07.755 --> 00:03:09.757 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And so that's more what
you're saying, although Beirut,

00:03:09.757 --> 00:03:12.960 align:middle line:84%
itself, had a very
sophisticated culture.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.028 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Very much so.

00:03:14.028 --> 00:03:15.162 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And talk about
that a little bit?

00:03:15.162 --> 00:03:17.197 align:middle line:84%
I don't think Americans
really understand a lot

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:21.302 align:middle line:84%
about this incredible
history and sophistication

00:03:21.302 --> 00:03:23.103 align:middle line:84%
of the cultures of the
Middle East, in general,

00:03:23.103 --> 00:03:24.805 align:middle line:84%
but speak specifically
to Lebanon?

00:03:24.805 --> 00:03:27.808 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Yes, well, Lebanon is
a very interesting country

00:03:27.808 --> 00:03:30.377 align:middle line:84%
because it's kind of a bridge
between the East and the West.

00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:35.683 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's right there on the
seashore of the Mediterranean,

00:03:35.683 --> 00:03:38.218 align:middle line:84%
and then you have a mountain,
it's a bit like California.

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:40.586 align:middle line:84%
I mean and the weather
is very temperate.

00:03:40.586 --> 00:03:43.857 align:middle line:84%
And so we have a lot of
universities develop in Lebanon,

00:03:43.857 --> 00:03:47.461 align:middle line:84%
and we had an American
university, an Arab university,

00:03:47.461 --> 00:03:49.897 align:middle line:84%
an Italian institute
of higher studies,

00:03:49.897 --> 00:03:51.598 align:middle line:84%
and a French university,
and so forth.

00:03:51.598 --> 00:03:54.068 align:middle line:84%
So there was a lot of
exposure to diversity.

00:03:54.068 --> 00:03:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, Lebanon
at that time when I was growing

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.740 align:middle line:84%
up was about half Christian
and half Muslim, so --

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.111 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of the
Christians came from --

00:04:04.111 --> 00:04:07.781 align:middle line:84%
into European, kind
of the Phoenicians,

00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:10.784 align:middle line:84%
I mean the Phoenicians had
-- which were a different ...

00:04:10.784 --> 00:04:13.120 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Explain about
the Phoenicians,

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.322 align:middle line:90%
we don't understand the nature

00:04:15.322 --> 00:04:19.692 align:middle line:84%
of the modern day Phoenician
interface, when you say that?

00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:21.895 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Well, I mean the
Phoenicians had the same culture

00:04:21.895 --> 00:04:23.297 align:middle line:90%
as the Greeks.

00:04:23.297 --> 00:04:25.332 align:middle line:84%
I mean Aphrodite for the Greece
were Astarte [assumed spelling]

00:04:25.332 --> 00:04:27.668 align:middle line:84%
for the Phoenicians, but
it was the same myth.

00:04:27.668 --> 00:04:30.671 align:middle line:84%
And we like to believe that it
started with the Phoenicians,

00:04:30.671 --> 00:04:34.775 align:middle line:84%
so the whole mythology
started in that area,

00:04:34.775 --> 00:04:38.078 align:middle line:84%
in the Mediterranean, and
the Phoenicians had that

00:04:38.078 --> 00:04:40.948 align:middle line:84%
and had the very rich
mythological culture

00:04:40.948 --> 00:04:43.817 align:middle line:84%
that was still present
in the land.

00:04:43.817 --> 00:04:48.355 align:middle line:84%
I mean we -- I grew-up going
to a river where I was told

00:04:48.355 --> 00:04:52.659 align:middle line:84%
that Aphrodite appeared in
that river and so forth,

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:54.962 align:middle line:90%
so and met her lover, Adonis.

00:04:54.962 --> 00:04:57.865 align:middle line:84%
And so all of that was
inbred in me growing up,

00:04:57.865 --> 00:04:59.967 align:middle line:84%
and then so you had
that influence,

00:04:59.967 --> 00:05:04.238 align:middle line:84%
you had the rich Arab,
Muslim influence in Lebanon.

00:05:04.238 --> 00:05:07.241 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: In science and
architecture, all of it, yes.

00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:09.777 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Oh, yes, definitely,
a long history of that.

00:05:09.777 --> 00:05:15.115 align:middle line:84%
And Lebanon was basically
a very moderate culture,

00:05:15.115 --> 00:05:17.317 align:middle line:90%
very tolerant, very accepting.

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:19.987 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that they
did, which was fascinating,

00:05:19.987 --> 00:05:22.823 align:middle line:84%
is they created a
pluralistic Democratic system.

00:05:22.823 --> 00:05:23.957 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Pluralistic?

00:05:23.957 --> 00:05:28.162 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Yes, where every
community was to be --

00:05:28.162 --> 00:05:30.964 align:middle line:84%
had a place, both
in the Parliament

00:05:30.964 --> 00:05:33.834 align:middle line:84%
and in the government, so
there is no winner take all,

00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:34.935 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:05:34.935 --> 00:05:36.570 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And this included
the religious sects

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.206 align:middle line:84%
because you had Christianity,
you had the Islamic faith ...

00:05:39.206 --> 00:05:39.706 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Exactly.

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:40.340 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: ...

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.341 align:middle line:90%
you had Jewish ...

00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:42.041 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Yes, there
was the Jewish ...

00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:43.444 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: You had Druze.

00:05:43.444 --> 00:05:44.211 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: There was the Druze --
yes, the Druze are there, yes.

00:05:44.211 --> 00:05:45.279 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: The Druze, as well,

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:46.046 align:middle line:84%
I mean so you had
everyone represented.

00:05:46.046 --> 00:05:47.014 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes.

00:05:47.014 --> 00:05:48.382 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And is it
fair to say that by

00:05:48.382 --> 00:05:51.785 align:middle line:84%
and large everyone was living
in peace within the country

00:05:51.785 --> 00:05:53.287 align:middle line:90%
and within this democracy?

00:05:53.287 --> 00:05:55.656 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: They were, they
were until the war started.

00:05:55.656 --> 00:05:56.790 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.759 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: In the beginning
of the '70s and then all

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:02.262 align:middle line:84%
of that exploded, but there
was a lot of tension again

00:06:02.262 --> 00:06:04.531 align:middle line:90%
with poverty was a big issue.

00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:05.766 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:06:05.766 --> 00:06:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: The country was
divided between the wealthy

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.170 align:middle line:84%
and the poor, and there wasn't
enough work done to attend

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.439 align:middle line:84%
to the poverty and
that at some point led

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:15.742 align:middle line:84%
to a violent explosion, which
makes sense and is expected.

00:06:15.742 --> 00:06:17.110 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Oh, yes, it is expected.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.114 align:middle line:84%
And I had a friend years ago
who was extremely sophisticated

00:06:21.114 --> 00:06:22.516 align:middle line:90%
in terms of his travels.

00:06:22.516 --> 00:06:25.986 align:middle line:84%
He was the CEO of an airline,
and we were talking one time,

00:06:25.986 --> 00:06:28.121 align:middle line:84%
and I said what is
your favorite place?

00:06:28.121 --> 00:06:32.426 align:middle line:84%
And then he was explaining to
me he loved Beirut and he found

00:06:32.426 --> 00:06:35.062 align:middle line:84%
that the Phoenician women
were the most beautiful women

00:06:35.062 --> 00:06:37.064 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:06:37.064 --> 00:06:38.432 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: I'll pass it on, yes.

00:06:38.432 --> 00:06:44.238 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I never forgot that, but
really beauty, architecture,

00:06:44.238 --> 00:06:46.607 align:middle line:84%
vegetation, these
things are very important

00:06:46.607 --> 00:06:47.808 align:middle line:90%
in this part of the world.

00:06:47.808 --> 00:06:49.009 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes, they are, they are.

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:52.179 align:middle line:84%
And also diversity creates
a very thriving culture.

00:06:52.179 --> 00:06:52.713 align:middle line:90%
I mean ...

00:06:52.713 --> 00:06:53.213 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:06:53.213 --> 00:06:54.615 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: ...

00:06:54.615 --> 00:06:56.016 align:middle line:84%
it allows people to realize that
there are different ways to look

00:06:56.016 --> 00:06:58.785 align:middle line:84%
at the same issue, and that we
have to learn to live together.

00:06:58.785 --> 00:07:02.389 align:middle line:84%
I mean Lebanon was a
microcosm of the world.

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.225 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Where you had different
culture and different religion,

00:07:05.225 --> 00:07:07.928 align:middle line:84%
realizing you've got to
learn to live together,

00:07:07.928 --> 00:07:10.330 align:middle line:84%
you've got to learn to create
a pluralistic system ...

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:10.831 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:07:10.831 --> 00:07:11.632 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: ...

00:07:11.632 --> 00:07:12.733 align:middle line:90%
that is an inclusive system.

00:07:12.733 --> 00:07:15.536 align:middle line:84%
And it succeeded
and it failed, both.

00:07:15.536 --> 00:07:16.837 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:07:16.837 --> 00:07:19.339 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: But it was a place
where we had to learn that,

00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:23.110 align:middle line:84%
which today we have to learn
it at the level of the world.

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.211 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:07:24.211 --> 00:07:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And you lived in --
so your early reality,

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.216 align:middle line:84%
it did change later, but
your early reality was one

00:07:29.216 --> 00:07:29.983 align:middle line:90%
of privilege?

00:07:29.983 --> 00:07:31.218 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes.

00:07:31.218 --> 00:07:32.019 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Your father was a
man who was very driven ...

00:07:32.019 --> 00:07:32.519 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes.

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:33.854 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: ...

00:07:33.854 --> 00:07:35.822 align:middle line:84%
and he was very driven on
behalf of his children, as well.

00:07:35.822 --> 00:07:37.024 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes.

00:07:37.024 --> 00:07:38.458 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So I assume you had
a lot of demands on you,

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:41.595 align:middle line:84%
but you also had a lot made
available to you by way

00:07:41.595 --> 00:07:43.030 align:middle line:90%
of education and everything?

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:47.301 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Very much so, I mean
education and not having

00:07:47.301 --> 00:07:49.369 align:middle line:84%
to worry about where the
next meal would come,

00:07:49.369 --> 00:07:52.205 align:middle line:84%
which then allowed me to
join the peace movement

00:07:52.205 --> 00:07:53.173 align:middle line:90%
at a very young age.

00:07:53.173 --> 00:07:54.474 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:56.510 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: And be active in the
peace movement in Lebanon.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:57.945 align:middle line:90%
I mean that I ...

00:07:57.945 --> 00:07:59.947 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yes, you had
the luxury of options.

00:07:59.947 --> 00:08:01.181 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes, I did, yes.

00:08:01.181 --> 00:08:02.683 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: But let's talk about
what happened one day --

00:08:02.683 --> 00:08:05.953 align:middle line:84%
I love this story -- when
you were just a little boy

00:08:05.953 --> 00:08:07.521 align:middle line:84%
and you were on your
way to the movies?

00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:08.889 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes.

00:08:08.889 --> 00:08:10.657 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: If you can talk about
that and what that did to you

00:08:10.657 --> 00:08:12.759 align:middle line:84%
in terms of a very
early realization?

00:08:12.759 --> 00:08:14.127 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes, yes.

00:08:14.127 --> 00:08:15.996 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I mean, obviously, your
dharma or your path is to be

00:08:15.996 --> 00:08:19.700 align:middle line:84%
who you are, but you awakened to
it early because of this moment.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:20.901 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes, very much so.

00:08:20.901 --> 00:08:24.104 align:middle line:84%
I will never forget, I
was walking with my father

00:08:24.104 --> 00:08:27.374 align:middle line:84%
and mother and sisters
and brother to the movies,

00:08:27.374 --> 00:08:31.344 align:middle line:84%
and we had just had a really
good dinner and the movies were

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:33.513 align:middle line:90%
about 10 minutes away.

00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:35.983 align:middle line:84%
And I was about six,
maybe six or seven,

00:08:35.983 --> 00:08:38.986 align:middle line:84%
and I remember seeing
this little boy

00:08:38.986 --> 00:08:41.121 align:middle line:90%
that was a homeless little boy.

00:08:41.121 --> 00:08:46.593 align:middle line:84%
And he looked quite
anguished and probably hungry.

00:08:46.593 --> 00:08:49.229 align:middle line:84%
And our eyes, I mean we
looked at each other,

00:08:49.229 --> 00:08:51.665 align:middle line:90%
like our eyes locked together.

00:08:51.665 --> 00:08:56.503 align:middle line:84%
And I was flooded, I mean I
was flooded with feelings,

00:08:56.503 --> 00:09:01.775 align:middle line:84%
and especially I felt like I was
looking at myself, I was looking

00:09:01.775 --> 00:09:05.078 align:middle line:84%
at myself, that this child
is not different from me,

00:09:05.078 --> 00:09:09.549 align:middle line:84%
we just are the same
with a different story.

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:12.052 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: It's quite an
awakening for a six year old.

00:09:12.052 --> 00:09:12.819 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes.

00:09:12.819 --> 00:09:14.221 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:09:14.221 --> 00:09:15.522 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: And it's something that
never left me, never left me,

00:09:15.522 --> 00:09:19.092 align:middle line:84%
that this little
boy was my brother,

00:09:19.092 --> 00:09:22.462 align:middle line:84%
that this little boy was my
brother, and the little girls

00:09:22.462 --> 00:09:26.667 align:middle line:84%
like him were my sisters, and
that we had a common destiny

00:09:26.667 --> 00:09:30.037 align:middle line:84%
and I needed -- I needed
to be awakened to that.

00:09:30.037 --> 00:09:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that not to be
lost in the world of privilege

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:38.545 align:middle line:84%
and make that an island, a
refuge, to realize that I came

00:09:38.545 --> 00:09:43.016 align:middle line:84%
from there, but I was given
that opportunity to be able

00:09:43.016 --> 00:09:45.252 align:middle line:90%
to bring it back to them.

00:09:45.252 --> 00:09:47.287 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And what did
you do with that?

00:09:47.287 --> 00:09:49.656 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously, that wasn't
the last time you encountered

00:09:49.656 --> 00:09:50.691 align:middle line:90%
poverty as a youth.

00:09:50.691 --> 00:09:52.025 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: No.

00:09:52.025 --> 00:09:54.027 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So from that point
forward whenever you would be

00:09:54.027 --> 00:09:56.530 align:middle line:84%
bumping up against
the alternate reality,

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:57.764 align:middle line:90%
which was extreme poverty ...

00:09:57.764 --> 00:09:58.265 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes.

00:09:58.265 --> 00:09:59.032 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: ...

00:09:59.032 --> 00:10:00.233 align:middle line:90%
what did you do with that?

00:10:00.233 --> 00:10:03.904 align:middle line:84%
I mean did it create a
kind of drive or a sadness

00:10:03.904 --> 00:10:05.238 align:middle line:84%
or what did it do
in you, confusion?

00:10:05.238 --> 00:10:09.409 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: All of the above, I
mean there was a lot of grief,

00:10:09.409 --> 00:10:10.744 align:middle line:90%
there was a lot of grief.

00:10:10.744 --> 00:10:15.148 align:middle line:84%
I mean I realized early on
that grief was part of my life,

00:10:15.148 --> 00:10:17.551 align:middle line:84%
that I mean unless
I numbed myself

00:10:17.551 --> 00:10:20.187 align:middle line:84%
and unless I closed my
eyes, which I think is one

00:10:20.187 --> 00:10:22.456 align:middle line:84%
of the problem that
we see sometimes

00:10:22.456 --> 00:10:25.092 align:middle line:84%
in the spiritual world,
I mean numbing ourselves

00:10:25.092 --> 00:10:27.794 align:middle line:90%
and looking away from suffering.

00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:30.697 align:middle line:84%
But if we want to look
at reality as it is,

00:10:30.697 --> 00:10:31.932 align:middle line:84%
it's going to leave
us with grief,

00:10:31.932 --> 00:10:33.300 align:middle line:90%
and it did leave me with grief.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.902 align:middle line:84%
But with time I realized
that that grief was sacred,

00:10:35.902 --> 00:10:39.005 align:middle line:84%
that that was the grief
of the Divine in me,

00:10:39.005 --> 00:10:42.375 align:middle line:84%
that these were the tears
of the Divine, of God in me,

00:10:42.375 --> 00:10:44.111 align:middle line:84%
and that I had to carry
them with respect.

00:10:44.111 --> 00:10:47.447 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, it took years of
journeying to understand that,

00:10:47.447 --> 00:10:48.682 align:middle line:90%
but it was very confusing.

00:10:48.682 --> 00:10:50.083 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:10:50.083 --> 00:10:52.853 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: And it also led me at a
young age, around the age of 13,

00:10:52.853 --> 00:10:57.357 align:middle line:84%
to co-found and join
in a small peace --

00:10:57.357 --> 00:10:58.825 align:middle line:84%
a Christian peace
movement, so ...

00:10:58.825 --> 00:11:00.460 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Because you
were raised Christian?

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.596 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Yes, I was raised
Christian, right, right, so.

00:11:02.596 --> 00:11:03.830 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And you were in
the mixed neighborhood.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:04.965 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes.

00:11:04.965 --> 00:11:05.732 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So your brothers
near you were Muslim?

00:11:05.732 --> 00:11:07.067 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes, oh, yes.

00:11:07.067 --> 00:11:09.369 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And there was no -- I
assume there was no jostling

00:11:09.369 --> 00:11:11.238 align:middle line:84%
for power, fighting
or anything like that

00:11:11.238 --> 00:11:13.173 align:middle line:90%
over religion at that time?

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:16.643 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: No, no, actually, I
mean there were incidents

00:11:16.643 --> 00:11:20.113 align:middle line:84%
in the country, but in general
there was a lot of cooperation

00:11:20.113 --> 00:11:23.250 align:middle line:84%
and friendships and
breaking bread together.

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:27.687 align:middle line:84%
And our small peace movement was
working in villages that some

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:29.322 align:middle line:84%
of them were Christian,
some of there were Muslim,

00:11:29.322 --> 00:11:30.590 align:middle line:90%
some of them were Jews.

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:33.727 align:middle line:84%
So we intermingled all the
time, and there was a lot

00:11:33.727 --> 00:11:39.266 align:middle line:84%
of connectivity, there
was a lot of connectivity,

00:11:39.266 --> 00:11:42.202 align:middle line:84%
and of course every now and
then there'd be a dark incident,

00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:42.869 align:middle line:90%
but ...

00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:44.171 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right, right.

00:11:44.171 --> 00:11:47.107 align:middle line:84%
What about -- okay, so you,
at 13 you started this --

00:11:47.107 --> 00:11:48.542 align:middle line:84%
you co-founded this
peace movement ...

00:11:48.542 --> 00:11:49.042 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes.

00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:50.177 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: ...

00:11:50.177 --> 00:11:52.012 align:middle line:84%
of youth, how did your
father respond to that

00:11:52.012 --> 00:11:54.781 align:middle line:84%
because he I think more
had his eye on the dollar,

00:11:54.781 --> 00:11:56.483 align:middle line:90%
he was a hardcore businessman?

00:11:56.483 --> 00:11:58.452 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:11:58.452 --> 00:12:01.087 align:middle line:84%
He had mixed feelings,
he had mixed feelings.

00:12:01.087 --> 00:12:03.824 align:middle line:84%
On one hand he expected
what I did because we used

00:12:03.824 --> 00:12:08.295 align:middle line:84%
to go every weekend we would
send a team to the area

00:12:08.295 --> 00:12:10.964 align:middle line:84%
in Lebanon that was
between Israel and --

00:12:10.964 --> 00:12:16.803 align:middle line:84%
well, it was at the frontier
of Israel and Lebanon,

00:12:16.803 --> 00:12:20.106 align:middle line:84%
but there were a lot of
villages there that were stuck

00:12:20.106 --> 00:12:22.375 align:middle line:84%
in the fight between
the Israeli forces

00:12:22.375 --> 00:12:24.811 align:middle line:84%
and the Palestinian resistance,
and it was the peasants

00:12:24.811 --> 00:12:26.146 align:middle line:90%
that were paying the price.

00:12:26.146 --> 00:12:29.249 align:middle line:84%
So we would send the team every
weekend to work with them,

00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:32.419 align:middle line:84%
to medical help, especially,
and sometimes food.

00:12:32.419 --> 00:12:33.620 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:35.322 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: But medicine was
what they needed the most.

00:12:35.322 --> 00:12:38.023 align:middle line:84%
Any my father expected
that because he, himself,

00:12:38.023 --> 00:12:39.726 align:middle line:84%
was a very courageous
man, very --

00:12:39.726 --> 00:12:43.129 align:middle line:84%
and he respected the courage
we did, but he was against that

00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:46.466 align:middle line:84%
because he thought
that why bother?

00:12:46.466 --> 00:12:50.136 align:middle line:84%
I mean he was of the mentality
that I encountered so much and,

00:12:50.136 --> 00:12:53.039 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately, a lot of
[inaudible] spiritual worlds,

00:12:53.039 --> 00:12:55.742 align:middle line:84%
the poor will always be there,
that's part of the world,

00:12:55.742 --> 00:12:57.444 align:middle line:84%
that's -- you've just
got to let it be,

00:12:57.444 --> 00:13:00.580 align:middle line:84%
and why are you bothering
about that?

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:04.050 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't buy that, I
was more of the mentality

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:06.052 align:middle line:84%
of Martin Luther
King and [inaudible]

00:13:06.052 --> 00:13:07.420 align:middle line:90%
that says this is our task.

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:08.688 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Those were your heroes?

00:13:08.688 --> 00:13:10.891 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Yes, these were my
heroes growing up, right.

00:13:10.891 --> 00:13:15.028 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Then when you were 21
the war came, 1982, right?

00:13:15.028 --> 00:13:16.396 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes, yes.

00:13:16.396 --> 00:13:18.798 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: This was an entirely
different reality and as I spoke

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:23.336 align:middle line:84%
about in the opening
of this conversation,

00:13:23.336 --> 00:13:26.172 align:middle line:84%
in America we watched
it from afar.

00:13:26.172 --> 00:13:30.076 align:middle line:84%
I was a young woman who was a
news anchor, and we reported

00:13:30.076 --> 00:13:33.146 align:middle line:84%
on it every night -- it had
no real bearing on my reality.

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:35.382 align:middle line:84%
It was -- there was
always a nice theme music

00:13:35.382 --> 00:13:38.818 align:middle line:84%
to the whole thing, and what I
would like to do is just to set

00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:40.620 align:middle line:90%
that part of your life up,

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.790 align:middle line:84%
is show a little news
clip from back then.

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:45.025 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Okay.

00:13:45.025 --> 00:13:46.393 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And what life was
like in Beirut at that time.

00:13:46.393 --> 00:13:47.160 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Sure.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:47.661 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Let's take a look.

00:13:47.661 --> 00:13:48.995 align:middle line:90%
[ Video ]

00:13:48.995 --> 00:13:52.799 align:middle line:84%
>> Frank, this afternoon the
Israeli Airforce attacked a

00:13:52.799 --> 00:13:54.601 align:middle line:90%
variety of targets in Lebanon.

00:13:54.601 --> 00:13:55.936 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't the massive raid,

00:13:55.936 --> 00:13:57.971 align:middle line:84%
which much of the world
has been expecting

00:13:57.971 --> 00:14:00.674 align:middle line:84%
and which the United States
has been trying to prevent.

00:14:00.674 --> 00:14:04.878 align:middle line:84%
It was, however, an attack with
major political implications.

00:14:06.279 --> 00:14:09.749 align:middle line:84%
>> Warplanes pounded Palestinian
targets in Lebanon again today,

00:14:09.749 --> 00:14:13.920 align:middle line:84%
as Israel launched a full
scale invasion against the PLO.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.523 align:middle line:84%
The Palestinians say they
downed three Israeli jets

00:14:16.523 --> 00:14:19.059 align:middle line:84%
and one helicopter in
the fighting and put more

00:14:19.059 --> 00:14:22.062 align:middle line:84%
than one dozen tanks
out of commission.

00:14:22.062 --> 00:14:24.764 align:middle line:84%
Early this morning
over 300 Israeli tanks

00:14:24.764 --> 00:14:26.433 align:middle line:90%
and personnel carriers poured

00:14:26.433 --> 00:14:28.468 align:middle line:84%
through U.N. peacekeeping
forces,

00:14:28.468 --> 00:14:31.571 align:middle line:84%
launching a three pronged
attack on PLO strongholds,

00:14:31.571 --> 00:14:33.373 align:middle line:84%
Intyre [assumed spelling],
Navatia [assumed spelling],

00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:34.741 align:middle line:90%
and Shuba [assumed spelling].

00:14:34.741 --> 00:14:37.844 align:middle line:84%
The aim of the invasion was
to push the PLO farther north

00:14:37.844 --> 00:14:40.447 align:middle line:84%
to stop missile attacks
into Israel.

00:14:40.447 --> 00:14:42.148 align:middle line:90%
>> Long columns of Israeli tanks

00:14:42.148 --> 00:14:44.818 align:middle line:84%
and armored personnel carriers
loaded with infantry rolled

00:14:44.818 --> 00:14:47.487 align:middle line:84%
over the border into
southern Lebanon this morning.

00:14:47.487 --> 00:14:50.290 align:middle line:84%
The Israeli military spokesman
said that they would seek out

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:53.727 align:middle line:84%
and destroy all the Palestinian
terrorist concentrations

00:14:53.727 --> 00:14:57.731 align:middle line:84%
and artillery positions and sent
a rain of rockets and shells

00:14:57.731 --> 00:15:01.301 align:middle line:84%
into Israeli border communities
in the past few days.

00:15:01.301 --> 00:15:03.837 align:middle line:84%
The shooting of the
Israeli ambassador in London

00:15:03.837 --> 00:15:05.672 align:middle line:84%
and the recent Palestinian
shelling

00:15:05.672 --> 00:15:07.707 align:middle line:84%
of northern Israel
were the last straw.

00:15:07.707 --> 00:15:11.811 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So that you were
in the middle of that?

00:15:11.811 --> 00:15:12.612 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes.

00:15:12.612 --> 00:15:13.546 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: You were seeing this.

00:15:13.546 --> 00:15:15.315 align:middle line:84%
Your family had to
deal with this.

00:15:15.315 --> 00:15:17.684 align:middle line:84%
When you watch it,
this is how we saw it.

00:15:17.684 --> 00:15:18.752 align:middle line:90%
What do you see?

00:15:18.752 --> 00:15:21.921 align:middle line:84%
Is this congruent
with your experience?

00:15:23.156 --> 00:15:24.357 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Well, I mean ...

00:15:24.357 --> 00:15:27.927 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Our media has a
point of view, obviously.

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:32.165 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Yes, I mean what they're
showing is I mean is what

00:15:32.165 --> 00:15:33.299 align:middle line:90%
they're seeing, right there,

00:15:33.299 --> 00:15:35.402 align:middle line:84%
but what they're not
covering is the --

00:15:35.402 --> 00:15:38.638 align:middle line:84%
and that was something
very disappointing,

00:15:38.638 --> 00:15:43.276 align:middle line:84%
as I continued watching the
coverage of the war over 15,

00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:45.712 align:middle line:84%
16 years because it
lasted that long --

00:15:45.712 --> 00:15:48.114 align:middle line:84%
was not covering
two things there.

00:15:48.114 --> 00:15:51.985 align:middle line:84%
The unbelievable level
of human suffering,

00:15:51.985 --> 00:15:54.654 align:middle line:84%
I mean this is not only
about tanks and fighting.

00:15:54.654 --> 00:15:55.455 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:56.523 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: And like this drama.

00:15:56.523 --> 00:15:58.158 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: All it was
was a military event.

00:15:58.158 --> 00:15:59.159 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Right, it's not a ...

00:15:59.159 --> 00:16:00.727 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: On the global stage.

00:16:00.727 --> 00:16:03.129 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Right, exactly, exactly,
and the unbelievable amount

00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:05.498 align:middle line:84%
of suffering, especially
for children,

00:16:05.498 --> 00:16:09.202 align:middle line:84%
especially for children
and woman,

00:16:09.202 --> 00:16:11.871 align:middle line:84%
and then the older people,
the senior citizens.

00:16:11.871 --> 00:16:13.640 align:middle line:90%
I mean the level of suffering

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.775 align:middle line:84%
when you have a conflict
like that.

00:16:15.775 --> 00:16:18.411 align:middle line:84%
Or both, I mean both, the
[inaudible] and the citizens

00:16:18.411 --> 00:16:20.980 align:middle line:90%
or Palestinian or Lebanese.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing that sadly
was not covered enough is the

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.286 align:middle line:90%
unbelievable number of people

00:16:26.286 --> 00:16:29.789 align:middle line:84%
who were doing incredible
compassionate actions during the

00:16:29.789 --> 00:16:33.226 align:middle line:84%
war, people who were
helping each other,

00:16:33.226 --> 00:16:36.229 align:middle line:84%
who were protecting the sick,
who were taking people in.

00:16:36.229 --> 00:16:38.298 align:middle line:84%
for example, Muslims who
would take Christians

00:16:38.298 --> 00:16:41.501 align:middle line:84%
and protect them, or Christians
who would take a Muslim family

00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:43.369 align:middle line:90%
and protect that family.

00:16:43.369 --> 00:16:47.574 align:middle line:84%
People who were out there
feeding those who were hungry

00:16:47.574 --> 00:16:52.112 align:middle line:84%
or providing water or driving
somebody for three hours to get

00:16:52.112 --> 00:16:54.214 align:middle line:84%
at a hospital because
the hospital next

00:16:54.214 --> 00:16:55.482 align:middle line:90%
to them was bombed.

00:16:55.482 --> 00:16:58.017 align:middle line:84%
I mean and we don't cover
them, we don't cover that,

00:16:58.017 --> 00:17:04.389 align:middle line:84%
and that is sad that we
focus more on the drama,

00:17:04.389 --> 00:17:06.592 align:middle line:90%
the excitement in a sense.

00:17:06.592 --> 00:17:08.293 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yes, the video
game element of the war.

00:17:08.293 --> 00:17:09.662 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Right, the video
game element, exactly.

00:17:09.662 --> 00:17:11.563 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Where we're not speaking
about the human element ...

00:17:11.563 --> 00:17:12.065 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Exactly.

00:17:12.065 --> 00:17:13.466 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: ...

00:17:13.466 --> 00:17:15.902 align:middle line:84%
or which is why it's so easy for
people to just turn the channel.

00:17:15.902 --> 00:17:19.304 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Right, or
think of war as, well,

00:17:19.304 --> 00:17:21.040 align:middle line:90%
sometimes war is necessary.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think, I mean from my
perspective we really need

00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:27.113 align:middle line:84%
to come to realize that
war needs to be banned.

00:17:27.113 --> 00:17:28.148 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:17:28.148 --> 00:17:29.349 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Wars need to
be totally banned

00:17:29.349 --> 00:17:32.785 align:middle line:84%
because it's an incredible,
horrible experience.

00:17:32.785 --> 00:17:34.988 align:middle line:84%
And we speak about a
bit of casualties here,

00:17:34.988 --> 00:17:37.323 align:middle line:90%
but that covers very little

00:17:37.323 --> 00:17:40.560 align:middle line:84%
of the disruption
that happens to life.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:45.799 align:middle line:84%
I mean I had a friend who
needed shots of insulin,

00:17:45.799 --> 00:17:48.468 align:middle line:84%
and he couldn't get
that anymore.

00:17:48.468 --> 00:17:49.769 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:17:49.769 --> 00:17:51.905 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: And he was in danger
just by that little thing.

00:17:51.905 --> 00:17:53.139 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:17:53.139 --> 00:17:55.775 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: And how many examples
like that, and children

00:17:55.775 --> 00:17:59.445 align:middle line:84%
or pregnant women who needed
attention couldn't get it.

00:17:59.445 --> 00:18:03.249 align:middle line:84%
War is, from my perspective, is
a very dark, dark, dark thing.

00:18:03.249 --> 00:18:05.518 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's so
important for spiritual people

00:18:05.518 --> 00:18:09.689 align:middle line:84%
to take a stand and
say we have to end war.

00:18:09.689 --> 00:18:13.459 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Absolutely, and yet, as
you say, people were helping,

00:18:13.459 --> 00:18:14.394 align:middle line:84%
neighbors were helping
each other.

00:18:14.394 --> 00:18:15.728 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes.

00:18:15.728 --> 00:18:18.097 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: They were going across
these ordinary divisions,

00:18:18.097 --> 00:18:22.902 align:middle line:84%
but as Andrew said in the
introduction to your book,

00:18:22.902 --> 00:18:26.706 align:middle line:84%
there is a shadowy force
that keeps these things going

00:18:26.706 --> 00:18:28.641 align:middle line:90%
against the will of the people.

00:18:28.641 --> 00:18:29.876 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes.

00:18:29.876 --> 00:18:31.411 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I've been in
Palestine, I've been in Israel,

00:18:31.411 --> 00:18:35.281 align:middle line:84%
and when you're with the average
person they don't want war.

00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:36.282 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes, yes.

00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:37.016 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Nobody is
interested in the war.

00:18:37.016 --> 00:18:38.918 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes, that's true.

00:18:38.918 --> 00:18:41.521 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yet it manages
to stay perpetuated

00:18:41.521 --> 00:18:44.324 align:middle line:84%
through not only the media, but
the military industrial complex.

00:18:44.324 --> 00:18:45.692 align:middle line:90%
We talked about this off camera.

00:18:45.692 --> 00:18:50.230 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Yes, yes, I mean the
-- I mean I believe it's --

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:52.999 align:middle line:84%
I believe the war in
Lebanon, for example,

00:18:52.999 --> 00:18:55.535 align:middle line:84%
that lasted 16 years, could
have lasted six months

00:18:55.535 --> 00:18:57.103 align:middle line:84%
and stopped there
and get the result,

00:18:57.103 --> 00:19:00.974 align:middle line:84%
but then you had the influx
of weapons into the area

00:19:00.974 --> 00:19:03.710 align:middle line:84%
that was amazing and the
money that was made out of

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:05.845 align:middle line:84%
that was beyond what
we can imagine.

00:19:05.845 --> 00:19:10.116 align:middle line:84%
I mean billions of dollars were
made, that's just by people

00:19:10.116 --> 00:19:12.218 align:middle line:84%
who were getting billions
of dollars in commissions,

00:19:12.218 --> 00:19:13.253 align:middle line:90%
so you can imagine how much ...

00:19:13.253 --> 00:19:14.420 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You knew someone
who talked

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.256 align:middle line:84%
about that privately
later, right?

00:19:16.256 --> 00:19:18.258 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Right, I knew
somebody who worked

00:19:18.258 --> 00:19:22.262 align:middle line:84%
for an arm sale company, and
he was a legal kind of job.

00:19:22.262 --> 00:19:23.663 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:19:23.663 --> 00:19:25.365 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: I mean he was paid and
he was salaried and all of that.

00:19:25.365 --> 00:19:26.399 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Really salaried.

00:19:26.399 --> 00:19:27.333 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes, really.

00:19:27.333 --> 00:19:28.701 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: He gave you
some percentages

00:19:28.701 --> 00:19:32.105 align:middle line:84%
of what he would make on having
just a tiny, tiny contract?

00:19:32.105 --> 00:19:34.641 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Right, he told me that
in addition to his salary,

00:19:34.641 --> 00:19:36.409 align:middle line:84%
because his salary was
just a regular salary,

00:19:36.409 --> 00:19:41.948 align:middle line:84%
but in addition what he was
making was 0.00001 and out

00:19:41.948 --> 00:19:44.250 align:middle line:90%
of that amassing millions.

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:49.355 align:middle line:84%
So the -- I agree with
you, most of the people

00:19:49.355 --> 00:19:53.593 align:middle line:84%
that I've encountered from every
religion are basically good

00:19:53.593 --> 00:19:58.131 align:middle line:84%
people that want to care about
family, care about peace,

00:19:58.131 --> 00:20:00.533 align:middle line:90%
in general support democracy.

00:20:00.533 --> 00:20:08.908 align:middle line:84%
But then we have these high --
we have some financial interests

00:20:08.908 --> 00:20:14.147 align:middle line:84%
that are -- make their money
out of the misery of people

00:20:14.147 --> 00:20:15.982 align:middle line:84%
and make their money
out of weapon sale

00:20:15.982 --> 00:20:17.583 align:middle line:90%
and all things related to war,

00:20:17.583 --> 00:20:20.053 align:middle line:84%
and these are really
powerful entities

00:20:20.053 --> 00:20:23.222 align:middle line:90%
that need to be challenged.

00:20:23.222 --> 00:20:24.624 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yes, and people
are aware of it.

00:20:24.624 --> 00:20:28.027 align:middle line:84%
I remember when we were
in Israel we went to Aka,

00:20:28.027 --> 00:20:30.997 align:middle line:84%
the ancient City
of Aka, which is --

00:20:30.997 --> 00:20:34.100 align:middle line:84%
it's wonderful because the Arab
and Jewish communities live

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:37.070 align:middle line:84%
in harmony there, and we got
this one little bit of video

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:38.504 align:middle line:90%
that was so beautiful.

00:20:38.504 --> 00:20:42.141 align:middle line:84%
It was an Israeli young
woman who threw her arm

00:20:42.141 --> 00:20:44.477 align:middle line:90%
around the neck of an Arab man,

00:20:44.477 --> 00:20:47.213 align:middle line:84%
and they were both
saying we don't want war,

00:20:47.213 --> 00:20:49.382 align:middle line:84%
we love each other,
we don't love that.

00:20:49.382 --> 00:20:49.949 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes, yes, yes.

00:20:49.949 --> 00:20:51.317 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: You know?

00:20:51.317 --> 00:20:51.851 align:middle line:84%
And it was really -- and they
were speaking for millions.

00:20:51.851 --> 00:20:53.186 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes.

00:20:53.186 --> 00:20:56.723 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I mean even as many
Israeli young people right now

00:20:56.723 --> 00:20:58.658 align:middle line:84%
are refusing to serve in the
military, they don't want

00:20:58.658 --> 00:21:00.526 align:middle line:84%
to be part of it, and the
same on the other side.

00:21:00.526 --> 00:21:05.765 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Yes, but when we
allow some mega corporations

00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:08.368 align:middle line:84%
to be able to amass
billions and billions

00:21:08.368 --> 00:21:14.140 align:middle line:84%
without limits then we open the
door for things very shadowy

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:17.410 align:middle line:84%
to be done, if it's around
war or around illicit drugs

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:19.412 align:middle line:90%
or prostitution or whatever.

00:21:19.412 --> 00:21:21.247 align:middle line:84%
And of course profit
is important

00:21:21.247 --> 00:21:24.417 align:middle line:84%
and of course business needs
to be supported and need to run

00:21:24.417 --> 00:21:26.285 align:middle line:90%
and people need to be rewarded,

00:21:26.285 --> 00:21:28.287 align:middle line:84%
but that is very
different than saying ...

00:21:28.287 --> 00:21:28.788 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Absolutely.

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:30.056 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: ...

00:21:30.056 --> 00:21:32.392 align:middle line:84%
some mega companies can
acquire thousands of billions

00:21:32.392 --> 00:21:36.963 align:middle line:84%
of dollars, and this is
where I believe the role

00:21:36.963 --> 00:21:38.498 align:middle line:90%
of spirituality is today ...

00:21:38.498 --> 00:21:38.998 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:21:38.998 --> 00:21:40.166 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: ...

00:21:40.166 --> 00:21:41.768 align:middle line:84%
it is to bring a prophetic
voice and to be able

00:21:41.768 --> 00:21:46.105 align:middle line:84%
to raise standards for how we
do business and how we relate

00:21:46.105 --> 00:21:50.042 align:middle line:84%
to each other and to raise
that voice in the world.

00:21:50.042 --> 00:21:52.345 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yes, and we have
to be able to see face

00:21:52.345 --> 00:21:53.846 align:middle line:90%
of the damage that it does.

00:21:53.846 --> 00:21:54.680 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes.

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.515 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: You saw the face of that.

00:21:55.515 --> 00:21:57.784 align:middle line:90%
Now you had a couple of years

00:21:57.784 --> 00:22:00.887 align:middle line:84%
into the war you were
approached, as I recall,

00:22:00.887 --> 00:22:04.557 align:middle line:84%
by someone who wanted you to
become part of the resistance.

00:22:04.557 --> 00:22:05.124 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Right.

00:22:05.124 --> 00:22:06.192 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Now ...

00:22:06.192 --> 00:22:07.226 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: That was the
Lebanese resistance.

00:22:07.226 --> 00:22:08.561 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: The Lebanese
resistance, right.

00:22:08.561 --> 00:22:13.032 align:middle line:84%
Now I can see that could have
caused you some conflicts.

00:22:13.032 --> 00:22:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes.

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.268 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Of feelings
because you were already

00:22:15.268 --> 00:22:16.202 align:middle line:90%
in the peace movement.

00:22:16.202 --> 00:22:17.437 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Right, right.

00:22:17.437 --> 00:22:19.105 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So tell us what
your experience of that was

00:22:19.105 --> 00:22:20.706 align:middle line:90%
and what happened with that?

00:22:20.706 --> 00:22:24.644 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: So the Lebanese
resistance was basically a

00:22:24.644 --> 00:22:27.780 align:middle line:84%
militia that was working
to protect Lebanon,

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:33.386 align:middle line:84%
and it was a Christian
militia that was at least --

00:22:33.386 --> 00:22:36.756 align:middle line:84%
I mean its main purpose was
to fight, to protect Lebanon,

00:22:36.756 --> 00:22:38.024 align:middle line:90%
protect the democracy and so on,

00:22:38.024 --> 00:22:40.026 align:middle line:84%
and there was a very
shadowy side to it, too.

00:22:40.026 --> 00:22:43.463 align:middle line:84%
But here I was about 21 or
22, a young male that --

00:22:43.463 --> 00:22:48.301 align:middle line:84%
and I got really tempted
when I got a call saying join

00:22:48.301 --> 00:22:52.638 align:middle line:84%
and with your education you can
become an officer and with time,

00:22:52.638 --> 00:22:55.608 align:middle line:84%
who knows, maybe become
a general, you know?

00:22:55.608 --> 00:22:56.809 align:middle line:90%
And there was that ...

00:22:56.809 --> 00:22:58.010 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: That appeals to a
young man's spirit, sure.

00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:00.847 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Oh, yes, there is
something, and especially

00:23:00.847 --> 00:23:04.951 align:middle line:84%
as a male, and me that was
very attracted by the idea

00:23:04.951 --> 00:23:07.119 align:middle line:84%
of the heroic fight,
and especially a fight

00:23:07.119 --> 00:23:12.225 align:middle line:84%
for what I thought
then was a good cause.

00:23:12.225 --> 00:23:14.961 align:middle line:84%
And so I didn't say
it neatly, no,

00:23:14.961 --> 00:23:17.063 align:middle line:84%
but I said give me a
couple days to think.

00:23:17.063 --> 00:23:19.198 align:middle line:84%
So the temptation was there,
the temptation was there,

00:23:19.198 --> 00:23:20.199 align:middle line:90%
and I was saying to myself I am

00:23:20.199 --> 00:23:22.435 align:middle line:84%
in the peace movement,
I mean come on.

00:23:22.435 --> 00:23:26.939 align:middle line:84%
But I -- it shook me, I had
to face that part in myself

00:23:26.939 --> 00:23:30.476 align:middle line:84%
that was so attracted
by fighting

00:23:30.476 --> 00:23:33.246 align:middle line:90%
and fighting for a good cause.

00:23:33.246 --> 00:23:38.284 align:middle line:84%
So I decided that before I
answered I would want to go

00:23:38.284 --> 00:23:42.889 align:middle line:84%
and visit a hospital,
both in East Beirut,

00:23:42.889 --> 00:23:44.690 align:middle line:84%
that was the Christian side,
and then in West Beirut,

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:46.792 align:middle line:90%
that was the Muslim side.

00:23:46.792 --> 00:23:50.396 align:middle line:84%
And I remember very clearly
I visited the first hospital,

00:23:50.396 --> 00:23:52.765 align:middle line:84%
I went to the second
hospital, the Muslim side,

00:23:52.765 --> 00:23:57.203 align:middle line:84%
and I went to the children's
section, and I saw children

00:23:57.203 --> 00:23:59.906 align:middle line:90%
that were maimed by the war.

00:23:59.906 --> 00:24:02.875 align:middle line:84%
And I mean it was overwhelming,
it was overwhelming,

00:24:02.875 --> 00:24:05.711 align:middle line:84%
it was overwhelming to
see these little kids,

00:24:05.711 --> 00:24:08.748 align:middle line:84%
these little kids losing
limbs and eyesight and all

00:24:08.748 --> 00:24:11.651 align:middle line:90%
of that from bombshells.

00:24:11.651 --> 00:24:14.487 align:middle line:84%
And it was like from my
perspective like looking

00:24:14.487 --> 00:24:17.523 align:middle line:84%
at Christ being re-crucified
right there.

00:24:17.523 --> 00:24:21.194 align:middle line:84%
I mean I was looking at
the Christ in front of me.

00:24:21.194 --> 00:24:22.828 align:middle line:90%
And at that moment I knew

00:24:22.828 --> 00:24:28.367 align:middle line:84%
that my answer would be a
resounding no, that the work is

00:24:28.367 --> 00:24:32.738 align:middle line:84%
through peace and that and
reconciliation, the work is not

00:24:32.738 --> 00:24:35.241 align:middle line:84%
through weapons, that
there is nothing,

00:24:35.241 --> 00:24:37.143 align:middle line:90%
nothing worth that price.

00:24:37.143 --> 00:24:38.611 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Nothing could
justify that.

00:24:38.611 --> 00:24:41.547 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Nothing, nothing can
justify what we do to children,

00:24:41.547 --> 00:24:43.516 align:middle line:90%
nothing can justify that.

00:24:43.516 --> 00:24:47.954 align:middle line:84%
And we have to -- I mean in a
sense I was gifted to see it,

00:24:47.954 --> 00:24:51.891 align:middle line:84%
I was gifted to see it because
it's so easy to put that aside

00:24:51.891 --> 00:24:54.961 align:middle line:84%
and to look at the good things
in my life, which I want to look

00:24:54.961 --> 00:24:56.662 align:middle line:84%
at the beauty in my life
and the good things,

00:24:56.662 --> 00:24:59.532 align:middle line:84%
but it's so easy not to
look at the children,

00:24:59.532 --> 00:25:00.900 align:middle line:90%
not to look at a child there

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.535 align:middle line:84%
in the hospital having
lost their sight

00:25:02.535 --> 00:25:04.971 align:middle line:90%
because of a bombshell.

00:25:04.971 --> 00:25:07.807 align:middle line:84%
And looking at it made me
realize that again it was

00:25:07.807 --> 00:25:11.277 align:middle line:84%
like that experience, that
if I believe in the love

00:25:11.277 --> 00:25:13.746 align:middle line:84%
of the Divine, if I
believe in God, if I believe

00:25:13.746 --> 00:25:19.352 align:middle line:84%
that God is love, and which
I did, I have to do something

00:25:19.352 --> 00:25:23.122 align:middle line:84%
about that, we have to do
something, we have to stop that.

00:25:23.122 --> 00:25:28.995 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: At one point you became
so overwhelmed you became angry,

00:25:28.995 --> 00:25:31.564 align:middle line:84%
and as you told me off camera
you became angry at God.

00:25:31.564 --> 00:25:32.498 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes.

00:25:32.498 --> 00:25:33.399 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: How can you
let this happen?

00:25:33.399 --> 00:25:34.500 align:middle line:90%
Please explain that one,

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:36.302 align:middle line:84%
that was another big
epiphany for you.

00:25:36.302 --> 00:25:36.802 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes.

00:25:36.802 --> 00:25:37.937 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:25:37.937 --> 00:25:41.507 align:middle line:84%
When I left Lebanon I
went to Paris, France,

00:25:41.507 --> 00:25:44.610 align:middle line:84%
and then I came here to
the States, where I was --

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:46.145 align:middle line:84%
my mother was raised
in Brooklyn,

00:25:46.145 --> 00:25:49.115 align:middle line:84%
so I was given the citizenship,
and I'm extremely grateful

00:25:49.115 --> 00:25:50.850 align:middle line:84%
for this country
to have taken me in

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:55.588 align:middle line:84%
and given me a chance
to rebuild my life.

00:25:55.588 --> 00:25:59.558 align:middle line:84%
But the first five or six
years I didn't lose my faith,

00:25:59.558 --> 00:26:01.494 align:middle line:90%
I mean I knew very deep in me

00:26:01.494 --> 00:26:03.729 align:middle line:84%
that there is a whole
other dimension to life

00:26:03.729 --> 00:26:06.866 align:middle line:84%
and that there are --
there's a Divine presence

00:26:06.866 --> 00:26:07.967 align:middle line:90%
and that there is God.

00:26:07.967 --> 00:26:11.203 align:middle line:90%
And I never could lose my faith,

00:26:11.203 --> 00:26:13.939 align:middle line:84%
even when I tried I couldn't
lose it, but I was very angry

00:26:13.939 --> 00:26:17.610 align:middle line:84%
with God because I would say
how can you let children suffer

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:18.844 align:middle line:90%
that way?

00:26:18.844 --> 00:26:22.648 align:middle line:84%
I don't get it, how can
you let children suffer?

00:26:22.648 --> 00:26:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, the
answers that, well,

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:28.587 align:middle line:84%
there is beyond what we
know and everything is --

00:26:28.587 --> 00:26:32.158 align:middle line:84%
what do they say
-- it is not real,

00:26:32.158 --> 00:26:34.460 align:middle line:90%
and that did not work for me.

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:38.230 align:middle line:84%
These kids were real and
their suffering was real.

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:41.967 align:middle line:84%
So, and that in some
other dimension all

00:26:41.967 --> 00:26:44.236 align:middle line:84%
of that makes sense, it
did not make sense to me.

00:26:44.236 --> 00:26:46.072 align:middle line:90%
So I was angry with God.

00:26:46.072 --> 00:26:49.608 align:middle line:84%
I said, you know, I understand,
I understand about suffering,

00:26:49.608 --> 00:26:53.179 align:middle line:90%
we have choices, but children?

00:26:53.179 --> 00:26:54.847 align:middle line:90%
And I remember very well

00:26:54.847 --> 00:26:59.218 align:middle line:84%
when about six years
later one day I woke-up

00:26:59.218 --> 00:27:03.556 align:middle line:84%
and I had this vision, you
know, as far as much as we see

00:27:03.556 --> 00:27:09.161 align:middle line:84%
and don't see, of God crying
and saying I am crying

00:27:09.161 --> 00:27:12.765 align:middle line:84%
over these children
even more than you are.

00:27:12.765 --> 00:27:16.068 align:middle line:84%
My heart is broken
even more than you are.

00:27:16.068 --> 00:27:21.173 align:middle line:84%
What are you and your
fellow spiritual or people

00:27:21.173 --> 00:27:24.610 align:middle line:84%
of faith going to do
about the children?

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:25.678 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Put it back on you?

00:27:25.678 --> 00:27:29.381 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Yes, you are,
you are me on earth.

00:27:29.381 --> 00:27:30.316 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:27:30.316 --> 00:27:32.451 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: You are the
Divine on earth.

00:27:32.451 --> 00:27:37.156 align:middle line:84%
And I was like just all of a
sudden my anger disappeared,

00:27:37.156 --> 00:27:39.892 align:middle line:84%
and I realized God was
weeping over the children

00:27:39.892 --> 00:27:45.131 align:middle line:84%
and God was waiting on me, on us
to wake-up and end the suffering

00:27:45.131 --> 00:27:47.433 align:middle line:84%
in the world and stop
saying this is an illusion

00:27:47.433 --> 00:27:48.834 align:middle line:90%
or this was somehow ...

00:27:48.834 --> 00:27:51.036 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: We're going to talk about
that, I want to talk about that

00:27:51.036 --> 00:27:54.607 align:middle line:84%
because that's something that
you -- now, first of all,

00:27:54.607 --> 00:27:59.645 align:middle line:84%
even though you were studying
and you did ultimately have to,

00:27:59.645 --> 00:28:03.716 align:middle line:84%
as you said to me privately, you
had to betray your own spirit,

00:28:03.716 --> 00:28:05.818 align:middle line:84%
you went in a direction
that you didn't want to go

00:28:05.818 --> 00:28:07.653 align:middle line:84%
to please your father
and so forth.

00:28:07.653 --> 00:28:09.021 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes.

00:28:09.021 --> 00:28:11.056 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And I would like you
to share what you did and how

00:28:11.056 --> 00:28:14.894 align:middle line:84%
that felt, but also at
that time, I'll just add,

00:28:14.894 --> 00:28:17.363 align:middle line:84%
that you were always
studying metaphysics.

00:28:17.363 --> 00:28:18.464 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes.

00:28:18.464 --> 00:28:20.299 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Really deep,
beautiful philosophies

00:28:20.299 --> 00:28:22.468 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual philosophies,
as well.

00:28:22.468 --> 00:28:23.602 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes.

00:28:23.602 --> 00:28:24.470 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Now when you say
you betrayed yourself,

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:26.906 align:middle line:90%
what happened there?

00:28:26.906 --> 00:28:30.476 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Well, I betrayed
myself because with my father,

00:28:30.476 --> 00:28:33.245 align:middle line:84%
my father was a lawyer, a
businessman, a politician

00:28:33.245 --> 00:28:34.680 align:middle line:90%
that was a self-made man.

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:39.018 align:middle line:84%
I mean he came from poverty
and he built his life,

00:28:39.018 --> 00:28:41.787 align:middle line:84%
and he built his life through
hard work, through working 20,

00:28:41.787 --> 00:28:45.724 align:middle line:84%
24 hours a day, I mean sometimes
and at least 18 hours a day,

00:28:45.724 --> 00:28:47.960 align:middle line:84%
and of course not
having time for self.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.195 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Of course.

00:28:49.195 --> 00:28:51.263 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: I mean it was --
and all the problems we had

00:28:51.263 --> 00:28:52.565 align:middle line:90%
in the family.

00:28:52.565 --> 00:28:56.602 align:middle line:84%
And he believed that the way
to avoid becoming poor is

00:28:56.602 --> 00:29:00.105 align:middle line:84%
to become very, very rich, and
he wanted us, his children,

00:29:00.105 --> 00:29:01.474 align:middle line:90%
especially the male ones,

00:29:01.474 --> 00:29:05.911 align:middle line:84%
to go and become very
successful businessmen.

00:29:05.911 --> 00:29:07.713 align:middle line:84%
And that's fine, there
is a place for business,

00:29:07.713 --> 00:29:09.815 align:middle line:84%
and business is sacred when
it's done from the heart

00:29:09.815 --> 00:29:12.718 align:middle line:84%
and with ethics, but
that was not my calling,

00:29:12.718 --> 00:29:13.786 align:middle line:90%
that was not my calling.

00:29:13.786 --> 00:29:16.822 align:middle line:84%
My calling was philosophy,
spirituality,

00:29:16.822 --> 00:29:23.863 align:middle line:84%
and but at that age
I did not understand

00:29:23.863 --> 00:29:29.168 align:middle line:84%
that my authenticity is sacred,
and that my path is a path given

00:29:29.168 --> 00:29:30.603 align:middle line:90%
to the Divine from me.

00:29:30.603 --> 00:29:34.039 align:middle line:84%
And I thought like, well,
you've got to work with --

00:29:34.039 --> 00:29:35.841 align:middle line:90%
maybe he's right, you know?

00:29:35.841 --> 00:29:38.177 align:middle line:84%
So what I ended doing
was compromising.

00:29:38.177 --> 00:29:42.715 align:middle line:84%
I went, became a businessman,
and did well in business,

00:29:42.715 --> 00:29:45.451 align:middle line:84%
and on the other hand
kept on of course working

00:29:45.451 --> 00:29:47.586 align:middle line:84%
with the peace movement
and studying metaphysics

00:29:47.586 --> 00:29:49.588 align:middle line:84%
and studying theology
and all of that.

00:29:49.588 --> 00:29:53.459 align:middle line:84%
So I tried to do both, but I
was really splitting myself

00:29:53.459 --> 00:29:57.296 align:middle line:84%
until I realized that -- and
that led me to depressive bouts

00:29:57.296 --> 00:30:02.434 align:middle line:84%
and feeling like I am
alienated from my own spirit.

00:30:02.434 --> 00:30:04.169 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You said even
the more money you made,

00:30:04.169 --> 00:30:05.170 align:middle line:90%
the more depressed you became.

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:06.372 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Oh, my God, yes.

00:30:06.372 --> 00:30:09.742 align:middle line:84%
I mean one summer I had
a very successful summer,

00:30:09.742 --> 00:30:11.677 align:middle line:84%
and we had just come
through all of that.

00:30:11.677 --> 00:30:12.945 align:middle line:84%
And my brother comes
and says, well,

00:30:12.945 --> 00:30:14.280 align:middle line:90%
how are you going to celebrate?

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:16.315 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh, my God,
I don't want to celebrate,

00:30:16.315 --> 00:30:20.252 align:middle line:84%
I just want to go home and
just close the curtains

00:30:20.252 --> 00:30:21.654 align:middle line:90%
and that hit me.

00:30:21.654 --> 00:30:23.188 align:middle line:90%
It's like what are you doing?

00:30:23.188 --> 00:30:25.190 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:28.294 align:middle line:84%
Because then I started realizing
there is an authentic spirit

00:30:28.294 --> 00:30:31.230 align:middle line:84%
in every one of us, there's
a path, like you were saying,

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:33.399 align:middle line:84%
there's a path in every
one of us and we have

00:30:33.399 --> 00:30:35.401 align:middle line:90%
to be faithful to that path.

00:30:35.401 --> 00:30:37.703 align:middle line:84%
So that was the other
thing that I've learned is

00:30:37.703 --> 00:30:41.573 align:middle line:84%
about authenticity, each one
of us has a very authentic,

00:30:41.573 --> 00:30:43.208 align:middle line:84%
is a very authentic
incarnation of the Divine

00:30:43.208 --> 00:30:45.577 align:middle line:84%
and nobody can touch that
and nobody can change that.

00:30:45.577 --> 00:30:49.148 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: So you quit business?

00:30:49.148 --> 00:30:50.249 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: I did.

00:30:50.249 --> 00:30:51.984 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yes, and you
followed your true path,

00:30:51.984 --> 00:30:54.553 align:middle line:84%
but as this true
path was coming to be

00:30:54.553 --> 00:30:59.024 align:middle line:84%
so was there a real blossoming
of the new age movement

00:30:59.024 --> 00:31:00.426 align:middle line:90%
and that a lot

00:31:00.426 --> 00:31:04.630 align:middle line:84%
of the philosophies were very
much ordered toward suffering is

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:05.998 align:middle line:90%
an illusion.

00:31:05.998 --> 00:31:07.032 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Right.

00:31:07.032 --> 00:31:09.234 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And so you
really did not jive

00:31:09.234 --> 00:31:11.637 align:middle line:84%
with the message
that was rising up?

00:31:11.637 --> 00:31:12.771 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes.

00:31:12.771 --> 00:31:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: From the depths
of that new age thought?

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:16.241 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Right, I mean I call --

00:31:16.241 --> 00:31:18.043 align:middle line:84%
I mean new age and
other than new age,

00:31:18.043 --> 00:31:20.546 align:middle line:84%
I call this the first
wave of spirituality.

00:31:20.546 --> 00:31:21.981 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yes, the first
wave, and that's --

00:31:21.981 --> 00:31:24.283 align:middle line:84%
I mean what you do is called
second wave spirituality, right?

00:31:24.283 --> 00:31:25.284 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Right, right,
right, right.

00:31:25.284 --> 00:31:26.285 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: That's what
you were created.

00:31:26.285 --> 00:31:27.953 align:middle line:84%
So let's say first
wave spirituality?

00:31:27.953 --> 00:31:29.421 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: First wave spirituality,

00:31:29.421 --> 00:31:31.457 align:middle line:84%
I think has brought
us many, many gifts.

00:31:31.457 --> 00:31:35.260 align:middle line:84%
It has liberated us from
the whole of dogmas,

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.730 align:middle line:84%
and that there is a
right way to follow God.

00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:40.099 align:middle line:84%
It has showed us that there
are many ways to follow God,

00:31:40.099 --> 00:31:43.535 align:middle line:84%
opening us up to more
inclusive thinking.

00:31:43.535 --> 00:31:46.005 align:middle line:84%
It also freed us
from a lot of shame,

00:31:46.005 --> 00:31:49.541 align:middle line:84%
the shame about who we are,
and so it was a great gift.

00:31:49.541 --> 00:31:52.511 align:middle line:84%
But I felt there was an
area that was very lacking

00:31:52.511 --> 00:31:55.381 align:middle line:84%
and in many ways very
dangerous in our thinking,

00:31:55.381 --> 00:31:58.017 align:middle line:84%
which is that suffering
is an illusion,

00:31:58.017 --> 00:32:00.219 align:middle line:84%
which is that this
whole planet Earth,

00:32:00.219 --> 00:32:04.189 align:middle line:84%
this beautiful blue
planet is not real,

00:32:04.189 --> 00:32:08.594 align:middle line:84%
and that we are just
going somewhere else

00:32:08.594 --> 00:32:09.728 align:middle line:90%
and this is just a passage.

00:32:09.728 --> 00:32:11.196 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yes, we're kind
of marking time passing

00:32:11.196 --> 00:32:12.664 align:middle line:84%
through here to something
better.

00:32:12.664 --> 00:32:14.233 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Exactly, like
a train station.

00:32:14.233 --> 00:32:15.534 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:32:15.534 --> 00:32:17.169 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: You don't want to go
through the train station,

00:32:17.169 --> 00:32:20.005 align:middle line:84%
but you don't really
care about [inaudible].

00:32:20.005 --> 00:32:21.373 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:32:21.373 --> 00:32:23.675 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: And this is related I
think to some very old thinking

00:32:23.675 --> 00:32:28.280 align:middle line:84%
that belief that evil
is in matter, you know,

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:29.882 align:middle line:90%
that we are only spirit,

00:32:29.882 --> 00:32:33.619 align:middle line:84%
and that whatever is
matter is evil, basically.

00:32:33.619 --> 00:32:38.857 align:middle line:84%
So we are trying to become
spiritual people therefore are

00:32:38.857 --> 00:32:41.260 align:middle line:90%
disconnected from matter.

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:47.699 align:middle line:84%
And that led us to turn our
back on what was physical

00:32:47.699 --> 00:32:51.937 align:middle line:84%
and material and physical
suffering, like extreme poverty,

00:32:51.937 --> 00:32:56.508 align:middle line:84%
like war, like the children of
war, like women who are enslaved

00:32:56.508 --> 00:32:58.744 align:middle line:84%
in so many ways in
so many places.

00:32:58.744 --> 00:33:01.346 align:middle line:84%
And it's like we turned away,
I mean we're still the charity,

00:33:01.346 --> 00:33:03.749 align:middle line:84%
we still care, we're a
compassionate people,

00:33:03.749 --> 00:33:05.851 align:middle line:84%
but we didn't feel
that this is our task

00:33:05.851 --> 00:33:09.288 align:middle line:90%
to really bring an end to that.

00:33:09.288 --> 00:33:10.689 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:33:10.689 --> 00:33:12.191 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Like we brought an end
to slavery in the United States,

00:33:12.191 --> 00:33:15.127 align:middle line:84%
bring an end to women's
slavery, bring an end

00:33:15.127 --> 00:33:16.495 align:middle line:90%
to war, we can't do that.

00:33:16.495 --> 00:33:18.630 align:middle line:84%
But 100 years, which I know
we're going to talk about ...

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:19.264 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes, we are.

00:33:19.264 --> 00:33:19.832 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: ...

00:33:19.832 --> 00:33:20.666 align:middle line:90%
we can do it.

00:33:20.666 --> 00:33:21.934 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:33:21.934 --> 00:33:23.769 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: The idea is that we
cannot do it, but the idea

00:33:23.769 --> 00:33:27.673 align:middle line:84%
that we cannot do it is related
to this split that we made

00:33:27.673 --> 00:33:30.542 align:middle line:84%
between the transcendental
and the imminent.

00:33:30.542 --> 00:33:31.610 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:33.011 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: And we made
this like, like this,

00:33:33.011 --> 00:33:36.715 align:middle line:84%
this gorgeous nature we
made it not that important.

00:33:36.715 --> 00:33:39.284 align:middle line:84%
And now we have come to the
place, and that's where --

00:33:39.284 --> 00:33:42.721 align:middle line:84%
it's a term that I've given to
this new wave of spirituality,

00:33:42.721 --> 00:33:45.591 align:middle line:84%
I called it second wave,
that is arising in the world

00:33:45.591 --> 00:33:49.495 align:middle line:84%
that is saying that transcendent
and the imminent are one.

00:33:49.495 --> 00:33:50.696 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:33:50.696 --> 00:33:53.198 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: You know, the
spirit and the body are one,

00:33:53.198 --> 00:33:55.667 align:middle line:84%
and we are the dream
of the Divine.

00:33:55.667 --> 00:33:58.504 align:middle line:84%
Archbishop Tutu in South
Africa used to always say,

00:33:58.504 --> 00:34:01.840 align:middle line:84%
it's a beautiful saying,
says the Divine has a dream,

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:04.610 align:middle line:84%
work for the dream of the
Divine, it's a dream of peace,

00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:06.111 align:middle line:90%
it's a dream of justice.

00:34:06.111 --> 00:34:09.148 align:middle line:84%
And that we are here to work
for that spiritual dream,

00:34:09.148 --> 00:34:12.184 align:middle line:84%
but it's a dream that
is anchored in you and I

00:34:12.184 --> 00:34:15.187 align:middle line:84%

list of people who are borrowing

there are 42 people,

00:35:52.851 --> 00:35:55.887 align:middle line:84%

they borrowed was $27.

simple problem to solve,

from my pocket.

I didn't have to discuss it with
anybody, such a small amount,

give this money

because it is about justice and
it's about attending to poverty,

and accountability and
it's not a handout.

the business world needs to be,

00:39:47.552 --> 00:39:51.423 align:middle line:84%
which is a lot of
small enterprises,

00:39:51.423 --> 00:39:54.359 align:middle line:84%
none of these huge
mega corporations

it's something, as you say,

we're on a big island, feel very
isolated from all these affairs,

00:40:17.182 --> 00:40:19.851 align:middle line:84%
even in that way one of
the easiest things --

00:40:19.851 --> 00:40:22.888 align:middle line:84%
this is kind of an American
version of pitching in,

00:40:22.888 --> 00:40:26.224 align:middle line:84%
which I pitched this to my
family I don't know about 10,

do we need to do this,
we don't need stuff?

00:40:33.365 --> 00:40:36.301 align:middle line:84%

takes no effort,

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.436 align:middle line:84%
it didn't even take
extra resources.

00:41:11.436 --> 00:41:14.139 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like that's
the least we can do

And many times we say,

you know, what can we do?

00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:36.394 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, Gandhi
used to say

00:41:36.394 --> 00:41:37.929 align:middle line:84%
and Martin Luther

do, but the issue is everybody.

>> CS: When we can bring numbers
then we can change the course.

00:41:53.979 --> 00:41:57.782 align:middle line:84%
I believe that as spiritual
people we are the bearers

00:41:57.782 --> 00:42:00.185 align:middle line:84%
of good news, I mean
it's like the gospel,

00:42:00.185 --> 00:42:00.986 align:middle line:90%
the bearers of good news.

00:42:00.986 --> 00:42:02.420 align:middle line:90%

situation that is catastrophic.

00:42:04.923 --> 00:42:06.524 align:middle line:90%
The world, I mean most --

00:42:06.524 --> 00:42:08.960 align:middle line:84%
a lot of thinkers today
are saying will we survive

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:10.095 align:middle line:90%
as a human race?

00:42:10.095 --> 00:42:11.162 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:42:11.162 --> 00:42:12.264 align:middle line:84%

economically,

00:42:12.264 --> 00:42:15.133 align:middle line:84%
ecologically we are
standing at the brink.

00:42:15.133 --> 00:42:16.201 align:middle line:90%
But at the same time

00:42:16.201 --> 00:42:19.571 align:middle line:84%
as spiritual people
we have been given,

00:42:19.571 --> 00:42:21.740 align:middle line:90%
we have been given the way out.

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:22.774 align:middle line:90%

00:42:22.774 --> 00:42:24.075 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: We know, I
mean micro financing

00:42:24.075 --> 00:42:27.245 align:middle line:84%
on the economic level is
one, politically the idea

00:42:27.245 --> 00:42:29.514 align:middle line:84%
of the inclusive
democracy and so forth,

00:42:29.514 --> 00:42:31.516 align:middle line:84%
there are other ideas
-- we have a platform.

00:42:31.516 --> 00:42:34.619 align:middle line:84%
What we need is for
every spiritual person

00:42:34.619 --> 00:42:38.323 align:middle line:84%
to do what you did, every
person to do their share.

00:42:38.323 --> 00:42:41.126 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Oh, and that's
just a simple small thing.

00:42:41.126 --> 00:42:42.794 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Exactly.

00:42:42.794 --> 00:42:47.966 align:middle line:84%

can start with a $25 program.

>> CS: Yes, exactly.

00:42:49.367 --> 00:42:51.970 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: To start investing, and
these people that are looking

00:42:51.970 --> 00:42:55.373 align:middle line:84%
for financing, you know, it
might be a flock of geese.

00:42:55.373 --> 00:42:56.608 align:middle line:90%

00:42:56.608 --> 00:42:57.809 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Or something, or like
you say a sewing machine

00:42:57.809 --> 00:42:59.444 align:middle line:90%
or to start a little store

00:42:59.444 --> 00:43:01.946 align:middle line:84%
where they can sell their
coconuts, it's so simple.

00:43:01.946 --> 00:43:03.615 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Right, and it's
not only good for them,

00:43:03.615 --> 00:43:06.484 align:middle line:84%
it's good for the world because
we need small businesses.

00:43:07.786 --> 00:43:10.989 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Not this accumulation
of power, so it's healing

00:43:10.989 --> 00:43:15.627 align:middle line:84%
for the world, it brings justice

00:43:15.627 --> 00:43:17.028 align:middle line:90%

00:43:17.028 --> 00:43:19.831 align:middle line:84%

good friend, Andrew Harvey,

00:43:22.267 --> 00:43:23.301 align:middle line:90%
and his wonderful fire.

00:43:23.301 --> 00:43:24.235 align:middle line:90%

00:43:24.235 --> 00:43:25.637 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Yes, his fire
and passion.

00:43:25.637 --> 00:43:29.107 align:middle line:84%
Sacred activism, you know,
bring your love of the Divine

00:43:29.107 --> 00:43:32.344 align:middle line:84%
to match your passion for
justice, but and I think more

00:43:32.344 --> 00:43:36.781 align:middle line:84%
and more people are doing
that, but we need to really get

00:43:36.781 --> 00:43:38.950 align:middle line:84%
that passion for
activism and realize

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:41.486 align:middle line:84%
that that's how we
express our spirituality.

00:43:41.486 --> 00:43:42.787 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:43:42.787 --> 00:43:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: And have more numbers
and meditate on our feats.

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:46.991 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:43:46.991 --> 00:43:49.594 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Pray and action,
get out there

00:43:49.594 --> 00:43:53.331 align:middle line:84%
because we have the numbers on
our side, but everyone needs

00:43:53.331 --> 00:43:54.833 align:middle line:90%
to be involved, everyone.

00:43:54.833 --> 00:43:56.868 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking about Stefan
Hasser [assumed spelling],

00:43:56.868 --> 00:44:00.839 align:middle line:84%
he is a beautiful Jewish
gentleman in France,

00:44:00.839 --> 00:44:05.710 align:middle line:84%
he actually passed away about a
year ago, and at the age of 90,

00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:08.346 align:middle line:84%
at the age of 90 he
wrote this amazing book,

00:44:08.346 --> 00:44:12.150 align:middle line:84%
saying get outraged, he wrote
a book called Get Outraged,

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:14.552 align:middle line:84%
and then he got another
book called Get Engaged.

00:44:14.552 --> 00:44:15.487 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Okay.

00:44:15.487 --> 00:44:17.622 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: And he understood this,

00:44:17.622 --> 00:44:20.425 align:middle line:84%
and he by the way he was
the diplomat who called

00:44:20.425 --> 00:44:24.829 align:middle line:84%
out the human right with Eleanor
Roosevelt, so but here he was

00:44:24.829 --> 00:44:30.702 align:middle line:84%
at the age of 90, I mean tall,
just beautiful elder man.

00:44:30.702 --> 00:44:35.640 align:middle line:84%
And his message was today is
the responsibility of every one

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:37.609 align:middle line:90%
to get engaged, everyone.

00:44:37.609 --> 00:44:40.178 align:middle line:84%
It's not the responsibility
of a nonprofit

00:44:40.178 --> 00:44:42.480 align:middle line:90%
or my cousin or these people ...

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:42.981 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:44:42.981 --> 00:44:43.948 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: ...

00:44:43.948 --> 00:44:45.283 align:middle line:84%
it's the responsibility
of everyone

00:44:45.283 --> 00:44:49.020 align:middle line:84%
who says they have a heart
or they live a spiritual life

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:51.790 align:middle line:84%
to get engaged and
underline everyone.

00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:53.057 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:44:53.057 --> 00:44:54.459 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: And he says we have
to stand-up for our world

00:44:54.459 --> 00:44:56.761 align:middle line:84%
in this moment of
needs, everyone.

00:44:56.761 --> 00:44:59.764 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And that brings me to
Outraged was one of the books,

00:44:59.764 --> 00:45:03.134 align:middle line:84%
you say, this has been a hard
place again when you're looking

00:45:03.134 --> 00:45:06.171 align:middle line:84%
at first wave spirituality,
a hard one for some people

00:45:06.171 --> 00:45:09.374 align:middle line:84%
to balance because it's, no,
we shouldn't be in judgment,

00:45:09.374 --> 00:45:12.610 align:middle line:84%
we should not be angry, we
need to stay in our center

00:45:12.610 --> 00:45:17.215 align:middle line:84%
and stay calm, but this is
a little more complex issue

00:45:17.215 --> 00:45:17.749 align:middle line:90%
than that.

00:45:17.749 --> 00:45:19.117 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes.

00:45:19.117 --> 00:45:22.387 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: That fire, which also
is outrage, is usually the fuel

00:45:22.387 --> 00:45:24.722 align:middle line:84%
that gets us off our
duff to do something,

00:45:24.722 --> 00:45:28.426 align:middle line:84%
so explain the nuance difference
in that kind of thing?

00:45:28.426 --> 00:45:31.529 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: I think what is
fascinating today is we have

00:45:31.529 --> 00:45:35.834 align:middle line:84%
created a spiritual culture
that learns from everywhere,

00:45:35.834 --> 00:45:37.735 align:middle line:90%
so we have brought -- a lot

00:45:37.735 --> 00:45:40.672 align:middle line:84%
of ideas have aligned
together right now,

00:45:40.672 --> 00:45:43.608 align:middle line:84%
and they're creating I
believe an incredible shift

00:45:43.608 --> 00:45:45.009 align:middle line:90%
in our minds.

00:45:45.009 --> 00:45:49.214 align:middle line:84%
I mean we are evolving mentally
in a way that is just amazing,

00:45:49.214 --> 00:45:50.215 align:middle line:90%
I believe, and it's due

00:45:50.215 --> 00:45:51.616 align:middle line:84%
to bringing all these
ideas together.

00:45:51.616 --> 00:45:54.519 align:middle line:84%
Where, yes, it's important to
be centered, yes, it's important

00:45:54.519 --> 00:45:58.556 align:middle line:84%
to be peaceful, yes, it's
important to be loving

00:45:58.556 --> 00:46:02.126 align:middle line:84%
to everyone and to
be forgiving, and --

00:46:02.126 --> 00:46:03.962 align:middle line:90%
it's the and that is the key --

00:46:03.962 --> 00:46:08.233 align:middle line:84%
and it is important to be
outraged, not at people,

00:46:08.233 --> 00:46:12.403 align:middle line:84%
individuals, but at injustice
as a practice of injustice.

00:46:12.403 --> 00:46:13.471 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:46:13.471 --> 00:46:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: It's important
to hold the grief

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:16.941 align:middle line:90%
of the people who are suffering.

00:46:16.941 --> 00:46:21.613 align:middle line:84%
So now we know we can be
centered, we can meditate,

00:46:21.613 --> 00:46:24.749 align:middle line:84%
we can do all of
that and be at peace,

00:46:24.749 --> 00:46:28.887 align:middle line:84%
while at the same time
saying, no, a passionate no

00:46:28.887 --> 00:46:33.324 align:middle line:84%
to the systemic impoverishment
of billions of people.

00:46:33.324 --> 00:46:36.294 align:middle line:84%
Say a systemic no to
the use of violence

00:46:36.294 --> 00:46:39.530 align:middle line:84%
to resolve international
conflicts.

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:44.168 align:middle line:84%
Say -- and, again, Christ,
what a beautiful example,

00:46:44.168 --> 00:46:47.305 align:middle line:84%
Jesus was outraged, but
he was outraged with love.

00:46:47.305 --> 00:46:50.642 align:middle line:84%
He didn't have -- he didn't
make individuals the enemy.

00:46:50.642 --> 00:46:51.976 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:46:51.976 --> 00:46:54.212 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: As spiritual people I
believe no individual needs

00:46:54.212 --> 00:46:57.548 align:middle line:84%
to be our foe, but the
structures, the structures

00:46:57.548 --> 00:47:01.552 align:middle line:84%
that are perpetuating that needs
to be, we need to be outraged.

00:47:01.552 --> 00:47:03.054 align:middle line:90%
We deal with as parents, right?

00:47:03.054 --> 00:47:04.389 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:47:04.389 --> 00:47:07.225 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: I mean if somebody is
bullying my child I'm going

00:47:07.225 --> 00:47:11.162 align:middle line:84%
to stand-up, I mean if
I may tell you this?

00:47:11.162 --> 00:47:12.797 align:middle line:84%
Marion Williamson
[assumed spelling] spoke

00:47:12.797 --> 00:47:17.001 align:middle line:84%
at the conference of the
organization called Results,

00:47:17.001 --> 00:47:21.372 align:middle line:84%
it's an organization of
citizen volunteers lobbying

00:47:21.372 --> 00:47:24.175 align:middle line:90%
for the end of poverty.

00:47:24.175 --> 00:47:27.245 align:middle line:84%
And last year she said something
that just touched me so much

00:47:27.245 --> 00:47:28.680 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of people, too.

00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:31.015 align:middle line:84%
She said -- and she was
speaking about women, she said,

00:47:31.015 --> 00:47:36.254 align:middle line:84%
us women we are amazing mother,
we are kind, we are accepting,

00:47:36.254 --> 00:47:40.925 align:middle line:84%
we are patient, like
anything, but touch our child,

00:47:40.925 --> 00:47:45.063 align:middle line:84%
harm our child and we stand-up
as a bear to defend that child.

00:47:45.063 --> 00:47:50.401 align:middle line:84%
And she said but now we know all
the children are our children,

00:47:50.401 --> 00:47:53.771 align:middle line:84%
and now we have to
stand as spiritual bears

00:47:53.771 --> 00:47:56.240 align:middle line:90%
for all these children.

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:59.744 align:middle line:84%
So we stand with love, we
stand with no animosity

00:47:59.744 --> 00:48:03.915 align:middle line:84%
against anybody, but
we stand with passion

00:48:03.915 --> 00:48:07.719 align:middle line:84%
and the Divine is outraged
against the killing,

00:48:07.719 --> 00:48:11.456 align:middle line:84%
against the weapons, against
the violation of the earth,

00:48:11.456 --> 00:48:13.624 align:middle line:84%
the ecological violation
of the earth.

00:48:13.624 --> 00:48:16.627 align:middle line:90%
So we can be both.

00:48:16.627 --> 00:48:17.795 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:48:17.795 --> 00:48:19.230 align:middle line:84%

and not aggressive.

00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:20.231 align:middle line:90%

never violent,

00:48:21.566 --> 00:48:24.135 align:middle line:84%
we have learned nonviolence,
at a personal level

00:48:24.135 --> 00:48:25.303 align:middle line:90%
and a collective level.

00:48:25.303 --> 00:48:26.671 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:48:26.671 --> 00:48:29.374 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
youth, what did you --

00:48:29.374 --> 00:48:31.909 align:middle line:84%
what were your feelings
and observations

00:48:31.909 --> 00:48:33.945 align:middle line:90%
when the Arab Spring occurred?

00:48:33.945 --> 00:48:37.915 align:middle line:84%
Now just as one caveat let
me say everything has --

00:48:37.915 --> 00:48:39.817 align:middle line:90%
seems to have its shadow side,

00:48:39.817 --> 00:48:41.853 align:middle line:84%
so we could have
had provocateurs

00:48:41.853 --> 00:48:44.689 align:middle line:84%
that did not necessarily
have the highest interest

00:48:44.689 --> 00:48:46.491 align:middle line:90%
that started a lot of this.

00:48:46.491 --> 00:48:47.859 align:middle line:90%

let's talk about the people

00:48:49.927 --> 00:48:52.997 align:middle line:84%
who actually showed up
sincerely, and that was

00:48:52.997 --> 00:48:55.099 align:middle line:90%
by the hundreds of thousands?

00:48:55.099 --> 00:48:56.334 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes, yes, yes.

00:48:56.334 --> 00:48:57.969 align:middle line:84%
Like you said, it's
very complex,

00:48:57.969 --> 00:49:01.806 align:middle line:84%
and of course there is shadow,
there is shadow to everything.

00:49:01.806 --> 00:49:03.041 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:49:03.041 --> 00:49:04.942 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: But the Arab
Spring was basically a lot

00:49:04.942 --> 00:49:09.881 align:middle line:84%
of moderate Muslims who cared
for democracy and who cared

00:49:09.881 --> 00:49:13.484 align:middle line:84%
for social justice and who
cared about their country,

00:49:13.484 --> 00:49:15.720 align:middle line:84%
who showed up and said
let us have democracy

00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:18.056 align:middle line:84%
and let's have a greater
vision of social justice.

00:49:18.056 --> 00:49:20.458 align:middle line:84%
Coming out of there,
beautiful faith,

00:49:20.458 --> 00:49:24.262 align:middle line:84%
and that's again it's sacred
activism that's based on action.

00:49:24.262 --> 00:49:26.497 align:middle line:90%
Now there were provocateurs

00:49:26.497 --> 00:49:29.901 align:middle line:84%
and there were extreme
Islamist groups.

00:49:29.901 --> 00:49:31.302 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:49:31.302 --> 00:49:34.772 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Who used the Arab Spring
back in Tunis and other places

00:49:34.772 --> 00:49:40.011 align:middle line:84%
to then go for their project
of an extreme Islamic society.

00:49:40.011 --> 00:49:43.181 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what
happened in Egypt, you know,

00:49:43.181 --> 00:49:47.518 align:middle line:90%
the up rise was taken away.

00:49:47.518 --> 00:49:51.155 align:middle line:84%
Now the Islamists in
Egypt won, you know,

00:49:51.155 --> 00:49:53.891 align:middle line:84%
they won by 50 points
something or 51%.

00:49:53.891 --> 00:49:55.159 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:49:55.159 --> 00:49:57.528 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: But the problem was
that they went immediately

00:49:57.528 --> 00:50:00.898 align:middle line:84%
into wanting to create
a more Islamist society.

00:50:00.898 --> 00:50:02.233 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:50:02.233 --> 00:50:05.837 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: And that's the problem
I believe with democracies

00:50:05.837 --> 00:50:10.208 align:middle line:84%
that are noninclusive, you know,
somehow we still today speak

00:50:10.208 --> 00:50:12.610 align:middle line:84%
about democracy as
a winner take all,

00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:16.247 align:middle line:84%
whoever has 51% then has all the
government and all the power,

00:50:16.247 --> 00:50:17.648 align:middle line:90%
and that's why a lot

00:50:17.648 --> 00:50:20.952 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual teachers are saying
we need an inclusive democracy

00:50:20.952 --> 00:50:23.421 align:middle line:84%
where, yes, you win,
you have more power.

00:50:23.421 --> 00:50:26.591 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yes, so in this
case spirituality, religion

00:50:26.591 --> 00:50:29.894 align:middle line:84%
and government do need to
start meeting in the middle.

00:50:29.894 --> 00:50:33.097 align:middle line:84%
I mean even in a
sectarian sense in Germany,

00:50:33.097 --> 00:50:36.801 align:middle line:84%
in many countries there are
a wide variety of parties

00:50:36.801 --> 00:50:39.537 align:middle line:84%
and interests, all that
have to be included

00:50:39.537 --> 00:50:42.073 align:middle line:84%
in making coalitions
that work for people.

00:50:42.073 --> 00:50:43.274 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Right, exactly, exactly.

00:50:43.274 --> 00:50:44.609 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: In the U.S. we
don't have such a thing.

00:50:44.609 --> 00:50:46.744 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: The idea of
inclusive democracy I think,

00:50:46.744 --> 00:50:48.012 align:middle line:90%
like micro financing,

00:50:48.012 --> 00:50:51.415 align:middle line:84%
it was born out of our
spiritual enlightenment.

00:50:51.415 --> 00:50:52.517 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:50:52.517 --> 00:50:53.584 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: And it's part
of our platform today.

00:50:53.584 --> 00:50:54.585 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:50:54.585 --> 00:50:55.353 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: And we make
a huge difference,

00:50:55.353 --> 00:50:56.687 align:middle line:90%
we make a huge difference.

00:50:56.687 --> 00:50:58.723 align:middle line:84%
In America, for example, we
are allowed the green party

00:50:58.723 --> 00:50:59.824 align:middle line:90%
to be more representative.

00:50:59.824 --> 00:51:00.658 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:51:00.658 --> 00:51:01.726 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Which it cannot today.

00:51:01.726 --> 00:51:03.194 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: No.

00:51:03.194 --> 00:51:07.865 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel that -- well, how do
you feel, the youth that showed

00:51:07.865 --> 00:51:12.336 align:middle line:84%
up with an open and pure
heart to these various events

00:51:12.336 --> 00:51:15.806 align:middle line:84%
around the Middle East over
the last couple of years,

00:51:15.806 --> 00:51:19.443 align:middle line:84%
how do you think they felt
once it became co-opted by,

00:51:19.443 --> 00:51:21.412 align:middle line:90%
again, the extremists?

00:51:21.412 --> 00:51:23.881 align:middle line:84%
I mean what's happening,
what's brewing now?

00:51:23.881 --> 00:51:27.752 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: I think there is a
lot of anger against that.

00:51:27.752 --> 00:51:31.756 align:middle line:84%
I mean I know in Tunis, for
example, you have a coalition

00:51:31.756 --> 00:51:35.526 align:middle line:84%
of moderate Muslims, more
democratically oriented Muslims.

00:51:35.526 --> 00:51:36.928 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:51:36.928 --> 00:51:39.463 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: And the second or so are
coming together to going back

00:51:39.463 --> 00:51:42.934 align:middle line:84%
to the street and asking
for the original version

00:51:42.934 --> 00:51:44.869 align:middle line:84%
of the revolution,
the Arab Spring,

00:51:44.869 --> 00:51:48.673 align:middle line:84%
which was the establishment
of a more inclusive democracy.

00:51:48.673 --> 00:51:49.774 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:51:49.774 --> 00:51:51.042 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Of course, in
Egypt that has happened,

00:51:51.042 --> 00:51:52.743 align:middle line:84%
millions of people
went to the streets,

00:51:52.743 --> 00:51:55.980 align:middle line:84%
especially young people saying,
no, we want a real democracy.

00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:58.216 align:middle line:84%
Now it's complex, we
don't know what the nature

00:51:58.216 --> 00:52:02.153 align:middle line:84%
that is going on, you know, use
that to create a dictatorship

00:52:02.153 --> 00:52:03.020 align:middle line:90%
or not, we don't know.

00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:03.988 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: We don't know, right.

00:52:03.988 --> 00:52:05.456 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: But the fact
is, I believe,

00:52:05.456 --> 00:52:07.758 align:middle line:84%
and this is that
second wave thing,

00:52:07.758 --> 00:52:09.560 align:middle line:84%
it's happening all
over the world.

00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:10.962 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:52:10.962 --> 00:52:14.265 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: People are saying that
old song, this land is my land,

00:52:14.265 --> 00:52:16.500 align:middle line:84%
that's what they're saying,
this land is our land

00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:19.871 align:middle line:84%
and it is sacred and it's a
manifestation of the Divine,

00:52:19.871 --> 00:52:22.373 align:middle line:84%
it's the body of
the Divine, it's --

00:52:22.373 --> 00:52:24.542 align:middle line:84%
we are going to take
care of the earth.

00:52:24.542 --> 00:52:27.945 align:middle line:84%
And people are arising in the
Middle East, they're arising

00:52:27.945 --> 00:52:29.313 align:middle line:90%
in France, for example.

00:52:29.313 --> 00:52:30.414 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:52:30.414 --> 00:52:32.984 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: In America --
the number of nonprofits

00:52:32.984 --> 00:52:37.288 align:middle line:84%
in the last 10 years
have gone up by millions,

00:52:37.288 --> 00:52:38.689 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of them
are young people.

00:52:38.689 --> 00:52:39.857 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes, very much so.

00:52:39.857 --> 00:52:41.792 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Yes, they're
saying let's get involved,

00:52:41.792 --> 00:52:44.228 align:middle line:84%
protecting animals,
protecting the environment,

00:52:44.228 --> 00:52:47.331 align:middle line:84%
working for justice,
working to free prisoners.

00:52:47.331 --> 00:52:53.337 align:middle line:84%
I mean nonprofits have increased
by millions and that's in Africa

00:52:53.337 --> 00:52:55.139 align:middle line:90%
and America, everywhere.

00:52:55.139 --> 00:52:57.375 align:middle line:84%
That says we need to
notice that phenomena,

00:52:57.375 --> 00:52:59.410 align:middle line:84%
something is happening
in the world.

00:53:00.811 --> 00:53:03.047 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yesterday when we were
speaking off camera you told me

00:53:03.047 --> 00:53:05.650 align:middle line:84%
about a young couple that came
into the Olive Branch Center.

00:53:05.650 --> 00:53:09.053 align:middle line:84%
First of all, tell us about
the Olive Branch Center,

00:53:09.053 --> 00:53:12.556 align:middle line:84%
and then tell us about this
young couple, because it really,

00:53:12.556 --> 00:53:14.458 align:middle line:84%
it was proof of something
larger,

00:53:14.458 --> 00:53:15.860 align:middle line:90%
this whole comment they made.

00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:18.829 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Yes, yes, that was a very
sweet story, a very sweet story.

00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:23.134 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Olive Branch Center
is a center that was co-founded

00:53:23.134 --> 00:53:25.870 align:middle line:84%
by my wife, Jessie Thompson
[assumed spelling], and myself,

00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:28.639 align:middle line:84%
and we both wanted to create
a center in Charlotte,

00:53:28.639 --> 00:53:34.211 align:middle line:84%
North Carolina, to promote the
coming together of spirituality

00:53:34.211 --> 00:53:36.881 align:middle line:84%
with solidarity and
social justice,

00:53:36.881 --> 00:53:39.884 align:middle line:84%
to promote that marriage, that
Andrew Harvey speaks about,

00:53:39.884 --> 00:53:41.285 align:middle line:90%
Matthew Fox and so many others.

00:53:41.285 --> 00:53:42.520 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: So we have different
programs and we publish

00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:49.193 align:middle line:84%
and we teach and we do campuses,
we invite people, like Andrew

00:53:49.193 --> 00:53:52.763 align:middle line:84%
and Matthew Fox and others
to come and speak there.

00:53:52.763 --> 00:53:54.665 align:middle line:84%
But that story was
so fascinating

00:53:54.665 --> 00:53:56.701 align:middle line:84%
because I was staying,
working late,

00:53:56.701 --> 00:54:00.338 align:middle line:84%
and then I heard a
knock on the door.

00:54:00.338 --> 00:54:05.076 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I looked and I
saw this couple of young people,

00:54:05.076 --> 00:54:07.445 align:middle line:84%
and they were very young,
probably in their 20s,

00:54:07.445 --> 00:54:11.582 align:middle line:84%
and they just looked wonderful,
and energy and excitement and,

00:54:11.582 --> 00:54:13.384 align:middle line:84%
you know, and I opened it --
I said, how can I help you?

00:54:13.384 --> 00:54:15.920 align:middle line:84%
They said, oh, we just saw
the name, Olive Branch Center,

00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:17.154 align:middle line:84%
and we wanted to know
what's that about?

00:54:17.154 --> 00:54:19.023 align:middle line:90%
I said, sure, come in.

00:54:19.023 --> 00:54:21.659 align:middle line:84%
So I came in and I gave
them my minute speech

00:54:21.659 --> 00:54:25.763 align:middle line:84%
around the importance of
spirituality and solidarity

00:54:25.763 --> 00:54:29.400 align:middle line:84%
and social justice and
inclusion to come more together,

00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:30.801 align:middle line:84%
and they looked at
me and they said

00:54:30.801 --> 00:54:34.305 align:middle line:84%
with these bright beautiful
eyes, and they said,

00:54:34.305 --> 00:54:39.210 align:middle line:84%
you mean it wasn't like that or
it's not something like this?

00:54:39.210 --> 00:54:40.378 align:middle line:90%
Of course, I mean it was

00:54:40.378 --> 00:54:43.247 align:middle line:84%
like why are you telling
me this new kind of --

00:54:43.247 --> 00:54:45.583 align:middle line:84%
yes, of course, I
mean I never expected.

00:54:45.583 --> 00:54:48.753 align:middle line:84%
They go [inaudible]
relationship of my life.

00:54:48.753 --> 00:54:50.354 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Isn't that
how it's always been?

00:54:50.354 --> 00:54:52.156 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Exactly, and how
it supports everybody,

00:54:52.156 --> 00:54:54.191 align:middle line:84%
and that is how it's
supposed to be.

00:54:54.191 --> 00:54:57.194 align:middle line:84%
They said we are spiritual,
and telling me about involved

00:54:57.194 --> 00:54:59.430 align:middle line:84%
in this and that, and
we expect to be involved

00:54:59.430 --> 00:55:00.798 align:middle line:90%
and our friends are involved.

00:55:00.798 --> 00:55:03.067 align:middle line:84%
And I said thank you, and I
said to them, you know, what,

00:55:03.067 --> 00:55:06.670 align:middle line:84%
coming from Lebanon the
children of the war thank you

00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:08.806 align:middle line:84%
because you are the
answer of their prayer.

00:55:08.806 --> 00:55:12.309 align:middle line:84%
They have prayed for you, they
have prayed for people like you

00:55:12.309 --> 00:55:16.013 align:middle line:84%
who will make the stand for
peace, who will make the stand

00:55:16.013 --> 00:55:18.983 align:middle line:84%
with the courage
and the passion,

00:55:18.983 --> 00:55:20.351 align:middle line:90%
and that you are heroes.

00:55:20.351 --> 00:55:23.621 align:middle line:84%
So I was able to really honor
them, but I was very touched

00:55:23.621 --> 00:55:25.356 align:middle line:90%
by their response, very touched.

00:55:25.356 --> 00:55:26.557 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes, let's talk

00:55:26.557 --> 00:55:27.691 align:middle line:84%
about Adam Bucko [assumed
spelling] for a moment?

00:55:27.691 --> 00:55:29.360 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we'll have him in
the studio here one day.

00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:30.728 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Oh, that would
be wonderful.

00:55:30.728 --> 00:55:33.998 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So tell us about him,
an interesting young man?

00:55:33.998 --> 00:55:35.933 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Fascinating
young man, fascinating.

00:55:35.933 --> 00:55:40.337 align:middle line:84%
I met him actually at a retreat
that Andrew Harvey organized

00:55:40.337 --> 00:55:42.206 align:middle line:84%
in Chicago around
sacred activism,

00:55:42.206 --> 00:55:43.574 align:middle line:90%
so he was teaching there.

00:55:43.574 --> 00:55:48.712 align:middle line:84%
And Adam Bucko came
and spoke and ...

00:55:48.712 --> 00:55:50.881 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Tell us who he is
and a bit about his work?

00:55:50.881 --> 00:55:56.454 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Yes, he's a young man
who grew-up in Eastern Europe

00:55:56.454 --> 00:56:03.060 align:middle line:84%
and then who came to the
States and ended by founding

00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:07.198 align:middle line:84%
or co-founding and organization
called Reciprocity that works

00:56:07.198 --> 00:56:12.403 align:middle line:84%
with homeless or
challenged young people,

00:56:12.403 --> 00:56:15.339 align:middle line:84%
but what is also very
interesting about his work is

00:56:15.339 --> 00:56:17.441 align:middle line:84%
that he takes -- he works
with these young people

00:56:17.441 --> 00:56:22.480 align:middle line:84%
to encourage them and
support them to discover how,

00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:25.316 align:middle line:84%
what is their passion and
vision to serve the world.

00:56:25.316 --> 00:56:28.219 align:middle line:84%
So it's not only how are
we going to help you,

00:56:28.219 --> 00:56:33.157 align:middle line:84%
but how are you going to find
your passion to help the world?

00:56:33.157 --> 00:56:34.558 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:56:34.558 --> 00:56:37.161 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: And then he trains people
in sacred spiritual activism,

00:56:37.161 --> 00:56:40.097 align:middle line:84%
so he trains a lot of these
young people, so it's like it's

00:56:40.097 --> 00:56:43.367 align:middle line:84%
that circle of everyone
is called to serve,

00:56:43.367 --> 00:56:45.102 align:middle line:84%
no one is just on
the receiving end.

00:56:45.102 --> 00:56:47.705 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: He was in his 20s
when he started this?

00:56:47.705 --> 00:56:49.173 align:middle line:90%
He's quite young, maybe 30?

00:56:49.173 --> 00:56:50.941 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Yes, I would think so,
I can't tell you, but he's ...

00:56:50.941 --> 00:56:51.742 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: A young guy,
he's very young.

00:56:51.742 --> 00:56:52.676 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: ...

00:56:52.676 --> 00:56:53.377 align:middle line:84%
he's very young,
a very young guy.

00:56:53.377 --> 00:56:54.745 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Very passionate.

00:56:54.745 --> 00:56:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: And what is beautiful
about his story that touched me

00:56:56.480 --> 00:57:01.085 align:middle line:84%
so profoundly, you know, he
went to India I think on his way

00:57:01.085 --> 00:57:04.288 align:middle line:84%
to the States or something
like that, and he speaks

00:57:04.288 --> 00:57:10.161 align:middle line:84%
about one day he looked, he
saw the face of a young woman

00:57:10.161 --> 00:57:17.201 align:middle line:84%
that was in tremendous pain
and suffering extremely,

00:57:17.201 --> 00:57:21.505 align:middle line:84%
and he saw her there and
he reached out to her.

00:57:21.505 --> 00:57:23.207 align:middle line:90%
But he said that when he came

00:57:23.207 --> 00:57:27.411 align:middle line:84%
to the States I mean this
was the land of opportunity,

00:57:27.411 --> 00:57:29.880 align:middle line:84%
so we can come to the
States thinking, oh,

00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:31.549 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to create
a fortune, you know?

00:57:31.549 --> 00:57:32.349 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:57:32.349 --> 00:57:33.117 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: I'm going to like ...

00:57:33.117 --> 00:57:34.218 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: That's number one.

00:57:34.218 --> 00:57:35.419 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: ...

00:57:35.419 --> 00:57:37.187 align:middle line:84%
become the ultimate
self-made person, you know?

00:57:37.187 --> 00:57:40.958 align:middle line:84%
But Adam, and who is smart, who
is energetic, was passionate,

00:57:40.958 --> 00:57:46.530 align:middle line:84%
said what guided was the
face of that woman I saw,

00:57:46.530 --> 00:57:49.099 align:middle line:84%
that's what became
my north star,

00:57:49.099 --> 00:57:52.770 align:middle line:84%
and then organized
his whole life.

00:57:52.770 --> 00:57:55.673 align:middle line:84%
That was an angel, and see
this is something we forget

00:57:55.673 --> 00:57:59.877 align:middle line:84%
sometimes, that angels can
appear as beautiful visions

00:57:59.877 --> 00:58:03.314 align:middle line:84%
of light or beautiful mountains,
I mean angels can appear

00:58:03.314 --> 00:58:07.818 align:middle line:84%
in that, but of course
when angels appear as those

00:58:07.818 --> 00:58:13.724 align:middle line:84%
who are most suffering among
us and who are awakening us

00:58:13.724 --> 00:58:15.793 align:middle line:90%
and awaken us to action.

00:58:15.793 --> 00:58:21.265 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And you talk about
how you've seen the destitute

00:58:21.265 --> 00:58:24.268 align:middle line:84%
praying, please,
help, please, help.

00:58:24.268 --> 00:58:25.636 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes.

00:58:25.636 --> 00:58:27.705 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: But you realized that
that was very empowering for you

00:58:27.705 --> 00:58:31.642 align:middle line:84%
to realize you're
part of the Divine,

00:58:31.642 --> 00:58:33.410 align:middle line:90%
that they're praying for.

00:58:33.410 --> 00:58:34.712 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Yes.

00:58:34.712 --> 00:58:38.749 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: To and for, the help
has to come from among us,

00:58:38.749 --> 00:58:41.585 align:middle line:84%
the charity toward each
other, the enlightenment,

00:58:41.585 --> 00:58:44.088 align:middle line:84%
the assistance to
find our own truth.

00:58:44.088 --> 00:58:45.155 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: Right.

00:58:45.155 --> 00:58:46.423 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: From one to
the other, that's ...

00:58:46.423 --> 00:58:48.892 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: And working to end
all of this extreme power

00:58:48.892 --> 00:58:51.161 align:middle line:84%
and the extreme suffering
that --

00:58:51.161 --> 00:58:54.531 align:middle line:84%
you know, what really struck
me as a metaphor that I use

00:58:54.531 --> 00:58:59.570 align:middle line:84%
in my teaching, it's about
six people stuck in a room

00:58:59.570 --> 00:59:02.573 align:middle line:84%
that was burning and there
was one way out, which is one

00:59:02.573 --> 00:59:05.042 align:middle line:84%
of these '60s windows
that is up there?

00:59:05.042 --> 00:59:05.976 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:59:05.976 --> 00:59:07.344 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: And nobody
can reach to it,

00:59:07.344 --> 00:59:11.882 align:middle line:84%
so everybody huddled together
and one person climbs on all

00:59:11.882 --> 00:59:15.686 align:middle line:84%
of them and gets to the window,
and they say go get help,

00:59:15.686 --> 00:59:17.254 align:middle line:84%
you know, we're going to
help you get up there.

00:59:17.254 --> 00:59:20.224 align:middle line:84%
And so the person gets out of
the window and he goes out,

00:59:20.224 --> 00:59:21.925 align:middle line:84%
when he goes out
he sees the city

00:59:21.925 --> 00:59:24.361 align:middle line:84%
with its lights and
so on and so on.

00:59:24.361 --> 00:59:27.531 align:middle line:84%
And after, and he was hungry, he
gets a good hamburger, whatever,

00:59:27.531 --> 00:59:31.468 align:middle line:84%
or maybe a vegetarian
meal, and but then forgets

00:59:31.468 --> 00:59:33.604 align:middle line:84%
about the people,
forgets that they,

00:59:33.604 --> 00:59:35.773 align:middle line:84%
it's on their backs
that he got here.

00:59:35.773 --> 00:59:38.542 align:middle line:84%
And then he might go and be
a lector and do meditation

00:59:38.542 --> 00:59:42.546 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, but he forgets
that he wouldn't be here.

00:59:42.546 --> 00:59:46.684 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that every
one of us who is privileged,

00:59:46.684 --> 00:59:49.353 align:middle line:84%
we got there on the
back of those people,

00:59:49.353 --> 00:59:52.322 align:middle line:84%
they are the one
who brought us here.

00:59:52.322 --> 00:59:56.760 align:middle line:84%
I am one of them, I just have
-- happen to have more money

00:59:56.760 --> 01:00:00.364 align:middle line:84%
and more education and more
-- acquired some skills,

01:00:00.364 --> 01:00:04.368 align:middle line:84%
but I'm one of them, I need
to go back to that room

01:00:04.368 --> 01:00:07.871 align:middle line:84%
to end the fire because
if it wasn't for them none

01:00:07.871 --> 01:00:09.373 align:middle line:90%
of us would have come out.

01:00:09.373 --> 01:00:12.476 align:middle line:84%
I mean look at the
workers, the teachers ...

01:00:12.476 --> 01:00:12.976 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: True.

01:00:12.976 --> 01:00:13.644 align:middle line:90%
>> CS: ...

01:00:13.644 --> 01:00:14.978 align:middle line:90%
all of whom made us.

01:00:14.978 --> 01:00:20.217 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I put my own, but I am
at the top of the pyramid,

01:00:20.217 --> 01:00:22.619 align:middle line:90%
on the backs who got me here.

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:25.055 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yes, what a
beautiful metaphor.

01:00:25.055 --> 01:00:27.324 align:middle line:84%
We only have a minute or
so left, what is the thing

01:00:27.324 --> 01:00:29.526 align:middle line:84%
that gives you the
greatest amount of hope

01:00:29.526 --> 01:00:33.197 align:middle line:84%
that the situation we're in,
sitting on this precipice,

01:00:33.197 --> 01:00:36.366 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, on a number of
levels, that we are going

01:00:36.366 --> 01:00:40.938 align:middle line:84%
to break-through and clearly
make it to the other side?

01:00:40.938 --> 01:00:45.309 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Well, I don't know,
I don't know if we can know

01:00:45.309 --> 01:00:46.877 align:middle line:84%
if we're going to make
it to the other side,

01:00:46.877 --> 01:00:52.182 align:middle line:84%
but what gives me a lot
of hope is that we --

01:00:52.182 --> 01:00:55.285 align:middle line:84%
there is a great reformation
in our spirituality happening

01:00:55.285 --> 01:00:57.154 align:middle line:84%
in our mind toward
love and action.

01:00:57.154 --> 01:00:58.555 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

01:00:58.555 --> 01:01:01.625 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: And that, if we keep on
investing in that and teaching

01:01:01.625 --> 01:01:05.262 align:middle line:84%
that and teaching meditation
and action, love and action,

01:01:05.262 --> 01:01:08.365 align:middle line:84%
spirituality and action,
there are so many people

01:01:08.365 --> 01:01:11.535 align:middle line:84%
who are spiritual, or of faith
that is very loving faith,

01:01:11.535 --> 01:01:12.870 align:middle line:90%
that can make the difference.

01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And that can save us, but the
question is will we invest

01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:16.907 align:middle line:90%
in that?

01:01:16.907 --> 01:01:17.908 align:middle line:90%
Will we go fully in that?

01:01:17.908 --> 01:01:19.209 align:middle line:84%
It is coming out,
it is burgeoning,

01:01:19.209 --> 01:01:21.044 align:middle line:90%
the second layer is coming out,

01:01:21.044 --> 01:01:24.648 align:middle line:84%
but the question is will we
respond to it and invest in that

01:01:24.648 --> 01:01:27.351 align:middle line:84%
and start teaching and
writing about it and speaking

01:01:27.351 --> 01:01:29.119 align:middle line:90%
about it and making it happen?

01:01:29.119 --> 01:01:32.289 align:middle line:84%
And I think if it happens
it can shift the trajectory

01:01:32.289 --> 01:01:32.990 align:middle line:90%
of our world.

01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:34.625 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes, yes, indeed.

01:01:34.625 --> 01:01:37.194 align:middle line:84%
Oh, it's such a pleasure
just spending a little bit

01:01:37.194 --> 01:01:38.028 align:middle line:90%
of time with you.

01:01:38.028 --> 01:01:40.030 align:middle line:90%
What a gracious and wise being.

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:41.665 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much for your care.

01:01:41.665 --> 01:01:42.800 align:middle line:84%
>> CS: Thank you
for having me here.

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:44.334 align:middle line:90%
It's been a pleasure.

01:01:44.334 --> 01:01:47.204 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: To become engaged
in love and action you need

01:01:47.204 --> 01:01:49.873 align:middle line:84%
to look no further than
what engages your heart.

01:01:49.873 --> 01:01:51.208 align:middle line:90%
To help where help is needed is

01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:52.709 align:middle line:84%
within the reach
of every one of us.

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:55.479 align:middle line:84%
