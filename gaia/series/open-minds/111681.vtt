>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Throughout my life

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.280 align:middle line:10%
I've been fascinated with
the phenomena of past lives

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.210 align:middle line:10%
and what happens between lives.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.200 align:middle line:10%
My research began with
author Ruth Montgomery.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.220 align:middle line:84%
But since her time, many
other brilliant people

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.610 align:middle line:84%
have entered this field,
including Michael Newton, who

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.240 align:middle line:84%
spent 50 years of his
life regressing people

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.810 align:middle line:84%
to learn about what happens
beyond the physical.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Michael Lindemann,
along with his wife,

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.270 align:middle line:90%
continue this exploration.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And he's here with us today
to speak about their findings

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.090 align:middle line:84%
in past life and
between life phenomena.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.270 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHAEL LINDEMANN:
Very happy to be here.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we talk
about Michael Newton

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.790 align:middle line:84%
because this is really a
huge influence on your work.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.870 align:middle line:84%
You're a devotee of
Michael Newton's work,

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.820 align:middle line:84%
and I know he's very
highly regarded,

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.380 align:middle line:90%
an elderly gentleman now.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.130 align:middle line:84%
Who knows, maybe one day we
can have him on the show, too.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.630 align:middle line:84%
But in the interim,
what we'd like

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.379 align:middle line:84%
to do is find out,
because you're actually

00:01:17.379 --> 00:01:19.150 align:middle line:84%
in the field
practicing as well, I

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.150 align:middle line:84%
wanted to find out what
kind of turned you-- you

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.441 align:middle line:90%
had a whole other career going.

00:01:22.441 --> 00:01:24.080 align:middle line:84%
What turned you
in this direction?

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know
your wife was very

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.510 align:middle line:84%
ensconced in regression
therapy, hypnosis, and so forth.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.299 align:middle line:90%
But what about you?

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:32.840 align:middle line:10%
>>LINDEMANN: Well,
I think in a sense

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.280 align:middle line:10%
it's just part of my
personal evolution, really.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.520 align:middle line:84%
My first exposure to
the idea of past lives

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.650 align:middle line:84%
came when I was in
my early 20s, when

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.190 align:middle line:84%
I became associated with
a spiritual teacher who

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.620 align:middle line:84%
had an eastern orientation
and obviously told

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.160 align:middle line:84%
us, all his students, that
reincarnation was a fact,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.332 align:middle line:84%
and that we had been
here many times before,

00:01:58.332 --> 00:02:00.665 align:middle line:84%
and that that was all part
of our spiritual progression.

00:02:00.665 --> 00:02:03.900 align:middle line:84%
That was a very interesting
idea to me at that time.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And so for a while,
it was simply

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.810 align:middle line:90%
a part of my spiritual belief.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.350 align:middle line:84%
Now I graduated out of that
spiritual belief system

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.750 align:middle line:90%
at a certain point in my life.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.560 align:middle line:84%
But I continued
to be interested,

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.150 align:middle line:84%
because I was also doing a form
of psychological counseling

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.391 align:middle line:84%
that drew heavily on
the idea of past lives.

00:02:28.391 --> 00:02:30.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've
heard of something called

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.290 align:middle line:84%
psychosynthesis, but that
was what I was practicing

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.600 align:middle line:90%
when I was in my 20s and 30s.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And psychosynthesis is
a very interesting form

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.440 align:middle line:84%
of psychological therapy,
but interestingly, it

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.912 align:middle line:84%
has its roots in Tibetan
mysticism, Tibetan Buddhism.

00:02:47.912 --> 00:02:49.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us a
little more about it.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.610 align:middle line:10%
>>LINDEMANN: Well,
it was invented

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.270 align:middle line:10%
by a guy who trained as a
psychoanalyst with Sigmund

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.730 align:middle line:10%
Freud, a man named
Roberto Assagioli.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.860 align:middle line:10%
He was an Italian, and he was
a very brilliant therapist.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.120 align:middle line:10%
And after doing his time
in standard psychoanalysis,

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.280 align:middle line:10%
he began to realize
that there had

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.860 align:middle line:10%
to be other dimensions
to the human psyche

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.510 align:middle line:10%
and how it is that we behave,
and the ideas that we have,

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.690 align:middle line:10%
and so forth.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And at the same
time, he was becoming

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:30.470 align:middle line:84%
a very advanced student of
this body of literature that

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.670 align:middle line:84%
is associated with a
teacher who is known

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.930 align:middle line:90%
to many as simply The Tibetan.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.780 align:middle line:84%
You've probably heard of this
guy, a guy named Djwhal Khul.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And he is the voice
behind the work that

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.185 align:middle line:90%
is attributed to Alice Bailey.

00:03:44.185 --> 00:03:46.900 align:middle line:10%
Now Alice Bailey wrote
a vast literature,

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.760 align:middle line:10%
huge, gigantic
spiritual literature.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.420 align:middle line:10%
Pretty hard stuff to read.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.640 align:middle line:10%
But when I was younger and more
ambitious, I read a lot of it.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And I learned
along the way, as I

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.210 align:middle line:84%
was learning to practice
psychosynthesis,

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.690 align:middle line:84%
I learned that Assagioli
had drawn a lot of his ideas

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.230 align:middle line:84%
from the teachings of The
Tibetan and Alice Bailey.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.280 align:middle line:84%
And so I began to have an
esoteric, exoteric combination

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.620 align:middle line:90%
in my work and thinking.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.977 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It makes sense
Tibetan Buddhism would take you

00:04:15.977 --> 00:04:17.810 align:middle line:84%
into the realms of
reincarnation, obviously.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Absolutely.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's just
part of the fabric that

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.670 align:middle line:90%
would have to be included.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:22.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Absolutely.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.840 align:middle line:84%
And what was interesting
was that apart from sort

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.180 align:middle line:84%
of the spiritual aspects
of reincarnation,

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.520 align:middle line:84%
Roberto Assagioli
brought reincarnation

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.420 align:middle line:90%
into the therapeutic zone.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And psychosynthesis assumes
that we have past lives,

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.960 align:middle line:84%
and that working with past
lives is part of the healing

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.199 align:middle line:90%
therapeutic process.

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:46.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: At this
point in your life,

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.670 align:middle line:84%
when you were still
a youngster, did

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.290 align:middle line:84%
you do some of your own
past life exploration?

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDEMANN: I did some, but
to be honest, not very much.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.820 align:middle line:84%
I did, however, have a
couple of regressions.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.871 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One of the
things I was noticing in

00:04:58.871 --> 00:05:01.370 align:middle line:84%
the book you have right in front
of you, "Journey of Souls,"

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.570 align:middle line:90%
from Michael Newton.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:04.960 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't going
in this direction

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.970 align:middle line:84%
initially either, until he
had a particular client who

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.570 align:middle line:84%
was having this severe chronic
pain down the right-hand side

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.380 align:middle line:90%
of his body, as I recall.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And when he started working
with him through hypnosis, boom,

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.310 align:middle line:84%
this other incarnation as a
World War I soldier popped up.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.810 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:21.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: That's right.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:22.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is that right?

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: That is correct.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:23.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And so that started,
really, his curiosity

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.500 align:middle line:84%
as to, hmm, how much
of what I'm seeing

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.040 align:middle line:84%
by way of pain and
dysfunction is actually

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.300 align:middle line:84%
coming from another
time long forgotten?

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.649 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about you
picking up on that thread.

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:37.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Right.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, I should
say that my wife was ahead

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.790 align:middle line:90%
of me on this.

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.280 align:middle line:84%
My wife trained in
regression therapy.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.630 align:middle line:84%
She is a clinical hypnotherapist
and has been in practice

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:49.900 align:middle line:90%
for over 20 years.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And she trained in
regression therapy

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.820 align:middle line:84%
as part of her early
training, so began

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:59.190 align:middle line:84%
doing regressions when
she was in her early 40s,

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.100 align:middle line:84%
and has been doing them from
time to time ever since.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:06.520 align:middle line:84%
Now when she and I
began to work together,

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.964 align:middle line:84%
I had to do some catching up,
because although I was well

00:06:09.964 --> 00:06:11.630 align:middle line:84%
familiar with the
concept of past lives,

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.580 align:middle line:84%
I had not done any work in
the therapeutic modality

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:16.820 align:middle line:90%
for a long time.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.290 align:middle line:84%
But she was doing that,
and still does do that.

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:21.910 align:middle line:84%
So that introduced
me to the idea

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.880 align:middle line:84%
that we can regress
people into past lives

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.670 align:middle line:90%
for therapeutic purposes.

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:30.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So once you started
in the use of hypnosis

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.970 align:middle line:84%
and past life therapy,
tell us, maybe,

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.930 align:middle line:84%
some of the more interesting
first cases that really

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.080 align:middle line:84%
startled you into
understanding, aha,

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.606 align:middle line:84%
I'm really on the
right path here.

00:06:41.606 --> 00:06:43.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDEMANN: Well,
I can recall a case,

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.724 align:middle line:84%
for example-- this was
one that my wife had,

00:06:45.724 --> 00:06:47.140 align:middle line:84%
but we talked about
it extensively

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.180 align:middle line:84%
because it was really
quite a surprise.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:55.690 align:middle line:84%
A person had come to her
with some intractable issues

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:57.780 align:middle line:90%
about his self- concept.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And he was very
unhappy with not being

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.030 align:middle line:84%
able to achieve some
things in his life,

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.470 align:middle line:84%
and not feeling like he was
really grounded in this life.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:13.820 align:middle line:84%
He was feeling like some
big piece was missing.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And in the course of
their work, Deborah

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.940 align:middle line:84%
decided to do a
past life regression

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:20.560 align:middle line:90%
to see what he came up with.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And what he came up
with was a life when

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.050 align:middle line:90%
he was a Civil War soldier.

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:34.220 align:middle line:84%
And in doing this past life
regression, part of his issues

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.660 align:middle line:84%
had been that he was
having difficulty

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.950 align:middle line:90%
with relationships with women.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out that what had
really occurred in this Civil

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:48.900 align:middle line:84%
War life was that he had
gone away to war, leaving

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:53.010 align:middle line:84%
a wife and young child,
and had been killed,

00:07:53.010 --> 00:08:00.120 align:middle line:84%
and had never resolved that loss
and that broken relationship.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And so, although this has
obviously happened to millions

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:04.899 align:middle line:84%
upon millions upon
millions of people,

00:08:04.899 --> 00:08:06.940 align:middle line:84%
we don't know how many
people are carrying around

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:10.989 align:middle line:84%
that kind of broken relationship
line that needs, at some point,

00:08:10.989 --> 00:08:11.530 align:middle line:90%
to be healed.

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:15.320 align:middle line:84%
But in this instance, my wife
was able to work with him

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:19.590 align:middle line:84%
and literally heal
that broken piece

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:22.050 align:middle line:90%
in his life in one session.

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And after that it
became much, much easier

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:29.280 align:middle line:84%
and more comfortable for him to
have a committed relationship.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have
experienced quite a lot

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.510 align:middle line:84%
of these myself, but also
assisted others in this.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:37.539 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
talking about this,

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:42.070 align:middle line:84%
it also brings to mind someone I
know very well who was speaking

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:46.500 align:middle line:84%
with the being that I'm
particularly-- that I respect,

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.990 align:middle line:90%
that I deal a lot with.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And they were talking
to this being,

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.400 align:middle line:84%
and they said, well, you
have a difficult path here.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And she asked why,
and they said, well,

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:58.520 align:middle line:84%
you have one foot in your past
life, your last one, and one

00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:59.520 align:middle line:90%
in this one.

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And as it turns out, they were
very delicate in handling her,

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:04.360 align:middle line:84%
much more so than
I'd seen before.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And as it turned out, she was
in very difficult circumstance

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:13.662 align:middle line:84%
where the family had
starved and frozen to death,

00:09:13.662 --> 00:09:15.120 align:middle line:84%
and she was the
last one remaining.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.110 align:middle line:84%
So she took her own
life, and so hadn't

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.800 align:middle line:90%
completed its natural process.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And she was still here
in this incarnation

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:27.080 align:middle line:90%
looking for her family.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And like she said
in the beginning,

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:33.070 align:middle line:84%
I felt no connection with
anyone, no passion, no purpose

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:34.200 align:middle line:90%
for being here.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.590 align:middle line:90%
She felt none of that.

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:38.422 align:middle line:84%
Is that similar to how this man
was feeling, just disconnected?

00:09:38.422 --> 00:09:39.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Yes.

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:40.920 align:middle line:90%
I would say yes, exactly.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.430 align:middle line:90%
As if displaced, out of time.

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:43.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:46.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDEMANN: Not in the
right time frame of his life.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And yes, and when we can resolve
these broken or uncompleted

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.320 align:middle line:84%
issues, then the
person realizes they

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:58.030 align:middle line:84%
can close the door on that past
which has had a grip on them,

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:00.150 align:middle line:90%
and be much more in the present.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:01.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:02.420 align:middle line:90%
OK, now.

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:07.140 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to some of the common
experience that people have.

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know "Journey
of Souls" is full of this,

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.960 align:middle line:90%
chapter by chapter.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.880 align:middle line:84%
It talks about a
commonality of experience.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.670 align:middle line:84%
Let's start with what people--
what they first experience when

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:21.030 align:middle line:84%
they find themselves out
of the body, and let's

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:24.510 align:middle line:84%
say, particularly, if
it's a surprise, as

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:28.310 align:middle line:84%
in a very quick, unexpected
ending, as opposed

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:31.970 align:middle line:84%
to being elderly and a very
natural transition, where you

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.216 align:middle line:90%
can become acculturated to it.

00:10:34.216 --> 00:10:35.590 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk
about what happens.

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:37.700 align:middle line:84%
So you're slammed
out of the body.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.130 align:middle line:10%
You've died suddenly.

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:42.172 align:middle line:10%
>>LINDEMANN: And of course,
this was something discovered

00:10:42.172 --> 00:10:44.380 align:middle line:10%
not only by Michael Newton,
but by some of the people

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.841 align:middle line:10%
who preceded him
such as Brian Weiss.

00:10:46.841 --> 00:10:47.840 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Raymond Moody.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:48.230 align:middle line:10%
>>LINDEMANN: Raymond Moody.

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:49.420 align:middle line:10%
Thank you.

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:53.050 align:middle line:10%
The idea is that
when we die, there

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:59.550 align:middle line:10%
is a process of dying,
which helps us to identify

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:06.760 align:middle line:10%
that an entity that remains
alert and aware and cognitive

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:11.382 align:middle line:10%
as the body itself is
dying and becoming inert.

00:11:11.382 --> 00:11:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there are
many out of body experiences

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:15.950 align:middle line:84%
that happen in hospital
settings and so forth

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:17.730 align:middle line:90%
that give us this clue.

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:22.410 align:middle line:84%
But Michael Newton, basically,
also finds from the work

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:24.870 align:middle line:84%
that he does with
hypnotic regression,

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:31.740 align:middle line:84%
that when the person dies,
depending on whether they're

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:33.650 align:middle line:84%
relatively new at this,
or whether they're

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:36.010 align:middle line:84%
old timers and old
hands at it, there

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:37.940 align:middle line:84%
could be a couple of
different reactions.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:42.520 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, if it's very sudden
and the soul is a young soul,

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:45.620 align:middle line:84%
meaning they haven't had many,
many incarnations, that it may

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:48.160 align:middle line:84%
come as a bit of a
surprise, a bit of a shock,

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.930 align:middle line:84%
because first of
all, they recognize,

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:52.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm still completely alert,
I'm still completely aware.

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:56.900 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not in the
same place I was.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.200 align:middle line:90%
My orientation is different.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.750 align:middle line:84%
There's a body on the floor
there, or on the table,

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:02.490 align:middle line:90%
or whatever happened.

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:08.650 align:middle line:84%
I am now separate from that, and
so there's a sense of surprise

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:12.030 align:middle line:84%
and almost disbelief
that they can

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:15.110 align:middle line:84%
be separated from everything
they thought was them,

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:19.836 align:middle line:84%
and yet still be absolutely full
of who they are, fully alert.

00:12:19.836 --> 00:12:21.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Quite a
surprise to find out.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:24.140 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in one of his
regressions, the guy said,

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:24.875 align:middle line:90%
I'm alive.

00:12:24.875 --> 00:12:25.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Exactly.

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:26.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm alive.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.330 align:middle line:90%
What a surprise.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:28.690 align:middle line:90%
What a surprise.

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And so now, when a
person is used to that,

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.210 align:middle line:84%
let's say, when
they're a bit more

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:38.530 align:middle line:84%
conscious in their
revolution, when they've

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:42.060 align:middle line:84%
gone through the process of
death and rebirth many times,

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.930 align:middle line:84%
dozens of times,
perhaps, for them

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.790 align:middle line:90%
it's not a surprise at all.

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:50.130 align:middle line:84%
For them, when they die,
they go, oh great, I'm dead.

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:51.520 align:middle line:90%
Let's get on with it.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.060 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.180 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of his
clients even said that.

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:55.980 align:middle line:90%
Let's get on with it, OK?

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.350 align:middle line:84%
Because that kind
of a soul that's

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:01.320 align:middle line:84%
had some experience
in this recognizes

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.690 align:middle line:90%
that this is just the next step.

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:08.950 align:middle line:84%
We have stepped out of
the incarnation pattern,

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:10.990 align:middle line:84%
and we are now on
the other side,

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:13.980 align:middle line:84%
where there are all kinds
of other opportunities.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:21.280 align:middle line:84%
But the person remains intact as
an entity, as a consciousness.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And so they even, if they
wish, can imagine themselves,

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:28.620 align:middle line:84%
or view themselves,
or even appear

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:34.400 align:middle line:84%
to others as still a human type
of form, although obviously not

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.510 align:middle line:90%
purely physical.

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:38.160 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be much
more of an ethereal form

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.830 align:middle line:90%
or an energetic form.

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:43.560 align:middle line:84%
But they still have
an identity that even

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:48.290 align:middle line:90%
has some body features to it.

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:53.400 align:middle line:84%
So that would be the first step,
is that they've left the body,

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.330 align:middle line:84%
but they've recognized
that they are still

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.762 align:middle line:90%
completely intact as an entity.

00:13:57.762 --> 00:13:59.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now that's
the pro, the old pro

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:03.232 align:middle line:84%
who's been around the block a
few times, many incarnations.

00:14:03.232 --> 00:14:04.690 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
continue from there,

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:06.110 align:middle line:90%
but let's go back for a moment.

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:10.550 align:middle line:84%
For people where it's more of
a newbie experience, let's talk

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:14.210 align:middle line:84%
about the phenomenon that
occurs right around that, too,

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:17.430 align:middle line:84%
with the presence of ones
they're familiar with

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:19.180 align:middle line:90%
and have love bonds with.

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:20.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Exactly.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:25.170 align:middle line:84%
It seems as if, for
people-- particularly people

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:28.640 align:middle line:84%
who are new to this or who
might be alarmed by it--

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:32.180 align:middle line:90%
there is lots of support.

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:36.270 align:middle line:84%
Various forms of comfort
and support are presented.

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:41.510 align:middle line:84%
If the person is looking at
their body, their dead body

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:45.770 align:middle line:84%
on the table there,
and feels alarmed,

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:51.870 align:middle line:84%
they may feel very quickly
some enveloping energies

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:55.380 align:middle line:84%
of love and comfort
and support that

00:14:55.380 --> 00:15:00.330 align:middle line:84%
begin to shift them into
changing their orientation away

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.970 align:middle line:84%
from the body and toward
a different direction.

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:07.440 align:middle line:84%
They might see a lighted
tunnel, for example,

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.570 align:middle line:84%
or a lighted space that
they can walk into.

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:12.080 align:middle line:90%
They might simply feel drawn.

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:15.360 align:middle line:84%
Many feel that when they die,
they are literally pushed out

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.970 align:middle line:84%
of their body and find
themselves above it,

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:22.020 align:middle line:84%
and are then-- as
long as there's

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:25.540 align:middle line:84%
nothing that is holding
them in place-- they

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:29.714 align:middle line:84%
may be drawn very easily and
naturally into the other side.

00:15:29.714 --> 00:15:31.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's where
it's good to have coaxing

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:33.315 align:middle line:90%
from people that look familiar.

00:15:33.315 --> 00:15:34.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Exactly.

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:34.740 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:38.230 align:middle line:84%
Because when a new soul,
or a young soul, let's say,

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:42.070 align:middle line:84%
has this experience,
they might feel

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:44.810 align:middle line:90%
drawn to stay with the body.

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:48.020 align:middle line:84%
They might even feel drawn
to not allow themselves to be

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:50.390 align:middle line:90%
pulled away or drawn away.

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And so they need
coaxing and comforting

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:57.940 align:middle line:84%
and help to feel that
they can leave that,

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:01.230 align:middle line:84%
that that was temporary, that
what's permanent about them is

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:03.670 align:middle line:84%
still with them, they're
still fully there,

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:05.370 align:middle line:90%
and it's OK to move on.

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:10.515 align:middle line:84%
So there's that stage of
needing to comfort and prepare

00:16:10.515 --> 00:16:13.370 align:middle line:84%
and orient the person to
a different way of seeing

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:14.810 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:16.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
commonality, whether it's

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.430 align:middle line:84%
a person who has a lot
of experience with this,

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:23.570 align:middle line:84%
or a newbie, is there
is a being drawn

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:28.000 align:middle line:84%
toward a light, the
layers of light,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.150 align:middle line:84%
sometimes in geometrical
forms or concentric circles.

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:34.485 align:middle line:84%
But it's always a
drawing toward the light.

00:16:34.485 --> 00:16:35.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDEMANN: It
seems to be, yes.

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:39.540 align:middle line:84%
That seems to be one of the
most widely reported features.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.430 align:middle line:84%
Now some people--
it should be noted,

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:45.740 align:middle line:84%
some people mention that they
go through a space of darkness

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.020 align:middle line:90%
on their way to the light.

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:47.280 align:middle line:90%
So you do hear variations.

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, where they'll
see a little dot of light

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:49.320 align:middle line:90%
in the distance.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:49.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Exactly.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:50.250 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:51.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's the tunnel
effect, I believe, right?

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:52.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Exactly.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:53.290 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:53.850 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:57.610 align:middle line:84%
The darkness, if they do
experience it, is not scary.

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:00.539 align:middle line:84%
It's a very warm and embracing
darkness that draws them.

00:17:00.539 --> 00:17:01.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Kind of a void.

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:01.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Yes.

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:04.170 align:middle line:84%
But it does draw them,
again, toward that light

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:05.420 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about.

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And the mature soul, or the
soul that has had experience,

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.010 align:middle line:84%
might find that
they're simply allowed

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:18.990 align:middle line:84%
to proceed into the afterlife
more or less on their own,

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:21.839 align:middle line:84%
as if they know the way, as if
everything's going to be fine,

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:23.170 align:middle line:90%
they've done this before.

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:26.660 align:middle line:84%
If, however, there's
any apprehension,

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:30.010 align:middle line:84%
any worry, any fear,
why then, those others

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:34.170 align:middle line:84%
will come forward to comfort
and orient the person.

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:38.000 align:middle line:84%
Now those others may
be a range of beings.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.780 align:middle line:84%
Some may be deceased
relatives, even

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:45.990 align:middle line:84%
if that relative might also
have reincarnated and be

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:47.005 align:middle line:90%
in material form.

00:17:47.005 --> 00:17:48.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we're
going to go there, too.

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDEMANN: But we'll
come back to that point.

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:50.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We'll
come back to that.

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:51.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDEMANN: But
let's leave that.

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:53.800 align:middle line:84%
That's a complication
we can talk about later.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.160 align:middle line:90%
Deceased relatives can come.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.900 align:middle line:90%


00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:03.070 align:middle line:84%
The person will have a guide who
has been with them for a very

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:05.510 align:middle line:90%
long time, a spiritual guide.

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:10.000 align:middle line:84%
The guide is probably
a human being

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.590 align:middle line:84%
who has been through
many, many lifetimes,

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:16.170 align:middle line:84%
many more than the person
that we're speaking of.

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:19.290 align:middle line:84%
But that person guides
from the standpoint

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:21.750 align:middle line:90%
of knowing the life of a human.

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And so the guide is a
very important friend

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:28.250 align:middle line:84%
to the person who is on
their way to the other side.

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:31.770 align:middle line:84%
Other people or entities
that might be involved

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:35.970 align:middle line:84%
are described as the council of
elders, or the support group.

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And there's also a
group of beings, people,

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.840 align:middle line:84%
that we have probably
been associated with,

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:49.880 align:middle line:84%
our own core group of
people that we have probably

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:53.660 align:middle line:84%
been associated with for
thousands and thousands

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:57.200 align:middle line:84%
of years, many, many,
many lifetimes, souls

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.920 align:middle line:84%
that we might even
have been created

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.630 align:middle line:90%
with as part of one group.

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:02.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, a soul group.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:03.963 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Yes, exactly.

00:19:03.963 --> 00:19:08.320 align:middle line:84%
So that soul group,
then, might be with us

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.301 align:middle line:90%
for virtually eternity.

00:19:10.301 --> 00:19:12.050 align:middle line:84%
They could with us for
thousands of years.

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And we will have had many, many,
many kinds of relationships

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:18.910 align:middle line:84%
again and again and again and
again in the physical plane

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:19.910 align:middle line:90%
with those beings.

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:21.690 align:middle line:90%
And so we will see them as well.

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:24.020 align:middle line:84%
So there's a whole host
of different entities

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:28.230 align:middle line:84%
that might greet us or
be there to support us.

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:31.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I remember
the day my mother died,

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:36.310 align:middle line:84%
I was in the room with her the
final day and holding her hand.

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:38.180 align:middle line:84%
I had my sister
hold her other hand,

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:41.070 align:middle line:90%
and I held my sister's hand.

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:45.200 align:middle line:84%
The way she showed herself
was as a woman of about 19.

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.600 align:middle line:90%
She was very young.

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And she had a circle,
a semicircle of beings

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:52.780 align:middle line:90%
that were all light beings.

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:55.070 align:middle line:84%
They were just-- it was
as though they were white,

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:57.970 align:middle line:84%
and just wearing some
nondescript flowing white

00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:03.830 align:middle line:84%
clothing in a semicircle around
her-- as she was telling me,

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:06.710 align:middle line:84%
you can let me go
now because I'm fine.

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And I felt we couldn't feel
her in the room anymore.

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:11.640 align:middle line:84%
It's as though she had
already left the body,

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:15.250 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to talk about
that, before the heart stopped

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:16.100 align:middle line:90%
beating.

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And because I know a lot of
intuitive people that can see.

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:22.200 align:middle line:84%
I happened to be with
some a couple days later,

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.660 align:middle line:84%
and one of the men said,
oh, it's so interesting.

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:26.490 align:middle line:84%
Your mother's showing
herself same age,

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:29.330 align:middle line:84%
wearing the same little green
t-shirt with the same beings

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:29.970 align:middle line:90%
behind her.

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:33.220 align:middle line:84%
So to me that was validation
that that is where she was.

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And so can you tell
us a little bit

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:38.590 align:middle line:84%
about how some people have
experienced these beings,

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:40.600 align:middle line:84%
explain how they
experience these beings,

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:41.860 align:middle line:90%
this array of beings.

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:44.680 align:middle line:84%
Is that the council of
elders, so to speak?

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDEMANN: Well, it
could be several things.

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:50.780 align:middle line:84%
It can be our soul
group that we're

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:53.270 align:middle line:84%
almost certain to meet
with on the other side

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:55.310 align:middle line:84%
and maybe spend quite
a lot of time with.

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:57.610 align:middle line:84%
It can also be our
council of elders.

00:20:57.610 --> 00:20:59.980 align:middle line:84%
Now the council of
elders is described,

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:04.890 align:middle line:84%
at least by Michael Newton, as
a group of more advanced beings,

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:08.850 align:middle line:84%
sort of like the
chairman of the board

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:11.920 align:middle line:84%
and the board members
who have been watching

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:17.370 align:middle line:84%
over our life for many, many,
many, many, many incarnations.

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:23.482 align:middle line:84%
Those beings may have a kind
of austere quality to them.

00:21:23.482 --> 00:21:24.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: These were austere.

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:25.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Yes.

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:29.950 align:middle line:84%
These beings are not
on the same level

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:31.890 align:middle line:90%
as the person who has passed.

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:35.150 align:middle line:84%
Now their soul group will be
roughly on the same level,

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:37.630 align:middle line:84%
and those people will
be treated as friends.

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And when they get
together, there

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:43.340 align:middle line:84%
might be laughter, there might
be fun, there might be joking,

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:47.200 align:middle line:84%
even, and a lot of other things,
because these people have

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.600 align:middle line:90%
been friends for a long time.

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:53.280 align:middle line:84%
But that other
group is much more

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:57.430 align:middle line:84%
a business-oriented group in
terms of the spiritual business

00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:58.475 align:middle line:90%
of the soul.

00:21:58.475 --> 00:22:00.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's what
it felt like at the time,

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:01.600 align:middle line:90%
in seeing her with them.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.790 align:middle line:84%
She was like a
child amongst them.

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:05.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: That makes sense.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:05.710 align:middle line:90%
It really does.

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:08.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now I would
like to go to-- before we

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:12.977 align:middle line:84%
go to what happens in the life
review and all of that-- well,

00:22:12.977 --> 00:22:14.810 align:middle line:84%
actually, let's go there
now, and then we'll

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:18.070 align:middle line:84%
go to this other subject
of multiple incarnations.

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: OK.

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:23.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, the person
who has passed now

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:27.080 align:middle line:84%
moves into the space
of the other side.

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And there is a kind of a
sequence of things that

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:34.390 align:middle line:90%
apparently need to take place.

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Now it's not clear at all
how much time this takes,

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:40.800 align:middle line:84%
because time on the other
side isn't really time the way

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:41.680 align:middle line:90%
we experience it.

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:45.980 align:middle line:84%
Time here is really
rooted in the physicality

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:46.870 align:middle line:90%
of our existence.

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:50.340 align:middle line:84%
Over there, time is
kind of make believe.

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And so you can use it or
not, whatever's useful.

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:57.980 align:middle line:84%
But when the person passes
over, probably the first group

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:03.790 align:middle line:84%
they meet will be-- if they're
in a state of discomfort

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:06.820 align:middle line:84%
or worry or concern,
then perhaps some

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:11.140 align:middle line:84%
of their soul group will come
forward, meaning the teachers.

00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:13.510 align:middle line:84%
Pardon me-- yes, the
teachers will come forward

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:14.740 align:middle line:90%
to console them.

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:20.180 align:middle line:84%
But once they're past
what we call the entryway,

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:23.922 align:middle line:84%
then they come to meet
with their actual group.

00:23:23.922 --> 00:23:26.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Before we go into
this whole notion of kind

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:30.210 align:middle line:84%
of parallel existences, which
is a little more complex,

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:34.850 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about what happens
most commonly with virtually

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:38.380 align:middle line:84%
everybody that talks about
their between life experience,

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:41.630 align:middle line:84%
and what we commonly refer
to as maybe a life review.

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Who are they meeting with,
and how does that take place?

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Exactly.

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:46.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:49.034 align:middle line:84%
On the topic of life review,
it seems as if-- again, this

00:23:49.034 --> 00:23:50.700 align:middle line:84%
is something that
Michael Newman came up

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:55.770 align:middle line:84%
with-- there maybe actually
two phases to life review. a

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:57.460 align:middle line:84%
But the first phase
certainly happens

00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:00.180 align:middle line:90%
very soon after you arrive.

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And that will happen with
your council of elders.

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And what the life
review is about

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:16.590 align:middle line:84%
is simply to look at how the
person did in their life just

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:21.400 align:middle line:84%
ended with respect to
what they intended to do,

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.760 align:middle line:84%
what they intended
to accomplish.

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:26.450 align:middle line:84%
The assumption there
is that before they

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:31.040 align:middle line:84%
were born into the life just
ended, they made some plans.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.810 align:middle line:90%
They made some agreements.

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:36.140 align:middle line:84%
They might have, for
example, agreed to meet up

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:37.490 align:middle line:90%
and work with certain people.

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:39.690 align:middle line:84%
They might have agreed
to have a relationship

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:43.370 align:middle line:84%
with a certain soul that
was to become their spouse.

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:46.620 align:middle line:84%
They might have agreed to
work on certain lessons

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:47.710 align:middle line:90%
in that life.

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:51.200 align:middle line:84%
Each one of us apparently
does that each and every

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.370 align:middle line:90%
incarnation.

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:54.740 align:middle line:84%
So when they are through
with that incarnation

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:57.100 align:middle line:84%
and they arrive on the other
side, one of the things

00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:01.770 align:middle line:84%
that the soul-- that their
group of elders wants to do

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:06.000 align:middle line:84%
is simply reflect with them
on, how did you do you?

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.430 align:middle line:84%
Did you actually manage to
work on those areas of weakness

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:14.050 align:middle line:84%
and trouble that you
had talked about before?

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And to some extent,
the answer will be yes,

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:19.340 align:middle line:90%
but it's probably yes, but.

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:22.720 align:middle line:84%
Because for almost
all of us, apparently,

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.290 align:middle line:84%
when we get to
the other side, we

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:28.360 align:middle line:84%
recognize that if we had been
able to lead an absolutely

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.390 align:middle line:84%
perfect life, we could
have gotten more done,

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:32.160 align:middle line:84%
we could have been
distracted less,

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:34.640 align:middle line:84%
we could've gotten
off on fewer tangents,

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:37.850 align:middle line:84%
and we would have, perhaps,
been a little further along

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:39.450 align:middle line:90%
by the time we ended this life.

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:43.550 align:middle line:84%
But whatever of that
may or may not be true,

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:45.950 align:middle line:84%
one thing that seems
to always be true

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:51.930 align:middle line:84%
is that the council of elders
is extremely gentle, extremely

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:53.910 align:middle line:84%
understanding,
extremely supportive.

00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:56.180 align:middle line:90%
There is no criticism.

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:58.222 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: People are so
terrified of that notion.

00:25:58.222 --> 00:25:59.096 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Exactly.

00:25:59.096 --> 00:26:00.170 align:middle line:90%
There is no criticism.

00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:02.140 align:middle line:90%
There is no condemnation.

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:07.360 align:middle line:84%
There is only the
supportive suggestions

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:12.140 align:middle line:84%
to help a person understand,
in as gentle a way as possible,

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:15.860 align:middle line:84%
what else is possible, what they
may want to work on next time,

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:17.589 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:26:17.589 --> 00:26:18.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:20.954 align:middle line:84%
Now let's-- if we can
delve a little bit to this,

00:26:20.954 --> 00:26:22.870 align:middle line:84%
because we just teased
it a little while ago--

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:26.860 align:middle line:84%
the notion of parallel realities
or parallel lifetimes within

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:29.340 align:middle line:90%
a given incarnation.

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:30.885 align:middle line:84%
That's-- yeah,
let's talk about it.

00:26:30.885 --> 00:26:32.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDEMANN: Well,
you know, this

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:36.680 align:middle line:84%
is an area that I think was a
big surprise to Michael Newton.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And I should probably
say for listeners

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:44.710 align:middle line:84%
that aren't aware of this,
that Michael Newton has gleaned

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:49.410 align:middle line:84%
all the information in his books
by regressing his subjects.

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:51.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he was
a skeptic to start.

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDEMANN: He was most
definitely a skeptic.

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:57.160 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he had no spiritual
convictions whatsoever right

00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:59.380 align:middle line:84%
as he went into this
work, as he began

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:02.086 align:middle line:90%
his career in hypnotherapy.

00:27:02.086 --> 00:27:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And he was using regression
the way a lot of other people

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:05.350 align:middle line:90%
use regression.

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:06.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Get rid of pain.

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:07.495 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Exactly.

00:27:07.495 --> 00:27:09.990 align:middle line:84%
Just to take them back in
this lifetime to earlier,

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:12.820 align:middle line:90%
when things can be released.

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:15.220 align:middle line:84%
So when he began
to encounter people

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:18.650 align:middle line:84%
who had these, literally,
past life experiences,

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:20.940 align:middle line:84%
he had to catch
up, and he really

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:23.320 align:middle line:90%
was quite stunned at first.

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:25.510 align:middle line:84%
But one of the very
big surprises that

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:29.320 align:middle line:84%
did come up after he'd
been at this awhile

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:32.320 align:middle line:84%
is that apparently,
if a soul wishes,

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:37.230 align:middle line:84%
a soul can express itself
in two different lifetimes

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:39.070 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:41.900 align:middle line:84%
Now one thing that he
says is always true

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:45.720 align:middle line:84%
is that the soul always
divides its presence

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:47.865 align:middle line:84%
between the other
side and this side.

00:27:47.865 --> 00:27:49.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's where I
was going to go next with it.

00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:52.300 align:middle line:84%
So go ahead and give us the full
complement of information here.

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDEMANN: Well, again,
apparently the soul

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:58.990 align:middle line:84%
can divide its presence
in whatever way

00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:01.750 align:middle line:84%
seems to be helpful for
the spiritual progress

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:02.500 align:middle line:90%
of the individual.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:06.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can be in association
with, or--yes, as a soul,

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:09.025 align:middle line:84%
penetrate more than one vehicle
at one time, so to speak.

00:28:09.025 --> 00:28:09.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Exactly.

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:13.150 align:middle line:84%
So first of all we know
one part of the soul

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:16.130 align:middle line:84%
always remains anchored
on the other side.

00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:19.280 align:middle line:90%
That part never changes.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that part
is-- when we say anchored,

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:27.090 align:middle line:84%
that part is directly connected
to the source of souls,

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:31.040 align:middle line:84%
the source, capital S. We can
call it God, whatever you like.

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:35.960 align:middle line:84%
But that soul, then, can
also project its self

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:38.300 align:middle line:84%
into the physical plane, which
is what normally happens.

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.260 align:middle line:84%
For you, for me, as
we're sitting here,

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:42.480 align:middle line:84%
we have a soul,
obviously, that is

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:45.300 align:middle line:90%
projected into our physicality.

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:48.410 align:middle line:84%
But our soul-- your
soul, for example,

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:53.360 align:middle line:84%
might also be projected
into another body

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:58.190 align:middle line:84%
somewhere else in this same
time frame on this same planet,

00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:00.160 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps even
somewhere else entirely.

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:01.560 align:middle line:90%
We don't know that.

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.960 align:middle line:84%
Now this is an area
that I haven't honestly

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:08.940 align:middle line:84%
given a huge amount of thought
to because it's rather more

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:12.610 align:middle line:84%
esoteric than a lot of the
other parts of the picture that

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:16.224 align:middle line:84%
have immediate
therapeutic help or use.

00:29:16.224 --> 00:29:17.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:23.080 align:middle line:84%
However, I'm wondering if
the other version of you

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:27.170 align:middle line:84%
in the given time frame is also
impacting-- because it's all

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:30.060 align:middle line:84%
coming back to the same
source-- is also impacting

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:31.620 align:middle line:90%
what's going on in that life.

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:34.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm curious about it
on a variety of levels,

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:39.600 align:middle line:84%
and also feelings that one
might have where you can almost

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:41.234 align:middle line:90%
feel this other place.

00:29:41.234 --> 00:29:42.525 align:middle line:90%
And you know it's not the past.

00:29:42.525 --> 00:29:44.190 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't feel
like the past as we

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:46.310 align:middle line:90%
speak of time, or the future.

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:48.220 align:middle line:84%
But it's so very
real, as though it's

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:49.970 align:middle line:90%
a place you spend a lot of time.

00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDEMANN: Well, that
could be true, certainly,

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:58.650 align:middle line:84%
if your soul, for example
has projected equally

00:29:58.650 --> 00:30:04.680 align:middle line:84%
into two different physical
lives in this time.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:06.310 align:middle line:84%
The life that is
sitting in that chair

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:09.860 align:middle line:84%
there might very well,
on a subliminal level,

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:13.080 align:middle line:84%
become aware from time to
time of things happening

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:16.310 align:middle line:84%
in the other life
because, of course,

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:19.330 align:middle line:84%
it is being mediated
through the one soul.

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:22.567 align:middle line:84%
So that may actually raise
interesting questions

00:30:22.567 --> 00:30:23.650 align:middle line:90%
in the mind of the person.

00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:24.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, it does.

00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:26.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDEMANN: You know, where
did this idea come from?

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:27.660 align:middle line:90%
Why do I know these things?

00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Why do I feel at home in a
completely different culture?

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:31.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:33.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDEMANN: And all
those kinds of questions

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:36.184 align:middle line:84%
may, indeed, reflect
back to that point.

00:30:36.184 --> 00:30:37.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And in
my own case, I've

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:40.079 align:middle line:84%
had experiences-- one
particular experience-- I don't

00:30:40.079 --> 00:30:41.370 align:middle line:90%
need to go into the experience.

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:45.080 align:middle line:84%
But it lasted for
many, many years,

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:51.596 align:middle line:84%
where I was in connection with
this other person right here.

00:30:51.596 --> 00:30:53.720 align:middle line:84%
It would kind of come in
and then it would go away.

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:56.180 align:middle line:84%
But it was a parallel
reality in which

00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:58.569 align:middle line:84%
I was totally existing with
this other person right here.

00:30:58.569 --> 00:30:59.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Interesting.

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:01.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Myself, another
version of me, or maybe

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:02.640 align:middle line:90%
me with another person.

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.840 align:middle line:84%
I started thinking,
can that maybe also

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:06.930 align:middle line:90%
be kind of like timeline jumps?

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:09.480 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe another
density, part of you

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:12.790 align:middle line:84%
that's in another dimensional
aspect or something?

00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:14.050 align:middle line:90%
I love all this.

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:15.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I said
that to begin with.

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:18.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm very intrigued with all
the different iterations

00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:21.750 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves that could
be impacting this moment.

00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:22.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Sure.

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:26.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, and as we've both
said, it's quite possible

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:30.990 align:middle line:84%
that a parallel life is
impacting this life right now.

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:33.590 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't know for sure
if that's true of me.

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:36.494 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any particular
inclinations that that is true.

00:31:36.494 --> 00:31:37.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
probably most people

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:39.868 align:middle line:84%
don't mention that when
they're in the therapy.

00:31:39.868 --> 00:31:42.021 align:middle line:84%
So we can consider
it more esoteric

00:31:42.021 --> 00:31:44.020 align:middle line:84%
and just something to
ponder than anything else.

00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:44.895 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Exactly.

00:31:44.895 --> 00:31:47.400 align:middle line:84%
But what it does do,
is it does indicate

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:50.590 align:middle line:84%
that the soul has many
prerogatives that it

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:51.980 align:middle line:90%
may choose if it wishes.

00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:52.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:53.100 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:56.440 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about
a challenge situation.

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And I know there was one
in "Journey of Souls"

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:01.180 align:middle line:90%
that was interesting.

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:05.630 align:middle line:84%
A person, a woman,
who was going back

00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:09.770 align:middle line:84%
to the source of pain,
pain enough that--

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:12.740 align:middle line:84%
in a previous life, as a
man, had committed suicide.

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:15.700 align:middle line:84%
This person had become really
quite abusive in their ways,

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:19.710 align:middle line:84%
using other people, trying to
manipulate money and people

00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:23.320 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, and came to a
dead end and killed themselves.

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:27.280 align:middle line:84%
This person then came into
a female body thinking,

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:31.210 align:middle line:84%
I'll try to manage this with
maybe more subtlety, in a more

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:33.000 align:middle line:84%
feminine way, but
was still displaying

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.320 align:middle line:84%
all of the masculine traits,
and just bludgeoning people

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:38.870 align:middle line:90%
in business deals and so forth.

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk a little bit
about this progression?

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:44.310 align:middle line:84%
That opens up two or three
different little kettle of fish

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:45.150 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:47.840 align:middle line:84%
One is, continuation
of behaviors

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:49.750 align:middle line:84%
even though we have
made an agreement

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:53.000 align:middle line:84%
to do things differently, and
what that normally results in.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Two, sexually, when people
migrate from one sex to another

00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:01.550 align:middle line:84%
not having really experienced
that sex a lot of the time.

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:03.301 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about a
couple of those issues.

00:33:03.301 --> 00:33:03.966 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: OK.

00:33:03.966 --> 00:33:06.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a lot of
pieces to what you just said.

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:06.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There are
a lot of pieces.

00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:09.280 align:middle line:84%
Go for it, whichever
ones are fun for you.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDEMANN: Well, first of
all, on the question of sex

00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:20.120 align:middle line:84%
and sexual orientation,
Michael Newton's subjects have

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:27.020 align:middle line:84%
indicated to him that most
souls have a preference for one

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:31.700 align:middle line:84%
sex or the other, and
given that preference,

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:36.750 align:middle line:84%
are likely to show up as one
sex or the other about 75%

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:37.490 align:middle line:90%
of the time.

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:41.530 align:middle line:84%
So for example, your soul might
lean toward being a woman.

00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:43.640 align:middle line:84%
My soul might lean
toward being a man.

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.462 align:middle line:84%
But it's almost
certain that if you've

00:33:45.462 --> 00:33:46.920 align:middle line:84%
been around a few
lifetimes, you've

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:49.115 align:middle line:84%
probably shown up as a
man, and the same for me,

00:33:49.115 --> 00:33:50.180 align:middle line:90%
shown up as a woman.

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:54.240 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I can kind of feel
at an almost cellular level,

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:57.395 align:middle line:84%
I can imagine the
possibility of having been

00:33:57.395 --> 00:34:00.600 align:middle line:90%
a woman some lifetimes ago.

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
anyone that is somewhat

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.330 align:middle line:84%
mature in their
spiritual outlook

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:09.929 align:middle line:84%
doesn't probably have too much
difficulty imagining that.

00:34:09.929 --> 00:34:12.969 align:middle line:84%
So that's one
level, where we can

00:34:12.969 --> 00:34:15.882 align:middle line:84%
be one kind or the
other from time to time.

00:34:15.882 --> 00:34:18.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Depending on the
experience we want to have

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:19.690 align:middle line:84%
and what we're looking
to learn, right?

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:20.565 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Exactly.

00:34:20.565 --> 00:34:21.600 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:28.389 align:middle line:84%
So beyond that the soul
has the possibility

00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:30.550 align:middle line:90%
of being in two bodies at once.

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:37.610 align:middle line:84%
It has the possibility
of choosing how it will

00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:40.370 align:middle line:90%
express itself, man or woman.

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
what I was referring

00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:44.310 align:middle line:84%
to in that instance is,
the person thought, OK, I

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:47.020 align:middle line:84%
can remedy this kind of
bullying, abusive behavior

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:50.780 align:middle line:84%
in one lifetime by trying
it again as a woman.

00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:53.779 align:middle line:84%
But the same traits were coming
up again, even as a woman.

00:34:53.779 --> 00:34:54.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Right.

00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:57.570 align:middle line:84%
Michael Newton has
found many clients

00:34:57.570 --> 00:35:02.880 align:middle line:84%
who clearly had an issue
in a past life as a man,

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:05.960 align:middle line:84%
and came forward
as a woman, finding

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:08.980 align:middle line:84%
that, in some respect or other,
they still had the same issue.

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Now for example, you mentioned
a case where, as a man,

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:15.192 align:middle line:90%
he was very abusive.

00:35:15.192 --> 00:35:16.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: More in
a business sense.

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:18.920 align:middle line:84%
A bully, really
manipulating the system,

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:20.175 align:middle line:90%
and killed himself ultimately.

00:35:20.175 --> 00:35:21.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Exactly.

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:22.591 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wasn't
working out for him.

00:35:22.591 --> 00:35:24.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDEMANN: He was so
unhappy, as he put it,

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:27.530 align:middle line:84%
he was so unhappy with
what his life had become.

00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And then, apparently,
that same soul

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:34.320 align:middle line:84%
came forward to express
itself as a woman.

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:38.880 align:middle line:84%
Now one of the things that souls
sometimes do--and people do

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:41.730 align:middle line:84%
explain this to Michael
Newton again and again--

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:49.440 align:middle line:84%
is that if, for example, a soul
in a man's body has very bad

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:53.790 align:middle line:84%
relations with women, or
is abusive toward women,

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:58.250 align:middle line:84%
or in some sense feels that they
have been harmful toward women

00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:02.400 align:middle line:84%
or unjust toward women,
that same soul might choose

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:07.440 align:middle line:84%
to incarnate as a woman in
order to experience how it was,

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.810 align:middle line:84%
as a woman, to be
treated that way.

00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And they might
even put themselves

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:15.530 align:middle line:84%
into a life situation
where they are

00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:17.690 align:middle line:84%
purposely, at least
from the soul's point

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:22.000 align:middle line:84%
of view, purposely
disadvantaged or purposely

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.410 align:middle line:84%
mistreated so that they
can have that experience.

00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:32.940 align:middle line:84%
It's not a matter of redressing
bad behavior so much.

00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:36.770 align:middle line:84%
It's not a matter of
punishment or balancing karma

00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:40.780 align:middle line:84%
so much as it is simply
teaching the soul what

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:46.400 align:middle line:84%
it means to be fully
balanced and fully human

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:51.200 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of being fully
expressive of the full range

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:54.289 align:middle line:84%
of human possibilities,
and fully accepting

00:36:54.289 --> 00:36:55.830 align:middle line:84%
of that range of
human possibilities.

00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:58.090 align:middle line:84%
So for example, a man
doesn't look down on a woman

00:36:58.090 --> 00:36:59.214 align:middle line:90%
or vice versa.

00:36:59.214 --> 00:36:59.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's not something that is
being meted from the outside.

00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:08.980 align:middle line:84%
It's the soul's choice to
allow itself to have experience

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:12.115 align:middle line:84%
that, as you said, creates
a deeper understanding.

00:37:12.115 --> 00:37:12.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Exactly.

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:13.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:14.878 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was having
a conversation

00:37:14.878 --> 00:37:18.060 align:middle line:84%
of this nature with someone
recently, and they were saying,

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:20.860 align:middle line:84%
well, how is it that when
you go to the other side,

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:24.050 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't be judged--
very Christian--

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:26.050 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't be judged
and there might not

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:28.940 align:middle line:84%
be some kind of period of
punishment of some kind?

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, if
a soul has good guidance

00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:35.640 align:middle line:84%
and a soul has any desire toward
its own refinement and wisdom,

00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:37.770 align:middle line:84%
it will choose a
balancing experience.

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:40.429 align:middle line:84%
And one might say, if you
want to look at punishment,

00:37:40.429 --> 00:37:41.970 align:middle line:84%
they're certainly
going to experience

00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:43.660 align:middle line:90%
the other end of the spectrum.

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:45.955 align:middle line:84%
And it's just
self-balancing, so to speak.

00:37:45.955 --> 00:37:46.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Exactly.

00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:48.560 align:middle line:90%
It is self-balancing.

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:53.910 align:middle line:84%
Part of it is certainly governed
by the soul's own judgment

00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:55.005 align:middle line:90%
and own wisdom.

00:37:55.005 --> 00:37:58.260 align:middle line:84%
But I think Newton also
makes it very clear

00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:03.290 align:middle line:84%
that if the soul is, let's say,
resisting its lessons-- which

00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:11.790 align:middle line:84%
souls do, no question-- gentle
persuasion can be applied.

00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:15.980 align:middle line:84%
Not coercion, because
souls are allowed to mess

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:18.120 align:middle line:90%
up as long as they want to.

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:19.230 align:middle line:90%
If a soul needs--

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:20.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Time is infinite.

00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:21.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Time is infinite.

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:22.610 align:middle line:90%
Precisely.

00:38:22.610 --> 00:38:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And it seems as if one thing
that everyone agrees on is,

00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:31.960 align:middle line:90%
compassion is also infinite.

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:36.560 align:middle line:84%
There is no end to the
compassion, to the patience,

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:41.800 align:middle line:84%
and to the allowing from
those on the other side who

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:44.080 align:middle line:90%
are managing and helping us.

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:46.800 align:middle line:84%
They will give us
every opportunity,

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:50.349 align:middle line:84%
literally forever, it would
seem, although luckily it

00:38:50.349 --> 00:38:51.890 align:middle line:84%
doesn't take forever
for most people.

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:58.520 align:middle line:84%
But it seems as if it is in
the nature of how we relate

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:02.700 align:middle line:84%
to the system, if you will, the
spiritual system in which we

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:04.050 align:middle line:90%
are a part.

00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:09.080 align:middle line:84%
It seems as if we are always
given every opportunity

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:12.530 align:middle line:84%
to learn our lessons at our
own rate in our own way.

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And if we are fearful,
if we are resistant,

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:19.090 align:middle line:84%
if we're just plain immature
and selfish, which is also

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:22.530 align:middle line:84%
part of the picture, we
are given all the time

00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:24.710 align:middle line:90%
we need to work that stuff out.

00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, to me,
it's so important for people,

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:30.080 align:middle line:84%
for humanity, to
understand that.

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And instead of the notion
of a punishing god that

00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:37.730 align:middle line:84%
is going to create a hellish
experience for a person somehow

00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:40.820 align:middle line:84%
somewhere, it's so
much more-- to me

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:45.550 align:middle line:84%
it always made more sense that
there was this notion of grace

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:48.277 align:middle line:90%
and balance and infinite time.

00:39:48.277 --> 00:39:49.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDEMANN: Well,
I absolutely agree.

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:55.750 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I think a punishing
god-- which, of course,

00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:59.390 align:middle line:84%
many, many people
believe is out there--

00:39:59.390 --> 00:40:01.890 align:middle line:84%
I believe a punishing
god is a very small god.

00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:03.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:03.520 align:middle line:90%
Small g.

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDEMANN: That's
the kind of god

00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:09.390 align:middle line:84%
that small-minded people imagine
because all they can imagine

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:16.030 align:middle line:84%
is a world in which
it's basically

00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:19.620 align:middle line:84%
dog-eat-dog survival
of the fittest,

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:23.910 align:middle line:84%
and a very kind of--
oh, I don't know.

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:26.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All religions are
fraught with this judgment

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:26.940 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:27.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:27.880 align:middle line:90%
Most religions.

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:27.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Yes.

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:29.310 align:middle line:90%
The idea that god judges us.

00:40:29.310 --> 00:40:32.650 align:middle line:84%
Now of course, the
scriptures have

00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:34.590 align:middle line:84%
a lot of judgment
language in them

00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:36.150 align:middle line:90%
depending on how you read them.

00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:38.970 align:middle line:84%
But I think that as we
become more spiritually

00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:44.790 align:middle line:84%
mature as a people, as a planet,
we find more and more people

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:49.760 align:middle line:84%
recognizing that it would be
in the nature of a big god,

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:53.100 align:middle line:84%
of a truly wonderful
and magnificent and--

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:54.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Source, god, whatever.

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:56.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDEMANN: The
kind of god that we

00:40:56.180 --> 00:41:00.200 align:middle line:84%
would like to believe in
is a god whose compassion

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:03.170 align:middle line:84%
is absolute, whose
love is absolute,

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:08.340 align:middle line:84%
and where the concept
of unconditionality

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:11.667 align:middle line:84%
goes far beyond anything
we imagine in our heads.

00:41:11.667 --> 00:41:12.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And for me, even as a
little child, that's the way

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:15.840 align:middle line:90%
I tended to go on it.

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:18.390 align:middle line:84%
When I heard about some of
the really judgemental stuff,

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:21.370 align:middle line:84%
by four, five, six years old
in Sunday school, it's really,

00:41:21.370 --> 00:41:23.150 align:middle line:90%
I can't go there.

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:24.180 align:middle line:90%
We just know innately.

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:25.930 align:middle line:90%
And children do know innately.

00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:28.280 align:middle line:84%
There is a sense of
a fairness, I think,

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:29.765 align:middle line:90%
built into most human beings.

00:41:29.765 --> 00:41:31.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDEMANN: Well,I
think so too.

00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:32.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's talk
about where it's not.

00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:34.872 align:middle line:84%
There are some human beings
where it's not built in,

00:41:34.872 --> 00:41:36.830 align:middle line:84%
where there are extreme
acts of cruelty because

00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:40.130 align:middle line:84%
of a lack of understanding,
extreme maybe

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:42.970 align:middle line:90%
immaturity, whatever caused it.

00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And I want to go there, because
according to Michael Newton's

00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:48.340 align:middle line:84%
work, there's a little
different process that

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:50.490 align:middle line:84%
happens if you
have just completed

00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:53.490 align:middle line:84%
acts of extreme cruelty
to others on this planet.

00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:55.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Well, that is true.

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think before
I even address

00:41:57.610 --> 00:42:02.140 align:middle line:84%
that, I want to say one more
thing that Newton talks about,

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:04.400 align:middle line:90%
which leads right into this.

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And that is that every
time a person shows up,

00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:13.740 align:middle line:84%
like you or me, in this
life, what has happened is,

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:18.530 align:middle line:84%
a soul has mated with
a brain, all right?

00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And though the soul has
a wonderfully expansive

00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:29.040 align:middle line:84%
and, let's say,
semi-enlightened--

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:31.910 align:middle line:84%
even an immature soul
has, relatively speaking,

00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:35.560 align:middle line:84%
a semi-enlightened view of the
way things are and ought to be.

00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:38.360 align:middle line:84%
But when they mate
with a human brain,

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:44.830 align:middle line:84%
they must accommodate all of
the innate physical drives

00:42:44.830 --> 00:42:46.870 align:middle line:84%
and programming that
are part of that brain.

00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:47.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All the animal inputs.

00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:48.954 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDEMANN: All
the animal stuff

00:42:48.954 --> 00:42:54.360 align:middle line:84%
which is absolutely build in and
inescapable in the physicality

00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:55.124 align:middle line:90%
of our existence.

00:42:55.124 --> 00:42:56.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, that is true.

00:42:56.290 --> 00:42:59.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDEMANN: And
so every soul is

00:42:59.330 --> 00:43:04.890 align:middle line:84%
in the business of managing
the sometimes unruly, sometimes

00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:09.100 align:middle line:84%
even crazy impulses
of the human brain

00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:11.407 align:middle line:84%
and its associated
body and its drives.

00:43:11.407 --> 00:43:12.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Emotions and so forth.

00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:13.906 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: All that stuff.

00:43:13.906 --> 00:43:14.760 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:21.321 align:middle line:84%
And so each one of us has a kind
of a wrestling match going on

00:43:21.321 --> 00:43:21.820 align:middle line:90%
inside.

00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:23.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thus, duality.

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:24.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Well, yeah.

00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And it is duality in a sense,
in that-- which, by the way,

00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:32.740 align:middle line:84%
we talked a little bit
about Amit Goswami.

00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:34.080 align:middle line:90%
That's something he hates.

00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:35.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, the word duality.

00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDEMANN: They try to get
around it anyway they can.

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:38.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, change the word.

00:43:38.130 --> 00:43:38.900 align:middle line:90%
But yeah.

00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:41.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDEMANN: But in
any case, this idea

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:46.990 align:middle line:84%
that the soul and the brain
have a relationship which

00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:52.920 align:middle line:84%
is more or less well-established
in any given lifetime.

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's
really everything

00:43:55.650 --> 00:44:01.440 align:middle line:84%
the soul can do to simply
hang on and see how it goes.

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:04.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, we had talked
about what happens

00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:12.500 align:middle line:84%
to a person whose brain was,
let's say, unhappy and perhaps

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:15.570 align:middle line:84%
even slightly
deranged, and tended

00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:18.830 align:middle line:84%
toward behavior that was
destructive and unkind

00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:20.310 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:22.760 align:middle line:90%
Where does that leave the soul?

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:30.030 align:middle line:84%
We have a person whose brain
was of the sort that tended

00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:32.304 align:middle line:90%
toward bad behavior, let's say.

00:44:32.304 --> 00:44:34.470 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they were destructive,
maybe they were unkind,

00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:39.760 align:middle line:84%
maybe they were violent, maybe
they harmed other people.

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:45.300 align:middle line:84%
The soul undoubtedly was unhappy
with much of that behavior,

00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:47.390 align:middle line:84%
and the nature of any
soul would be unhappy.

00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:49.410 align:middle line:84%
But that particular
soul may have felt,

00:44:49.410 --> 00:44:50.845 align:middle line:90%
I don't have enough strength.

00:44:50.845 --> 00:44:51.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Enough influence.

00:44:51.970 --> 00:44:52.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDEMANN: I don't
have enough influence.

00:44:52.850 --> 00:44:53.700 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:56.890 align:middle line:84%
I cannot influence
this brain, OK?

00:44:56.890 --> 00:44:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, why did they get that
brain in the first place?

00:44:59.570 --> 00:45:01.530 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't by accident.

00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:03.090 align:middle line:90%
It was chosen.

00:45:03.090 --> 00:45:05.430 align:middle line:84%
Now they may have
simply made a mistake.

00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:10.710 align:middle line:84%
They may have simply
failed to fully appreciate

00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:12.430 align:middle line:84%
what the tendencies
of that brain

00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:15.470 align:middle line:84%
would have led to in the
way of human behavior.

00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:18.700 align:middle line:84%
But in any event, when the
soul was mated with that brain,

00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:23.210 align:middle line:84%
the soul definitely had a
conscious choice in the matter,

00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:25.300 align:middle line:90%
and did take on that brain.

00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:29.480 align:middle line:90%
So the soul is responsible.

00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:34.210 align:middle line:84%
Even if they were riding a
wild horse with no control

00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:38.220 align:middle line:84%
whatsoever, the fact that
they chose into that situation

00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:41.100 align:middle line:84%
without exception-- every
single time they did

00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:46.830 align:middle line:84%
choose it-- that means they are
responsible for what occurred.

00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:54.190 align:middle line:84%
And if that person utilizing
a damaged or unhappy brain

00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:57.810 align:middle line:84%
did terribly destructive
things, well,

00:45:57.810 --> 00:46:03.110 align:middle line:84%
then the soul must
make amends for that.

00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:07.310 align:middle line:84%
But in addition, the soul
might also need repair.

00:46:07.310 --> 00:46:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the
things that seems

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:13.980 align:middle line:84%
to happen almost immediately
when the soul passes

00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:18.020 align:middle line:84%
from the body and
gets to the other side

00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:21.950 align:middle line:84%
is that there will
be a healing process.

00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:24.290 align:middle line:84%
Everyone probably
gets a little bit

00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:27.830 align:middle line:84%
of healing just in the
general nature of things.

00:46:27.830 --> 00:46:31.240 align:middle line:84%
But some souls who come back
after that kind of lifetime,

00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:33.780 align:middle line:84%
where a lot of
damage was done, they

00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:35.540 align:middle line:90%
may spend time in isolation.

00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:38.460 align:middle line:84%
They may spend
time really needing

00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:41.820 align:middle line:84%
a great deal of quiet
time, reflection

00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:46.415 align:middle line:84%
time, and actual repair in order
to be fully functional again.

00:46:46.415 --> 00:46:47.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:51.390 align:middle line:84%
It's not the same kind of gentle
ushering over to Auntie May

00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:52.230 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:54.490 align:middle line:84%
It's just, let's
get on with this.

00:46:54.490 --> 00:46:55.910 align:middle line:90%
Let's get you over here.

00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And again, there is its
own-- there's a grace in that

00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:00.430 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:01.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDEMANN: Oh,
certainly there is.

00:47:01.930 --> 00:47:03.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, it's
not a punishment.

00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:05.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDEMANN: It's not
a punishment at all.

00:47:05.330 --> 00:47:12.390 align:middle line:84%
What is intended is that that
soul, which has now taken on--

00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:16.290 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily by choice, but
because of the circumstances

00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:19.430 align:middle line:84%
they did, in fact,
choose into, they

00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:23.060 align:middle line:84%
have taken on what we
could call-- the shorthand,

00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:24.280 align:middle line:90%
anyway-- bad karma.

00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:26.310 align:middle line:84%
They have got some
damage and they've

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:28.330 align:middle line:84%
got some things that
have to be redressed.

00:47:28.330 --> 00:47:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And so that will be done in a
very loving and very supportive

00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:39.670 align:middle line:84%
environment so that they can
be regenerated and reoriented

00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:43.460 align:middle line:84%
back to the path that they
would prefer to be on.

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:45.670 align:middle line:90%
It takes time sometimes.

00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:47.860 align:middle line:84%
A soul that has been
severely damaged

00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:51.000 align:middle line:84%
by a very, very
violent or bad life

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.050 align:middle line:84%
might need a long, long
time in Earth years

00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:54.120 align:middle line:90%
before they come back.

00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:54.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And one thing you hear about
when it comes to repair

00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:02.270 align:middle line:84%
is that people, some of the
people that he worked with,

00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:04.780 align:middle line:84%
explained it was almost
like they were bathed

00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:09.200 align:middle line:84%
in some kind of a laser
light of energy, color,

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:14.550 align:middle line:84%
and so forth that seemed to
be coming in and lifting,

00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:17.136 align:middle line:84%
elevating, repairing
damage to their being.

00:48:17.136 --> 00:48:18.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Exactly.

00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:22.765 align:middle line:84%
Many kinds of energy that we
might experience as music,

00:48:22.765 --> 00:48:26.000 align:middle line:84%
as warmth, as various
forms of light,

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.024 align:middle line:84%
are utilized on the
other side all the time.

00:48:29.024 --> 00:48:30.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now let's
talk about the cycle

00:48:30.690 --> 00:48:33.242 align:middle line:84%
from beginning to
end, before-- we just

00:48:33.242 --> 00:48:34.950 align:middle line:84%
talked about a little
bit of a debriefing

00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:36.930 align:middle line:90%
after one leaves the body.

00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:39.930 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the process
of what happens before one

00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:41.879 align:middle line:90%
chooses to incarnate again.

00:48:41.879 --> 00:48:42.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Right.

00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:47.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, the person
has gone to the other side

00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:51.660 align:middle line:84%
and has gone through the
stages of being reoriented

00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:55.340 align:middle line:84%
to the other side, has
rejoined their own group

00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:56.450 align:middle line:90%
on the other side.

00:48:56.450 --> 00:49:00.520 align:middle line:84%
Now according to Michael
Newton and his subjects,

00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:03.850 align:middle line:84%
every one of us has
a group of souls

00:49:03.850 --> 00:49:06.900 align:middle line:84%
with whom we've been associated
for a very, very long time.

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And portions of that group
remain on the other side

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:11.050 align:middle line:90%
at any given time.

00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:14.360 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, we're going
to spend time with them.

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:16.460 align:middle line:84%
Some of that time will
simply be rest time.

00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:19.230 align:middle line:90%
Some of it will be study time.

00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:22.070 align:middle line:84%
In the life just
ended, we came up

00:49:22.070 --> 00:49:24.550 align:middle line:84%
against dilemmas
we couldn't solve.

00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:26.390 align:middle line:90%
Every one of us does.

00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And once we get back
to the other side,

00:49:29.130 --> 00:49:32.090 align:middle line:84%
some of what we're
doing is going

00:49:32.090 --> 00:49:34.890 align:middle line:84%
through some of the things
that didn't work out very well,

00:49:34.890 --> 00:49:37.750 align:middle line:84%
some of the mistakes we made,
some of the horrible stuff

00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:38.800 align:middle line:90%
that happened.

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And we want to
repair that stuff.

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:43.160 align:middle line:90%
We want to learn our way.

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:44.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And some people
were traumatized, oftentimes.

00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:45.555 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Exactly.

00:49:45.555 --> 00:49:50.090 align:middle line:84%
So there will be the healing
parts for the trauma.

00:49:50.090 --> 00:49:54.630 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of bad
ideas encountered,

00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:57.190 align:middle line:84%
bad behaviors that
have to be figured out,

00:49:57.190 --> 00:50:02.320 align:middle line:84%
all that comes down to a
period of study and reflection,

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:07.260 align:middle line:84%
which prepares us to
give it another try.

00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:11.600 align:middle line:84%
If the life wasn't perfect,
it's a virtual certainty

00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:12.960 align:middle line:90%
that we're going to go back.

00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:16.030 align:middle line:84%
So the assumption
is that all of us

00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:18.960 align:middle line:84%
are still on the
reincarnational cycle,

00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:21.810 align:middle line:84%
even if our lives
are going very well.

00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:25.030 align:middle line:84%
You might reincarnate
as a teacher.

00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And by that I mean,
as an actual guide.

00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:29.900 align:middle line:90%
But you will still be human.

00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:32.550 align:middle line:84%
You've obviously learned a
bunch of lessons in your life

00:50:32.550 --> 00:50:34.851 align:middle line:90%
and in many lifetimes previous.

00:50:34.851 --> 00:50:37.100 align:middle line:84%
You're not a beginner, and
I'm not a beginner, either.

00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:39.570 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean we're
at the end of the game.

00:50:39.570 --> 00:50:41.480 align:middle line:90%
We have a long way to go.

00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And as we cycle
through these things,

00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:48.420 align:middle line:90%
we get ready for the next round.

00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And so having spent
time with our group,

00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:55.530 align:middle line:84%
we then go back our
council of elders.

00:50:55.530 --> 00:51:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And our council of elders now
wants to-- rather than debrief

00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:04.640 align:middle line:84%
us from last time, they want
to pre-brief us for next time.

00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And so there will be a
whole bunch of things

00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:08.990 align:middle line:90%
that need to be determined.

00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:12.620 align:middle line:84%
First of all, what is the
point of your next life?

00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:15.424 align:middle line:90%
What are you trying to achieve?

00:51:15.424 --> 00:51:16.340 align:middle line:90%
Who do you want to be?

00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:18.480 align:middle line:84%
What would be the
best kind of life

00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:20.600 align:middle line:84%
to help you make
those achievements,

00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:22.500 align:middle line:90%
to accomplish those things?

00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And if that's the life you
want to have, where should be

00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:27.640 align:middle line:90%
and with whom?

00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:31.490 align:middle line:84%
So those questions are all
addressed very methodically,

00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:34.060 align:middle line:90%
if his information is correct.

00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And all of them are meant to
give us the best possible shot

00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:43.720 align:middle line:84%
at actually achieving the
goals we set for ourself when

00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:47.780 align:middle line:84%
we arrive in the planetary
environment again.

00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:51.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Then why the amnesia?

00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:53.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Great question.

00:51:53.690 --> 00:51:57.370 align:middle line:90%
Very irksome, isn't it?

00:51:57.370 --> 00:52:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And by the amnesia, of
course, what we mean is,

00:52:01.290 --> 00:52:07.020 align:middle line:84%
we don't remember, really,
all this stuff that apparently

00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:08.240 align:middle line:90%
happens on the other side.

00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:12.100 align:middle line:84%
When we're here in our
physical incarnation,

00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:15.450 align:middle line:84%
we can only guess
or imagine or hope.

00:52:15.450 --> 00:52:19.820 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a firm
sense of memory.

00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And Michael Newton
says very emphatically,

00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:24.340 align:middle line:90%
that's because of the amnesia.

00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:28.280 align:middle line:90%
The amnesia is there on purpose.

00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:29.660 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's interesting.

00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:36.920 align:middle line:84%
When the soul
arrives in the body

00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:40.510 align:middle line:84%
of a fetus that has
not yet been born,

00:52:40.510 --> 00:52:43.790 align:middle line:90%
the soul still knows who it is.

00:52:43.790 --> 00:52:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And the soul can-- as a soul,
as a conscious soul-- can

00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:53.370 align:middle line:84%
work with the brain of the
fetus in terms of getting itself

00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:54.837 align:middle line:90%
well-established, well set i n.

00:52:54.837 --> 00:52:56.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It can work with
the physiology as well,

00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:59.130 align:middle line:84%
and start directing
the genetic influence.

00:52:59.130 --> 00:53:03.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDEMANN: Yes, it can,
if what is said is true.

00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:07.860 align:middle line:84%
And so up to the point of actual
physical birth, it would seem,

00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:12.800 align:middle line:84%
the soul does know who it
is and what it's about.

00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:16.970 align:middle line:84%
But the soul also
agrees to forget.

00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:21.190 align:middle line:84%
At the point of birth,
the soul forgets,

00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:25.660 align:middle line:84%
because one of the great
challenges and lessons

00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:32.520 align:middle line:84%
of every single lifetime is to
find your way back to the soul

00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:36.300 align:middle line:90%
from a place of not remembering.

00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:40.750 align:middle line:84%
That is an underlying spiritual
challenge and opportunity

00:53:40.750 --> 00:53:42.330 align:middle line:90%
in every single life.

00:53:42.330 --> 00:53:45.012 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be designed
into the project.

00:53:45.012 --> 00:53:46.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I
think another thing

00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:49.440 align:middle line:84%
he mentioned as well is,
it can be a bit of a burden

00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:53.240 align:middle line:84%
to carry around, perhaps,
memory of things that were done

00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:56.320 align:middle line:84%
against one, for example,
that would show up as perhaps

00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:58.460 align:middle line:90%
anger, grudges, and so forth.

00:53:58.460 --> 00:54:01.300 align:middle line:84%
Now it might be buried
in the subconscious mind.

00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:04.390 align:middle line:84%
It might that if we were
stabbed to death, for example,

00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:06.790 align:middle line:84%
you might still have a
little pain in the side.

00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:08.630 align:middle line:84%
But again, to have
full conscious memory

00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:12.019 align:middle line:84%
of that could really skew the
way one went about their lives.

00:54:12.019 --> 00:54:13.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDEMANN: That's
absolutely right.

00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And he does say that
very emphatically,

00:54:16.190 --> 00:54:20.150 align:middle line:84%
that it would be very difficult
to stay focused on this life

00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:23.930 align:middle line:84%
if we had full memory of all
the lives we'd had in the past.

00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:26.880 align:middle line:84%
We might spend a lot of time
wishing we were back being

00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:28.490 align:middle line:90%
somebody big and important.

00:54:28.490 --> 00:54:31.450 align:middle line:84%
Or we might spend a lot
of time resenting people

00:54:31.450 --> 00:54:34.367 align:middle line:84%
who had harmed us in the
past, and not be focused on--

00:54:34.367 --> 00:54:34.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Now.

00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:35.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: The present.

00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:36.290 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:54:36.290 --> 00:54:37.680 align:middle line:90%
So it's very, very important.

00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:42.497 align:middle line:84%
But of course, we know that
those lifetimes do bubble up

00:54:42.497 --> 00:54:44.580 align:middle line:84%
because that's what past
life therapy's all about.

00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:45.538 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:54:45.538 --> 00:54:46.120 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:48.570 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite films
is "Defending Your Life."

00:54:48.570 --> 00:54:50.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDEMANN: Oh,
I love that film.

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:50.710 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely love it.

00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:53.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think it's in
that film where they give them

00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:54.720 align:middle line:84%
a little shot before
they come back.

00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:58.150 align:middle line:90%
Poof, memory all gone.

00:54:58.150 --> 00:54:59.530 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes I confuse that.

00:54:59.530 --> 00:55:01.820 align:middle line:84%
There are three or four of
those films I really like.

00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:05.620 align:middle line:84%
But in that one in particular,
it shows in a comedic way.

00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:08.060 align:middle line:84%
But still, I love
the way Hollywood

00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:12.010 align:middle line:84%
is able to kind of take
very complex themes

00:55:12.010 --> 00:55:13.800 align:middle line:84%
and reduce them to
a simple comedy,

00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:17.237 align:middle line:84%
because actually a lot of
truth comes out in that film.

00:55:17.237 --> 00:55:19.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDEMANN: I think
that film in particular

00:55:19.070 --> 00:55:22.055 align:middle line:84%
did a very, very good job of
exploring some of these issues.

00:55:22.055 --> 00:55:22.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:55:22.930 --> 00:55:23.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDEMANN: I
strongly recommend it.

00:55:23.830 --> 00:55:25.413 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, of
course Meryl Streep

00:55:25.413 --> 00:55:29.420 align:middle line:84%
can do no wrong in real
life, too, I guess, even now.

00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:32.690 align:middle line:84%
On that note, one final
question, because we're

00:55:32.690 --> 00:55:34.090 align:middle line:90%
just about out of time.

00:55:34.090 --> 00:55:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And this has to do with
the human condition.

00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:42.670 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel that-- people
are afraid of dying.

00:55:42.670 --> 00:55:46.020 align:middle line:84%
So there's always
the question, am I

00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:48.320 align:middle line:84%
just embracing this
notion of past lives

00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:51.180 align:middle line:90%
because I'm afraid of death?

00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:52.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Well, of course.

00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And skeptics are sure
to trot that out.

00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:57.580 align:middle line:90%
In fact, they do.

00:55:57.580 --> 00:56:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And in fairness, we can't prove
scientifically that this stuff

00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:04.980 align:middle line:90%
is true yet, not really.

00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:09.860 align:middle line:84%
But there's an awful lot of
mounting evidence, certainly

00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:13.330 align:middle line:84%
evidence for the persistence
of the soul outside the body.

00:56:13.330 --> 00:56:17.215 align:middle line:84%
Going back to the work
that started in 1975

00:56:17.215 --> 00:56:19.090 align:middle line:84%
with the guy whose name
I can never remember.

00:56:19.090 --> 00:56:19.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Raymond Moody.

00:56:19.450 --> 00:56:20.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Raymond Moody.

00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:20.390 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:21.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He's
done amazing work.

00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:21.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: What is that?

00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:23.350 align:middle line:90%
Why can't I remember your name?

00:56:23.350 --> 00:56:23.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Decades
and decades of work.

00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:24.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Exactly.

00:56:24.730 --> 00:56:29.270 align:middle line:84%
Starting in '75, he was
publishing many, many cases

00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:31.990 align:middle line:84%
that indicate very
strongly that there

00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:35.690 align:middle line:84%
is a persistence of conscious
understanding of who you

00:56:35.690 --> 00:56:38.350 align:middle line:90%
are outside the body itself.

00:56:38.350 --> 00:56:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And so we do have, if
not proof, per se--

00:56:42.310 --> 00:56:44.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, there's
thousands of cases.

00:56:44.210 --> 00:56:46.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Thousands of cases.

00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:49.190 align:middle line:84%
As a guy who used to spend a
lot of time in the UFO world,

00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:53.670 align:middle line:84%
I understand the frustration
of people who recognize

00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:56.240 align:middle line:90%
that as good, solid evidence.

00:56:56.240 --> 00:57:00.690 align:middle line:84%
Because science, hard science,
says no, that's not evidence.

00:57:00.690 --> 00:57:02.600 align:middle line:90%
Those are anecdotes.

00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:04.930 align:middle line:84%
You can tell stories all
day long if you like,

00:57:04.930 --> 00:57:07.550 align:middle line:84%
and they're nice stories,
but they don't add up

00:57:07.550 --> 00:57:08.932 align:middle line:90%
to proof of anything.

00:57:08.932 --> 00:57:10.390 align:middle line:84%
That was the argument
against UFOs.

00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:12.540 align:middle line:90%
It's still the same argument.

00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And it, again, can be
trotted out as an argument

00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:21.900 align:middle line:84%
not against the reality of this,
but an argument that requires

00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:24.592 align:middle line:90%
a kind of agnostic position.

00:57:24.592 --> 00:57:25.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is true.

00:57:25.550 --> 00:57:28.790 align:middle line:84%
This is a challenge we're
having across the board.

00:57:28.790 --> 00:57:31.440 align:middle line:84%
You can't use one
set of criteria,

00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:35.500 align:middle line:84%
which is experiential, in
the true meaning of the word

00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:38.820 align:middle line:84%
empirical, with
empirical science.

00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And we're always trying--
and I know, I do this, too,

00:57:41.710 --> 00:57:43.470 align:middle line:84%
and many people
sitting across from me.

00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:46.850 align:middle line:84%
We're always trying to
use one set of criteria

00:57:46.850 --> 00:57:49.570 align:middle line:84%
to prove the other, but it
can never actually be done.

00:57:49.570 --> 00:57:51.950 align:middle line:84%
So you have to go on what
you garner as your truth.

00:57:51.950 --> 00:57:53.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDEMANN: Well, I think
that that's basically

00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:54.750 align:middle line:90%
what it comes to.

00:57:54.750 --> 00:57:59.010 align:middle line:84%
But I do think that
the world as a whole

00:57:59.010 --> 00:58:02.140 align:middle line:84%
is becoming more
comfortable with the idea

00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:04.000 align:middle line:90%
that life goes on.

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.430 align:middle line:84%
I think that we
are beginning to be

00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:10.220 align:middle line:84%
more comfortable with the
idea that the soul is real.

00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:13.070 align:middle line:84%
I think that that's a
widely held view today.

00:58:13.070 --> 00:58:17.390 align:middle line:84%
I think the idea-- I think I
read a statistic the other day

00:58:17.390 --> 00:58:20.110 align:middle line:84%
that over half of all people in
the United States now believe

00:58:20.110 --> 00:58:22.390 align:middle line:84%
in reincarnation, which
was an interesting--

00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:23.515 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, that is.

00:58:23.515 --> 00:58:24.015 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:58:24.015 --> 00:58:24.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDEMANN: That's an
interesting finding.

00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:27.120 align:middle line:84%
Right around half,
if I'm not mistaken.

00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And so there is a
shift toward this.

00:58:30.890 --> 00:58:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And I think that it is very
beneficial to the planet

00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:39.430 align:middle line:84%
as a whole if we begin
to understand ourselves

00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:44.070 align:middle line:84%
not as meat sacks that die
and are gone after one life.

00:58:44.070 --> 00:58:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thus no
consequence for behavior.

00:58:46.030 --> 00:58:47.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Exactly.

00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:47.760 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:54.950 align:middle line:84%
Instead, we live in a world
of souls that come and go

00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:57.950 align:middle line:84%
that have relationships
that span millennia,

00:58:57.950 --> 00:59:02.910 align:middle line:84%
that there are consequences to
every single thing we do, for

00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:09.960 align:middle line:84%
better or for worse, and
that if we want to actualize

00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:13.830 align:middle line:84%
the highest that we can
be, we must understand

00:59:13.830 --> 00:59:18.037 align:middle line:84%
that we are first and
foremost spiritual entities.

00:59:18.037 --> 00:59:18.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well said.

00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:20.270 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't agree more.

00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:21.120 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:23.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of glad you did your
shift over from the world

00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:27.070 align:middle line:84%
of UFOs, which you explored
out to the nth degree,

00:59:27.070 --> 00:59:29.060 align:middle line:84%
and now you're doing
the same in this area,

00:59:29.060 --> 00:59:31.750 align:middle line:84%
because you have a nice
compulsive aspect of your being

00:59:31.750 --> 00:59:32.650 align:middle line:90%
that needs to know.

00:59:32.650 --> 00:59:33.483 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Thanks.

00:59:33.483 --> 00:59:34.074 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:59:34.074 --> 00:59:36.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're wonderful
at articulating it as well.

00:59:36.490 --> 00:59:37.698 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDEMANN: Well, I hope so.

00:59:37.698 --> 00:59:39.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm very much at the
beginning of this,

00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:41.290 align:middle line:90%
as you well can understand.

00:59:41.290 --> 00:59:44.090 align:middle line:10%
And perhaps in a year or
two, we can do another one

00:59:44.090 --> 00:59:45.582 align:middle line:10%
and have another conversation.

00:59:45.582 --> 00:59:46.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sounds great.

00:59:46.540 --> 00:59:47.150 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Michael.

00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:47.425 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDEMANN: It's
been lots of fun.

00:59:47.425 --> 00:59:47.977 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:59:47.977 --> 00:59:49.810 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Again, if
you'd like to learn more

00:59:49.810 --> 00:59:52.730 align:middle line:10%
about life between lives and
the journey of the souls,

00:59:52.730 --> 00:59:54.200 align:middle line:10%
you can read Michael
Newton's work,

00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:55.970 align:middle line:10%
available at major booksellers.

00:59:55.970 --> 00:59:57.700 align:middle line:10%
If you enjoyed the
topic, you might also

00:59:57.700 --> 01:00:00.630 align:middle line:10%
enjoy my interview with Dr.
Raymond Moody, which we just

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:01.180 align:middle line:90%
spoke of.

01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:04.190 align:middle line:84%
He is the godfather of
out of body experiences.

01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:08.270 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.

01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:15.234 align:middle line:90%
