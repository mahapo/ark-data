00:00:17.107 --> 00:00:18.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Our
beloved Andrew Harvey

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.910 align:middle line:90%
is in a revolutionary mode.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.800 align:middle line:10%
Religious scholar, Matthew Fox,
and other religious leaders

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.840 align:middle line:10%
are joining with
Andrew in resurrecting

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.810 align:middle line:10%
a new form of Christianity based
in the mystical love expressed

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:30.820 align:middle line:10%
by Christ.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.210 align:middle line:10%
They're all deeply dismayed
at the ravaging effects

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.590 align:middle line:10%
of Christian-driven
patriarchy on parishioners

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.850 align:middle line:10%
around the planet.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.000 align:middle line:90%
There's another spin.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.500 align:middle line:84%
The Muslim mystic, Rumi, also
honored the mystical teachings

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.190 align:middle line:84%
of Jesus, which has the
potential of creating

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.110 align:middle line:90%
a bridge between the two worlds.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.414 align:middle line:84%
Andrew is with us today to
share the love once again.

00:00:49.414 --> 00:00:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's so delightful
to have you back.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.530 align:middle line:90%
Our whole building's buzzing.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.410 align:middle line:90%
"Andrew's back.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.500 align:middle line:90%
Andrew's back."

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW HARVEY:
Thank you, darling.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.070 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.986 align:middle line:90%
Lovely to be with you.

00:00:56.986 --> 00:00:58.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You leave
a trail, a mist,

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.430 align:middle line:84%
of this very
elevated kind of love

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.210 align:middle line:90%
in your wake everywhere you go.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.447 align:middle line:90%
Even at diners.

00:01:04.447 --> 00:01:05.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Thank you, sweetheart.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.490 align:middle line:84%
What are we here to
do except exude love?

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.640 align:middle line:90%
And you are the maestro.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to start
right in on, off camera,

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.270 align:middle line:84%
we were talking about
an event recently

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.350 align:middle line:90%
in Oakland, California.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.104 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:01:18.104 --> 00:01:20.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That you were a part
of, along with Matthew Fox.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.620 align:middle line:84%
And this, to me, is
very encouraging.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And you are attempting to
begin a true revolution

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.120 align:middle line:90%
in Christianity.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.600 align:middle line:90%
Please start sharing.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.990 align:middle line:90%
Just go for it.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.240 align:middle line:10%
>>HARVEY: Well about seven
months ago, I rang Matt.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.180 align:middle line:10%
And Matthew Fox is one of my
dearest friends and somebody

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.170 align:middle line:10%
who I have infinite
admiration for.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.610 align:middle line:10%
I said, Matt, we cannot
let the Christian church

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.710 align:middle line:10%
and the Christian tradition be
interpreted by these morons,

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.710 align:middle line:10%
and these sadists, and these
patriarchal fascists anymore.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.450 align:middle line:84%
We have got to really stand by
our authentic vision of Jesus

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.960 align:middle line:84%
as a great revolutionary
of the heart

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.860 align:middle line:90%
and a revolutionary of justice.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.256 align:middle line:84%
And why don't we start something
called the Christ Path Seminar?

00:02:04.256 --> 00:02:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And I called it the
Christ Path Seminar

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.560 align:middle line:84%
because there was this great
movement called the Jesus

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.214 align:middle line:84%
Seminar which made available
the historical Jesus in the way

00:02:12.214 --> 00:02:13.880 align:middle line:84%
that we've never
experienced him before.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.460 align:middle line:84%
But we wanted to
go the next level,

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.040 align:middle line:84%
to make available to everybody
the authentic, mystical

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.350 align:middle line:84%
teachings of Christ
that are in service

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.060 align:middle line:84%
of a major revolution of
all institutions, all arts,

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.390 align:middle line:90%
all sciences.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Matthew has a slightly less
exuberant temperament than I.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.330 align:middle line:84%
He thought for a moment,
and he said, well,

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.490 align:middle line:84%
that will throw the
leopard among the pigeons.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes, was his answer.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.470 align:middle line:84%
So last weekend, actually
a couple of weekends

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.980 align:middle line:84%
ago in Oakland, we began
the Christ Path Seminar.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.050 align:middle line:10%
And anybody who's
interested can go

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.000 align:middle line:10%
to the christpathseminar.org.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.980 align:middle line:10%
We offered it as a gift
economy, so people paid only $50

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.419 align:middle line:10%
either to listen to it in
live streaming or to attend.

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:56.960 align:middle line:10%
Which we felt was
terribly important.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.890 align:middle line:84%
How can we talk about Jesus
and charge excessively for it?

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.400 align:middle line:84%
So that was a very
important part of it.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And we really launched
the revolution.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.775 align:middle line:90%
It's been launched.

00:03:06.775 --> 00:03:10.422 align:middle line:84%
Because what both
of us said is, look,

00:03:10.422 --> 00:03:14.670 align:middle line:84%
the whole revelation has
been betrayed by making Jesus

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.540 align:middle line:84%
into an inaccessible son
of God, a unique being.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.450 align:middle line:84%
This was not his intention, not
his mission, not his message.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.840 align:middle line:84%
Jesus never claimed to
be a unique son of God.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.380 align:middle line:84%
What he claimed was an
amazing relationship with God.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And he offered that relationship
to all other beings.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.240 align:middle line:90%
He enacted it.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And he showed what it
would look like to be

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.180 align:middle line:90%
in that relationship.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And again, and again, and again,
he said, don't call me good.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.640 align:middle line:90%
Only God is good.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.070 align:middle line:84%
You can do things
that I can't do,

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.850 align:middle line:84%
if only you'll establish
this relationship.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And in recent years,
in the last century,

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.195 align:middle line:84%
we discovered the Gospel
of Thomas in 1945.

00:03:57.195 --> 00:04:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And the Gospel of
Thomas has, I believe,

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.440 align:middle line:84%
Jesus' real, yogic
instruction to the world.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.100 align:middle line:10%
And fundamentally, what he's
saying in the Gospel of Thomas

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.890 align:middle line:10%
is three things.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.500 align:middle line:84%
First, you are as
divine as I am.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.610 align:middle line:84%
You are born with
divine consciousness.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.850 align:middle line:84%
The whole point of
being on the Earth

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.000 align:middle line:84%
is to realize that
and live your life

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.400 align:middle line:84%
in the pursuit of
justice and compassion.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.770 align:middle line:84%
From the profoundest peace
and the wildest, wildest love.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.470 align:middle line:84%
The second thing he's saying
is that the kingdom, what

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.320 align:middle line:84%
he calls the kingdom, this state
of joyful inter-penetrating,

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.230 align:middle line:84%
inter-related love with
all things is already here.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.100 align:middle line:90%
It's on the Earth.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.320 align:middle line:90%
It's not in some otherwhere.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.670 align:middle line:90%
It's here.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And the whole point of waking
up to your divine consciousness

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.290 align:middle line:84%
is that you wake up to this
radiance of divine presence

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:58.760 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, in other
beings, and in yourself.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And in the works of
justice and compassion

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.540 align:middle line:90%
that flow from that knowledge.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And the third thing
that Jesus is saying

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.220 align:middle line:84%
is love doesn't
mean a hill of beans

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:16.066 align:middle line:84%
until you put it
into radical action.

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:17.440 align:middle line:84%
Jesus' vision of
enlightenment is

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.810 align:middle line:84%
very different from the
vision of enlightenment

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.650 align:middle line:84%
the we inherit from the
glorious traditions of Hinduism

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:23.357 align:middle line:90%
and Buddhism.

00:05:23.357 --> 00:05:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And I love those
traditions, and honor them,

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.020 align:middle line:84%
and I, of course,
was born in India.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And I co-wrote "The Tibetan
Book of Living and Dying."

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.360 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not knocking
Hinduism Buddhism at all.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.310 align:middle line:84%
But what Jesus
brought in, uniquely,

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.190 align:middle line:84%
was a vision of enlightenment,
the highest state

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.720 align:middle line:84%
being one of being a
servant of others--

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:50.430 align:middle line:84%
a truly dedicated, passionate,
compassionate servant of others

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.371 align:middle line:84%
and in the name
of God as justice.

00:05:54.371 --> 00:05:56.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, one of the
things that's very damaging

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.580 align:middle line:84%
about our new age, apart
from its terminal narcissism

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.830 align:middle line:84%
and its incredibly
boring spirituality,

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.970 align:middle line:84%
is its lack of understanding
that one of the holiest

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.330 align:middle line:90%
names of God is justice.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.600 align:middle line:84%
People talk up a blue
streak about divine love,

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.070 align:middle line:90%
divine love, divine love.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.220 align:middle line:84%
But they do not
accept or even begin

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.875 align:middle line:84%
to imagine the real challenge
that the real Jesus is saying,

00:06:19.875 --> 00:06:22.240 align:middle line:84%
to every human being,
not just Christians,

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.110 align:middle line:84%
but Buddhists and
all human beings.

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.920 align:middle line:90%
Saying, you say you love God.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.710 align:middle line:90%
You say you are awake.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.860 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.210 align:middle line:84%
What are you doing
with your life

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:41.490 align:middle line:84%
to bring about the establishment
of the laws of compassion

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:45.710 align:middle line:84%
and justice that belong to the
kingdom that is already here

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.700 align:middle line:84%
in the divine presence
and waiting for you

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.700 align:middle line:84%
to step up to your
mission to enact it

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.790 align:middle line:84%
with courage in the
heart of the world?

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:57.450 align:middle line:84%
So these three grenades
we tossed happily

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.910 align:middle line:84%
into the decaying
body of Christianity.

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How did
the crowd respond?

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.005 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people must
have been ecstatic.

00:07:04.005 --> 00:07:05.338 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Oh, I cannot tell you.

00:07:05.338 --> 00:07:07.350 align:middle line:84%
People were ecstatic
because there

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.420 align:middle line:84%
are three kinds of Christians
at the moment, I think.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.670 align:middle line:84%
The first kind are those
who have bought the Kool-Aid

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.920 align:middle line:84%
and really don't want
to be shoved aside

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.720 align:middle line:90%
at all in their theology.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.950 align:middle line:84%
Because they've
decided who he is.

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.510 align:middle line:84%
They've bought the
version of who he is.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And they're often
very nice people.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.730 align:middle line:84%
It's not that
they're bad people.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:29.630 align:middle line:84%
Some of the most
wonderful people I know

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.000 align:middle line:90%
are fundamentalists, actually.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.314 align:middle line:84%
They have passionate
love of Jesus.

00:07:33.314 --> 00:07:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And they've very
kind and generous

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:35.730 align:middle line:90%
in their personal lives.

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:38.490 align:middle line:84%
It's just that they also believe
that the Dalai Lama is going

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.980 align:middle line:84%
to burn in hell and
that homosexuals

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.310 align:middle line:90%
will be burning with him.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And women who don't
obey their husbands

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:45.590 align:middle line:90%
will also be crisping alongside.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.035 align:middle line:84%
So it's a little sad,
that particular vision

00:07:48.035 --> 00:07:50.480 align:middle line:90%
of Jesus' universal love.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:54.510 align:middle line:84%
The second kind of Christians
are the incredibly wounded

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:59.150 align:middle line:84%
who have stayed in the
churches, although very

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.814 align:middle line:84%
disabused of a great deal
of the church's teachings.

00:08:01.814 --> 00:08:03.230 align:middle line:84%
There are many
Catholics like this

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:07.800 align:middle line:84%
who know perfectly well that
the Vatican has been covering up

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.470 align:middle line:84%
pedophilia scandals, the
Vatican has been investing

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.040 align:middle line:84%
in horrifying
things, the Vatican

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.810 align:middle line:90%
is run by the boy's club.

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:15.740 align:middle line:84%
The Vatican is
not releasing some

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.690 align:middle line:84%
of the most powerful
teachings of Jesus.

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:21.650 align:middle line:84%
They know all this, but it's
too scary for them to get out.

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And they're like wounded members
of a dysfunctional family.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:28.190 align:middle line:84%
But the third kind
of Christian is

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:32.940 align:middle line:84%
someone who has been so
wounded and so disabused

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.210 align:middle line:84%
that they're truly
hungry for a new vision.

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That would be
almost in the born again

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:39.760 align:middle line:84%
category of a lot of people
who've come to it later

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.409 align:middle line:84%
in life, after
suffering a great deal

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:43.999 align:middle line:84%
and not having
found other answers.

00:08:43.999 --> 00:08:45.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Well I
think also that they

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.360 align:middle line:84%
are people who will not give
up their love affair with Jesus

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.900 align:middle line:84%
but have understood that
none of the churches

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.510 align:middle line:84%
represent the Jesus that
they are in love with.

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm in that category
because I was born a Protestant.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:58.270 align:middle line:90%
I was born in India.

00:08:58.270 --> 00:08:59.780 align:middle line:84%
From a very early
age, I realized

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.440 align:middle line:84%
there was just one god
and many parts to the god.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.960 align:middle line:84%
But I never, ever, in all
of the different traditions

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.145 align:middle line:84%
I've plunged into-- I've
been initiated in Sufism,

00:09:09.145 --> 00:09:12.110 align:middle line:84%
and in Buddhism, and in Hinduism
and learned a huge amount

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:14.310 align:middle line:84%
from all of those
wonderful traditions.

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:17.610 align:middle line:84%
But I never, ever lost
my passion for Him.

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:22.660 align:middle line:84%
Because there's something about
Jesus, as a divine human being,

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.890 align:middle line:90%
that shatters your heart open.

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:30.510 align:middle line:84%
It's the bravest, wildest, most
courageous, most in your face,

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.730 align:middle line:84%
most challenging living
out of the divine

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:36.150 align:middle line:84%
that I think any
teacher's ever done.

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think when
you really stare

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:42.000 align:middle line:84%
into the face of the real Jesus,
into both the joy of that face

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.380 align:middle line:84%
and the heartbreak
of that face, it

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:46.170 align:middle line:90%
sears you at a profound level.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And you never forget
that glorious wound.

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
Christians-- I hope

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:54.010 align:middle line:84%
we can reach all those
three types of Christians,

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.900 align:middle line:84%
because it would be such a
wonderful thing if we could

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.110 align:middle line:84%
take back the golden shadow
that we've flung onto him

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:02.100 align:middle line:90%
and claim our own divinity.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And resurrect the
mystical practices

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.137 align:middle line:90%
that will help us do that.

00:10:06.137 --> 00:10:06.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.080 align:middle line:84%
I felt very
similarly as a child.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.049 align:middle line:84%
I was raised as a
Christian, a rather dour--

00:10:12.049 --> 00:10:13.423 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: What
kind of Christian?

00:10:13.423 --> 00:10:14.110 align:middle line:90%
V Missouri Synod Lutheran.

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Oh, my God,
that's very dour.

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:16.938 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: As dour as it gets.

00:10:16.938 --> 00:10:18.660 align:middle line:90%
As dry as it gets.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.489 align:middle line:84%
And very dogmatic,
as a matter of fact.

00:10:21.489 --> 00:10:22.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Only faith saves you.

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:23.370 align:middle line:90%
No works do.

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:23.870 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:24.876 align:middle line:90%
Oh, Lord, yes.

00:10:24.876 --> 00:10:26.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like I said, it's like
Catholicism without the fun.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:26.743 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:10:26.743 --> 00:10:28.890 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to
have a corrupt church,

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:33.230 align:middle line:84%
have the drag queens, have the
incense, have the whole thing.

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:34.430 align:middle line:90%
Don't go for drab.

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:34.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Something that
has a lot of juicy stuff.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:34.880 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.060 align:middle line:90%
This was as drab as it gets.

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:40.270 align:middle line:84%
But the dogma of it was such
that, even by the age of five,

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:42.730 align:middle line:84%
when it was explained
to me-- I remember

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:45.770 align:middle line:84%
asking my mother at
that time, but Mom,

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:49.250 align:middle line:84%
what happens to a baby in
China that never had a chance

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:50.960 align:middle line:84%
to learn about
Jesus, and then dies?

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.501 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Oh, this
is such craziness.

00:10:52.501 --> 00:10:54.857 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And she said,
well, no one said it's fair.

00:10:54.857 --> 00:10:56.190 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: No one says it's fair?

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:56.790 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:58.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No one says it's fair.

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:00.735 align:middle line:84%
And that became a real
disconnect in my psyche.

00:11:00.735 --> 00:11:02.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Well, it's
rubbish, isn't it?

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:02.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:04.351 align:middle line:84%
Because there's
something else imbued

00:11:04.351 --> 00:11:06.350 align:middle line:84%
in any religion
of a larger nature

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:09.040 align:middle line:84%
that you're absorbing
almost on a cellular level.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And then to have your mind
confused to that degree

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:15.957 align:middle line:84%
creates, usually, a
falling away of some type.

00:11:15.957 --> 00:11:18.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Well it creates
a kind of schizophrenia,

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:18.880 align:middle line:90%
let's face it.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.520 align:middle line:84%
Look, Jesus didn't come
to form a religion.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.760 align:middle line:90%
We've had enough religions.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.640 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't into the
business of being adored.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:31.530 align:middle line:84%
He came to show a
revolutionary path that

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:34.200 align:middle line:84%
could lead you to be an
instrument of love and justice

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.300 align:middle line:84%
in action, which is
much, much greater

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:39.220 align:middle line:90%
than finding a religion.

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:41.990 align:middle line:84%
Many lunatics have
founded a religion.

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:44.190 align:middle line:84%
Very few have given
the path to humanity

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:48.250 align:middle line:84%
of evolutionary transfiguration,
which is what he did.

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:51.290 align:middle line:84%
Can you really
believe that a being

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:54.040 align:middle line:84%
who went through what
he went through out

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.620 align:middle line:84%
of sheer, wild
love for humanity,

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.670 align:middle line:90%
would not embrace everyone?

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:04.180 align:middle line:84%
Every broken, dispossessed,
desolate, heartbroken,

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.810 align:middle line:90%
shattered person?

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:08.530 align:middle line:84%
After all, he showed
that in his life, my God.

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:10.750 align:middle line:84%
He hung out with
thieves and prostitutes.

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:12.724 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't into the holy rollers.

00:12:12.724 --> 00:12:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And one of my favorite things,
one of my favorite stories,

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:18.280 align:middle line:84%
is how he announced his
messiah-ship, his mission,

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:22.680 align:middle line:84%
his divine purpose by the
well of Jacob to a woman

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:26.980 align:middle line:84%
who had been divorced five
times, was a Sumerian.

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.310 align:middle line:84%
So doubly outcast,
doubly rejected.

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:30.700 align:middle line:90%
And, of course, a woman.

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.370 align:middle line:84%
So not to some
guy in a robe, but

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:35.620 align:middle line:84%
to a woman who was
considered disgusting,

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:39.320 align:middle line:84%
he announced the great
secret of why he'd come.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:43.170 align:middle line:84%
So he's saying, through all
of these different ways,

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:44.790 align:middle line:90%
I love everyone.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:47.140 align:middle line:84%
Everyone is welcome
to the feast.

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:50.720 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter whether you
are gay, or straight, or black,

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.160 align:middle line:84%
or white, or
Buddhist, or Hindu--

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Divorced five times.

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:56.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: --or a lesbian
go-go dancer in Caracas.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:58.340 align:middle line:84%
You are my brother
and my sister.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And I came to show you
that you're divine.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:05.345 align:middle line:84%
And you can become divine
if you surrender your love

00:13:05.345 --> 00:13:07.750 align:middle line:90%
to God and your life to God.

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:11.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this had to
have an innate understanding.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And now this is a little going
more toward the science of it,

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:17.750 align:middle line:84%
but an innate understanding
of the multi-dimensionality

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:20.720 align:middle line:84%
of what it is to be human,
which we still don't truly

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.190 align:middle line:90%
understand to this day.

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:24.330 align:middle line:84%
Only maybe a handful
of people on the planet

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:28.570 align:middle line:84%
know what it is to truly merge
with their other part that

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:31.250 align:middle line:84%
is of a non-physical
and permanent nature.

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:33.960 align:middle line:84%
And so he obviously understood
these deep principles

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.360 align:middle line:84%
and was simply
trying to help people

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.490 align:middle line:90%
remember that aspect of self.

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Well, everyone
is the divine in drag.

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And everyone is the divine
enacting a certain role, which

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:50.780 align:middle line:84%
is crucial for the
future of the planet.

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:53.330 align:middle line:84%
Everyone needs to turn
up as their fullest,

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:58.830 align:middle line:84%
divine human self in order
for the plan to be successful.

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:00.310 align:middle line:90%
It's like a piece of music.

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:04.670 align:middle line:84%
Every note in a Mozart symphony
is absolutely essential.

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And without that
note being sounded,

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:09.320 align:middle line:90%
the symphony falls apart.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:13.650 align:middle line:84%
So the whole purpose of life is
to realize that you are divine.

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:15.251 align:middle line:90%
And you're also human.

00:14:15.251 --> 00:14:17.500 align:middle line:84%
You're also the divine
appearing in this material body

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:18.584 align:middle line:90%
with a mission of justice.

00:14:18.584 --> 00:14:20.041 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're an
unusual species.

00:14:20.041 --> 00:14:21.916 align:middle line:84%
We're a very unusual
species in that respect.

00:14:21.916 --> 00:14:22.499 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:14:22.499 --> 00:14:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we're
so screwed up also,

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:25.760 align:middle line:84%
because it's very
difficult to be

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.260 align:middle line:90%
these two things in the same.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:28.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
duality is really--

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:31.551 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that the universe
has duality like this anywhere

00:14:31.551 --> 00:14:32.050 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:32.680 align:middle line:90%
This is really incredible.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.304 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Well it's
not really duality.

00:14:34.304 --> 00:14:38.140 align:middle line:84%
It is because God is both
formless and appearing in form.

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:41.300 align:middle line:84%
It's actually non-dual
because, as the Buddha said,

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:42.967 align:middle line:84%
form is emptiness and
emptiness is form.

00:14:42.967 --> 00:14:43.925 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is true.

00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:46.050 align:middle line:84%
It's showing it's polarities
of one and the same.

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:46.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Exactly.

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:47.056 align:middle line:90%
It's polarities.

00:14:47.056 --> 00:14:50.340 align:middle line:84%
Because God is the opposition,
the marriage of opposites.

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And what we are is that
same marriage of opposites,

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:54.660 align:middle line:90%
both transcendent and imminent.

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:56.620 align:middle line:90%
Both spirit and matter.

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And they fuse in
a mystery which is

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:00.850 align:middle line:90%
the source of our true identity.

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:02.839 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet,
we're taught things

00:15:02.839 --> 00:15:04.630 align:middle line:84%
such as what I was
taught in Sunday school.

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:05.760 align:middle line:90%
And the way I was raised.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Well
they teach you that

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:08.140 align:middle line:84%
stuff because they
want to control you.

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well and
we're going to get

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.020 align:middle line:84%
into the control
in just a second.

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:14.520 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is
it has thrust millions

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:17.920 align:middle line:84%
upon millions of people
that were under-- that

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.910 align:middle line:84%
were in one Christian
faith or another into India

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:24.285 align:middle line:84%
and across the borders of Tibet
to try to find the answers.

00:15:24.285 --> 00:15:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And tell me from
your perspective,

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:27.900 align:middle line:84%
because you're so
well steeped in both

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:30.937 align:middle line:84%
of these other religions, let's
just take those two for now.

00:15:30.937 --> 00:15:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, Rumi, which
we'll get to a little later.

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Oh, God.

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:34.005 align:middle line:90%
I'd love to.

00:15:34.005 --> 00:15:34.505 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:34.505 --> 00:15:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about what
it is, in your own opinion,

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:41.610 align:middle line:84%
that shines about this one
particular path of the Christ,

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:46.539 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to Buddha and as
opposed to the Hindu teachings.

00:15:46.539 --> 00:15:47.330 align:middle line:90%
What is it that's--

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:49.829 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Well I wouldn't ever
use the word "as opposed to,"

00:15:49.829 --> 00:15:52.450 align:middle line:84%
because I think-- I'll tell
you what I really think.

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And you know how
reticent and restrained

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.197 align:middle line:84%
I usually am about
expressing myself,

00:15:56.197 --> 00:15:57.280 align:middle line:90%
but you're drawing me out.

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:59.363 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Please say it
in your restrained manner.

00:15:59.363 --> 00:16:01.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: I think
that humanity is

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:04.990 align:middle line:90%
on a great evolutionary journey.

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And that the destiny of
this evolutionary journey

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:14.950 align:middle line:84%
is to embody the divine on Earth
in an embodied divine humanity.

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is immensely difficult,
and immensely glorious,

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:19.730 align:middle line:90%
and immensely challenging.

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the time
for this radical embodiment

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:24.320 align:middle line:90%
of the divine has come.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And that the sign of it is
the enormous, terrible crisis.

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Evolution proceeds
by compulsive crises.

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think if you
step back and look

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:37.275 align:middle line:84%
at the evolutionary
history of the human race,

00:16:37.275 --> 00:16:42.360 align:middle line:84%
you see that we emerged
from the animals,

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:48.460 align:middle line:84%
we created a gorgeous, shamanic,
matriarchal culture embedded

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:53.010 align:middle line:84%
in the radiance of nature, which
was a very important foundation

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:56.340 align:middle line:84%
and remains an essential
foundation for wisdom.

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:59.820 align:middle line:84%
Then in the sixth and
seventh centuries BC,

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.940 align:middle line:84%
there was what we
call the First Axial

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:05.829 align:middle line:84%
Age in which a major
breakthrough, which gave us

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:10.339 align:middle line:84%
access to a major new power and
understanding, was affected.

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And it blazed in The
Upanishads in Hinduism.

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:16.880 align:middle line:84%
It blazed softly in the
sublime life of the Buddha.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.950 align:middle line:84%
It blazed in Confucius'
brilliant understanding

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:23.582 align:middle line:84%
of the relationship of
the spirit and society.

00:17:23.582 --> 00:17:24.990 align:middle line:90%
It burned in Lao Tzu.

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:28.780 align:middle line:84%
It was a huge breakthrough
into the transcendent,

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:32.960 align:middle line:84%
into the infinite
light that is actually

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.030 align:middle line:90%
our deep, secret origin.

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:37.550 align:middle line:90%
However, there was one problem.

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And that was that
this breakthrough

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:42.900 align:middle line:84%
was so gob-smacking,
so shattering,

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:46.250 align:middle line:84%
that it actually set up a
kind of secret addiction.

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:50.430 align:middle line:84%
Those traditions became addicted
to the transcendent, addicted

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:52.060 align:middle line:90%
to the infinite light.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And they were so amazed by it
and so devastated and shattered

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:58.940 align:middle line:84%
by its revelation that
they privileged it

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:03.946 align:middle line:84%
as the unique goal, missing
the subtle interplay

00:18:03.946 --> 00:18:05.945 align:middle line:84%
between the light and
matter, between the father

00:18:05.945 --> 00:18:10.720 align:middle line:84%
and the mother, between this
great source and the creations

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.799 align:middle line:84%
of the source, which
are just as holy.

00:18:12.799 --> 00:18:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it was
bypassing, essentially,

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:15.564 align:middle line:90%
our material aspect?

00:18:15.564 --> 00:18:16.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Well it was.

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was that it
created a subtle dissociation,

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:23.050 align:middle line:84%
a subtle schizophrenia between
masculine and feminine,

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:26.890 align:middle line:84%
between creator and creation,
between human and divine,

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:30.250 align:middle line:84%
and between society
and the enlightened.

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:33.170 align:middle line:90%
And this was very dangerous.

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:36.010 align:middle line:90%
Then he came.

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:42.750 align:middle line:84%
Jesus came, not to abandon the
past, but to sum up the pie.

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:45.640 align:middle line:84%
In a way, he began
where the others ended.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.120 align:middle line:84%
He began with this tremendous,
shamanic background.

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.900 align:middle line:90%
He was a shaman, Jesus.

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:52.320 align:middle line:90%
The donkey, he rode on a donkey.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.620 align:middle line:84%
He had shamanic
powers of healing.

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:55.610 align:middle line:90%
All of that.

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:59.190 align:middle line:84%
He was also absolutely grounded
in the transcendent origin

00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:01.720 align:middle line:84%
of the Upanishads, and
Lao Tzu, and Buddha.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:07.690 align:middle line:84%
But he was also the son
of the divine mother,

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:09.290 align:middle line:90%
the motherhood of God.

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And he had the passion of
the mother for reality.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And he had the sense,
the deep understanding,

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:17.736 align:middle line:84%
that the mother gives
of the utter sacredness

00:19:17.736 --> 00:19:18.860 align:middle line:90%
and holiness of everything.

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.425 align:middle line:84%
Of this flower,
of our connection,

00:19:20.425 --> 00:19:24.230 align:middle line:84%
of our connection
as we're talking.

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:28.910 align:middle line:84%
This interconnected, radiant
web of sacred reality.

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And what Jesus brought in is
essential for the human race.

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:34.920 align:middle line:90%
Not just for Christians.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:39.650 align:middle line:84%
He brought in a vision
of God as burning,

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:44.280 align:middle line:84%
passionate, compassionate,
personal love,

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:48.870 align:middle line:84%
as well as impersonal
grandeur and realization.

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:50.740 align:middle line:90%
Again, a marriage of opposites.

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:55.219 align:middle line:84%
And he brought in what his
own tradition had taught him

00:19:55.219 --> 00:19:57.260 align:middle line:84%
through the great prophets
and through the wisdom

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:00.170 align:middle line:84%
tradition of the great
Jewish revelation.

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:04.990 align:middle line:84%
He brought in the knowledge
that this love is in us

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:10.160 align:middle line:84%
to help us co-create with
God the kingdom, queendom,

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.040 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:16.520 align:middle line:84%
A wholly new way of being
and doing everything.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.380 align:middle line:84%
So this was an
evolutionary breakthrough.

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And if you see the progress
of the religions like this,

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:25.830 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't mean that you
don't revere the Upanishads.

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:29.670 align:middle line:84%
I am lost in awe before
the grandeur of the Hindu

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:30.890 align:middle line:90%
tradition.

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:33.480 align:middle line:84%
The Buddhist tradition is
something that I've plunged in.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.890 align:middle line:84%
I co-wrote with Patrick
Gaffney, "The Tibetan Book

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:36.920 align:middle line:90%
of Living and Dying."

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:40.310 align:middle line:84%
I have a very deep reverence for
his holiness, the Dalai Lama.

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:42.070 align:middle line:84%
I've studied very
deeply in Buddhism.

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And I honor the ideal
of the bodhisattva.

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:48.780 align:middle line:84%
But there's a difference
between enlightened compassion

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.750 align:middle line:90%
and burning love.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus is the
avatar, or the apostle,

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:59.780 align:middle line:84%
or the instrument of this
revelation of burning love.

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that our
movement on the planet now,

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.900 align:middle line:84%
our evolutionary movement,
could be so transformed

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:13.000 align:middle line:84%
if people could connect
beyond religion, beyond dogma,

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.920 align:middle line:84%
to this passionate, fiery,
burning love for reality.

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.960 align:middle line:84%
Because that would connect
a spiritual realization

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.530 align:middle line:84%
with sacred action
and make of us

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:26.780 align:middle line:84%
all humble revolutionaries
of love in action.

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I think
Jesus has created.

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:30.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I can't imagine anyone
saying it more beautifully

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:31.370 align:middle line:90%
than what you've just said.

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:31.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Thank you, darling.

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:34.223 align:middle line:84%
So there's no opposition to
any of the other traditions.

00:21:34.223 --> 00:21:36.400 align:middle line:90%
It's a completion in a way.

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.000 align:middle line:84%
It's look at one image of
it-- sorry to go on you,

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.850 align:middle line:84%
but you've raised a
kind of radiant worm.

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:41.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, please do.

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:46.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: It's as if what the
great Hindu, and Buddhist,

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:50.520 align:middle line:84%
and Daoist revelations did
was to awaken the light

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.630 align:middle line:90%
and to reveal the light in us.

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:58.700 align:middle line:84%
But what Jesus was was a lens,
a lens through which the light

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:04.690 align:middle line:84%
can become focused on real
problems in the real world.

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:07.300 align:middle line:84%
On poverty, on injustice,
on the horrible treatment

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:08.210 align:middle line:90%
of gay people.

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:09.918 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which was
part of his activism.

00:22:09.918 --> 00:22:12.030 align:middle line:90%


00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:14.217 align:middle line:84%
Historically, it was
part of his activism.

00:22:14.217 --> 00:22:14.800 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.506 align:middle line:84%
He's the most radical person
that's ever been on the Earth.

00:22:17.506 --> 00:22:21.010 align:middle line:84%
He absolutely un-wrote
the patriarchy

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:23.280 align:middle line:84%
before the patriarchy
really blazed into being.

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.576 align:middle line:84%
He came at the moment
when the Romans

00:22:25.576 --> 00:22:26.950 align:middle line:84%
were going to take
over the world

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:30.190 align:middle line:84%
and make the patriarchal way
of being the only way of being

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:31.940 align:middle line:84%
and then risk the
psychosis, which

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.420 align:middle line:90%
is now threatening the world.

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And he came as a man, not
because men are superior,

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:38.070 align:middle line:84%
but because men were
about to go crazy

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:40.720 align:middle line:84%
with this obscene
vision of power.

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And he showed the
exact opposite way.

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:45.450 align:middle line:84%
He showed the way
through, the way out.

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And the way out was through
surrender, and humility,

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:54.710 align:middle line:84%
and love, and tenderness,
and a passion for justice.

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And a real, radical respect
for all forms of life.

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:01.290 align:middle line:84%
It could not be a
more important message

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:02.870 align:middle line:84%
for the whole world
at this moment.

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:05.314 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Too bad
it didn't take.

00:23:05.314 --> 00:23:06.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: It did take.

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:07.750 align:middle line:84%
It didn't take in the
churches, because they all

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:09.540 align:middle line:84%
got taken over by
the boy's club.

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:12.100 align:middle line:84%
And the great catastrophe
was when the Roman Empire

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:14.825 align:middle line:84%
made Christianity its
official religion.

00:23:14.825 --> 00:23:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And there were many
other catastrophes.

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:20.160 align:middle line:84%
Then we have the farce of the
Vatican and all the rest of it.

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:24.930 align:middle line:84%
But it took in some of
the extraordinary mystics.

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And Christianity actually, the
Christian mystical tradition,

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:30.160 align:middle line:84%
is as glorious as
any of the others.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And what I'd love to
say to all seekers

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:34.752 align:middle line:84%
out there who may have
absolutely turned away

00:23:34.752 --> 00:23:36.710 align:middle line:84%
from Jesus because of
the horrible image of him

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:41.180 align:middle line:84%
as a misogynistic,
homophobic tyrant claiming

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:43.280 align:middle line:84%
total uniqueness--
all that nonsense

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.350 align:middle line:84%
that we've been sold
by the boy's club who

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:49.170 align:middle line:84%
want to control us through
that image-- get rid of that,

00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:53.300 align:middle line:84%
and listen to the
amazing message.

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:55.220 align:middle line:84%
And plunge into the
great Christian mystics.

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Because if you do,
you'll find that you

00:23:57.790 --> 00:24:01.390 align:middle line:84%
will find an extraordinary
range of understanding.

00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:04.455 align:middle line:84%
Look at Theresa of Avila, one of
the greatest mystics who's ever

00:24:04.455 --> 00:24:06.390 align:middle line:84%
been here, who has a
deeper understanding

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:08.330 align:middle line:84%
of the interior
life than anybody.

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:11.720 align:middle line:84%
Look at Radovich of
Antwerp, one of my craziest

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:14.320 align:middle line:84%
and most magnificent
friends of the soul.

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:18.090 align:middle line:84%
She was this burning, Rumi-like
poet of the twelfth century.

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:19.940 align:middle line:90%
Mad for love of God.

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:22.370 align:middle line:84%
Look at Matilda of Magdeburg,
the incredible woman who

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:25.090 align:middle line:84%
understood that Jesus was a
mother as well as a father.

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:28.590 align:middle line:84%
Look at Julian of Norwich,
look at Meister Eckhart,

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:30.310 align:middle line:90%
look at Rickebrick.

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:33.160 align:middle line:84%
Look, in our time, at people
like Howard Thurman, who

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.660 align:middle line:84%
wrote that book that
Martin Luther King carried

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:38.270 align:middle line:84%
into jail with him, "Jesus
and The Disinherited."

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:42.660 align:middle line:84%
Look at Matthew Fox doing this
staggering, monumental work,

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:46.080 align:middle line:84%
bringing in the whole
vision of the cosmic Christ,

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:48.440 align:middle line:84%
the whole universe lit
up with the glory of God.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.290 align:middle line:84%
Look at the Celtic
mystics, who worshipped

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:53.970 align:middle line:84%
Jesus in every flower,
in every rabbit,

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:57.190 align:middle line:84%
and in the vision of the
whole creation as singing

00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:58.610 align:middle line:90%
the praises of God.

00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And when you do come into the
Christian mystical tradition

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:04.830 align:middle line:84%
like this, you see that it
is just as powerful, just as

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:06.710 align:middle line:84%
noble, just as
grand as any other.

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And gifted, at its core, with
this particular understanding

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:14.170 align:middle line:84%
of passionate love for
justice and compassion,

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:15.740 align:middle line:90%
which is so important.

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:19.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you can't go
there without addressing

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:21.720 align:middle line:84%
the divinity in the
feminine, of course,

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.500 align:middle line:90%
which is the other part of this.

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:24.609 align:middle line:90%
And so what happened?

00:25:24.609 --> 00:25:25.150 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Mm.

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:26.457 align:middle line:90%
That's a lovely one.

00:25:26.457 --> 00:25:27.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And why was mother Mary elevated
while Mary Magdalene was

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:35.010 align:middle line:90%
cast aside?

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:38.950 align:middle line:10%
>>HARVEY: Well let's look at
it-- let's start with Jesus.

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:41.170 align:middle line:10%
I want to tell you
one of the greatest

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:42.580 align:middle line:10%
experiences of my life.

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:44.740 align:middle line:10%
I've been to Israel three times.

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:48.400 align:middle line:10%
And I've been in the
places where he was.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.550 align:middle line:90%
And is.

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And when, on my first
visit, I went to Tabgha,

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:55.770 align:middle line:84%
which is where he
gave the Beatitudes.

00:25:55.770 --> 00:26:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's a rolling, gorgeous
meadow filled with wild flowers

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:01.560 align:middle line:90%
by the sea of Galilee.

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And I stood in this
field of wild flowers

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.770 align:middle line:84%
which was saturated by
soft, spring sunlight.

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:10.205 align:middle line:84%
And I gazed across
the glittering blue

00:26:10.205 --> 00:26:11.780 align:middle line:90%
of the sea of Galilee.

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And saw the soft-breasted
hills around it.

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly it burst upon me
that everything that he ever

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:25.220 align:middle line:84%
championed, the Beatitudes--
"Blessed are the pure in heart,

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:26.500 align:middle line:90%
for they shall see God.

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:29.760 align:middle line:84%
Blessed are those who mourn,
for they shall be comforted"--

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:33.130 align:middle line:90%
it's all Mother transmission.

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:37.450 align:middle line:84%
He was as much a son of the
mother, a child of the mother,

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:40.380 align:middle line:84%
as he was of the
transcendent father.

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And when you see
that, when you really

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:47.510 align:middle line:84%
know that Jesus was a
sacred androgen, someone

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:50.030 align:middle line:84%
fusing at the
greatest and deepest

00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:54.710 align:middle line:84%
depths, the transcendent piece
of the Father with the burning,

00:26:54.710 --> 00:27:00.090 align:middle line:84%
compassionate passion of
all the truth of the Mother,

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:02.020 align:middle line:84%
then you understand that
what he's bringing in

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:04.610 align:middle line:90%
is the true sacred marriage.

00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And he's representing the
empowered, humble, loving life

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:10.710 align:middle line:90%
that that gives birth to.

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And then you look at
actually how he lived.

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.140 align:middle line:90%
He didn't live as a guru.

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:19.380 align:middle line:84%
He lived as a traveling
troubadour of God.

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:23.370 align:middle line:90%
He always said, don't love me.

00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:24.640 align:middle line:90%
Don't idolize me.

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:27.250 align:middle line:84%
It's your faith
that has healed you.

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:30.890 align:middle line:84%
He got dressed up as a female
servant at the Last Supper

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:31.920 align:middle line:90%
and washed their feet.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.550 align:middle line:90%
And said, don't project on me.

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:35.810 align:middle line:90%
Stop it.

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:39.650 align:middle line:90%
You must be me in action.

00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:42.360 align:middle line:84%
And look at the relationships
that he had with women.

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:46.620 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't simply that he
had an enlightened mother.

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And Mary is the divine
mother, the embodied mother.

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:51.110 align:middle line:90%
They came together.

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:54.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a mother,
son, father dance.

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:58.820 align:middle line:84%
But he had a consort,
probably a tantric consort,

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:00.440 align:middle line:90%
in Mary Magdalene.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:03.230 align:middle line:84%
Someone whom he
adored, and who adored

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:05.400 align:middle line:84%
him, was present
at the crucifixion,

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:09.570 align:middle line:84%
was the first person
to see him resurrected.

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:14.350 align:middle line:84%
She was almost totally written
out of the later tradition

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:18.370 align:middle line:84%
because the boy's club
wanted to control it

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:23.330 align:middle line:84%
and couldn't face the full,
outrageous radicalism of Jesus'

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:27.939 align:middle line:84%
overturning of all the
previous ways of being--

00:28:27.939 --> 00:28:29.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of his pure humanity.

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:middle line:90%
Simple humanity.

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:31.620 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: His tenderness.

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:33.300 align:middle line:90%
But his femininity.

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:35.030 align:middle line:90%
Why do we love Jesus?

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:39.405 align:middle line:84%
It's because he is-- of
course, he's grand, and strong,

00:28:39.405 --> 00:28:40.740 align:middle line:90%
and he does miracles.

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And he's noble,
and he's powerful.

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:45.940 align:middle line:84%
He has the full beauty of
the sacred masculine in him.

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:49.100 align:middle line:84%
But he's also
unbelievably tender,

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.890 align:middle line:90%
and shattered, and vulnerable.

00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And he's also outraged,
as a lioness is outraged,

00:28:56.810 --> 00:29:01.370 align:middle line:84%
as the black Madonna is outraged
by any kind of cruelty to life.

00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:03.840 align:middle line:84%
He has the mother
outrage at things.

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:08.420 align:middle line:84%
So he brings both with
such enormous truth.

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:12.210 align:middle line:84%
When you see that, when
you begin to comprehend it,

00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:15.560 align:middle line:84%
it changes your complete vision
of him and of the Revelation.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:19.370 align:middle line:84%
It's utterly insane that women
haven't been totally let in.

00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:22.180 align:middle line:84%
They were actually bishops
until the second century.

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:23.090 align:middle line:90%
Women were bishops.

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And then the boy's club took
over, and then they were--

00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:27.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's had
devastating consequences.

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:29.410 align:middle line:84%
You were just
talking a moment ago.

00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:31.700 align:middle line:90%
You used the word "likely."

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:35.170 align:middle line:10%
They were likely in a tantric
type of relationship, Jesus

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:36.540 align:middle line:10%
and Mary Magdalene.

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:38.770 align:middle line:10%
And let's talk about
that for a moment.

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:41.010 align:middle line:10%
The genuine
constituents that have

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:44.140 align:middle line:10%
to be present to have
a tantric relationship.

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean
the stuff that's

00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:47.940 align:middle line:84%
being sold in the
new age community.

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:48.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Oh, God.

00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:48.972 align:middle line:90%
That's not tantra.

00:29:48.972 --> 00:29:50.440 align:middle line:90%
That's souped-up pornography.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.994 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to
do with tantra.

00:29:51.994 --> 00:29:52.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk
about what it takes

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:58.330 align:middle line:84%
to have a genuine
tantric connection.

00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:00.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: There are three
things that it takes.

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:03.980 align:middle line:10%
The first is that both
people must be high adepts.

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:08.020 align:middle line:10%
They must have a deep,
deep, radical understanding

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:10.070 align:middle line:10%
of their divine origin.

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:12.520 align:middle line:10%
The second thing
is that they must

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:14.850 align:middle line:10%
be in a relationship
of the profoundest

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:19.380 align:middle line:10%
respect spiritually, mentally,
emotionally, and physically.

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:21.810 align:middle line:90%
All four must come together.

00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:27.222 align:middle line:84%
And that that respect is
focused on worshipping the other

00:30:27.222 --> 00:30:29.770 align:middle line:90%
as the emanation of the divine.

00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:32.780 align:middle line:84%
Not just adoring
each other, and not

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:38.370 align:middle line:84%
just lusting for each other,
but worshipping each other,

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:41.070 align:middle line:84%
consciously, from
their own divine self,

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:43.080 align:middle line:90%
as an emanation of the other.

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And third, that they really make
a commitment, the people who

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:50.770 align:middle line:84%
are taking on this
tremendous glory

00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:54.720 align:middle line:84%
of a tantric relationship,
to guard each other's shadow.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:58.390 align:middle line:84%
Because you cannot have an
authentic tantric relationship

00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:01.380 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of frightening
stuff coming up,

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:03.940 align:middle line:84%
because so much is at stake
in a tantric relationship.

00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:06.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What do you mean by
this guard each other's shadow?

00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:08.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Well what it
means is that if you

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:12.500 align:middle line:84%
are pursuing a true
tantric relationship, which

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:16.720 align:middle line:84%
has as its goal the
divinization of everything.

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.800 align:middle line:84%
It's not just your mind that
is inflamed with new knowledge.

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:22.750 align:middle line:84%
It's not just your heart
that opens to great bliss.

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:26.940 align:middle line:84%
It's also that your body gets
transformed in subtle ways

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:32.600 align:middle line:84%
by the constant irrigation,
by divine orgasmic ecstasy.

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And that is-- it actually is a
true, inner, physical change.

00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:41.730 align:middle line:84%
But the divine
power that comes in

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:46.830 align:middle line:84%
is so great that it awakens
immense resistance in you.

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:50.176 align:middle line:84%
And you get exposed
to your jealousy,

00:31:50.176 --> 00:31:53.530 align:middle line:84%
to your possessiveness,
to your nastiness,

00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:56.920 align:middle line:84%
to your childhood wounds,
to your body hatred,

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:59.590 align:middle line:84%
to your body loathing,
to all the messages

00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:01.810 align:middle line:84%
that you've ever
given them by anybody

00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:03.760 align:middle line:90%
about your insufficiency.

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:07.650 align:middle line:90%
And those can drown you.

00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And they can make you
behave in weird ways.

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:11.380 align:middle line:84%
Not me, of course,
but other people.

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:12.793 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course.

00:32:12.793 --> 00:32:15.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: If you believe
that, you believe anything.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.500 align:middle line:84%
They can make you behave in
weird and destructive ways.

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And if you're having a
tantric relationship,

00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:23.210 align:middle line:84%
you have to have an
awe-inspiring and humble sense

00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:25.970 align:middle line:84%
of what this process
means for both of you.

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And truly, truly help the
other person with their shadow,

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:33.530 align:middle line:84%
instead of damning them,
but also protect them in it,

00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:36.840 align:middle line:84%
so that you don't do
things or say things

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.850 align:middle line:84%
that activate that
shadow, so that they

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:42.640 align:middle line:84%
have more of a chance of
bringing all of themselves

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:46.180 align:middle line:84%
into the glorious, golden
glow of the relationship.

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:48.545 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So from what
is evidenced around us,

00:32:48.545 --> 00:32:51.130 align:middle line:84%
in all of humanity, the
incredible damage that

00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:54.150 align:middle line:84%
has been incurred over the
last thousands of years.

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:56.210 align:middle line:84%
But also even over
the last 50 years,

00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:58.500 align:middle line:90%
just by way of media alone.

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.834 align:middle line:90%
And self image, and expectation.

00:33:00.834 --> 00:33:03.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: The church is telling
us that the body is dirty.

00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And women are dirty
because they are

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:06.380 align:middle line:90%
the purveyors of original sin.

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:08.960 align:middle line:84%
All this has created a
horrible schizophrenia.

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:11.029 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how can
people ever really begin

00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:12.070 align:middle line:90%
connecting on that level?

00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:13.789 align:middle line:84%
Well, this brings us
to Rumi, actually.

00:33:13.789 --> 00:33:14.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: No.

00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:16.121 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about Jesus
a little bit longer,

00:33:16.121 --> 00:33:18.610 align:middle line:84%
because I think that
if you see Jesus

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:23.590 align:middle line:84%
as this great, sacred,
androgynous, sublimely

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:26.790 align:middle line:84%
masculine, sublimely
feminine being, who

00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:31.540 align:middle line:84%
was a man, what you can see, if
you look at his relationships,

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:36.300 align:middle line:84%
is that he models for us
two very important kinds

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:37.017 align:middle line:90%
of relationships.

00:33:37.017 --> 00:33:38.600 align:middle line:84%
He models the male
female relationship

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.070 align:middle line:90%
with Mary Magdalene.

00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And the rapture,
and the tenderness,

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:44.180 align:middle line:84%
and the beauty of what
we can gather from it.

00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And we have the
gospel of Mary, which

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:49.460 align:middle line:84%
shows that she was the one he
gave his highest teachings to.

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:51.060 align:middle line:90%
Shows him kissing her.

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And all the other disciples
freak out, naturally,

00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:54.672 align:middle line:90%
because they're jealous.

00:33:54.672 --> 00:33:55.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Of course,
most people have not

00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:56.860 align:middle line:90%
heard of the gospel of Mary.

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:59.276 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Well it is something
that everybody should read,

00:33:59.276 --> 00:34:00.980 align:middle line:84%
because it really
shows how primal she

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:02.960 align:middle line:84%
was to his whole
mission and suggested

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:05.210 align:middle line:84%
they had a very
intimate relationship.

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:07.010 align:middle line:90%
He was a rabbi, after all.

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:08.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't think he would
have kissed anybody

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:11.701 align:middle line:84%
on the mouth that he wasn't
actually, maybe married to.

00:34:11.701 --> 00:34:12.409 align:middle line:90%
We'll never know.

00:34:12.409 --> 00:34:13.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
there's some evidence

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:15.350 align:middle line:84%
in Aramaic
interpretations that they

00:34:15.350 --> 00:34:18.366 align:middle line:84%
were married and
did have children.

00:34:18.366 --> 00:34:20.199 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: The second
relationship-- and this

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:22.540 align:middle line:84%
is actually in the
Gospels, and has always

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:25.900 align:middle line:84%
been a theme that
haunts European art-- is

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:28.960 align:middle line:84%
the relationship that he has
with his beloved disciple who

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:32.355 align:middle line:84%
leans against his heart
at the Last Supper.

00:34:32.355 --> 00:34:34.719 align:middle line:84%
This is such a-- And
that beloved disciple,

00:34:34.719 --> 00:34:37.370 align:middle line:84%
traditionally, was the one
who wrote John's gospel.

00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:38.260 align:middle line:90%
John.

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:40.760 align:middle line:84%
So he's modeling
the sublime tantra

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:45.110 align:middle line:84%
of-- the sublime sexual
tantra with a woman.

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:50.000 align:middle line:84%
He's also modeling the sublime
tantra of male friendship

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.620 align:middle line:90%
at the highest level with a man.

00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:54.070 align:middle line:90%
Imagine.

00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:59.810 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if we had a world that
could respond to these two,

00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:02.115 align:middle line:90%
linked revelations.

00:35:02.115 --> 00:35:02.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:03.960 align:middle line:90%
You know--

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:04.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: It would
be astonishing.

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:06.248 align:middle line:84%
Everything would be
changed, wouldn't it?

00:35:06.248 --> 00:35:06.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:07.710 align:middle line:90%
Indeed.

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say,
on a personal level,

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:13.230 align:middle line:84%
I had perhaps the most
not just unexpected

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:16.780 align:middle line:84%
but profound mystical
experience of my life

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:20.370 align:middle line:84%
in the little cave
near the monastery

00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:23.440 align:middle line:84%
that John the
Baptist is said to go

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:25.340 align:middle line:90%
into for his mystic journeys.

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:30.200 align:middle line:84%
My seat, my rear end barely
touched the little stool

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.240 align:middle line:84%
that's in that tiny
little cave, and things

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:35.340 align:middle line:84%
started showing themselves
that were unbelievable.

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:36.680 align:middle line:90%
The power was unbelievable.

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:39.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: If you go to that
place, if you go to the place

00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:42.740 align:middle line:84%
where the tomb was,
if you go to the place

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:48.740 align:middle line:84%
where he was born in Bethlehem,
that incredible place where

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:52.660 align:middle line:84%
there's just a black
star-- If you go,

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:56.340 align:middle line:84%
many extraordinary things will
happen to you if you are open.

00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:58.760 align:middle line:90%
The power of his presence.

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:02.711 align:middle line:84%
And this evolutionary power has
to come back into humanity now.

00:36:02.711 --> 00:36:04.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well I mean
it's alive and well,

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:05.790 align:middle line:90%
if you can manage to--

00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:06.210 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Oh, God, yes.

00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:08.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean you
could just-- all you

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:11.175 align:middle line:84%
have to do is have the intention
even of tapping into it.

00:36:11.175 --> 00:36:12.940 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
travel to Jerusalem.

00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:14.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: And the
belief that you can.

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And the belief that you can
have an intimate, personal

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:20.360 align:middle line:84%
relationship with someone
who has become one

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:23.780 align:middle line:84%
with the entire universe,
but who is also your brother

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:25.154 align:middle line:90%
beloved.

00:36:25.154 --> 00:36:26.070 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:29.371 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when we
look at these teachings,

00:36:29.371 --> 00:36:30.870 align:middle line:84%
when we look at
what you just talked

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:33.960 align:middle line:84%
about about this sacred dance
between the masculine and

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:35.150 align:middle line:90%
feminine.

00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:36.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm asking you this--

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:37.725 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: And the masculine
and the masculine.

00:36:37.725 --> 00:36:38.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the masculine
and the masculine.

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:40.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Because
in a way, I think

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:43.470 align:middle line:84%
the whole homosexual movement
would be transformed.

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:46.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, gay men, if they
could model their relationship

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:50.750 align:middle line:84%
on Jesus and John, wouldn't
that take homosexual liberation

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:52.600 align:middle line:84%
to a wholly new level
of transcendent love?

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And if two men who are straight
could model their friendship

00:36:57.730 --> 00:37:00.105 align:middle line:84%
on this sublime
exchange of the heart,

00:37:00.105 --> 00:37:01.480 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't that
transfigure the way

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:04.074 align:middle line:84%
in which men relate to
each other in the world?

00:37:04.074 --> 00:37:05.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well it
certainly would,

00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:08.520 align:middle line:84%
and as they've had the
dominant, primary influence

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:11.280 align:middle line:84%
on the way things have
played out in every respect--

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:14.190 align:middle line:84%
militarily,
politically, et cetera--

00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:17.560 align:middle line:84%
how would you view that
kind of transformation

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:19.760 align:middle line:90%
and its effect on the world?

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Well you
mentioned military.

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:23.870 align:middle line:84%
You know, I have
many marine friends.

00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:26.660 align:middle line:84%
I have a great friend who's
in the special forces.

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:28.844 align:middle line:84%
And actually, military
guys have that kind

00:37:28.844 --> 00:37:31.510 align:middle line:84%
of relationship with each other,
because they are truly prepared

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:32.670 align:middle line:90%
to die for each other.

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:33.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is true.

00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:35.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: And their level
of love for each other.

00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:37.430 align:middle line:84%
If you see marines
together, you think

00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:38.960 align:middle line:90%
they're all having love affairs.

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:39.654 align:middle line:90%
They're not.

00:37:39.654 --> 00:37:41.070 align:middle line:84%
They're straight
guys who are just

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:43.720 align:middle line:84%
mad about each other and
truly surrender to each other,

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:46.530 align:middle line:84%
because they've sweated
together, bled together.

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:48.970 align:middle line:84%
The tragedy is that they have
to learn that in violence.

00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:53.910 align:middle line:84%
Why can't we have men who learn
it in friendship and reality?

00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And sports is a good way
for people to come to it,

00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:59.870 align:middle line:84%
but I want another level
of masculine transmission.

00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:02.705 align:middle line:84%
I'm hungry and waiting for
these-- and they're coming.

00:38:02.705 --> 00:38:05.510 align:middle line:84%
The younger generation of men
are really waking up to this.

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:08.920 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, we're living in
a system which pits everybody

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:12.130 align:middle line:84%
against everyone else, has
a completely fake dream,

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:15.670 align:middle line:84%
has a totally
narcissistic spirituality.

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's very hard to get out
of this competitive framework,

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:21.140 align:middle line:90%
but you can.

00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And if you do, a whole
feast of love awaits you.

00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:27.719 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well now,
you lecture all over.

00:38:27.719 --> 00:38:29.010 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: I never stop talking.

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:30.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You
never stop talking,

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:32.240 align:middle line:90%
which I love about you.

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And there are people that are
looking for very practical ways

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:39.520 align:middle line:84%
to go about this transformation
in their own lives.

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:43.100 align:middle line:84%
Which we have cellular
memory, lifetime

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:46.830 align:middle line:84%
after lifetime after
lifetime, of these old edicts.

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:49.240 align:middle line:84%
Of this repression and
so forth, which is--

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:51.130 align:middle line:84%
and we talked about
this off camera--

00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:54.910 align:middle line:84%
creating an incredible lash
back, certainly among women.

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:58.900 align:middle line:84%
A lot of women that I
know, and among men,

00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:02.290 align:middle line:84%
as the ethers seem to
be refining to the point

00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:04.670 align:middle line:84%
where everything can
begin bubbling closer

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:07.320 align:middle line:84%
to the surface, tremendous
amounts of resentment

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:08.840 align:middle line:90%
and anger--

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:09.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Rage.

00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:11.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --are
starting to surface.

00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:13.160 align:middle line:84%
Now let's look at that
part, because we can't just

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:15.740 align:middle line:84%
go into love and light without
acknowledging the rage.

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:17.155 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Oh, God, no.

00:39:17.155 --> 00:39:18.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a love
and light brigade.

00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:19.080 align:middle line:90%
You know me.

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:20.788 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know, so
let's talk about it.

00:39:20.788 --> 00:39:22.910 align:middle line:84%
Most people are looking
for love and light.

00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:25.460 align:middle line:84%
But this is sitting right
there, ready to come up.

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: We're
never going to find

00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:28.140 align:middle line:84%
the true love and the
true light without going

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:29.760 align:middle line:90%
through the shadow.

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:31.470 align:middle line:84%
But what we have
to evolve-- Let's

00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:33.550 align:middle line:84%
take the male female
problem, and let's

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:36.950 align:middle line:84%
try and look at it from the
Jesus perspective together.

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:40.790 align:middle line:84%
It's obvious that patriarchy
has wounded, and betrayed,

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:44.310 align:middle line:84%
and humiliated, and degraded
women at the deepest level.

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:47.120 align:middle line:84%
Made them into
whores, or Madonnas,

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:50.470 align:middle line:84%
or purveyors of
original sin, and made

00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:53.030 align:middle line:84%
them deeply self-loathing
of the very things

00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:57.010 align:middle line:84%
that women should be
so gloriously proud of.

00:39:57.010 --> 00:39:59.470 align:middle line:84%
Their bodies, the
power of creation

00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:01.017 align:middle line:84%
that is given to
a woman, the fact

00:40:01.017 --> 00:40:03.580 align:middle line:84%
that a woman is really a
representative, an ambassador,

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:07.890 align:middle line:84%
a living vision of
the divine mother.

00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:09.360 align:middle line:90%
My God.

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing
is being done to men,

00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:14.740 align:middle line:84%
because you can't
make an oppressor

00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:18.490 align:middle line:84%
class without secretly
oppressing the heart,

00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:20.600 align:middle line:84%
and soul, and body
of the oppressor.

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:23.270 align:middle line:84%
So men are cut off from
the feminine they degrade.

00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And women are annihilated by
pain, and resentment, and rage

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:30.690 align:middle line:84%
at everything that
they've suffered.

00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:35.920 align:middle line:84%
What's necessary now, I
think, is for men and women

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:40.210 align:middle line:84%
to evolve a way of being
with each other in which

00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:47.930 align:middle line:84%
these deep-seated, cellular
agonies can be talked about,

00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:51.580 align:middle line:84%
can be opened up,
while not accusing

00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:54.294 align:middle line:84%
the other person of being
the representative of it.

00:40:54.294 --> 00:40:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:55.580 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:58.077 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: So many men--
straight guys that I love

00:40:58.077 --> 00:41:00.035 align:middle line:84%
and who are my buddies--
come up to me and say,

00:41:00.035 --> 00:41:01.250 align:middle line:90%
you have no idea.

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:01.750 align:middle line:90%
I can't.

00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:05.390 align:middle line:84%
I am not personally
responsible for the last 2,500

00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:06.600 align:middle line:90%
years of patriarchy.

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:09.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying very hard
to be a metro-sexual.

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:11.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm trying to be kind.

00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:13.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm trying to be sensitive.

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:16.035 align:middle line:84%
I've read Clarissa Pinkola
Estes and Betty Friedan.

00:41:16.035 --> 00:41:17.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But
nothing is working.

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:19.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Nothing
is working because I

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:24.602 align:middle line:84%
am being held to account for
crimes I myself know are awful.

00:41:24.602 --> 00:41:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really
trying to transform.

00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:30.060 align:middle line:90%
And this is not working.

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:31.060 align:middle line:90%
And the same with women.

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:33.510 align:middle line:84%
I think that women
really need to be

00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:36.815 align:middle line:84%
able to voice their
outrage and their pain

00:41:36.815 --> 00:41:42.220 align:middle line:84%
without identifying with it,
because they are not just

00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:43.270 align:middle line:90%
their rage.

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:45.760 align:middle line:90%
They are the divine mother.

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
key is two things.

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:53.080 align:middle line:84%
First, women to connect with
the divine motherhood of God.

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And men to connect with
the divine masculine.

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And to be empowered at
a sacred level by both.

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:01.360 align:middle line:90%
Both need to be there.

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And then, when
they come together,

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:06.590 align:middle line:84%
to do practices, very
simple practices,

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:10.820 align:middle line:84%
that can align the man and the
woman with their divine truth.

00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And then to speak like
you speak if you're

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:17.935 align:middle line:84%
an Israeli or a Palestinian
in a hostage negotiation.

00:42:17.935 --> 00:42:20.320 align:middle line:90%
It's no good screaming.

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:24.860 align:middle line:84%
You just have to speak calmly
and not make the other person

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:28.060 align:middle line:84%
guilty, not shame or
blame the other person.

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:30.650 align:middle line:90%
Help the other person.

00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:35.320 align:middle line:84%
Both men and women are in a
catastrophic, dissociated,

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:39.290 align:middle line:84%
horrifically painful situation
in which both are cut off

00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:41.410 align:middle line:90%
from the best of each other.

00:42:41.410 --> 00:42:42.420 align:middle line:90%
Let's get real.

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:43.490 align:middle line:90%
Let's get together.

00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:45.580 align:middle line:84%
Let's work out ways in
which we can share this.

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:47.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This takes incredible
maturity and courage.

00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And you're looking
on behalf of women.

00:42:51.550 --> 00:42:56.060 align:middle line:84%
What you'll often
see is that that pain

00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:58.017 align:middle line:84%
that's coming up closer
to the surface now,

00:42:58.017 --> 00:43:00.350 align:middle line:84%
that outrage, which is basically
standing up and saying,

00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:00.850 align:middle line:90%
no more.

00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:01.349 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:03.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: And there's a
good thing about that.

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.071 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There is a
good thing about that.

00:43:05.071 --> 00:43:08.860 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
because of an innate need

00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:13.470 align:middle line:84%
for a type of really
almost cellular security,

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:17.230 align:middle line:84%
which is running throughout
our historical DNA,

00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:20.040 align:middle line:84%
this need for security,
there is a fear of the women

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:23.600 align:middle line:84%
to speak up and share
that rage because they're

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.170 align:middle line:84%
afraid they'll
lose what they have

00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:27.770 align:middle line:84%
by way of their
secure relationship.

00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:31.407 align:middle line:84%
And so they continue even now,
with it surfacing, stuffing it.

00:43:31.407 --> 00:43:33.615 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Well I think that
what you're talking about

00:43:33.615 --> 00:43:36.970 align:middle line:84%
is something that Jesus is
very, very brilliant on,

00:43:36.970 --> 00:43:42.290 align:middle line:84%
too, because Jesus shows us
that outrage is essential.

00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:44.650 align:middle line:84%
If you're not outraged,
you're not human.

00:43:44.650 --> 00:43:47.470 align:middle line:84%
But that outrage
is just not enough.

00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:50.120 align:middle line:84%
You have to be able to
transmute that outrage

00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:52.550 align:middle line:90%
into fierce compassion energy.

00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:57.700 align:middle line:84%
So what I would suggest to
women is, and very respectfully,

00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:01.150 align:middle line:84%
is that they come together
and empower each other

00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:02.230 align:middle line:90%
in that outrage.

00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:04.200 align:middle line:90%
Really voice it with each other.

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:06.070 align:middle line:90%
Get it out.

00:44:06.070 --> 00:44:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And then work with
divine practices

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:15.530 align:middle line:84%
so that that outrage becomes
that laser calm, clear vision.

00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Then men will be deeply
humiliated by the outrage.

00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:22.290 align:middle line:90%
And they will hear the love.

00:44:22.290 --> 00:44:24.560 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean that
women have to in any way

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:27.660 align:middle line:84%
mitigate what they know,
or soften what they say,

00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:31.671 align:middle line:84%
or in any way not get
their deep point across.

00:44:31.671 --> 00:44:33.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But dumping
it on your man

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:34.563 align:middle line:90%
is not working well right now.

00:44:34.563 --> 00:44:35.104 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: No.

00:44:35.104 --> 00:44:36.062 align:middle line:90%
And you can't be heard.

00:44:36.062 --> 00:44:38.760 align:middle line:84%
If I scream at you,
even if I'm screaming

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:41.540 align:middle line:84%
absolutely true things,
you're going to resist it.

00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:44.130 align:middle line:84%
That's just how human
beings are built.

00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:47.550 align:middle line:84%
I know very wonderful
women who are outraged,

00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:50.350 align:middle line:84%
who do know this
about the patriarchy,

00:44:50.350 --> 00:44:54.100 align:middle line:84%
but who love their men enough
to be able to work on it

00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:57.630 align:middle line:84%
and to be able to say what
they need to say in a way

00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:59.060 align:middle line:90%
that men can hear.

00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And there's a very simple rule,
which my women friends tell me,

00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:08.870 align:middle line:84%
which is first tell the guy how
much you really care about him.

00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:11.510 align:middle line:84%
Tell him how much
you appreciate him.

00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:13.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Set the scene
softly and gently.

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:14.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:17.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: And then be very
clear, and very lucid,

00:45:17.970 --> 00:45:23.790 align:middle line:84%
and very, very to the point
about what needs to be changed.

00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:26.857 align:middle line:84%
But you'll never get anybody to
change anything, especially not

00:45:26.857 --> 00:45:30.840 align:middle line:84%
a man, if you humiliate him and
make him feel like a killer.

00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:32.490 align:middle line:90%
He'll just say, damn it.

00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:35.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to just be the
person that she thinks I am,

00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:37.520 align:middle line:84%
because she's not
giving me the juice.

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:39.954 align:middle line:84%
She's not giving me what
I need from a woman.

00:45:39.954 --> 00:45:40.870 align:middle line:90%
I need her tenderness.

00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:43.010 align:middle line:90%
And I need her acceptance.

00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll change
anything for her.

00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:48.436 align:middle line:84%
And the same for the-- does
that make any sense to you?

00:45:48.436 --> 00:45:49.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:49.810 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:45:49.810 --> 00:45:51.335 align:middle line:90%
It makes perfect sense.

00:45:51.335 --> 00:45:53.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: And the
same for the man.

00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:57.650 align:middle line:84%
Love your woman enough that
when she drives you nuts,

00:45:57.650 --> 00:45:59.560 align:middle line:90%
don't shout at her.

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:01.790 align:middle line:84%
Don't batter her
emotionally, God

00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:04.290 align:middle line:84%
knows, and certainly
not physically.

00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:05.220 align:middle line:90%
Take it.

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:07.480 align:middle line:90%
And then work on it.

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And then offer her
your love for her.

00:46:10.310 --> 00:46:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And then say, I would
be-- maybe I'm wrong,

00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:14.820 align:middle line:90%
but this is what I'm feeling.

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Please let me share with
you how, when you do that,

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.110 align:middle line:90%
it makes me feel.

00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And I know you don't
want me to feel that.

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:24.885 align:middle line:84%
So let's find another
way of doing this.

00:46:24.885 --> 00:46:27.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're
a brave generation.

00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:30.620 align:middle line:84%
This is the bridge generation
that has chosen to break away.

00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And also, it's
not-- we've chosen

00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:33.570 align:middle line:90%
to incarnate at this time.

00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:35.730 align:middle line:84%
And the frequencies,
the cosmic frequencies

00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:37.335 align:middle line:84%
are supporting this
transformation.

00:46:37.335 --> 00:46:38.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: We're
choosing to marry

00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:40.140 align:middle line:90%
the masculine and the feminine.

00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:42.280 align:middle line:90%
Everyone is on that journey.

00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:45.000 align:middle line:84%
That Jesus is coming
back to us, the Jesus

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.360 align:middle line:84%
of the sacred
marriage, to help us

00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:50.130 align:middle line:84%
fuse the masculine and feminine,
heaven and Earth, matter

00:46:50.130 --> 00:46:50.990 align:middle line:90%
and spirit.

00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And get on with the
business of transforming

00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:54.757 align:middle line:84%
the planet before
we all explode.

00:46:54.757 --> 00:46:55.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:58.840 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to go on from
there to one of the bridges.

00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:02.340 align:middle line:84%
And that can be the work
of Rumi and the concepts

00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:05.340 align:middle line:84%
that Rumi was trying
to-- well the divinity

00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:07.290 align:middle line:84%
that he was trying to
relate to humanity.

00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:09.325 align:middle line:84%
And you've been
studying Rumi for, what?

00:47:09.325 --> 00:47:09.940 align:middle line:90%
40 years.

00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:10.630 align:middle line:90%
This is your passion.

00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:11.921 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Although I'm only 42.

00:47:11.921 --> 00:47:13.014 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:47:13.014 --> 00:47:14.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Gosh,
you started early.

00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:16.719 align:middle line:84%
But then you did start reading
very young, I've heard.

00:47:16.719 --> 00:47:17.260 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: No.

00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:17.764 align:middle line:90%
I'm 60.

00:47:17.764 --> 00:47:18.520 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:21.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So with
Rumi, what is the piece

00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:25.960 align:middle line:84%
of Rumi in terms of the divinity
and purity of love from-- just

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:28.720 align:middle line:84%
from within between ourselves
and the divine-- not even

00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:30.830 align:middle line:84%
expressing yet with
another human being--

00:47:30.830 --> 00:47:34.960 align:middle line:84%
that you cherish so much
and can share with us?

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:38.583 align:middle line:84%
And the Christ concepts
that he also embraced.

00:47:38.583 --> 00:47:39.166 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:47:39.166 --> 00:47:40.457 align:middle line:90%
It all goes together, actually.

00:47:40.457 --> 00:47:42.630 align:middle line:84%
This is such a
momentous discovery

00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:45.190 align:middle line:84%
that's really been made
in the last 30 years.

00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:49.460 align:middle line:90%
And it goes like this.

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Rumi was, of course,
Islamic and Muslim.

00:47:53.090 --> 00:47:55.030 align:middle line:84%
But many people
don't know that Jesus

00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:57.190 align:middle line:84%
plays an immense
role in the Quran.

00:47:57.190 --> 00:48:00.950 align:middle line:84%
He is celebrated as a
great, great prophet.

00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:04.080 align:middle line:84%
And also, he's given the role
of bringing in the rule of God

00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:04.957 align:middle line:90%
at the end of time.

00:48:04.957 --> 00:48:06.665 align:middle line:84%
It isn't prophet
Muhammad who comes back.

00:48:06.665 --> 00:48:08.000 align:middle line:90%
It's Jesus.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.570 align:middle line:84%
Also, in the Sufi
mystical tradition,

00:48:10.570 --> 00:48:13.460 align:middle line:84%
the Islamic mystical
tradition, Jesus

00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:18.110 align:middle line:84%
appears to the mystic at
a time when that mystic

00:48:18.110 --> 00:48:20.410 align:middle line:84%
has achieved a level
of divine love.

00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:21.700 align:middle line:90%
And this is known.

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:24.570 align:middle line:84%
He appeared to Iba Nairobi, the
great mystical philosopher that

00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:27.300 align:middle line:84%
influenced Rumi,
and he undoubtedly

00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:29.450 align:middle line:90%
appeared to Rumi himself.

00:48:29.450 --> 00:48:31.520 align:middle line:84%
Because Jesus goes
beyond religion.

00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:34.700 align:middle line:84%
Jesus is the force of
divine love in action.

00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And when you are taken
by your realization

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:40.180 align:middle line:84%
to the place in which that is
beginning to be alive in you,

00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:42.280 align:middle line:84%
Jesus will appear to
you to guide you deeper

00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:45.020 align:middle line:84%
into it, whether you're Hindu,
or Buddhist, or Islamic.

00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:47.320 align:middle line:84%
This is something that the
mystics of the lovers of God

00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:49.190 align:middle line:90%
know.

00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:51.950 align:middle line:84%
The most important thing
that I could say about Rumi

00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:54.580 align:middle line:84%
is that Rumi lived
the Jesus life.

00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:57.300 align:middle line:84%
He was crucified
and resurrected.

00:48:57.300 --> 00:49:00.720 align:middle line:84%
He was crucified by
the agony of his love

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:02.200 align:middle line:90%
for Shams, his great teacher.

00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:03.500 align:middle line:90%
Because Shams was killed.

00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:04.190 align:middle line:90%
And he went mad.

00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And after three
years, he realized

00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:07.760 align:middle line:84%
that Shams was
living inside him.

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And he was resurrected
as a divine human

00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:13.715 align:middle line:84%
by this shattering,
amazing experience.

00:49:13.715 --> 00:49:19.600 align:middle line:84%
So he lived the
archetypal life that Jesus

00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:23.340 align:middle line:84%
came to give us, the
evolutionary Christ path.

00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:29.785 align:middle line:84%
And there are 82 poems that he
devoted to Jesus in his work.

00:49:29.785 --> 00:49:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to say something
which is pretty wild,

00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:35.470 align:middle line:84%
but actually part of a
secret tradition, which

00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:39.240 align:middle line:84%
I think it's time now
to reveal to the planet.

00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:41.970 align:middle line:90%
It goes like this.

00:49:41.970 --> 00:49:46.010 align:middle line:84%
We are living at the time of the
great birth of divine humanity.

00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:49.000 align:middle line:84%
That birth is the birth of
an embodied, divine humanity

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.960 align:middle line:84%
inspired by the fire
of love, impassioned

00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:53.930 align:middle line:84%
for justice and
compassion on every level.

00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:57.300 align:middle line:84%
It's a transformation
on every level.

00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:59.420 align:middle line:84%
The Second Coming that
people talk about,

00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:02.290 align:middle line:84%
and the fundamentalists make
into the return of a Star Wars

00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:06.720 align:middle line:84%
avatar is not the second
coming of Jesus, the person.

00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:10.660 align:middle line:84%
It's the rising of the golden
yeast of passionate love

00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:14.230 align:middle line:84%
consciousness in millions
and millions of human beings,

00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:17.230 align:middle line:84%
as a response to this
appalling evolutionary crisis

00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:19.950 align:middle line:84%
that we've created
out of our own lunacy.

00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And this passionate
love consciousness,

00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:24.330 align:middle line:84%
passionate for compassion,
passionate for harmony,

00:50:24.330 --> 00:50:27.230 align:middle line:84%
passionate for balance,
passionate for justice,

00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:30.250 align:middle line:84%
is rising now like
a golden yeast

00:50:30.250 --> 00:50:34.120 align:middle line:84%
in millions of human beings of
all kinds all over the world.

00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And as you will notice, the
greatest poet in the world now,

00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:42.470 align:middle line:84%
the poet who is most read in the
world, the poet that Buddhists

00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:45.810 align:middle line:84%
love, that Hindus love,
that Christians love,

00:50:45.810 --> 00:50:49.570 align:middle line:84%
that Muslims love,
is Jalal ad-Din Rumi.

00:50:49.570 --> 00:50:53.779 align:middle line:84%
So what Rumi's poetry is
doing, this incredible power

00:50:53.779 --> 00:50:55.570 align:middle line:84%
that's coming through
this incredible poet,

00:50:55.570 --> 00:50:58.850 align:middle line:84%
is softening up the
whole human race

00:50:58.850 --> 00:51:01.620 align:middle line:84%
for the rising of this
divine love consciousness.

00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:03.930 align:middle line:90%
They come together.

00:51:03.930 --> 00:51:07.820 align:middle line:84%
Jesus did his enormous work
of laying down the path.

00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Rumi came 13 centuries later to
give us this universal Christ

00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:17.260 align:middle line:90%
vision, whatever you call it.

00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:18.700 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't matter what you call it.

00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:23.460 align:middle line:84%
Universal intense vision
of love in action in poetry

00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:27.160 align:middle line:84%
that the whole world
could be intoxicated by.

00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:31.084 align:middle line:84%
And now the time has come for
the return of the real Jesus,

00:51:31.084 --> 00:51:33.042 align:middle line:84%
and the return of the
real Rumi, and the return

00:51:33.042 --> 00:51:36.940 align:middle line:84%
of all the lovers of God
that say, get going now.

00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:38.790 align:middle line:90%
Put love into action.

00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:40.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is
astoundingly put, too.

00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:42.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: You see, at
the end of his life,

00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:43.630 align:middle line:90%
Rumi wrote this quatrain.

00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And it was about his
relationship with Shams.

00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:47.110 align:middle line:90%
And this quatrain is the key.

00:51:47.110 --> 00:51:51.800 align:middle line:84%
He said-- he was talking
about his beloved, beloved

00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:54.530 align:middle line:84%
relationship with
his supreme teacher.

00:51:54.530 --> 00:52:01.780 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Those tender words we
said to one another have been

00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:05.660 align:middle line:84%
stored in the secret
heart of heaven.

00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And one day, like the rain,
they will fall and spread

00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:16.960 align:middle line:84%
and the whole world will
grow green with our love."

00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And the love that Shams and
Rumi birthed on the Earth

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:26.740 align:middle line:84%
is the embodied, divine,
passionate, tender love

00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:29.290 align:middle line:90%
of the Christ consciousness.

00:52:29.290 --> 00:52:31.500 align:middle line:90%
This burning relationship.

00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's that
burning relationship

00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:35.826 align:middle line:84%
that's the key to the
evolutionary transformation

00:52:35.826 --> 00:52:36.682 align:middle line:90%
of humanity.

00:52:36.682 --> 00:52:39.034 align:middle line:84%
The burning relationship
between human beings,

00:52:39.034 --> 00:52:41.450 align:middle line:84%
the burning relationship between
human beings and animals,

00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:44.420 align:middle line:84%
the burning relationship between
us and the glory of creation,

00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:47.040 align:middle line:84%
the burning relationship
between us and the whole,

00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:49.870 align:middle line:90%
blazing glory of the universe.

00:52:49.870 --> 00:52:53.370 align:middle line:84%
This is what will give us
the chutzpah, and the joy,

00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:56.880 align:middle line:84%
and the energy to get out
of our funk of paralysis,

00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:59.940 align:middle line:84%
and depression, and cynicism,
and irony, and boredom,

00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:04.890 align:middle line:84%
and start transforming
the world in and for God.

00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:08.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when I read Rumi,
what comes to me on, again,

00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:11.690 align:middle line:84%
almost a cellular
level, is that this

00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:16.090 align:middle line:84%
is above anything else
about our connection

00:53:16.090 --> 00:53:19.000 align:middle line:84%
to simply the
divine, higher aspect

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.360 align:middle line:90%
of our own being, our own soul.

00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:23.580 align:middle line:84%
Which is already
connected with all.

00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Well the beauty of
what he's trying to convey

00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:28.035 align:middle line:84%
is, first of all,
he's trying to arouse

00:53:28.035 --> 00:53:31.382 align:middle line:90%
a wild love for the beloved.

00:53:31.382 --> 00:53:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And then, as that
love progresses,

00:53:34.250 --> 00:53:36.750 align:middle line:84%
you realize something that
blows your brains out,

00:53:36.750 --> 00:53:40.240 align:middle line:84%
which is that you are the
beloved of the beloved.

00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And that the beloved is
living in you, as you.

00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And then the seeker and the
sought become one mystery.

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:51.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then, one
might contemplate tantra

00:53:51.530 --> 00:53:53.537 align:middle line:84%
with another human
being, from that place.

00:53:53.537 --> 00:53:54.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Because what you're
having a great love affair

00:53:56.840 --> 00:54:00.140 align:middle line:84%
with is a different aspect
of your own divine self,

00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:02.225 align:middle line:84%
to be cherished, and
respected, and nourished,

00:54:02.225 --> 00:54:06.850 align:middle line:84%
and held in the most infinite,
infinite, tender compassion.

00:54:06.850 --> 00:54:08.070 align:middle line:90%
This is the real tantra.

00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:11.480 align:middle line:84%
The rubbish that they're selling
in the great, terrible, smelly

00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:13.610 align:middle line:84%
bazaar of the new
age is rubbish.

00:54:13.610 --> 00:54:16.900 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to
do with tantra.

00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:19.940 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with a kind of
degraded form of athletics.

00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:22.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It keeps being shut
down by local police anyway.

00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:22.811 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: And I'm
not only saying this

00:54:22.811 --> 00:54:24.710 align:middle line:84%
because I can't fling leg
over the top of my shoulder.

00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:25.515 align:middle line:90%
It's not that.

00:54:25.515 --> 00:54:28.550 align:middle line:84%
It's that without this
vision, all of that

00:54:28.550 --> 00:54:31.247 align:middle line:84%
just becomes the higher
pornography, doesn't it?

00:54:31.247 --> 00:54:31.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:31.830 --> 00:54:32.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:54:32.330 --> 00:54:35.070 align:middle line:84%
So now you have been saying
these sorts of things publicly

00:54:35.070 --> 00:54:37.700 align:middle line:90%
and in churches, I suppose.

00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And now another-- we opened the
conversation talking about what

00:54:40.690 --> 00:54:42.260 align:middle line:84%
happened when you
and Matthew Fox

00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:44.180 align:middle line:90%
had your gathering in Oakland.

00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:47.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, you were also in
Charlotte recently.

00:54:47.490 --> 00:54:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And tell us a little bit
about what happened that day?

00:54:51.090 --> 00:54:53.442 align:middle line:84%
To show how people
are opening to this.

00:54:53.442 --> 00:54:55.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Well what
happened was that I'd

00:54:55.150 --> 00:54:56.800 align:middle line:84%
given-- I have a
sacred leadership

00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:59.945 align:middle line:84%
school with a magnificent
man called Chris Sade, who's

00:54:59.945 --> 00:55:00.820 align:middle line:90%
doing momentous work.

00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:03.710 align:middle line:84%
He's really being
a champion of what

00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:05.330 align:middle line:84%
he calls second
wave spirituality.

00:55:05.330 --> 00:55:07.540 align:middle line:84%
First, the new age,
which did good things,

00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:09.230 align:middle line:84%
but became hopelessly
narcissistic.

00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:11.620 align:middle line:84%
Now the second wave,
which has to be engaged

00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:16.180 align:middle line:84%
spirituality, otherwise we
are truly up you know where.

00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:17.660 align:middle line:90%
And he's fabulous.

00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And I gave a talk on
Jesus, this Jesus,

00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:23.490 align:middle line:90%
to a Unity Church in Charlotte.

00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:27.065 align:middle line:84%
And I just, I must say I was
like an old cabaret singer who

00:55:27.065 --> 00:55:29.540 align:middle line:90%
flung away-- I just went for it.

00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:33.640 align:middle line:84%
Because it's much too late not
to go for it at this moment.

00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:36.260 align:middle line:90%
And the reaction was fantastic.

00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:41.810 align:middle line:84%
People are hungry to be allowed
an intimate relationship

00:55:41.810 --> 00:55:44.140 align:middle line:84%
with this incredible
being and the revelation.

00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And they just all came
up afterwards and said,

00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:49.630 align:middle line:84%
thank god you're saying it,
because we've always felt it.

00:55:49.630 --> 00:55:52.950 align:middle line:84%
We've always intuited it,
but people weren't telling us

00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:54.980 align:middle line:84%
that this was the
real relationship.

00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:58.500 align:middle line:84%
Now we have you-- you've
been mad enough to show it.

00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:01.285 align:middle line:84%
So now we can go mad with
love and do the same thing.

00:56:01.285 --> 00:56:02.544 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What did the pastor?

00:56:02.544 --> 00:56:03.460 align:middle line:90%
Is it called a pastor?

00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:04.290 align:middle line:90%
A minister?

00:56:04.290 --> 00:56:05.456 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: She's a priest.

00:56:05.456 --> 00:56:06.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What did she say?

00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:07.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: She's an old
and great friend of mine,

00:56:07.970 --> 00:56:09.670 align:middle line:90%
and she sort of mopped her brow.

00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And she said, my god,
this is the real thing.

00:56:12.010 --> 00:56:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be
establishing a new church.

00:56:14.350 --> 00:56:17.085 align:middle line:84%
We're going to call it the
Church of the Living Christ.

00:56:17.085 --> 00:56:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to
be the head of it,

00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:21.840 align:middle line:84%
because there's not
going to be any head.

00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:23.509 align:middle line:10%
But I'm going to
be a kind of-- I'm

00:56:23.509 --> 00:56:26.050 align:middle line:10%
going to be the gay godfather
of the new Church of the Living

00:56:26.050 --> 00:56:26.549 align:middle line:10%
Christ.

00:56:26.549 --> 00:56:27.160 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:27.624 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: But they're
changing their Unity Church?

00:56:27.624 --> 00:56:27.645 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:56:27.645 --> 00:56:27.710 align:middle line:10%
There you go.

00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:30.030 align:middle line:10%
>>HARVEY: It's about time we
had a few gay Christs around,

00:56:30.030 --> 00:56:30.290 align:middle line:10%
right?

00:56:30.290 --> 00:56:30.394 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:56:30.394 --> 00:56:31.060 align:middle line:10%
It's about time.

00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:33.790 align:middle line:10%
>>AUDIENCE: Women Christs,
gay Christs, straight Christs.

00:56:33.790 --> 00:56:35.862 align:middle line:10%
That's what's needed.

00:56:35.862 --> 00:56:37.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's all
the same spirit.

00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:38.285 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: It is.

00:56:38.285 --> 00:56:39.660 align:middle line:90%
With just different roles.

00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:40.670 align:middle line:90%
And different functions.

00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:41.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Different faces.

00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:43.180 align:middle line:90%
And I would like to ask you.

00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:44.763 align:middle line:84%
We only have a couple
of minutes left.

00:56:44.763 --> 00:56:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to ask
you for all the people

00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:50.300 align:middle line:84%
that are now hungry for more
of this information and work,

00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:52.800 align:middle line:84%
can you tell us-- you
have so many books.

00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:55.150 align:middle line:84%
"Son of Man, The
Mystical Path to Christ."

00:56:55.150 --> 00:56:56.390 align:middle line:90%
Right here.

00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:56.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: This is
truly the book I

00:56:56.790 --> 00:56:57.340 align:middle line:84%
love the most that
I've ever written.

00:56:57.340 --> 00:56:58.840 align:middle line:90%
It took 20 years to write it.

00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And many, many breakdowns
and breakthroughs.

00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And everything that I've ever
really experienced about him

00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:06.130 align:middle line:90%
is in this book.

00:57:06.130 --> 00:57:09.299 align:middle line:84%
And it has the inspiration of my
great teacher, Bede Griffiths,

00:57:09.299 --> 00:57:10.090 align:middle line:90%
running through it.

00:57:10.090 --> 00:57:11.980 align:middle line:84%
And there are tape
sets that I did

00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:14.320 align:middle line:84%
for Sounds True called
"Radiant Heart."

00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:15.676 align:middle line:90%
And "Son of Man."

00:57:15.676 --> 00:57:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And in "Radiant Heart,"
what I'm trying to do

00:57:17.550 --> 00:57:21.356 align:middle line:84%
is to help Christians get to
the buried mystical practices

00:57:21.356 --> 00:57:22.980 align:middle line:84%
of Christianity that
can help them have

00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:24.720 align:middle line:84%
this flaming, passionate,
intimate relationship.

00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:25.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they're
present in this book?

00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:28.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: They're present in
that book and in that tape set.

00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:31.170 align:middle line:84%
So the revolution has been under
preparation for quite a while.

00:57:31.170 --> 00:57:33.700 align:middle line:90%
But now, it's time.

00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is indeed.

00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:38.621 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, I'm always
left, as you say,

00:57:38.621 --> 00:57:40.120 align:middle line:84%
gob-smacked, in
British terminology.

00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:40.610 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: I love gob-smacked.

00:57:40.610 --> 00:57:42.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I love
gob-smacked, too.

00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:45.540 align:middle line:84%
But I'm also left
breathless at your words.

00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:48.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have the
ability, I don't know who

00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:50.350 align:middle line:84%
or what you've been
from times past,

00:57:50.350 --> 00:57:52.160 align:middle line:84%
but you have the
ability to reach people

00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:53.440 align:middle line:90%
on a very, very deep level.

00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank you so much
again for being here with us.

00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Thank you
very, very much.

00:57:57.600 --> 00:57:58.767 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being touched.

00:57:58.767 --> 00:58:00.725 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you're
inspired by Andrew's words,

00:58:00.725 --> 00:58:02.320 align:middle line:84%
you can then delve
deeper through one

00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:04.290 align:middle line:84%
of his many books
available on Amazon

00:58:04.290 --> 00:58:05.790 align:middle line:90%
and other major booksellers.

00:58:05.790 --> 00:58:08.200 align:middle line:84%
Andrew also supports the
works of other great authors,

00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:10.910 align:middle line:84%
such as Chris Sade,
and Cynthia Bourgeault,

00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:12.390 align:middle line:90%
which we mentioned earlier.

00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And you can do some of that
for further, quality research.

00:58:15.110 --> 00:58:19.410 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
