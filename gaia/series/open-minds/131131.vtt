00:00:27.426 --> 00:00:30.050 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: I don't think
there is a person among us who

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.810 align:middle line:10%
has not sunk into either anger
or despair over the unfairness

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.550 align:middle line:10%
regarding bailouts
of the big banks

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.810 align:middle line:10%
while the citizens are
left paying the bill.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.220 align:middle line:84%
As our guest today, who goes
by the name of Citizen Zeus,

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.680 align:middle line:84%
our global economic
system has given itself

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.150 align:middle line:84%
over to nothing short
of outright lawlessness.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.470 align:middle line:84%
But how did we get
here, and what will it

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.170 align:middle line:84%
take to reestablish
value, true value,

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.400 align:middle line:90%
in democratic capitalism?

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.457 align:middle line:84%
Zeus, I have to say, you're
an incredibly clear thinker.

00:00:58.457 --> 00:00:59.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CITIZEN ZEUS: Thank you.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.415 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The points
that you've made in this

00:01:01.415 --> 00:01:06.190 align:middle line:84%
really inspire a person to
want to do the right thing,

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.330 align:middle line:84%
even though to do
the right thing

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.990 align:middle line:90%
has short-term sacrifices.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of our
economy, I mean,

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.020 align:middle line:84%
everyone can see
the flaws in that,

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.950 align:middle line:84%
but there isn't
economy without people.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.370 align:middle line:84%
We're driving the economy,
either by our complacency,

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.860 align:middle line:84%
which is a passive buy-in,
or by conscious choices,

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.060 align:middle line:84%
because of the illusions set
forth by media and so forth as

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.200 align:middle line:90%
to what a prosperous life is.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think you've
done a beautiful job

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.490 align:middle line:90%
of delineating this.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go
into as many points

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.550 align:middle line:90%
as-- were talking off camera.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.240 align:middle line:84%
This could be a
three-hour conversation,

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.614 align:middle line:84%
so we're going to
reduce it down.

00:01:40.614 --> 00:01:43.650 align:middle line:84%
But first of all, you're a
philosopher of education.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.230 align:middle line:84%
How did this extend over
into such a deep analysis

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.540 align:middle line:84%
of how the economy
works and should work?

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.280 align:middle line:10%
>>ZEUS: Well, my background
in philosophy of education

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.880 align:middle line:10%
was within an interdisciplinary,
sort of interdepartmental sort

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:04.410 align:middle line:10%
of study and involved history,
philosophy, psychology,

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.140 align:middle line:10%
anthropology, sociology.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.650 align:middle line:84%
So what happens when
you begin to bring

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.440 align:middle line:84%
these different lenses
of study together

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.710 align:middle line:84%
is you start noticing that they
all reference phenomena, what

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.380 align:middle line:84%
might seem like
separate phenomena,

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.560 align:middle line:84%
like for instance
with the economy.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.630 align:middle line:90%
You know, I can't pay the rent.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.960 align:middle line:84%
Or why haven't we had a
minimum wage raise in, like,

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.015 align:middle line:90%
10 to 15 years?

00:02:31.015 --> 00:02:36.540 align:middle line:90%


00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.080 align:middle line:84%
You start to see in
the process of going

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.210 align:middle line:84%
from these different
lenses that it's not just

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.570 align:middle line:84%
this one instance, that there's
a larger, underlying issue

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.890 align:middle line:90%
happening here.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.997 align:middle line:84%
And that's the start to a
deeper and larger investigation.

00:02:53.997 --> 00:02:55.330 align:middle line:90%
Now I did that with self-esteem.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.870 align:middle line:84%
My dissertation
was on self-esteem

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.740 align:middle line:84%
and developing an interpersonal
notion of self and self-esteem.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed in
self-esteem that it

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.430 align:middle line:84%
was either very task
oriented and individualistic,

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.020 align:middle line:84%
or there was this sort of
emphasis on global self-esteem

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.760 align:middle line:84%
or in some sense also
self-esteem in relationship,

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.320 align:middle line:84%
but usually just in
terms of dating well

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.860 align:middle line:90%
or doing something like this.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.560 align:middle line:84%
What I thought was
instead of having

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.310 align:middle line:84%
an individualistic notion, we
learn and develop true worth

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.380 align:middle line:84%
in these really meaningful,
supportive relationships.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.960 align:middle line:84%
I can have all kinds of ideas
in my head about who I am

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.590 align:middle line:84%
and what I'm worth, but
if it has no reference,

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.550 align:middle line:90%
it's not gonna matter.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It has to be in
relationship to something.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Absolutely,
and the economy

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.930 align:middle line:90%
is very similar to that.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.180 align:middle line:84%
I noticed, looking
at the economy,

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.960 align:middle line:84%
we have a very, very
balkanized or fragmented,

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.590 align:middle line:84%
individualistic
notion of what it

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.240 align:middle line:84%
means to be a participant
in the economy.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.250 align:middle line:90%
You know, we are consumers.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.700 align:middle line:90%
What is my salary?

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.340 align:middle line:90%
What is my education?

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.835 align:middle line:84%
And it just goes
on and on and on.

00:04:04.835 --> 00:04:05.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We compete.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Right, and
even the family,

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.770 align:middle line:84%
which is one of the big
units for the economy,

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.080 align:middle line:84%
is seen as a kind of
abstract, isolated thing

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.880 align:middle line:90%
in and of itself.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.710 align:middle line:84%
You know, what are you going
to get for your family?

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.300 align:middle line:84%
These big sports
stars have said,

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.761 align:middle line:90%
I have to work for my family.

00:04:18.761 --> 00:04:20.010 align:middle line:90%
But it's like, no, you're not.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.779 align:middle line:90%
These are extensions of you.

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:22.660 align:middle line:90%
You have $32 million.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.450 align:middle line:84%
It's not about your
family at this point.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.400 align:middle line:84%
So what's happened is that
we have a notion of economy

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.510 align:middle line:84%
really built around
the self, the ego,

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.260 align:middle line:84%
largely, very much in the same
way that self-esteem had that.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And I started to begin
to notice similarities

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.340 align:middle line:84%
between my work with
learning and education

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.220 align:middle line:84%
and the way in which the economy
is understood and enacted

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.730 align:middle line:90%
in our society.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And add that with my
background from all

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.800 align:middle line:84%
these different disciplines,
and all of a sudden

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.920 align:middle line:84%
I started to put
the pieces together.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.564 align:middle line:84%
And it just started
to build on itself.

00:05:01.564 --> 00:05:03.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you
did a beautiful job.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm really torn because you
have these short papers which

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.030 align:middle line:84%
are kind of to be used
for really talking points

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.660 align:middle line:84%
for community
gatherings and such,

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.670 align:middle line:84%
and really beautifully
done to bring

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.290 align:middle line:84%
especially small communities
together that are frustrated.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.380 align:middle line:84%
The infrastructure
doesn't work for them,

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.450 align:middle line:84%
where people have to
start coming together.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And I see this everywhere,
so I can see this

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.730 align:middle line:84%
as a guideline for the starting
of a new kind of community

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:35.970 align:middle line:84%
relationship between people
and even institutional entities

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.530 align:middle line:90%
if they'll participate.

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.760 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
refer to these.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.680 align:middle line:84%
Even though I have,
like, pages and pages

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.300 align:middle line:84%
of questions I've
already written,

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm so impressed with this.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.330 align:middle line:84%
So let's start out
with one question

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.920 align:middle line:84%
before we go to this, which
is "The 10 shocking practices

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.550 align:middle line:90%
in the US and global economy.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.250 align:middle line:90%


00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.469 align:middle line:90%
I've studied this a bit.

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And I know of some
of it, but I don't

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.259 align:middle line:84%
think I really understood,
till you went through point

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:06.360 align:middle line:84%
by point, with any clarity how
sick the system has become.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.760 align:middle line:84%
As you say, it's riddled with
a devouring kind of cancer,

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.600 align:middle line:90%
the actual economic system.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.290 align:middle line:84%
So let's start out with the
question of imaginary worth,

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:21.450 align:middle line:84%
the empire of debt, and
that real worth cannot be

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.340 align:middle line:84%
fabricated, as you
say in the book.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.250 align:middle line:90%
We'll start there.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:25.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: In the introduction
and the conclusion,

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.570 align:middle line:84%
I reinforce this,
but I really begin

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.330 align:middle line:84%
to explain sort of where
the disease started

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:31.960 align:middle line:90%
in that chapter.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And really, worth is created
by effort, by creativity,

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.590 align:middle line:84%
by something you're
bringing into the world

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.090 align:middle line:90%
and giving and sharing.

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And imaginary worth is created
by taking someone's giving,

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:59.070 align:middle line:84%
multiplying it in
an illusory way,

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.700 align:middle line:84%
and convincing other
people that you actually

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.977 align:middle line:84%
have given something
yourself, where you yourself

00:07:05.977 --> 00:07:07.060 align:middle line:90%
have not created anything.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.910 align:middle line:84%
You haven't produced
anything, but you

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.060 align:middle line:90%
said, oh, I'm the capitalist.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:15.970 align:middle line:84%
I put the money into
buying this idea,

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:17.590 align:middle line:90%
so I am now the controller.

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:19.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm the ruler of this process.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason, our economy
and people in our economy

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.978 align:middle line:90%
bought that.

00:07:27.978 --> 00:07:32.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we actually
chose to turn a blind eye.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.140 align:middle line:84%
I think we first
were just ignorant.

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:40.240 align:middle line:84%
We didn't understand that anyone
was capable of these practices,

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.570 align:middle line:84%
no less our own banking
institutions and government.

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:45.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't think anyone
would have suspected

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:46.990 align:middle line:90%
this is what was going on.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:48.880 align:middle line:84%
Then we started
learning a little bit.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.650 align:middle line:84%
I think 2008 and the
bailouts of the bank

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:53.460 align:middle line:84%
was kind of the first
hint most people got

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.840 align:middle line:84%
that something wasn't
done correctly here

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.710 align:middle line:90%
to create this problem.

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:02.110 align:middle line:84%
But no one understood
the full extent of it.

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And also when they did,
it was so overwhelming,

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:09.350 align:middle line:84%
and you felt so powerless
in the face of this,

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:13.080 align:middle line:84%
that we then chose collectively
to turn a blind eye.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.520 align:middle line:84%
People just wanted to get
their credit ratings back, get

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.350 align:middle line:84%
another house if they
lost their house,

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.330 align:middle line:84%
so they didn't have time
to think about this.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:23.140 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about this, because
the implications are huge.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:27.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: They are huge, and
a quick comment on that.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.010 align:middle line:84%
I think the reason why people
have turned a blind eye

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.064 align:middle line:84%
is because it's so
systematic and overwhelming.

00:08:33.064 --> 00:08:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things that brought

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.640 align:middle line:84%
me to bring this book forward
is to say, don't worry.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.320 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot more simple than
they're making it seem.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.809 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot more clear than
they're making it seem.

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:46.470 align:middle line:84%
They're using this notion that
it's extraordinarily complex,

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:49.860 align:middle line:84%
and you're just going
to have to trust us,

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.050 align:middle line:84%
to keep you from cutting
through what is actually

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:56.250 align:middle line:84%
a fairly simple con game
and a fairly simple disease.

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, cancer is
difficult to deal with,

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.290 align:middle line:84%
but it's fairly simple
in its inception.

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Its cells whose DNAs have
changed and are now reproducing

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:08.774 align:middle line:90%
without any kind of regulation.

00:09:08.774 --> 00:09:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And they're creating damage
for the rest of the body

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:14.030 align:middle line:84%
because they're just
taking over the body.

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:17.200 align:middle line:90%
Now what's the response to that?

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.840 align:middle line:84%
We can talk about it
because part of it

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.540 align:middle line:84%
is the diagnosis,
you know, which

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.650 align:middle line:84%
I had in one of
those documents just

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:25.320 align:middle line:84%
to show you how
outrageous it's gotten.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And the other part is now
what can we do about it?

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:30.950 align:middle line:84%
How can we create
alternatives that are healthy

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:31.920 align:middle line:90%
and that challenge it?

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.186 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely, so
let's go through the challenges

00:09:35.186 --> 00:09:36.810 align:middle line:84%
because you just lay
it out like it is.

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:38.340 align:middle line:90%
OK, so we're starting backward.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:39.650 align:middle line:90%
This is 1 through 10.

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:43.260 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's called "10 Shocking
Practices of the US and Global

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.060 align:middle line:90%
Economy."

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Starting with number 10,
loading the national debt

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:50.100 align:middle line:84%
on younger generations who
neither borrowed nor benefited,

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.984 align:middle line:90%
that is unethical.

00:09:52.984 --> 00:09:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Extraordinarily,
I mean, the way

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:58.290 align:middle line:84%
that I put it is, you know,
I have older people talking

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:01.000 align:middle line:84%
about the young people
using their credit cards

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.300 align:middle line:84%
and charging them up for a
couple of hundred dollars.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, the older generation
has taken out a $19 trillion

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:13.204 align:middle line:84%
credit card, maxed it out
on the younger generation,

00:10:13.204 --> 00:10:14.870 align:middle line:84%
and they're the ones
benefiting from it.

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:16.200 align:middle line:84%
The younger
generation had nothing

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.533 align:middle line:90%
to do with generating this debt.

00:10:17.533 --> 00:10:19.360 align:middle line:84%
They did not benefit
from this debt.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.590 align:middle line:84%
In fact, more debt is
being piled on them

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:23.530 align:middle line:84%
with really extravagant
college costs

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:26.200 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, and then they
have the older generation,

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.390 align:middle line:84%
their parents, handing
them the credit card

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:29.950 align:middle line:90%
and going, oh, by the way.

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:32.250 align:middle line:84%
Here's $19 trillion that
I spent which you're

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:34.070 align:middle line:90%
going to have to pay off.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:36.792 align:middle line:90%
So it's outrageous to the max.

00:10:36.792 --> 00:10:38.165 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it is.

00:10:38.165 --> 00:10:39.850 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
these poor kids

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:44.150 align:middle line:84%
are struggling to even find a
means of supporting themselves.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:45.970 align:middle line:84%
It's not the world
that we inherited.

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:47.710 align:middle line:90%
Theirs is a depleted world.

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:49.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Exactly,
and it's depleted

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:53.080 align:middle line:84%
because, much like a cancer,
all of the available resources

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.430 align:middle line:84%
are being sucked into
the multiplication

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:59.200 align:middle line:84%
of a particular segment
of the population that

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.640 align:middle line:84%
is only interested in expanding
and concentrating wealth

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:07.700 align:middle line:84%
and the results of productivity
in their own lives.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:11.160 align:middle line:84%
And no healthy system
operates that way.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.370 align:middle line:84%
Healthy systems
always have diversity.

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:14.990 align:middle line:90%
They have exchange.

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:17.950 align:middle line:84%
They have sharing,
in a word, sharing.

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And when you have taking
motivating everything,

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:24.310 align:middle line:84%
you always go toward
death, death of a system.

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:27.170 align:middle line:84%
Now death doesn't have
to be a bad thing, right?

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:30.250 align:middle line:90%


00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:31.950 align:middle line:84%
Bad systems can
undermine themselves,

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:34.770 align:middle line:84%
but we need a healthy
response to that system.

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And right now,
we're in the middle

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:41.920 align:middle line:84%
of recognizing that this is in
no way sustainable or healthy.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:47.250 align:middle line:84%
So that's what partly motivated
this top 10 most outrageous

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:50.770 align:middle line:84%
list because I want people
to really be able to focus in

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:52.710 align:middle line:90%
on how we got here.

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:53.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I totally agree.

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:56.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, yeah, this is
the unpleasantness of it,

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:59.000 align:middle line:84%
but then we're going to get
into the other part after.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.310 align:middle line:84%
OK, so number nine,
which is rehypothecation,

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:05.350 align:middle line:84%
and it's using the
same collateral

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:06.830 align:middle line:90%
for different transactions.

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:09.050 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what that means
and what would happen if we

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:10.800 align:middle line:90%
tried to do that in our lives.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Absolutely, let's
say you had a house,

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.290 align:middle line:84%
and you had the ability to
use that house as collateral

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:17.506 align:middle line:90%
to buy 100 houses.

00:12:17.506 --> 00:12:20.830 align:middle line:90%


00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And the banks actually
went for it, right?

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:28.400 align:middle line:84%
So you have every incentive
to make outrageous risks

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:32.310 align:middle line:84%
in a whole bunch of different
housing markets on the hope

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:35.680 align:middle line:84%
that one of them turns up
to have increased its value.

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And then you cash
out, and you get.

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:39.490 align:middle line:84%
Now on all the other
houses that you've

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:42.190 align:middle line:84%
used your house as collateral
for, let's say half of them

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:45.490 align:middle line:84%
went down and only
10 of them went up.

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Then you can just
sort of default

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.011 align:middle line:90%
on all those other ones.

00:12:49.011 --> 00:12:50.510 align:middle line:84%
You can default on
your house, which

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:52.380 align:middle line:84%
is the only collateral
you put up with,

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:55.860 align:middle line:84%
and now the banks have to
fight over that collateral.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:13:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And it can't pay for nearly
all of the losses that

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.240 align:middle line:90%
are generated.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:05.160 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, in
finance that has

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.990 align:middle line:84%
been standard practice with
these financial industries.

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:11.370 align:middle line:84%
They will use the
same-- and again, it's

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:15.400 align:middle line:84%
hidden behind these allegedly
complex financial schemes

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.330 align:middle line:90%
and derivatives.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.180 align:middle line:84%
But they basically are
using the same collateral.

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:20.430 align:middle line:90%
It's just much like a house.

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:22.410 align:middle line:84%
They might call it
an asset, or they

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:27.190 align:middle line:84%
might say, a small reserve, but
a very small reserve in a bank

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:28.010 align:middle line:90%
account.

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And then they will just
simply leverage that and say,

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:33.890 align:middle line:84%
you know, it counts for all
these other investments.

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:37.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, right,
it should be illegal.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:42.080 align:middle line:84%
So if we go to the bank, and
we want to, say, take out

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:46.070 align:middle line:84%
a loan for a car,
and maybe they're

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:48.580 align:middle line:84%
looking sideways at you
a bit because you've

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.640 align:middle line:84%
had a little ding on your credit
rating somewhere along the way,

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.870 align:middle line:84%
then you have to
put up collateral,

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:56.340 align:middle line:84%
something significant
which they will

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:59.950 align:middle line:84%
come and take away from you if
you start missing a payment.

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:02.060 align:middle line:84%
So that's how they
work on our end.

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:04.130 align:middle line:84%
How they work on
their end is just

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:05.640 align:middle line:90%
sort of criminal in that sense.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:09.754 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Right, because
they did these practices.

00:14:09.754 --> 00:14:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to
get ahead of myself,

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:12.980 align:middle line:84%
so I won't get into
the rest of the list.

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.590 align:middle line:84%
But they did these practices,
and there were no consequences.

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:18.680 align:middle line:84%
There has not been a
significant investigation,

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:23.840 align:middle line:84%
much less prosecution, of any
significance to any company.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.100 align:middle line:84%
They have a couple of bad
apples that they pulled out,

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.490 align:middle line:90%
and even those were very few.

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And they had to be ridiculous,
like Bernie Madoff--

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:32.770 align:middle line:90%
no accountability, zero.

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
causing the outrage,

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.210 align:middle line:84%
both in terms of left and
right political spectrum,

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:38.550 align:middle line:90%
across the spectrum.

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:42.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK, number
eight, fractional reserve, poof,

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:44.610 align:middle line:90%
the magical money multiplier.

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Yeah, well, a lot
of people don't know this,

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:51.070 align:middle line:84%
but your bank can
basically fabricate money.

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:53.100 align:middle line:84%
All it needs is a
tenth of a reserve,

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.440 align:middle line:90%
and it can write loans.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:58.970 align:middle line:84%
If it has $100,000, it can
write loans for $1 million.

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:02.730 align:middle line:84%
It can basically multiply
its money by a factor of 10--

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:05.580 align:middle line:84%
and it's allowed to
do this-- in order

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:07.206 align:middle line:84%
to, in quotes,
"increase money supply."

00:15:07.206 --> 00:15:08.746 align:middle line:84%
But it's not increasing
money supply.

00:15:08.746 --> 00:15:11.210 align:middle line:84%
It's increasing debt supply
because it's not real money.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:14.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly, yeah, and
they charge interest on that

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:14.210 align:middle line:90%
money that they--

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:16.001 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Of course they
do, the funny money.

00:15:16.001 --> 00:15:18.256 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --loan out.

00:15:18.256 --> 00:15:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And that one, I
think, is the one

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:24.420 align:middle line:84%
that people are most familiar
with, that particular one-- OK,

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:28.620 align:middle line:84%
this one, mark to model or
mark to fantasy accounting.

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:30.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Right, this
is another one.

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:32.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, again, this is where
this alleged complexity comes

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:33.760 align:middle line:90%
in.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.210 align:middle line:90%
It's a very simple con game.

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:36.790 align:middle line:90%
OK, listen.

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:41.800 align:middle line:84%
If I want to
leverage what I have,

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.810 align:middle line:84%
if I want to say I have a
lot of assets, I'm rich,

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:47.870 align:middle line:84%
the way that I talk about it
is if I were like these banks,

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:51.690 align:middle line:84%
I could valuate my
kitty litter box

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:57.979 align:middle line:84%
is a million dollars because my
mathematical models say it is.

00:15:57.979 --> 00:16:00.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're creating
the mathematical model.

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Exactly, and my
created mathematical model

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.930 align:middle line:84%
and its circular
logic reinforces

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:08.690 align:middle line:84%
this supposedly independent
valuation of my kitty litter

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:09.490 align:middle line:90%
box.

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:12.745 align:middle line:84%
And what I have in
the book is, you know,

00:16:12.745 --> 00:16:14.710 align:middle line:84%
imagine me being
able to do that.

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:17.150 align:middle line:84%
This is mark to fantasy,
or mark to model,

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:18.510 align:middle line:90%
my mathematical model.

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And then I take that and
leverage that another 100-fold

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:25.140 align:middle line:84%
or 1,000-fold to buy up a
multi-billion-dollar dollar

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:27.280 align:middle line:90%
company.

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.182 align:middle line:84%
And then if I deal with
private equity firms,

00:16:29.182 --> 00:16:31.390 align:middle line:84%
then I will just try to
hollow it out and get as much

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:34.610 align:middle line:84%
out of it as I can and then let
it go bankrupt and walk away.

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:41.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's outrageous that,
purely on my say so, I can say,

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:45.330 align:middle line:84%
all those houses out there that
have just got foreclosed upon

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:48.460 align:middle line:84%
are still as high,
maybe even higher,

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:51.210 align:middle line:84%
than they were at the
peak of the market.

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to come to
terms with taking a loss,

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:58.210 align:middle line:84%
so I simply just say,
I assess it at this.

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's what it is,
according to our models.

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:05.619 align:middle line:84%
And our portfolio is still
as healthy as it's ever been,

00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:07.480 align:middle line:84%
even though it has
no relationship

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:08.990 align:middle line:90%
whatsoever to the market.

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And there's no one forcing
them to have any kind

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.060 align:middle line:90%
of relationship to the market.

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm sensitive to plunging
prices bringing it well

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:19.107 align:middle line:84%
below its market value,
so I have suggested

00:17:19.107 --> 00:17:20.190 align:middle line:90%
something very reasonable.

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:23.069 align:middle line:84%
I've said, bring it to
the inflation index.

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:24.740 align:middle line:84%
In other words, draw
that little dotted

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:28.230 align:middle line:84%
line of where the average
house prices have been,

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:30.250 align:middle line:84%
and then bring it
down to that line.

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:32.920 align:middle line:84%
You know, so then you can't
claim that you've been shorted,

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.780 align:middle line:84%
and you're going
well below that.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.110 align:middle line:90%
But they don't do that.

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:39.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, nothing in it
for them, like massive profits,

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:42.380 align:middle line:90%
OK, number six is toxic assets.

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Right, this
is a special, like,

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:47.650 align:middle line:84%
[GROANING] of mine
because the term,

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:52.020 align:middle line:84%
toxic assets, itself is an
inherently incoherent term.

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:55.280 align:middle line:84%
Nothing that is an
asset can be toxic.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:58.300 align:middle line:90%
Toxics are 100% liability.

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:00.420 align:middle line:90%
Assets are 100% benefit.

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.960 align:middle line:84%
You can't stick
those two together.

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:06.700 align:middle line:84%
So how did we ever come up
with this term, toxic asset,

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.696 align:middle line:90%
as a meaningful term?

00:18:08.696 --> 00:18:11.280 align:middle line:90%


00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:12.440 align:middle line:90%
That's a good question.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:15.800 align:middle line:84%
I know what it serves
for these people.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:20.180 align:middle line:84%
It serves to have
these companies deny

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:22.910 align:middle line:84%
their accountability
and responsibility.

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:27.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it like these toxic
assets just happen to them?

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:28.302 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEUS: Yes, yes.

00:18:28.302 --> 00:18:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's how
they position it or spin it.

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:33.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: I think that's
how they position it.

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, they
blame it on the little guy.

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Oh, these people were
defaulting on their mortgage

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:40.770 align:middle line:84%
so that infected the
mortgage-backed securities

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:42.360 align:middle line:84%
and all the derivatives
that we have.

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And now those aren't
worth anything.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's really, you
know, the little people

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:49.650 align:middle line:84%
who overextended themselves
that created the problem

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:51.450 align:middle line:90%
and made these toxic.

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:54.350 align:middle line:84%
What happened, though, in
reality, is they leveraged.

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:55.830 align:middle line:90%
They multiplied.

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:59.290 align:middle line:84%
We could have easily paid
off the entire mortgage

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:02.790 align:middle line:84%
of every person in
default in the biggest

00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:06.230 align:middle line:84%
default in this country's
history for about $1 trillion.

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And instead, we spent
about $12 trillion

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:11.726 align:middle line:84%
bailing these guys
out, $12 trillion.

00:19:11.726 --> 00:19:13.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
ticks people off.

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Because they
multiplied them, right?

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:18.580 align:middle line:84%
That toxicity could not have
been created by the little guy.

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:21.050 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, its maximum
would have been $1 trillion

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:22.166 align:middle line:90%
to buy up every asset.

00:19:22.166 --> 00:19:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And you could have still
gotten at least 40%,

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:26.302 align:middle line:84%
50%, 60% out of
that, so it would

00:19:26.302 --> 00:19:27.810 align:middle line:90%
have been than less than that.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:29.830 align:middle line:84%
But because they were
based in real assets,

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:32.720 align:middle line:84%
they have some value, going
back to our original question.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.910 align:middle line:84%
But when you start spinning it
out into its imaginary value,

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:38.740 align:middle line:84%
now you've got
nothing but toxins

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:41.650 align:middle line:84%
being created by
the finance industry

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:45.580 align:middle line:84%
and not taking
responsibility for it.

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:51.450 align:middle line:84%
So this accountability,
explaining

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:53.100 align:middle line:84%
this about toxic
assets, is to say, no.

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:54.330 align:middle line:90%
It isn't you.

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:55.990 align:middle line:84%
The toxins are
not being created,

00:19:55.990 --> 00:20:00.060 align:middle line:84%
even by irresponsible borrowing,
you know, hopeful borrowing.

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And you're probably going to
have the consequence for that

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.282 align:middle line:90%
anyway.

00:20:04.282 --> 00:20:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And explain what
you mean by hopeful borrowing.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Well, that's part
of the American ethic.

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:11.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a part
of the American dream

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:15.557 align:middle line:84%
that I have some problems with,
this notion of aspiration.

00:20:15.557 --> 00:20:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And you have a dream,
and you're going

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:19.760 align:middle line:84%
to borrow against just
on a hope and a prayer.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And you want to live
the American dream.

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:24.128 align:middle line:84%
And you want to have that house,
and maybe you don't really

00:20:24.128 --> 00:20:26.280 align:middle line:90%
have the money to pay for it.

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.667 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, you're
going to get that job.

00:20:28.667 --> 00:20:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, that is part
of what it is to be an American,

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.579 align:middle line:90%
is to dream the American dream.

00:20:34.579 --> 00:20:36.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Right, I'd like to
see that dream more in terms

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:40.090 align:middle line:84%
of community interaction,
building up slowly,

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:42.870 align:middle line:84%
if you want to start a business,
doing some pilot projects,

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:46.070 align:middle line:84%
working out of your home,
learning the business,

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:49.160 align:middle line:84%
being able to develop
it in a sustainable way,

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:52.120 align:middle line:84%
knowing that it's filling an
actual need in the community,

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.450 align:middle line:84%
right, rather than
a hope and a prayer.

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:56.570 align:middle line:84%
You can pray all you
want, but it actually

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:58.089 align:middle line:90%
helps something productive.

00:20:58.089 --> 00:21:00.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You still have to take
the proper steps and action.

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:02.320 align:middle line:90%
There's a process.

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.380 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Yeah, and
so you're going

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:08.540 align:middle line:84%
to see this kind of cropping
up again and again in the book

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:09.820 align:middle line:90%
and in this.

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:11.630 align:middle line:84%
American people have
allowed themselves

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:16.340 align:middle line:84%
to be sold on this mentality
of getting rich quick, so they

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:17.160 align:middle line:90%
have participated--

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, we glorify it.

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:20.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: We glorify
it, and part of this

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:23.490 align:middle line:84%
is to make us aware of
how we have actually

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:24.940 align:middle line:90%
agreed to some of this stuff.

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:26.600 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm not blaming
the victim here,

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:30.707 align:middle line:84%
but there are ways in
which we bought it.

00:21:30.707 --> 00:21:33.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, yeah, if you can
buy a house that, as you say,

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:36.260 align:middle line:84%
is more than 10 times
your yearly income

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:42.650 align:middle line:84%
on an adjustable rate
mortgage right for 3% or 2%,

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:43.640 align:middle line:90%
that's very tempting.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.190 align:middle line:90%
It's like, oh, my gosh.

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:49.410 align:middle line:84%
I never thought I could have
a house like that, but I can.

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And you just kind
of turn a blind eye

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:54.980 align:middle line:84%
to what's going to happen in
three years or five years.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm sure
something will happen.

00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:00.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I guess
we could sell it.

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:02.180 align:middle line:84%
I guess we could sell
it if we get in trouble.

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:03.480 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of people did that.

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:05.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: And everyone
was telling them,

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.470 align:middle line:84%
these unscrupulous
mortgage lenders.

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:09.440 align:middle line:84%
First of all, they were
having them sign up

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.648 align:middle line:84%
for balloon payments, where
it would be low payments,

00:22:11.648 --> 00:22:14.280 align:middle line:90%
and then it would step up.

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:16.330 align:middle line:90%
And they were giving loans.

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:20.920 align:middle line:84%
I saw newspaper articles where
people making $45,000 a year

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:24.642 align:middle line:84%
out in California were given
loans for a $745,000 house.

00:22:24.642 --> 00:22:25.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's crazy.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: So we're
talking not even--

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:29.320 align:middle line:84%
3 and 1/2 is what's
normal, 3 and 1/2 times

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.220 align:middle line:90%
your yearly salary.

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:33.120 align:middle line:84%
It was going up to 10 and even
exceeding that, all the way up

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.420 align:middle line:90%
to almost 20.

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't care
because the mortgage lenders

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:39.310 align:middle line:90%
were going to get their fees.

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:42.532 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly, I assume you
saw the movie "The Big Short."

00:22:42.532 --> 00:22:43.490 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEUS: Oh, absolutely.

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:45.865 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A couple times, I
saw it a couple times anyway.

00:22:45.865 --> 00:22:47.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEUS: It was very well done.

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very well
done, and I thought

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:53.580 align:middle line:84%
that the way they represented
that element of the crumbling

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:57.990 align:middle line:84%
financial picture was beautiful
when they went to Florida.

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And they talked to the guys
that were selling those loans.

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.189 align:middle line:90%
And the guys would say, hey.

00:23:03.189 --> 00:23:04.480 align:middle line:90%
They don't know any difference.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.605 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we try to get
as many foreign people

00:23:06.605 --> 00:23:07.480 align:middle line:90%
on board as possible.

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:10.080 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand the
language all that well.

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was
really despicable,

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:14.065 align:middle line:84%
and there was no conscience
surrounding it at all.

00:23:14.065 --> 00:23:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, Florida
was one of the first states

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:17.355 align:middle line:90%
to start going belly up.

00:23:17.355 --> 00:23:19.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the value
of their properties

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:21.230 align:middle line:90%
dropped like a stone.

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:26.290 align:middle line:84%
You could practically get
them for an annual salary.

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: They were
dropping 80%, 90%.

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:29.770 align:middle line:90%
You could.

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:32.186 align:middle line:84%
You could get them for almost
one times your annual salary

00:23:32.186 --> 00:23:33.090 align:middle line:90%
at a certain point.

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and
so anyway, if someone

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:38.150 align:middle line:84%
hasn't seen "The Big Short,"
I think it's definitely worth

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:45.520 align:middle line:84%
watching because it shows the
not hyperactive megalomania,

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:49.390 align:middle line:84%
the psychology behind how
this became the way it did.

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:51.862 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, on
that note for those

00:23:51.862 --> 00:23:53.320 align:middle line:84%
who have seen "The
Big Short," what

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:55.450 align:middle line:84%
did you think of the
prime character in it

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:59.250 align:middle line:84%
who was just looking at the
numbers and what he did?

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:01.584 align:middle line:84%
Explain that to the people
so when they go see this film

00:24:01.584 --> 00:24:03.250 align:middle line:84%
they're looking at
it through your lens.

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:06.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Well, he's kind of like
an interesting Shakespearean

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:06.820 align:middle line:90%
character.

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:09.730 align:middle line:84%
He's almost like the
narrator of a drama.

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:12.010 align:middle line:84%
He's the guy kind
of behind the scenes

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:16.164 align:middle line:84%
who understands that
the system is rigged,

00:24:16.164 --> 00:24:17.830 align:middle line:84%
and he understands
what the consequences

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:20.849 align:middle line:84%
will be if they play out in the
direction that they're going.

00:24:20.849 --> 00:24:21.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Christian Bale.

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:22.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEUS: Yes.

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and he's
just about numbers.

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:26.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEUS: Yeah, or was it Gosling?

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.900 align:middle line:84%
Were you talking
about Gosling, too?

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:28.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, Gosling
is the narrator--

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:31.283 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: OK, that's who I
thought you were talking about.

00:24:31.283 --> 00:24:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, Christian
Bale, the one who said, whoa.

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:37.450 align:middle line:84%
We're going into a total
mass default on mortgages.

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:38.420 align:middle line:90%
It's in the numbers.

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And he was a quirky, Silicon
Valley kind of savant guy.

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:47.790 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: The savant, guy, OK,
right, and what I liked was--

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:51.670 align:middle line:84%
and you don't really pick this
up explicitly in the movie.

00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:56.632 align:middle line:84%
But these guys who were
going contrary to--

00:24:56.632 --> 00:24:58.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The credit
default swaps.

00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:00.626 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Yeah, who were going
contract to this, a lot of them

00:25:00.626 --> 00:25:02.250 align:middle line:84%
were activists and
agitators, realizing

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:04.160 align:middle line:90%
that this was really unhealthy.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And they were going
to bet against this

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:08.940 align:middle line:84%
because traditionally in the
financial market, if you bet

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.000 align:middle line:84%
against it, you
can create a hedge

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.070 align:middle line:84%
against irrational
exuberance, what's

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:18.190 align:middle line:84%
called irrational exuberance,
from this testosterone-fuelled,

00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:22.190 align:middle line:84%
like, greed, because there
will be a consequence for it.

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:25.740 align:middle line:84%
But what they realized, I
think, and he did as well,

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.610 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the
movie when he realizes.

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:29.202 align:middle line:90%
He put a number up on the board.

00:25:29.202 --> 00:25:30.160 align:middle line:90%
They kept losing money.

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.720 align:middle line:90%
It was going down, like, 50%.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And everyone's saying,
you've got to do something.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Panicking, and at the
end it was almost like 500%.

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:37.550 align:middle line:84%
I think it was like 496%
or something ridiculous.

00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:40.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, something
like that, 469%, something

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:40.810 align:middle line:90%
like that, yeah.

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:44.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Yes, and the other
one, played by Steve Carell,

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.540 align:middle line:84%
they all realized though
they had gotten rich,

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:48.360 align:middle line:90%
nothing had changed.

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.940 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely nothing had changed.

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:51.950 align:middle line:84%
These banks, they've
gotten away with it all.

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:56.410 align:middle line:84%
The US taxpayers'
money backstopped them.

00:25:56.410 --> 00:26:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And their attempts
to correct the system

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:03.860 align:middle line:84%
by betting against
it got them wealthy,

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:07.300 align:middle line:84%
but it really didn't change
the underlying sickness.

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:10.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, and
I bring this up

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.900 align:middle line:84%
because it was so
well represented,

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:14.640 align:middle line:84%
I think, toward what
you're speaking of.

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:18.330 align:middle line:84%
Brad Pitt played the role of
a previously very successful

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:20.890 align:middle line:84%
trader who was just
sick of the game.

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:24.160 align:middle line:84%
He got out of the game and
moved to Boulder, Colorado,

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.910 align:middle line:84%
grew his own organic vegetables,
you know, and all of that.

00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And in real life,
Brad Pitt is one

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:35.920 align:middle line:84%
of the actors who has very
publicly come out and said,

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.660 align:middle line:90%
that didn't buy me anything.

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:41.140 align:middle line:84%
The fame, the
fortune, everything

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:45.280 align:middle line:84%
I have bought me nothing by
way of happiness in my life.

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:48.114 align:middle line:84%
And he was, I think, also one
of the producers or executive

00:26:48.114 --> 00:26:49.030 align:middle line:90%
producer of that film.

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:49.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEUS: He was.

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:50.400 align:middle line:90%
He was.

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So he's really trying
to-- he's using his position

00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:56.430 align:middle line:84%
to get this message out
that the system is sick.

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Right, and I think that
that's where we are starting.

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:01.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I hope that
when people read

00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:05.020 align:middle line:84%
this book and these documents,
which I will make available,

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.950 align:middle line:90%
that they will get the notion.

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:08.880 align:middle line:90%
They won't be overwhelmed.

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.670 align:middle line:84%
They will be attracted
to the notion

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:13.437 align:middle line:84%
that in very clear and
concise and simple terms

00:27:13.437 --> 00:27:15.020 align:middle line:84%
they have been able
to diagnose what's

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:16.509 align:middle line:90%
at the heart of this sickness.

00:27:16.509 --> 00:27:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I liked
the film, because it

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:21.560 align:middle line:84%
did a very personal,
well-edited job of getting

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.560 align:middle line:90%
to the core of it.

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's the first step
in making a healthy recovery

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:30.640 align:middle line:90%
and finding alternatives.

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:33.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we're not even
done with the sick part yet.

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:35.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Yeah, OK,
let's continue.

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:37.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK,
sovereign governments

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:39.830 align:middle line:84%
paying private central
banks to create money,

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:42.260 align:middle line:84%
we'll kind of go on
through that quickly.

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:44.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Right,
well, that's just--

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:46.767 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Federal Reserve
people don't understand.

00:27:46.767 --> 00:27:48.600 align:middle line:84%
They think it's a
governmental organization.

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:49.000 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.200 align:middle line:84%
It's a private organization,
and it represents

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.400 align:middle line:90%
not the American people.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.640 align:middle line:84%
It represents the biggest
banks in the country.

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.120 align:middle line:90%
And people don't know this.

00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:59.510 align:middle line:84%
When Hillary Clinton recently
said that the banks paid it

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:03.760 align:middle line:84%
back in one of the debates,
they did not pay anything back.

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:08.160 align:middle line:84%
They were given 0% money
in trillions of dollars,

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:09.790 align:middle line:84%
many hundreds of
billions of dollars,

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:11.770 align:middle line:84%
if not trillions of dollars,
from the Federal Reserve,

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:13.040 align:middle line:90%
which is a private bank.

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And they lent it back
to the US government

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.100 align:middle line:90%
at 2% to 3% interest.

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:19.610 align:middle line:84%
So the US government and
the American taxpayers

00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:25.560 align:middle line:84%
were paying these banks to give
them interest on the free money

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:26.607 align:middle line:90%
that they got.

00:28:26.607 --> 00:28:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And so they are able to
get tens, if not hundreds,

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:31.160 align:middle line:84%
of billions of dollars of
interest on that free money

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:33.100 align:middle line:90%
they got to pay us back.

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And where did they
get that money?

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:35.390 align:middle line:90%
From us.

00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:37.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, that was a
really fraudulent statement

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:40.650 align:middle line:84%
on her part, but
she's known to be

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:42.320 align:middle line:90%
in collusion with Wall Street.

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Well, I mean,
I think that was

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:47.140 align:middle line:84%
the criticism that was brought
up in the Sanders campaign.

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:49.530 align:middle line:84%
When you are payed
enormous fees to speak--

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:51.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: At least
$15 million thus far.

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.719 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Yeah, your PAC
is receiving $15 million.

00:28:53.719 --> 00:28:56.110 align:middle line:84%
You're personally receiving
$600,000 from Goldman Sachs

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:58.260 align:middle line:90%
alone to give three speeches.

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:00.990 align:middle line:84%
You're more than a
little compromised.

00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:03.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: More than a
little compromised, yes, OK,

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:07.370 align:middle line:84%
number four, "complex"
derivatives operating

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:09.860 align:middle line:84%
as vehicles for fraud--
most people can't even

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:12.200 align:middle line:90%
explain what derivatives are.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: No, but I
like just focusing

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:15.830 align:middle line:90%
on the term, derivative.

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:18.280 align:middle line:84%
Now when we use that in the
common English language,

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:21.760 align:middle line:84%
is that a positive thing
or a negative thing?

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:26.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, if a person is acting,
or their act, or their business

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:30.760 align:middle line:84%
is derivative, we
usually say it's a fake,

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:33.880 align:middle line:90%
or it's an inferior copy.

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Or it's just kind of
a wanna be, right?

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, just think
of that when you

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:44.330 align:middle line:84%
think of financial derivatives,
because it's exactly that.

00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:47.970 align:middle line:84%
It's a pale copy,
pumped up as if it was

00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:49.780 align:middle line:90%
complex and important and real.

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, you can put
lots of big lingo around it.

00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:55.020 align:middle line:84%
But all it's basically
saying is that I'm

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:58.620 align:middle line:84%
going to use real
value, monkey with it

00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:01.890 align:middle line:84%
into all these
artificial instruments,

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:04.517 align:middle line:84%
multiply its value in these
artificial instruments way

00:30:04.517 --> 00:30:05.600 align:middle line:90%
beyond fractional reserve.

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.930 align:middle line:84%
Fractional reserve
multiplies that by 10.

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:10.380 align:middle line:84%
There is no limit to
the multiplication

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:11.730 align:middle line:90%
you can do with derivatives.

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:14.690 align:middle line:84%
You can have bets on bets on
bets, and before you know it

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:19.292 align:middle line:84%
there's this whole link of
essentially false creation.

00:30:19.292 --> 00:30:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The film
also illustrated

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:22.120 align:middle line:90%
that, "The Big Short."

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:25.090 align:middle line:84%
I've never understood it
because there is no logic to it.

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:25.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: There is
no logic at all.

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:26.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the real
world, there's no logic.

00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:28.590 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't happen
in the real world.

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:30.631 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Right, and that's
why people sometimes, I

00:30:30.631 --> 00:30:33.134 align:middle line:84%
think, turned a blind eye, as
you say, because they're like,

00:30:33.134 --> 00:30:34.050 align:middle line:90%
how could that happen?

00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:35.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I must not be
understanding it correctly--

00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:35.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: I must not
be understanding.

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:36.765 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --because
it doesn't make sense.

00:30:36.765 --> 00:30:38.181 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: You're
telling me that you

00:30:38.181 --> 00:30:41.320 align:middle line:84%
can create a completely
imaginary pyramid based

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:42.900 align:middle line:90%
on very little actual value?

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Legally, and
not go to prison for it?

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:45.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEUS: And legally?

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:49.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, and the answer
is, yes, unfortunately.

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:52.044 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so number three,
nothing succeeds like failure.

00:30:52.044 --> 00:30:54.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Yeah, this is something
that just drives me crazy,

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:58.140 align:middle line:90%
too, lack of accountability.

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:00.800 align:middle line:90%
I noticed this in CEO pay.

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:05.750 align:middle line:84%
If you succeed through this
kind of legal chicanery,

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:10.390 align:middle line:84%
you get a $500-million
golden parachute.

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:12.155 align:middle line:84%
If you fail, you
only get $50 million.

00:31:12.155 --> 00:31:13.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
people who have

00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:15.980 align:middle line:84%
lost 90% of the
value of the company,

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:20.020 align:middle line:84%
and they are invited toward
the door, as you would expect.

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:22.030 align:middle line:84%
But in order to give
them an inducement

00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:24.110 align:middle line:84%
to leave after really
poor leadership,

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:27.040 align:middle line:84%
they're given $50
million, $40 million.

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:30.430 align:middle line:84%
So here you have it, where
the worst you can do,

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:33.560 align:middle line:84%
by completely tanking the
company, is to get $50 million

00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:35.000 align:middle line:90%
in your personal bank account.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And the best you
can do, you know,

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:39.320 align:middle line:84%
either legitimately
or illegitimately,

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:40.890 align:middle line:90%
is you get $500 million.

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:44.990 align:middle line:10%
You've got every incentive
to be completely unwise

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:47.040 align:middle line:10%
and to just go for
the highest you can

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:49.079 align:middle line:10%
because even if you
crash to the ground,

00:31:49.079 --> 00:31:50.120 align:middle line:10%
you've still made a haul.

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely
no accountability.

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:52.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEUS: None.

00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:53.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Financial
crime is the best way

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:56.830 align:middle line:90%
to maximize profit, number two.

00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:58.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Well, and
this is the thing that

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:01.500 align:middle line:84%
runs throughout my book, this
is what's really dangerous here.

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:04.690 align:middle line:84%
Fraud is, by far, the
most profitable activity

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:08.760 align:middle line:84%
in the United States
of America right now.

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:12.284 align:middle line:90%
Just let that sink in.

00:32:12.284 --> 00:32:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you care
to expand on that?

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:18.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Yes, we have
shown in the way

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:20.260 align:middle line:84%
that we have addressed
and followed up

00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:24.010 align:middle line:84%
the collapse of 2008 that
nobody, no matter how

00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:30.040 align:middle line:84%
outrageous their betting,
will actually go to jail,

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:32.780 align:middle line:84%
will actually have to pay
back any more than pennies

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:34.050 align:middle line:90%
on the dollar.

00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:38.960 align:middle line:84%
All these $5 billion and
$200 million civil penalties

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:41.370 align:middle line:84%
that these big banks
are paying, they're just

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:43.530 align:middle line:84%
a drop in the bucket
from the trillions

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:45.800 align:middle line:84%
that they have raked in
or the trillions they've

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:49.370 align:middle line:84%
been backstopped by the US
taxpayer, world taxpayers

00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:51.770 align:middle line:90%
in other countries as well.

00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And they have not even
had to admit wrongdoing

00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:59.460 align:middle line:90%
in these civil cases.

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:01.230 align:middle line:84%
So if that's the
worst that's going

00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:05.780 align:middle line:84%
to happen-- no jail time, no
investigation, no prosecution,

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:10.534 align:middle line:84%
pennies on the dollar, and
no admission of wrongdoing--

00:33:10.534 --> 00:33:12.200 align:middle line:84%
if that's the worst
you're going to get,

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:15.830 align:middle line:84%
you are incentivizing
massive fraud

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:19.060 align:middle line:84%
because what happens
is the payoff for fraud

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:21.700 align:middle line:84%
is far greater than
any other investment,

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:26.640 align:middle line:84%
by far, 10, 100 times greater
than gold or housing market,

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.870 align:middle line:90%
even at its peak.

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:32.210 align:middle line:84%
So what you're saying
is, you can't lose.

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:34.816 align:middle line:84%
And you can win much more
than the rest of them,

00:33:34.816 --> 00:33:36.690 align:middle line:84%
so that's going to be
the new business model.

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:37.510 align:middle line:90%
And it is.

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:39.801 align:middle line:84%
The bigger banks are even
bigger than they were before.

00:33:39.801 --> 00:33:42.530 align:middle line:84%
They're even more fraudulent
than they were before.

00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And Obama himself signed a
bill that basically said, now

00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:47.430 align:middle line:84%
this gambling is
going to actually

00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:50.510 align:middle line:84%
officially be backstopped
by the American taxpayer.

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And the text for that
bill was written.

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:56.230 align:middle line:84%
It was taken, and if you
compare it to the industry--

00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:58.240 align:middle line:84%
I think it was Goldman
Sachs or JP Morgan,

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.850 align:middle line:84%
whatever, or Citibank that
came up with the text of that.

00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:02.090 align:middle line:90%
It's exact.

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:03.150 align:middle line:90%
It's the exact same text.

00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:05.680 align:middle line:84%
It was literally written by
the industry, put in there,

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:06.220 align:middle line:90%
and signed off.

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:07.511 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's so depressing.

00:34:07.511 --> 00:34:08.320 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEUS: It is.

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:13.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's
truly depressing.

00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And yet a mother who's hungry
and steals food from a grocery

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:23.560 align:middle line:84%
store or writes a bad check can
end up with a criminal record,

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:24.929 align:middle line:90%
or even doing jail time.

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:27.659 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Absolutely,
absolutely, and I

00:34:27.659 --> 00:34:29.870 align:middle line:84%
think this sense of
injustice is what's

00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:32.138 align:middle line:84%
causing the outrage
in this country

00:34:32.138 --> 00:34:33.929 align:middle line:84%
that you're seeing in
the political climate

00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:37.239 align:middle line:84%
right now because people,
whether or not they sense it

00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:39.520 align:middle line:84%
directly or understand
what's happening directly,

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:41.380 align:middle line:90%
they know something's up.

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:44.380 align:middle line:84%
They know that the crooks
are getting away with murder.

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:47.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
statistics that

00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:50.330 align:middle line:84%
show when the economy tanks
like this the amount of deaths

00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:51.480 align:middle line:90%
created like this.

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:54.300 align:middle line:84%
It's astronomical
when you create

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:59.060 align:middle line:84%
these artificial problems,
the depressions, suicides,

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:01.970 align:middle line:84%
you know, health concerns that
go by the wayside that actually

00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:02.770 align:middle line:90%
increase.

00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:04.810 align:middle line:90%
And so it's not inconsequential.

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:05.940 align:middle line:90%
It's not just about money.

00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:07.315 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
people can't afford

00:35:07.315 --> 00:35:09.280 align:middle line:84%
to take care of the
health problem anyway.

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:12.810 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Exactly, so these
consequences are legion,

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:13.840 align:middle line:90%
and they are deep.

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And they are not
just about money.

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:17.760 align:middle line:84%
They're about people's
actual lives, life and death,

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.530 align:middle line:84%
and yet there is
no accountability.

00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:24.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The final one is
fraud closure, as you call it.

00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:29.960 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: That is my number
one because it's so clear.

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:34.790 align:middle line:84%
In fraud closure,
here's what happened.

00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:41.330 align:middle line:84%
Banks decided they were going
to digitize ownership of homes

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:44.540 align:middle line:84%
because you can't ship them
around and package them

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:47.130 align:middle line:84%
up and go through
all the recording

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:50.770 align:middle line:84%
requirements of transferring
from paper to paper

00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:53.820 align:middle line:84%
and paying the fees to
do that, by the way,

00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:56.380 align:middle line:84%
and move it as fast as
they needed to move.

00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And it costs a lot
of money to do.

00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And so what they did is they
started to digitize ownership,

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:04.560 align:middle line:90%
and they got around.

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.990 align:middle line:84%
They didn't follow the
title requirements.

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:07.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:10.490 align:middle line:84%
Now this is something I've
found interesting for years.

00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:14.190 align:middle line:84%
Explain the implications
of that to the homeowner

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:15.717 align:middle line:90%
who has now gone into default.

00:36:15.717 --> 00:36:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Well, what's
happened a lot of these times

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.716 align:middle line:84%
is when these ones that
have gone into default

00:36:19.716 --> 00:36:22.400 align:middle line:84%
have asked for the title,
they can't produce it.

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:25.620 align:middle line:90%


00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:28.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What is the
legal right of the banking

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:29.132 align:middle line:90%
system in that case?

00:36:29.132 --> 00:36:30.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Well, a
lot of these judges

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:31.720 align:middle line:90%
are on the side of the banks.

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.553 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to force
these citizens, even

00:36:33.553 --> 00:36:35.760 align:middle line:84%
without this thing being
produced, to pay up

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:38.870 align:middle line:90%
or to cede ownership of a house.

00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:40.860 align:middle line:90%
And it's complicated.

00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:43.840 align:middle line:84%
To me, again, this shows you
that even the judicial system

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:45.116 align:middle line:90%
has been caught up in this.

00:36:45.116 --> 00:36:47.740 align:middle line:84%
Now some judges have been what
I would call judges of integrity

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:48.820 align:middle line:90%
and said, listen.

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:52.020 align:middle line:84%
If you did illegal
things or improper things

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:54.000 align:middle line:84%
to get to this point,
you need to clear it up

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.350 align:middle line:90%
before this goes through.

00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:58.840 align:middle line:84%
If you can't produce it at all--
and this is the real problem.

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:02.150 align:middle line:84%
We can't even produce a record
for a lot of these properties.

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:04.340 align:middle line:84%
You know, for a
libertarian or someone

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:06.820 align:middle line:84%
on the more conservative
side, these banks

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:08.970 align:middle line:84%
have ruined the whole
notion of private property

00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:10.424 align:middle line:90%
at all in a lot of ways.

00:37:10.424 --> 00:37:11.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true, yeah.

00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:13.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: So what
they tried to do was

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:19.490 align:middle line:84%
to retroactively
sign title documents

00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:21.320 align:middle line:90%
by doing these signature mills.

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:23.770 align:middle line:84%
So they would literally
just have stacks of paper,

00:37:23.770 --> 00:37:25.916 align:middle line:84%
and they would hire these
people to sign them,

00:37:25.916 --> 00:37:27.540 align:middle line:84%
pretending that
they're representatives

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:29.610 align:middle line:90%
of some legitimate company.

00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:31.020 align:middle line:90%
So that's fraud.

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:32.340 align:middle line:90%
That's forgery.

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:35.459 align:middle line:84%
Now, fraud, they're saying,
we can't go after these guys,

00:37:35.459 --> 00:37:37.500 align:middle line:84%
even though there are some
outrageous emails that

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:38.730 align:middle line:90%
show there's pure intent.

00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:42.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, we can't prove intent,
so we can't prove fraud.

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:44.480 align:middle line:84%
You can prove fraud
when people have forged.

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.390 align:middle line:84%
There is no way you
can say, my hand

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:49.392 align:middle line:84%
slipped and I accidentally--
and it's not just one.

00:37:49.392 --> 00:37:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Hundreds of thousands
of documents

00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:54.640 align:middle line:84%
were done like this,
perhaps even millions.

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
as a result of this?

00:37:56.630 --> 00:38:00.870 align:middle line:84%
US government brings all the
states' attorney generals

00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:03.074 align:middle line:84%
together for
$25-billion settlements.

00:38:03.074 --> 00:38:04.740 align:middle line:84%
Some of them didn't
sign off completely,

00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:08.250 align:middle line:84%
said they still reserve
the right to pursue this,

00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:10.370 align:middle line:90%
and then it just went away.

00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:13.290 align:middle line:84%
They could have nailed them
for every one of those.

00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:15.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what I wonder,
because people were starting

00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:21.470 align:middle line:84%
to fight and do these mortgage
forensics and such and say,

00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:22.270 align:middle line:90%
proof.

00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:23.150 align:middle line:90%
Show us proof.

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:24.566 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Right, and
there have been

00:38:24.566 --> 00:38:26.840 align:middle line:84%
private lawsuits that
have been well researched

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:28.120 align:middle line:90%
that have gone forward.

00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:31.690 align:middle line:84%
And I'm planning on
doing an update on this,

00:38:31.690 --> 00:38:35.730 align:middle line:84%
and those have been shut
down by the court system.

00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:39.545 align:middle line:84%
They had really great
evidence obviously.

00:38:39.545 --> 00:38:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And if you had forced these
companies, these banks,

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:44.910 align:middle line:84%
to pay the fines for
each one of these sheets

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:48.960 align:middle line:84%
that they had forged,
they would go bankrupt.

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:50.917 align:middle line:84%
That's how many
there are, and that's

00:38:50.917 --> 00:38:52.000 align:middle line:90%
how big the penalties are.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.760 align:middle line:84%
If you had a government that was
interested in true enforcement,

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:58.840 align:middle line:84%
that could be used as leverage
to break up the banks.

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:00.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they're
not going to do that.

00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And so the average person
just becomes docile and says,

00:39:05.370 --> 00:39:07.200 align:middle line:84%
well, I can't do
anything about it.

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:08.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Right, because
they don't have the money

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:10.111 align:middle line:90%
to go through the court system.

00:39:10.111 --> 00:39:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And even if they
do, they have judges

00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:15.090 align:middle line:84%
that are siding with these
banks, against the law,

00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:16.760 align:middle line:90%
against precedent.

00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:20.160 align:middle line:90%
And they're like, what can I do?

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:21.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is true.

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: And there's the
practical life aspect, too.

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:26.800 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to
consume your life

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:31.320 align:middle line:84%
in being consumed in this
litigation when you're already

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:32.737 align:middle line:84%
behind the eight
ball financially?

00:39:32.737 --> 00:39:34.278 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But some
people just choose

00:39:34.278 --> 00:39:37.000 align:middle line:84%
to stay until the sheriff's
department comes and gives them

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.196 align:middle line:84%
a 3-day or a 30-day
or whatever notice.

00:39:39.196 --> 00:39:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And some people
have been staying

00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:41.830 align:middle line:90%
in those homes for years.

00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:43.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Yes, yes,
for several years.

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:45.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now what is
your feeling on that?

00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And if someone were in
that situation, what would

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:51.680 align:middle line:90%
you say to them?

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:54.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Well, I
mean, I don't know.

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.520 align:middle line:84%
Certainly a person
who responsibly

00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:59.230 align:middle line:84%
pays their mortgage
would say, listen.

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:00.030 align:middle line:90%
Wait a minute.

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:01.360 align:middle line:84%
You're living in
your house for free

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:03.970 align:middle line:84%
after you've been irresponsible,
and I'm paying for my house

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:05.430 align:middle line:90%
while I've been responsible?

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:08.210 align:middle line:84%
So in general, I'd
say, I don't like that.

00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:10.340 align:middle line:84%
But here's where
two wrongs almost

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:12.310 align:middle line:84%
do make a right, to
a certain extent.

00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:14.275 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I totally
get what you're saying,

00:40:14.275 --> 00:40:15.150 align:middle line:90%
and I agree with you.

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:16.983 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Because what
happens is that a house

00:40:16.983 --> 00:40:18.620 align:middle line:90%
falls into disrepair, right?

00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:20.350 align:middle line:84%
The bank's not going
to sell it anyway

00:40:20.350 --> 00:40:21.680 align:middle line:84%
because they don't want
to take the loss on it.

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:22.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now the
lawn's overgrown.

00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:23.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Now the
lawn's overgrown.

00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:25.370 align:middle line:84%
The neighborhood
is being overgrown.

00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:27.274 align:middle line:84%
At least they're
mowing the lawn.

00:40:27.274 --> 00:40:28.690 align:middle line:84%
At least they're
paying the taxes,

00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:30.720 align:middle line:84%
and they're paying the
utilities on the house.

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:34.690 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, you know,
doing the immoral thing

00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:37.396 align:middle line:84%
is still making the better
out of a really bad situation.

00:40:37.396 --> 00:40:39.860 align:middle line:90%


00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:41.805 align:middle line:84%
The complication,
though, doesn't come out

00:40:41.805 --> 00:40:43.180 align:middle line:84%
of these simplistic
moral things.

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:43.970 align:middle line:90%
Someone's responsible.

00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:44.380 align:middle line:90%
They're paying.

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:46.046 align:middle line:84%
Someone's irresponsible,
and they don't.

00:40:46.046 --> 00:40:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And I would encourage
the listeners or viewers

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:52.330 align:middle line:84%
here not to allow yourself
to be pulled back into that.

00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:55.900 align:middle line:84%
Who were the real crooks
here who set this thing up?

00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:57.330 align:middle line:84%
Is it the
irresponsible borrowers

00:40:57.330 --> 00:40:59.079 align:middle line:84%
who should have known
what they were doing

00:40:59.079 --> 00:41:00.410 align:middle line:90%
and failed to pay it off?

00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:02.200 align:middle line:84%
Or is it these people
like these mortgage

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:05.920 align:middle line:84%
lenders who were forging,
who were signing and getting

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:06.720 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:08.370 align:middle line:90%
I'll get you into that house.

00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:09.720 align:middle line:90%
And then it goes.

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now we're going
to go away from those 10

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:16.510 align:middle line:84%
toxic steps as to how we got
here to the 5 courageous steps

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:18.350 align:middle line:90%
to transform the economy.

00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And you start with number
one, which is pierce

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:23.210 align:middle line:90%
the fantasy or nail the issue.

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:25.400 align:middle line:90%
Now what do you mean by that?

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:27.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Well, I
think we had talked

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:32.390 align:middle line:84%
about the American dream, and
the American dream and sort

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:33.560 align:middle line:90%
of the false American dream.

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:37.760 align:middle line:84%
The false American
dream is, I can consume

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:41.290 align:middle line:90%
my way into the good life.

00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:43.740 align:middle line:84%
If I just play the
game, you know,

00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:45.240 align:middle line:90%
I can get a higher paying job.

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:46.420 align:middle line:90%
I can buy more things.

00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:48.160 align:middle line:84%
I can go on more
vacations, and that's

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:50.810 align:middle line:84%
what it means to
have a good life.

00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:53.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, if that's your
vision of a good life,

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:56.109 align:middle line:84%
you can be compromised
pretty quickly.

00:41:56.109 --> 00:41:58.150 align:middle line:84%
People can say, well, you
can have the good life,

00:41:58.150 --> 00:42:00.056 align:middle line:90%
and I can give you this loan.

00:42:00.056 --> 00:42:01.930 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have the
money now, don't worry.

00:42:01.930 --> 00:42:04.535 align:middle line:90%
You'll get it.

00:42:04.535 --> 00:42:05.660 align:middle line:90%
Everybody else is doing it.

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:07.430 align:middle line:90%
They're going to Disneyland.

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:09.960 align:middle line:84%
You know, just put it
on your credit card.

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:11.750 align:middle line:84%
Or you can get a
home equity loan out,

00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:14.520 align:middle line:84%
and you can have a
good, old, fun time.

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:17.310 align:middle line:84%
So the heart of the
illusion and the issue

00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:21.370 align:middle line:84%
is the notion that you can
get something for nothing

00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:25.000 align:middle line:84%
and that taking and
consuming is the good life.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:25.960 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:28.440 align:middle line:84%
America is an incredibly
creative country.

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:29.560 align:middle line:90%
It's an inventive country.

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:31.507 align:middle line:84%
Look at all the forms
of music, especially

00:42:31.507 --> 00:42:33.090 align:middle line:84%
within the
African-American community,

00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:35.350 align:middle line:90%
that have been created here.

00:42:35.350 --> 00:42:40.440 align:middle line:84%
Look at all the inventions
that have happened here.

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:41.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even in
the fantastical,

00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:44.020 align:middle line:84%
artistic realms,
just Hollywood alone.

00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:46.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Exactly, we're
talking the automobile.

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:47.580 align:middle line:90%
We're talking electricity.

00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:48.850 align:middle line:90%
We're talking airplane.

00:42:48.850 --> 00:42:50.860 align:middle line:84%
We're talking-- it
just goes on and on.

00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:53.680 align:middle line:84%
So that's the real
American dream.

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:56.470 align:middle line:84%
The real American dream
is to take our talent

00:42:56.470 --> 00:43:00.570 align:middle line:84%
to create and share and give
and find economic mechanisms

00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:02.320 align:middle line:84%
and ways of relating
to the community that

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:04.040 align:middle line:90%
allow us to maximize that.

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:08.450 align:middle line:84%
Not financial profit,
maximize creative intensity,

00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:11.360 align:middle line:84%
creative connection,
community connection.

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And so what we need
to do is we need

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:15.510 align:middle line:84%
to get off the
high-fructose corn

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:19.840 align:middle line:84%
syrup of this
fantasy of consuming

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:23.420 align:middle line:84%
your way into the good life,
which just leaves you morally

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:26.670 align:middle line:84%
obese and morally
sick, and start

00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:31.750 align:middle line:84%
generating a notion of giving
and sharing and producing

00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:35.915 align:middle line:84%
and connecting as the
driver for the good life.

00:43:35.915 --> 00:43:37.740 align:middle line:84%
The nice thing about
a real good life

00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:39.620 align:middle line:90%
is it doesn't fit your image.

00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:41.830 align:middle line:84%
It comes out of your
growing and creating,

00:43:41.830 --> 00:43:44.850 align:middle line:90%
and it develops as you develop.

00:43:44.850 --> 00:43:47.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Number two is
get real about consequences

00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:50.580 align:middle line:84%
so that you can
anticipate the trends.

00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:53.790 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEUS: Right, so
let's say you happen

00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:58.960 align:middle line:84%
to be one of those people that
bought at the top of a market,

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:03.070 align:middle line:84%
like your house now is worth
a lot less than it was.

00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And, oh, my stock, I mean, I
should have sold that stock

00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:07.780 align:middle line:90%
when it was--

00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:08.926 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:44:08.926 --> 00:44:09.747 align:middle line:90%


00:44:09.747 --> 00:44:11.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEUS: And now it's worth half.

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:13.420 align:middle line:84%
It's still a little bit
more than when I bought it,

00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:15.560 align:middle line:84%
but I'm waiting for it
to go back up again.

00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And again, that's part
of that same disease,

00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:23.350 align:middle line:84%
trying to maximize what you
can get out of something.

00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:25.770 align:middle line:84%
The fact is that
allowing yourself

00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:28.170 align:middle line:84%
to be sucked into
that mentality,

00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:32.960 align:middle line:84%
you're being sucked into a
scarcity model, where you're

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:36.510 align:middle line:90%
being driven by what you lost.

00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And you want to get it
back by staying in the game

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:41.190 align:middle line:90%
and continuing to play the game.

00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:44.490 align:middle line:84%
What I say in this paper is
you can actually gain more

00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:50.110 align:middle line:84%
in terms of quality of life by
admitting it didn't work out,

00:44:50.110 --> 00:44:51.250 align:middle line:90%
getting rid of it--

00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:54.109 align:middle line:90%


00:44:54.109 --> 00:44:56.400 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So it's not plaguing
you on an emotional level.

00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:58.220 align:middle line:84%
ZEUS: So it's not plaguing
you and weighing on you.

00:44:58.220 --> 00:44:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And there's something
really sort of

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:02.300 align:middle line:84%
courageous and outrageous
about that action

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:04.680 align:middle line:84%
that's very freeing,
very liberating.

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:07.280 align:middle line:84%
Like, I won't be determined
by the objects around me.

00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:09.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to be determined
by the images of wealth

00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:11.230 align:middle line:90%
and the good life around me.

00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:14.860 align:middle line:84%
I could live on nothing, and
I don't have all that burden

00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:15.840 align:middle line:90%
on me.

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:18.890 align:middle line:84%
And our family can learn to
work with other families.

00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:23.060 align:middle line:84%
We may even move in with another
family, co-housing, you know,

00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:26.360 align:middle line:84%
and share our resources,
reduce our housing

00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:29.270 align:middle line:90%
cost which is our highest cost.

00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:31.140 align:middle line:84%
Instead of thinking,
oh, well, maybe we

00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:33.740 align:middle line:84%
can scrape up enough to get
a slightly smaller house,

00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:36.495 align:middle line:90%
why not get more imaginative?

00:45:36.495 --> 00:45:37.370 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: You're right.

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:38.324 align:middle line:90%
That's one thing.

00:45:38.324 --> 00:45:39.740 align:middle line:84%
The nice thing
about this country,

00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:41.440 align:middle line:84%
having so little
history, is that it

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:46.640 align:middle line:84%
allows for the implementation
of whatever we can imagine.

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:50.700 align:middle line:84%
We're not held back by a sense
of what's been done all along.

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:54.260 align:middle line:84%
ZEUS: And that's a
perfect way to look at it.

00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:56.720 align:middle line:84%
What will allow you to do
what you have imagined,

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.030 align:middle line:90%
to be creative?

00:45:58.030 --> 00:46:01.490 align:middle line:84%
To be stuck in the old images
of what wealth and value is

00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:05.440 align:middle line:84%
that's hemmed you in
and has you working jobs

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:08.530 align:middle line:84%
you don't like and has you
scraping by, or saying,

00:46:08.530 --> 00:46:10.060 align:middle line:90%
wait a minute.

00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:13.240 align:middle line:84%
The people who came into this
country came with nothing.

00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:15.760 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Right, that
is true, you know,

00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:18.900 align:middle line:84%
with the whole
downturn from 2008.

00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:22.400 align:middle line:84%
And I would certainly argue
we're in for another wild ride

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:23.200 align:middle line:90%
here soon.

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:24.436 align:middle line:90%
ZEUS: Oh, yes.

00:46:24.436 --> 00:46:27.020 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Yeah, and
we'll get to that,

00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:32.130 align:middle line:84%
is that it was giving people
an opportunity to rethink right

00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:36.090 align:middle line:84%
how they choose to live because
we all know that on one level

00:46:36.090 --> 00:46:38.680 align:middle line:84%
or another most of us
are slaves to a system.

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:39.800 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
you can't stand up

00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:44.610 align:middle line:84%
to your boss for fear
of losing your job.

00:46:44.610 --> 00:46:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And so you just
accept whatever's

00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:50.094 align:middle line:84%
going on in your life because
you have to pay those bills

00:46:50.094 --> 00:46:51.760 align:middle line:84%
or you have kids to
support and whatnot.

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And so I think most people
understand that pain.

00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And so with the
economy shredding

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:01.762 align:middle line:84%
as it did, more
or less, it really

00:47:01.762 --> 00:47:03.220 align:middle line:84%
gave people a chance
to rethink it.

00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:08.070 align:middle line:84%
But other than kids
struggling to find jobs,

00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:10.960 align:middle line:84%
young kids, people
who are in their 20s

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:12.589 align:middle line:84%
not being able to
make it, moving back

00:47:12.589 --> 00:47:14.130 align:middle line:84%
in with their parents,
I haven't seen

00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:15.500 align:middle line:90%
a lot of creativity happening.

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:18.512 align:middle line:84%
ZEUS: No, no, because people
are still trying to eke it.

00:47:18.512 --> 00:47:20.470 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: They still think
it's going to recover.

00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:22.550 align:middle line:84%
ZEUS: They still think
it's going to recover,

00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:26.110 align:middle line:84%
but jobs are contracting through
automation and et cetera.

00:47:26.110 --> 00:47:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And these jobs are
not coming back.

00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:29.490 align:middle line:84%
All throughout history,
we've gone to another thing.

00:47:29.490 --> 00:47:30.920 align:middle line:84%
We've gone agrarian
to industrial,

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:34.910 align:middle line:84%
industrial to information age,
information age to, oh, wait

00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:36.080 align:middle line:90%
a minute.

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:39.920 align:middle line:84%
We're getting rid of these jobs,
and they're not coming back.

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:42.720 align:middle line:84%
So we have really got
to be creative about how

00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:43.810 align:middle line:90%
we exchange value.

00:47:43.810 --> 00:47:45.851 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Well, and that
gets us into number three.

00:47:45.851 --> 00:47:48.470 align:middle line:84%
Stop feeding the beast,
and act on your deeper

00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:50.470 align:middle line:90%
values and sense.

00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:52.950 align:middle line:84%
ZEUS: Yes, and I think
one of the examples that

00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:56.020 align:middle line:84%
resonates with a lot of people--
it might be in that section

00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:57.560 align:middle line:90%
there, where I'm like, listen.

00:47:57.560 --> 00:47:59.680 align:middle line:84%
How many of you have
a storage locker?

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:02.450 align:middle line:84%
Is this the one that has the
storage locker in it, you know,

00:48:02.450 --> 00:48:08.850 align:middle line:84%
where you have your aunt's old
furniture after she's died?

00:48:08.850 --> 00:48:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And you're keeping it because
you want to honor her memory.

00:48:11.330 --> 00:48:13.871 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And you're paying $100
a month to keep all this junk.

00:48:13.871 --> 00:48:16.120 align:middle line:84%
ZEUS: Yes, and you
know that after a year,

00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:18.360 align:middle line:84%
you've already paid up for
the value of everything

00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:19.318 align:middle line:90%
in that storage locker.

00:48:19.318 --> 00:48:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And yet you're continuing
to keep it around.

00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:23.610 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Yes, and the example
you use up here I thought

00:48:23.610 --> 00:48:24.693 align:middle line:90%
was really cute.

00:48:24.693 --> 00:48:27.580 align:middle line:84%
It said, if you
cut yourself badly,

00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:29.750 align:middle line:84%
you don't worry about
all the blood you've lost

00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:32.026 align:middle line:90%
and how to get it back.

00:48:32.026 --> 00:48:36.840 align:middle line:84%
You stop the bleeding so you
won't lose any more blood.

00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:38.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind
of where you say,

00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:40.310 align:middle line:84%
we need to assess
ourselves right now.

00:48:40.310 --> 00:48:45.420 align:middle line:84%
ZEUS: Right, if something
is hemorrhaging you,

00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:48.730 align:middle line:84%
hemorrhaging your bank account,
even something as simple

00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:51.590 align:middle line:90%
as a storage locker, stop it.

00:48:51.590 --> 00:48:52.809 align:middle line:90%
Stop the bleeding.

00:48:52.809 --> 00:48:55.100 align:middle line:84%
How do you stop the bleeding
with a storage locker that

00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:57.270 align:middle line:84%
has junk in it
that you never use,

00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:59.850 align:middle line:84%
for reasons that aren't
really legitimate?

00:48:59.850 --> 00:49:01.510 align:middle line:84%
You're not honoring
your aunt's memory

00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:03.950 align:middle line:84%
by keeping something
in a dusty closet

00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:05.250 align:middle line:90%
that you're never going to use.

00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:08.630 align:middle line:84%
Give it to someone
who can use it.

00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:10.940 align:middle line:90%
That's honoring your memory.

00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And the same is true
of housing costs.

00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:18.060 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you're just
laboring under a mortgage,

00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:19.860 align:middle line:84%
and you can't really
pay it off, and you're

00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:22.471 align:middle line:84%
working two jobs to two and
a half jobs to pay it off,

00:49:22.471 --> 00:49:24.970 align:middle line:84%
and it's consuming the life you
could spend with your family

00:49:24.970 --> 00:49:28.050 align:middle line:84%
and friends and so forth,
then seriously consider

00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:30.510 align:middle line:84%
defaulting on it, well,
not defaulting, per se.

00:49:30.510 --> 00:49:32.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be put in
a position of advocating

00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:37.110 align:middle line:84%
open default, but look
into your personal options,

00:49:37.110 --> 00:49:39.150 align:middle line:90%
into financial options.

00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:41.832 align:middle line:84%
And if it makes
sense, you know, you

00:49:41.832 --> 00:49:43.040 align:middle line:90%
can do other creative things.

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:45.550 align:middle line:84%
You can have a family
move in with you perhaps,

00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:48.920 align:middle line:84%
or you can let go of
the house or downsize.

00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:51.000 align:middle line:84%
But the whole thing
is what you want to do

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.009 align:middle line:84%
is move from an
unmanageable situation

00:49:53.009 --> 00:49:54.300 align:middle line:90%
to a more manageable situation.

00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:55.270 align:middle line:90%
You want to stop the bleeding.

00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:57.700 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Otherwise, life is
just a struggle and a burden.

00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:00.390 align:middle line:84%
ZEUS: Exactly, if you've
left that cut open,

00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:01.810 align:middle line:90%
you're going to become anemic.

00:50:01.810 --> 00:50:03.910 align:middle line:84%
It's going to affect
everything in your life.

00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:08.090 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it won't kill you, but
you're going to be anemic.

00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:09.840 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
be able to enjoy life.

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:12.210 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to be able
to make healthy connections.

00:50:12.210 --> 00:50:13.770 align:middle line:90%
You've got to stop it.

00:50:13.770 --> 00:50:16.670 align:middle line:84%
And we have always been taught
about how interesting accrues.

00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:18.490 align:middle line:84%
You've got to save
early, and then it's

00:50:18.490 --> 00:50:20.290 align:middle line:90%
going to be exponential.

00:50:20.290 --> 00:50:23.440 align:middle line:84%
But hardly anyone talks
about cutting your costs.

00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:25.850 align:middle line:90%
It has the same effect.

00:50:25.850 --> 00:50:29.510 align:middle line:84%
If you cut a cost or
stop the bleeding early,

00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:31.760 align:middle line:84%
it's going to have exponential
effects for your future

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:34.680 align:middle line:84%
as well by eliminating
the negatives

00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:38.480 align:middle line:84%
and drains on your resources
in very much the same way.

00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:40.760 align:middle line:84%
So that's one thing
you don't hear much,

00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:42.280 align:middle line:90%
and it's absolutely crucial.

00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:43.930 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes, I agree with that.

00:50:43.930 --> 00:50:48.010 align:middle line:84%
I do know of one situation
where a woman's parents had

00:50:48.010 --> 00:50:50.960 align:middle line:84%
reached retirement age, and
she was living by herself.

00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And they each had
mortgages, and so they

00:50:53.090 --> 00:50:55.890 align:middle line:84%
decided to sell their
individual homes

00:50:55.890 --> 00:50:57.880 align:middle line:84%
and then buy a home
that had two master

00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:00.300 align:middle line:84%
suites-- it was a
good enough size--

00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:01.945 align:middle line:90%
and then just collaborate.

00:51:01.945 --> 00:51:04.650 align:middle line:90%


00:51:04.650 --> 00:51:05.720 align:middle line:90%
They're from India.

00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:07.770 align:middle line:84%
The mother did the
cooking for everybody,

00:51:07.770 --> 00:51:10.917 align:middle line:84%
so my friend had fabulous
food around all the time.

00:51:10.917 --> 00:51:12.500 align:middle line:84%
She had someone to
watch her dogs when

00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:15.520 align:middle line:84%
she wanted to go on
vacation and actually

00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:19.830 align:middle line:84%
had a much higher quality of
life as a result of their just

00:51:19.830 --> 00:51:22.400 align:middle line:84%
deciding to get creative
and do this together.

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:24.740 align:middle line:84%
But then again, their
culture is more collaborative

00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:26.460 align:middle line:90%
and family oriented.

00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:28.350 align:middle line:84%
We tend not to see
that as an option

00:51:28.350 --> 00:51:31.750 align:middle line:84%
because it's somehow a weakness
or a failure if you're older

00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:33.670 align:middle line:84%
and you just haven't
saved enough to make

00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:35.810 align:middle line:90%
it work in your elderly years.

00:51:35.810 --> 00:51:37.930 align:middle line:84%
Or if you're young and
you haven't made it work,

00:51:37.930 --> 00:51:41.750 align:middle line:84%
either way, we're failures if
we can't have our own domain.

00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:45.590 align:middle line:84%
That's so false, and it's
just so disconnective.

00:51:45.590 --> 00:51:49.740 align:middle line:84%
ZEUS: Yes, yes, that's a
different kind of accounting.

00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:52.630 align:middle line:90%
That's a life accounting.

00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And being real with the
numbers of life accounting,

00:51:55.050 --> 00:51:57.360 align:middle line:90%
it's creating value.

00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:00.210 align:middle line:84%
It's creating quality
of life because now you

00:52:00.210 --> 00:52:02.210 align:middle line:84%
don't have to hire and
do everything yourself.

00:52:02.210 --> 00:52:03.180 align:middle line:90%
You actually have help.

00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:05.096 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: It worked way
better for both of them.

00:52:05.096 --> 00:52:06.230 align:middle line:90%
ZEUS: Of course, it does.

00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And the millennials
are getting this.

00:52:08.130 --> 00:52:10.990 align:middle line:84%
They're forced into it, but
they're starting to do this.

00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:13.448 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: As long as they're not
smoking weed in the basement

00:52:13.448 --> 00:52:16.840 align:middle line:84%
and playing video games, which
a lot of them kids do do.

00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:19.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've got to stand up
and still offer what you have,

00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:22.050 align:middle line:84%
whatever your skills,
talents, gifts, passions are.

00:52:22.050 --> 00:52:24.760 align:middle line:84%
ZEUS: Right, and I have talked
to you about this earlier.

00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:27.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm passionate about big
helping millennials get together

00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:30.750 align:middle line:84%
to realize that they can work
better together than simply

00:52:30.750 --> 00:52:33.510 align:middle line:84%
going back to their
parents' basement

00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:36.630 align:middle line:84%
and addressing in a social
entrepreneurial way community

00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:39.200 align:middle line:84%
needs and working with
schools to get them

00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:43.220 align:middle line:84%
outside of the building and get
them to do applied knowledge.

00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:46.210 align:middle line:84%
You know, so that education
comes back around again.

00:52:46.210 --> 00:52:47.010 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: It does.

00:52:47.010 --> 00:52:49.343 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the thing is we're
working our way through this,

00:52:49.343 --> 00:52:52.540 align:middle line:84%
but you have an equal
amount of lucidity

00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:54.150 align:middle line:90%
on the subject of education.

00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And at the very
end, we'll talk just

00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:58.757 align:middle line:84%
for a minute about another
passion that you have

00:52:58.757 --> 00:53:00.590 align:middle line:84%
and what you're trying
to contribute to kids

00:53:00.590 --> 00:53:04.060 align:middle line:90%
who appear to be challenged.

00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:06.170 align:middle line:84%
OK, so finally we
have step number four,

00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:08.530 align:middle line:84%
confront your habits
and then start

00:53:08.530 --> 00:53:10.429 align:middle line:84%
transforming your
actual character.

00:53:10.429 --> 00:53:12.470 align:middle line:84%
ZEUS: Now this is one of
the most difficult steps

00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:15.910 align:middle line:84%
for an American because
Americans' identity,

00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:18.900 align:middle line:84%
they build their
identity like a suit.

00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And we all kind of
agree to that identity.

00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:23.250 align:middle line:84%
You go to LA, and
you can see that.

00:53:23.250 --> 00:53:25.340 align:middle line:84%
Everyone wants to be a
star, and everyone kind of

00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:29.250 align:middle line:90%
has to agree to that game.

00:53:29.250 --> 00:53:30.950 align:middle line:84%
So you spend more
money than you have.

00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:32.800 align:middle line:84%
You have this nice
car and so forth.

00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And yet at the same
time, in LA people

00:53:37.290 --> 00:53:39.010 align:middle line:84%
have stopped as I'm
crossing a street

00:53:39.010 --> 00:53:40.968 align:middle line:84%
or stopped to allow me
to go across the street.

00:53:40.968 --> 00:53:46.540 align:middle line:84%
You know, so it's this odd
mix that I like of aspiration

00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:48.470 align:middle line:90%
mixed with materialism.

00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:50.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm not so keen on
that, but I realize

00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:53.000 align:middle line:84%
it's part of the
American character,

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.580 align:middle line:84%
and then mixed with
this desire to succeed.

00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's very difficult
for an American

00:53:59.590 --> 00:54:01.510 align:middle line:84%
to step back and say
that they're wrong

00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:03.430 align:middle line:84%
or this is not
working because it's

00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:05.350 align:middle line:84%
like if I let go
of this identity

00:54:05.350 --> 00:54:08.960 align:middle line:84%
that I've spent all this
time building up, who am I?

00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And I want to say, you're the
person creatively adapting.

00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:14.840 align:middle line:90%
You're not your mask.

00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:16.595 align:middle line:90%
You're not your identity.

00:54:16.595 --> 00:54:19.620 align:middle line:84%
You're the one inside
that can throw this off

00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:24.730 align:middle line:84%
completely and say, I'm
a creative American.

00:54:24.730 --> 00:54:27.320 align:middle line:84%
I can let all of this go and
create a completely different

00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:28.270 align:middle line:90%
life if I want to.

00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:30.410 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Absolutely, and
it allows for passion

00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:33.630 align:middle line:84%
to flow back in in your
endeavors, which we've lost.

00:54:33.630 --> 00:54:36.730 align:middle line:84%
There's no energy left
for any kind of passion,

00:54:36.730 --> 00:54:39.260 align:middle line:84%
really, in the
American lifestyle.

00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:42.310 align:middle line:84%
ZEUS: Unfortunately, there
isn't, not in this mode.

00:54:42.310 --> 00:54:45.710 align:middle line:84%
There are glimmers of
it, but people are timid.

00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:47.750 align:middle line:84%
I think that people are
being invited-- this

00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:49.430 align:middle line:90%
is the good thing about this.

00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:51.790 align:middle line:84%
We're being invited with the
collapse of a system that

00:54:51.790 --> 00:54:53.620 align:middle line:84%
has been very inauthentic
and has served us

00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:57.260 align:middle line:84%
poorly to step forward in
a positive, healthy way.

00:54:57.260 --> 00:55:00.890 align:middle line:84%
The problem again is that
we have to not only confront

00:55:00.890 --> 00:55:04.330 align:middle line:84%
the outside aspects of
it, like spending money

00:55:04.330 --> 00:55:05.571 align:middle line:90%
that we don't need.

00:55:05.571 --> 00:55:07.820 align:middle line:84%
But we have to confront the
inner aspects of it, which

00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:10.570 align:middle line:84%
is this step number
four, your character.

00:55:10.570 --> 00:55:12.470 align:middle line:84%
It says, what are
my little addictions

00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:15.080 align:middle line:84%
and my worries that keep
me going into the game

00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:17.840 align:middle line:84%
that I know deep in my
heart is completely over?

00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:18.640 align:middle line:90%
It's done.

00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:19.220 align:middle line:90%
It's bankrupt.

00:55:19.220 --> 00:55:19.930 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: It's killing
me, right, yeah.

00:55:19.930 --> 00:55:20.980 align:middle line:90%
ZEUS: It's killing me.

00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And to have not only
the courage individually

00:55:23.830 --> 00:55:28.150 align:middle line:84%
but together to get outside of
that classic American isolated

00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:31.409 align:middle line:84%
individualism and to start
to speak up and have courage

00:55:31.409 --> 00:55:33.700 align:middle line:84%
because when you do that,
then the other people go, oh.

00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:35.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm not the only one
thinking this way.

00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And before you know
it, you can start

00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:40.510 align:middle line:84%
creating discussion
groups, groups

00:55:40.510 --> 00:55:43.620 align:middle line:84%
where you decide maybe you're
going to go in together

00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:47.090 align:middle line:84%
to buy larger lots of food
and spend less money on that

00:55:47.090 --> 00:55:50.250 align:middle line:84%
and maybe even start a
co-op as a result of that.

00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:51.860 align:middle line:84%
So these are the
kinds of things that

00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:55.050 align:middle line:84%
will allow the American
creativity to come together.

00:55:55.050 --> 00:55:58.080 align:middle line:84%
This community, getting outside
of the isolated individualism

00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:01.350 align:middle line:84%
is to not identify yourself
with your mask of your identity,

00:56:01.350 --> 00:56:02.550 align:middle line:90%
with your dream.

00:56:02.550 --> 00:56:04.450 align:middle line:84%
Your dream is something
that's continual.

00:56:04.450 --> 00:56:05.860 align:middle line:90%
It's creative.

00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:07.050 align:middle line:90%
It's not a caricature.

00:56:07.050 --> 00:56:08.690 align:middle line:90%
It's not a cartoon.

00:56:08.690 --> 00:56:10.540 align:middle line:90%
It's not an image.

00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
have to get away from.

00:56:12.330 --> 00:56:14.621 align:middle line:84%
Because we're are so wrapped
up with reality television

00:56:14.621 --> 00:56:19.002 align:middle line:84%
and stuff about image, we
need to break that habit.

00:56:19.002 --> 00:56:20.085 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: I agree with that.

00:56:20.085 --> 00:56:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting because
what you're talking about,

00:56:22.930 --> 00:56:25.130 align:middle line:84%
all of this again,
if you weren't

00:56:25.130 --> 00:56:28.820 align:middle line:84%
looking at it in these bit-sized
pieces, seems overwhelming.

00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:30.790 align:middle line:84%
But when you put this
together, you see,

00:56:30.790 --> 00:56:34.350 align:middle line:84%
gee, the problem actually you
can see is relatively systemic.

00:56:34.350 --> 00:56:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's sick, but
it's relatively easy

00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:38.670 align:middle line:84%
to understand the way
you break it down.

00:56:38.670 --> 00:56:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And the solutions
are too, but it

00:56:40.690 --> 00:56:44.510 align:middle line:84%
does require an accounting
of one's own life.

00:56:44.510 --> 00:56:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And the way you've
put this together, you

00:56:46.610 --> 00:56:48.760 align:middle line:84%
say you're going to make
these documents available?

00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:49.150 align:middle line:90%
ZEUS: Yeah, sure.

00:56:49.150 --> 00:56:51.070 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: That's great
because it really

00:56:51.070 --> 00:56:53.790 align:middle line:84%
does give a focal point for
people to gather together,

00:56:53.790 --> 00:56:56.860 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a family
or, again, a community,

00:56:56.860 --> 00:56:59.020 align:middle line:84%
or a group of young
people who really

00:56:59.020 --> 00:57:00.769 align:middle line:84%
are trying to figure
out, how are we going

00:57:00.769 --> 00:57:02.560 align:middle line:90%
to make the rent, you know?

00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:06.450 align:middle line:84%
The last one is liberate
yourself and get proactive.

00:57:06.450 --> 00:57:08.340 align:middle line:90%
ZEUS: Right, and that's it.

00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:13.300 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is a
joyful endeavor.

00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:16.720 align:middle line:84%
I think that a large part
of what's keeping people

00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:21.120 align:middle line:84%
from taking this not so
radical but actually quite

00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:24.850 align:middle line:84%
joyous step of stopping
what's not working, inside

00:57:24.850 --> 00:57:28.080 align:middle line:84%
and outside, and moving
into the creative realm

00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:29.510 align:middle line:84%
is this notion
that, one, they're

00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:30.890 align:middle line:90%
going to lose something.

00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:35.040 align:middle line:84%
Or, two, it's going
to be too risky.

00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:37.510 align:middle line:84%
Like, it's going to be
riskier than having nothing?

00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:39.510 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Riskier than what
they're already doing?

00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:42.070 align:middle line:84%
ZEUS: And being
miserable having nothing?

00:57:42.070 --> 00:57:43.370 align:middle line:90%
I've told young people.

00:57:43.370 --> 00:57:45.430 align:middle line:84%
I've said, there's
never been a better time

00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:48.060 align:middle line:84%
to be who you are
because even selling out

00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:50.682 align:middle line:90%
is not paying anymore.

00:57:50.682 --> 00:57:52.390 align:middle line:84%
You could sell out to
become that lawyer.

00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:55.370 align:middle line:84%
Now you have $400,000 of debt,
and you don't have a job.

00:57:55.370 --> 00:57:59.000 align:middle line:84%
You did the responsible thing,
and it's not working either.

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.300 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: I love it,
even when selling out

00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:03.010 align:middle line:90%
doesn't make a profit.

00:58:03.010 --> 00:58:06.300 align:middle line:84%
ZEUS: Yes, so I wanted to say,
you're not losing anything.

00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:08.850 align:middle line:84%
You're facing the realities of
the world in which the selling

00:58:08.850 --> 00:58:12.660 align:middle line:84%
out actually ends up making
you worse off than actually

00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:14.690 align:middle line:90%
following your own passion.

00:58:14.690 --> 00:58:16.320 align:middle line:90%
You're in less debt.

00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:19.280 align:middle line:84%
You're doing something
at least you care about,

00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:21.550 align:middle line:84%
and you're not being
abused and mistreated

00:58:21.550 --> 00:58:23.510 align:middle line:84%
by organizations or
corporations that

00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:27.800 align:middle line:84%
want to take every last
dime out of your hide

00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:31.280 align:middle line:84%
and every last sweat out
of you to make profit

00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:33.160 align:middle line:90%
and to ship it off to the 1%.

00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:37.640 align:middle line:84%
So before there was
at least a bargain

00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:39.100 align:middle line:90%
to be made with the devil.

00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:40.540 align:middle line:84%
There isn't that
bargain anymore.

00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:41.850 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: We already did that.

00:58:41.850 --> 00:58:43.558 align:middle line:84%
ZEUS: We've already
done that, and that's

00:58:43.558 --> 00:58:47.010 align:middle line:84%
what got us in this
place in the first place.

00:58:47.010 --> 00:58:51.700 align:middle line:84%
So I really want to emphasize
that this is a step of joy.

00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:53.280 align:middle line:90%
It's not admitting failure.

00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:57.800 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a
humorous acknowledgement.

00:58:57.800 --> 00:58:58.950 align:middle line:90%
It's all gone downhill.

00:58:58.950 --> 00:59:00.864 align:middle line:84%
Even selling out
has gone downhill.

00:59:00.864 --> 00:59:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And to have that kind
of good American humor

00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:05.972 align:middle line:84%
and good global
humor to say, OK,

00:59:05.972 --> 00:59:07.930 align:middle line:84%
especially if you're in
the younger generation,

00:59:07.930 --> 00:59:08.400 align:middle line:90%
let's get inventive.

00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:09.480 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: It's all an experiment.

00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:10.563 align:middle line:90%
This is how that one went.

00:59:10.563 --> 00:59:12.390 align:middle line:84%
ZEUS: It's an
experiment, and then

00:59:12.390 --> 00:59:14.950 align:middle line:84%
start using some of the
material in the book.

00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:17.280 align:middle line:84%
Start developing some
of your own experiments

00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:20.620 align:middle line:84%
to see what can actually
increase your quality of life

00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:23.570 align:middle line:90%
and actually decrease the cost.

00:59:23.570 --> 00:59:26.080 align:middle line:90%
And pool your resources.

00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:28.260 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And draw back your
energy for, as you say,

00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:30.450 align:middle line:84%
where you really
choose to use it for.

00:59:30.450 --> 00:59:32.610 align:middle line:84%
ZEUS: Right, and
it will accelerate

00:59:32.610 --> 00:59:34.800 align:middle line:84%
the downfall of the
sickness because once

00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:37.110 align:middle line:84%
you withdraw your energy
away from the sickness,

00:59:37.110 --> 00:59:38.794 align:middle line:84%
then it doesn't have
anything to go on.

00:59:38.794 --> 00:59:39.960 align:middle line:90%
It starts to consume itself.

00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:41.168 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah, it has no food.

00:59:41.168 --> 00:59:42.240 align:middle line:90%
ZEUS: It has no food.

00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:44.280 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost a
moral obligation

00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:46.440 align:middle line:84%
to do that as well as
a personal opportunity

00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:48.060 align:middle line:90%
and a communal opportunity.

00:59:48.060 --> 00:59:51.240 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And so with what's
coming up economically, I mean,

00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:54.740 align:middle line:84%
we hear various forecasts at
the beginning of the year.

00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:56.411 align:middle line:90%
And I pay attention.

00:59:56.411 --> 00:59:58.660 align:middle line:84%
You pay attention to probably
some of the same people.

00:59:58.660 --> 01:00:02.370 align:middle line:90%


01:00:02.370 --> 01:00:04.730 align:middle line:84%
Let's use 2007-2008
as an example.

01:00:04.730 --> 01:00:07.530 align:middle line:84%
What's it look
like for 2016-2017?

01:00:07.530 --> 01:00:08.390 align:middle line:90%
What's coming up?

01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:14.224 align:middle line:84%
ZEUS: Well, my book has
been very, very accurate.

01:00:14.224 --> 01:00:15.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do
an update on this,

01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:18.710 align:middle line:84%
but there's really
not much to update.

01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:21.970 align:middle line:84%
In this, I made these comments
like, the fundamentals will not

01:00:21.970 --> 01:00:23.310 align:middle line:90%
be followed.

01:00:23.310 --> 01:00:25.890 align:middle line:84%
The interests of
the hyper-wealthy

01:00:25.890 --> 01:00:28.410 align:middle line:84%
will continue to predominate
over the general interest,

01:00:28.410 --> 01:00:29.993 align:middle line:84%
and these things
have begun to happen.

01:00:29.993 --> 01:00:31.876 align:middle line:90%


01:00:31.876 --> 01:00:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And what's happened
is the bigger banks

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:35.070 align:middle line:90%
have gotten even bigger.

01:00:35.070 --> 01:00:39.610 align:middle line:84%
So the problems that
gave rise to 2008

01:00:39.610 --> 01:00:44.460 align:middle line:84%
have increased behind the
scenes, and people can feel it.

01:00:44.460 --> 01:00:46.650 align:middle line:84%
They are struggling
more and more.

01:00:46.650 --> 01:00:49.170 align:middle line:84%
They have hollowed out
their retirement accounts,

01:00:49.170 --> 01:00:52.310 align:middle line:84%
gotten into greater debt to
finance even a minimal life,

01:00:52.310 --> 01:00:55.195 align:middle line:84%
even a contracted or
lowered lifestyle.

01:00:55.195 --> 01:00:58.760 align:middle line:90%
And it's still not adequate.

01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And jobs are now
shrinking because they're

01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:02.190 align:middle line:84%
being automated and
so forth, and the jobs

01:01:02.190 --> 01:01:03.660 align:middle line:84%
that are being put
into the economy

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:06.740 align:middle line:90%
are half the salary or less.

01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:10.040 align:middle line:84%
They're lower-level service jobs
or part time with no benefits

01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:11.390 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:14.880 align:middle line:84%
So this, again,
is going to build.

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:19.190 align:middle line:84%
Before, I thought-- that's why
I tried to get this book out.

01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:24.540 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking,
2014, maybe 2016.

01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:26.460 align:middle line:84%
What I found is that
the technologies

01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:29.390 align:middle line:84%
for pushing off the
consciousness and reckoning

01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:30.250 align:middle line:90%
are well developed.

01:01:30.250 --> 01:01:32.380 align:middle line:84%
The American people
have allowed themselves

01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:35.017 align:middle line:84%
to be pulled into it
because they don't

01:01:35.017 --> 01:01:36.100 align:middle line:90%
want the reckoning either.

01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:40.330 align:middle line:84%
A part of them doesn't,
but it can't last forever.

01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:43.420 align:middle line:84%
When it comes, it's going
to be worse than 2008.

01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:45.080 align:middle line:84%
I do think it's
probably going to come

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:49.170 align:middle line:84%
within this presidential
term, from 2016 to 2020.

01:01:49.170 --> 01:01:51.970 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, looking
at the trends, I

01:01:51.970 --> 01:01:55.430 align:middle line:90%
don't see it going beyond 2020.

01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:57.125 align:middle line:90%
There's just too much happening.

01:01:57.125 --> 01:01:59.000 align:middle line:84%
Baby boomers retiring,
they're going to drop,

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.010 align:middle line:84%
need much more medical
care, and so forth.

01:02:01.010 --> 01:02:03.160 align:middle line:84%
So there are going to be
stresses on the system.

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:05.330 align:middle line:84%
Young people, they're
sitting around,

01:02:05.330 --> 01:02:08.490 align:middle line:84%
waiting for jobs that
are not materializing.

01:02:08.490 --> 01:02:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And also they themselves are
pushing for accountability.

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:14.480 align:middle line:84%
You saw this in the tremendous
support of Bernie Sanders.

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:20.009 align:middle line:84%
They're looking for a way to--
they're saying, wait a minute.

01:02:20.009 --> 01:02:21.800 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
accept this rigged game.

01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:24.560 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get involved--
politically, culturally,

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:27.060 align:middle line:84%
and socially in
our communities--

01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:29.280 align:middle line:84%
with meeting these needs
that are not being met.

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:33.140 align:middle line:84%
So that's both positive
and creating a resistance

01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:35.740 align:middle line:84%
to business as usual that
these things come around.

01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:38.320 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm not advocating
any particular candidate.

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:44.400 align:middle line:84%
So I don't want to be
juxtaposing candidates.

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:48.240 align:middle line:84%
But what I am
advocating for is a way

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:52.840 align:middle line:84%
of going forward into the
future in which we are clear

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:56.750 align:middle line:84%
of what the possible
creative possibilities are

01:02:56.750 --> 01:02:59.170 align:middle line:84%
and where the real
damage is happening.

01:02:59.170 --> 01:03:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And again, coming
up to the housing

01:03:02.290 --> 01:03:07.070 align:middle line:84%
market when people are saying,
who could have known, I did.

01:03:07.070 --> 01:03:08.365 align:middle line:90%
I wrote about it.

01:03:08.365 --> 01:03:09.250 align:middle line:90%
And look at it.

01:03:09.250 --> 01:03:14.760 align:middle line:84%
You have houses in the Bay Area
that are three times the rent.

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:17.390 align:middle line:84%
For the same house, you
are paying a mortgage

01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:19.540 align:middle line:84%
that is three times
what you would pay

01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:21.885 align:middle line:90%
for that same house in rent.

01:03:21.885 --> 01:03:25.020 align:middle line:90%
That cannot continue.

01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:27.520 align:middle line:90%
It is so skewed.

01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing that would
not allow a person to say this

01:03:31.210 --> 01:03:34.580 align:middle line:84%
is going to collapse
sooner rather

01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:37.376 align:middle line:84%
than later is to just
delude yourself and say, oh.

01:03:37.376 --> 01:03:38.750 align:middle line:84%
The market's just
going to go up.

01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:40.520 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: One little
glimmer of hope

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:44.480 align:middle line:84%
which we see on television,
some of the good side of media,

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:46.930 align:middle line:84%
is the notion of these
little mini homes

01:03:46.930 --> 01:03:50.240 align:middle line:84%
where people have their own
little, tiny domains for just

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:53.260 align:middle line:84%
really maybe several
thousand dollars.

01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:55.610 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people look at
it, and their heart opens.

01:03:55.610 --> 01:03:58.800 align:middle line:90%
It's like, that's so appealing.

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:00.225 align:middle line:90%
Talk about that for just a sec.

01:04:00.225 --> 01:04:02.100 align:middle line:84%
ZEUS: I think-- and I
do want to leave people

01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:03.410 align:middle line:90%
with a very hopeful note.

01:04:03.410 --> 01:04:05.670 align:middle line:84%
I am a very hopeful
person in this.

01:04:05.670 --> 01:04:08.576 align:middle line:84%
Even as the system collapses,
I don't see that as a tragedy.

01:04:08.576 --> 01:04:09.700 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: No, I don't either.

01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:15.180 align:middle line:84%
ZEUS: I see it as the opening
to the kind of simplicity,

01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:18.560 align:middle line:84%
community action
and interaction.

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:20.040 align:middle line:90%
Tiny homes is a great example.

01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:21.830 align:middle line:84%
What are the quality
of life things

01:04:21.830 --> 01:04:24.800 align:middle line:84%
that are brought in by
a tiny home, intimacy

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:25.650 align:middle line:90%
being one of them?

01:04:25.650 --> 01:04:26.660 align:middle line:84%
You know, in the
old system, oh, I

01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:28.010 align:middle line:90%
want to stay away from somebody.

01:04:28.010 --> 01:04:29.510 align:middle line:90%
I want my distance.

01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:32.890 align:middle line:84%
But these huge McMansions
are creating situations

01:04:32.890 --> 01:04:35.170 align:middle line:84%
where families don't
even know each other.

01:04:35.170 --> 01:04:37.930 align:middle line:84%
They're watching TV, and
they're doing things separately.

01:04:37.930 --> 01:04:40.530 align:middle line:84%
With these tiny
homes, you're actively

01:04:40.530 --> 01:04:42.320 align:middle line:90%
participating together.

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:45.400 align:middle line:90%
You're making meals together.

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:50.420 align:middle line:84%
You have to fold the table
up to get your bed out,

01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:52.170 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it happens to be.

01:04:52.170 --> 01:04:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And as we begin to
understand that this

01:04:55.490 --> 01:05:00.240 align:middle line:84%
is where real quality of lies
in connection, in sharing

01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:03.270 align:middle line:84%
and giving, and also giving
to future generations,

01:05:03.270 --> 01:05:06.520 align:middle line:84%
tiny homes are making
the expense and footprint

01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:08.870 align:middle line:84%
that we have for future
generations much less.

01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:12.470 align:middle line:84%
So we're loving and sharing
people that haven't even

01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:13.940 align:middle line:90%
been born yet.

01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And this awakens
something in us.

01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:18.450 align:middle line:84%
You say, you're
buying back our soul.

01:05:18.450 --> 01:05:20.990 align:middle line:10%
This is awakening the spirit.

01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:22.990 align:middle line:10%
It's awakening the soul.

01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:28.320 align:middle line:10%
It's showing by your activities
in the world that you get it,

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:29.710 align:middle line:10%
that it's about spirit.

01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:32.590 align:middle line:84%
It's about extending that
spirit to other people

01:05:32.590 --> 01:05:34.890 align:middle line:84%
and about doing it in these
really inventive ways,

01:05:34.890 --> 01:05:38.390 align:middle line:84%
like these tiny homes or
local currency or farmers

01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:40.320 align:middle line:90%
markets or urban gardening.

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:41.120 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh--

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:42.203 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: All stuff we love.

01:05:42.203 --> 01:05:45.650 align:middle line:84%
ZEUS: Yes, exactly, we love
doing this, so let's do it.

01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:48.360 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: We need to assess
what our own true values are

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:51.090 align:middle line:84%
and look at where we can
start conserving and buy back

01:05:51.090 --> 01:05:52.064 align:middle line:90%
our souls.

01:05:52.064 --> 01:05:52.980 align:middle line:90%
ZEUS: Oh, I love that.

01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:53.920 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:55.012 align:middle line:90%
Buy back our souls.

01:05:55.012 --> 01:05:56.700 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Yeah, buy back
our souls, meanwhile we'll

01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:58.200 align:middle line:84%
have you on for
another conversation

01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:01.060 align:middle line:84%
down the road on education
because your thoughts on it

01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:04.140 align:middle line:84%
are as clear and lucid
and as transformative,

01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:08.270 align:middle line:84%
destructive of the old system,
as your thoughts on this.

01:06:08.270 --> 01:06:11.890 align:middle line:84%
So again, I thank you
for your clear thinking.

01:06:11.890 --> 01:06:13.470 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:15.470 align:middle line:84%
I think what Zeus
has to say is nothing

01:06:15.470 --> 01:06:17.740 align:middle line:84%
short of a call to
action to actually give

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:19.270 align:middle line:90%
a damn once again.

01:06:19.270 --> 01:06:22.030 align:middle line:84%
You can order a copy of his
book through major booksellers

01:06:22.030 --> 01:06:24.740 align:middle line:84%
and start digging deep
inside your own heart.

01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:26.410 align:middle line:10%
Let's see what we're
willing to release

01:06:26.410 --> 01:06:28.660 align:middle line:10%
to have a more beautiful
and satisfying future.

01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:30.260 align:middle line:10%
What are we willing to do?

01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:33.750 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank you
for joining us here at Gaia.
