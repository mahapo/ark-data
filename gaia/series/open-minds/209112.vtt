>> What I can tell you is that
this was the toughest project

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.630 align:middle line:84%
for Belinda, the human
being, that I've ever done.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.630 align:middle line:84%
From the angel's
perspective, religion

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.100 align:middle line:90%
has a lot to do with it.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.400 align:middle line:84%
When you become
just ego, that means

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.980 align:middle line:84%
that fierce old
male and old female

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.550 align:middle line:84%
eat you for breakfast,
lunch, and dinner.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.140 align:middle line:84%
I love the way the angels
define fear in their new book,

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.580 align:middle line:90%
fear is--

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.480 align:middle line:84%
>> What's the trajectory you
and the angels see humanity on?

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I just have to let
them answer this question.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.770 align:middle line:90%

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.280 align:middle line:84%
>> You're not going
to be rescued by ETs.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.940 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
rescue yourselves.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.255 align:middle line:90%
Holy cow, they're big today.

>> Belinda, did you think it
would be appropriate to read

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.213 align:middle line:84%
the short meditation,
the Purple Door,

00:01:01.213 --> 00:01:03.650 align:middle line:84%

favorite angel lady is back,

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.590 align:middle line:90%
Belinda Womack.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.050 align:middle line:84%
This time, the angels are
going to help us understand

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.090 align:middle line:84%
the human propensity
for feelings

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.840 align:middle line:84%
of lack and unworthiness,
which Belinda has an antidote

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.410 align:middle line:90%
for in her new book.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.920 align:middle line:84%
It's chock full of absolutely
beautiful and uplifting

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.520 align:middle line:84%
meditations for every type
of self criticism and fear,

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.650 align:middle line:84%
which is so relevant
in today's world.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:30.567 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back, Belinda.

00:01:30.567 --> 00:01:32.733 align:middle line:84%
>>BELINDA WOMACK: It's
wonderful to be back, Regina.

00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And welcome
back, 12 archangels.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:35.630 align:middle line:90%
They're here with us.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.630 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: Oh, they're here.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.367 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell me
first, Belinda, why--

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:43.450 align:middle line:84%
whether you are the angels--
probably the angels--

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.710 align:middle line:90%
why you all--

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.550 align:middle line:84%
y'all decided to write
this particular book,

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.430 align:middle line:90%
as if it wasn't obvious, right?

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: The
Angels really wanted

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.620 align:middle line:84%
to give a manual
or a prescription

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.990 align:middle line:90%
on human suffering.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.480 align:middle line:10%
And they really want--

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.310 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's always
been their mission

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.560 align:middle line:10%
to help us to understand that
what we experience really

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.950 align:middle line:10%
is changeable,
it's transformable,

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.770 align:middle line:10%
and we can really experience
something far better.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.220 align:middle line:84%
We have some work to do in
order to make that happen,

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.620 align:middle line:90%
but it's very possible.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.560 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, and also, just
on a kind of large picture

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.690 align:middle line:10%
view, one of the
dominant messages

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.450 align:middle line:10%
that's been floating around
Earth now for decades

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.900 align:middle line:10%
is that we people
are horrible, we

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.420 align:middle line:10%
are going to cause mass
extinction of our own species

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.090 align:middle line:10%
and probably every other
species in the Earth

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.720 align:middle line:10%
itself because of our selfish,
horrible, bad behavior.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.090 align:middle line:84%
This is actually a message
I'm getting really tired

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.040 align:middle line:84%
of because it's not
truthful, but there

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.290 align:middle line:84%
are interests that would
like to have us believe that.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to talk to
the angels about this too,

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.330 align:middle line:84%
but what is your understanding
of what we, humans,

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.710 align:middle line:84%
who are struggling to progress
and advance ourselves,

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.920 align:middle line:84%
what's the trajectory you and
the angels see humanity on?

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: I just have to let
them answer this question.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: Our message is that
human beings are divine beings

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.220 align:middle line:84%
and they are playing out
their movies and their stories

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.870 align:middle line:84%
and they are really
showing on the outside what

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.030 align:middle line:90%
they feel on the inside.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.410 align:middle line:90%
Are they horrible?

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.270 align:middle line:90%
Are they terrible beings?

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.910 align:middle line:90%
No, they are divine beings.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.020 align:middle line:90%
You are divine beings, humanity.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.060 align:middle line:84%
What we need to say is
that you have forgotten

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.180 align:middle line:84%
how to feel your
feelings, you've

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.060 align:middle line:84%
forgotten how to be
creative, not all of you.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.440 align:middle line:84%
But as you just step
back into the bigger

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.310 align:middle line:84%
part of your brain,
the wiser part of you,

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.400 align:middle line:84%
the more evolved
part of you, then you

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.860 align:middle line:84%
have all the power to lift
up the ugly, the aspects that

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:12.730 align:middle line:84%
have fallen deep into fear, deep
into hell, and you can rise up.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.610 align:middle line:90%
And you are rising up.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.380 align:middle line:90%
Are rising up.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.980 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
be rescued by ETs,

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.680 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
rescue yourselves.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And because of divine oneness,
we are in this with you.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.200 align:middle line:84%
So all of the great
universe must see humanity

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.290 align:middle line:90%
and schoolroom Earth transform.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.550 align:middle line:90%
We're in it together.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And so no, you are not
horrible creatures.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.230 align:middle line:84%
You are so magnificent
and we love you.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.780 align:middle line:90%
We love you.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.850 align:middle line:90%
Well, that answered that for us.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:56.650 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Belinda.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.000 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, archangels.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.670 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for letting
yourself have the information

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.520 align:middle line:84%
flow through you and,
which is so very true.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'll ask them a
continued set of questions

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.890 align:middle line:84%
about the second
half of that question

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.390 align:middle line:84%
I asked them a little later,
and I know they're aware of it.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.780 align:middle line:84%
So what I wanted to say is
the frequency of the words

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.090 align:middle line:84%
that they-- this
was a channeled work

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.520 align:middle line:84%
and the meditations
that were given

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.320 align:middle line:84%
is so high that I had
a hard time staying

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.170 align:middle line:84%
with it because I kept
falling into an altered state.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.480 align:middle line:84%
Like, as soon as I'd start
reading the meditation,

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.470 align:middle line:84%
I was gone because,
for me, they drew me

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.020 align:middle line:90%
in so deeply and so beautifully.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a book
that's not really

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.770 align:middle line:84%
meant to just be a read
where you read through it.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.240 align:middle line:84%
This is a book to be utilized
as a companion in your life,

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.080 align:middle line:90%
it seems to me.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.360 align:middle line:90%
Now tell me your take on it.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.380 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: What I can tell you
is that this was the toughest

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.110 align:middle line:84%
project for Belinda,
the human being,

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.040 align:middle line:84%
that I've ever done
because of the love

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.700 align:middle line:90%
intensity and the thoroughness.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And each and every word had
to be perfectly orchestrated

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.300 align:middle line:90%
vibrationally--

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, that's clear.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:16.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: --because their
mission with this book

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:21.730 align:middle line:84%
is they want the reader
to be able to read,

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:27.807 align:middle line:84%
just to read it, even a
page, and feel different.

00:06:27.807 --> 00:06:29.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think
it does do that.

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:30.650 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, it does that.

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.960 align:middle line:84%
I had to keep putting
it down, wake myself--

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.530 align:middle line:84%
not wake myself, bring myself
back into a cognitive state

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.550 align:middle line:84%
again, left brain state,
to be able to read

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.410 align:middle line:90%
the next chapter for example.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.770 align:middle line:84%
But it really
focused on the fears

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.680 align:middle line:84%
that we have and
this constant state

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.660 align:middle line:84%
humans have found
themselves in for thousands

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.330 align:middle line:90%
of years of feeling less than.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And I contend it's
not our fault.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:00.230 align:middle line:84%
We've been given one
message after another

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.570 align:middle line:84%
from those who
propose to be higher,

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.660 align:middle line:90%
that you're not good enough.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.850 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: From the
Angel's perspective,

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:12.035 align:middle line:84%
religion has a lot to do
with it and there's no--

00:07:12.035 --> 00:07:15.590 align:middle line:84%
they just want to make it clear
they do not judge religion

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:20.180 align:middle line:84%
when there is love and
oneness and benevolence

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.590 align:middle line:90%
and helpfulness.

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:26.360 align:middle line:84%
But when what they call the
fierce old male patriarchy gets

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:31.520 align:middle line:84%
in there and creates a
hierarchy, then what happens

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.010 align:middle line:84%
is that the feminine,
which means the creative,

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:39.080 align:middle line:84%
it means the child, it means
the creative imagination,

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:45.380 align:middle line:84%
is just swept away and it
becomes this internal power

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:50.330 align:middle line:84%
struggle for the human being
and externally, that human being

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:54.560 align:middle line:84%
forgets who they are, they're
no longer a child of God

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.230 align:middle line:84%
or a child of creator,
a child of source.

00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:00.440 align:middle line:90%
They say pick your terminology.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:08.800 align:middle line:84%
You become this abandoned,
unworthy, how do I survive?

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:13.900 align:middle line:84%
How am I going to
manage in my life?

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:18.280 align:middle line:84%
You become ego that
has become pulled away

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:22.690 align:middle line:84%
from your own soul, your own
blanket of care and protection

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:25.090 align:middle line:90%
and love and nurturance.

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And when you become
just ego, that

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.030 align:middle line:84%
means that fierce old
male and old female

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:34.360 align:middle line:84%
eat you for breakfast,
lunch, and dinner.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.221 align:middle line:84%
And that's called
unworthiness and less than.

00:08:37.221 --> 00:08:38.679 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's
talk about that

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:40.929 align:middle line:84%
because the book
goes into that a lot,

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:44.210 align:middle line:90%
the old male and the old female.

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:47.110 align:middle line:84%
OK, tell us what it
looks like because it's

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.060 align:middle line:84%
given an actual
description in the book,

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:52.210 align:middle line:84%
and some of the meditations
say, if you-- when

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.760 align:middle line:84%
you come through this door,
you will see the old male

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:55.750 align:middle line:90%
and the old female.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And they're given very
visual descriptions.

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Talk about what that looks like
for these archetypal qualities

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:03.340 align:middle line:90%
in humanity.

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:06.340 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: Well, fierce old
male looks like an emperor.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And the angels say, please, we
say everything metaphorically

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:12.620 align:middle line:90%
anyway.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't like the
terminology of old male,

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.580 align:middle line:90%
call him the old dinosaur.

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:24.880 align:middle line:84%
But he's an emperor and he's
stern and he knows everything,

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.470 align:middle line:84%
and his job is to pull
you into negative judgment

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:31.840 align:middle line:90%
and into control.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:35.650 align:middle line:84%
When the ego goes into
control, it immediately--

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:40.150 align:middle line:84%
we are pulled into the past or
we're pulled into the future

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:45.250 align:middle line:84%
where we're powerless because
all we are is in negativity

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:51.070 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not good enough or in
some cases, we can go into,

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:54.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm better than everybody
else because that's

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:55.967 align:middle line:90%
part of the old male's game.

00:09:55.967 --> 00:09:58.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you notice the
word, now, doesn't come up.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.770 align:middle line:90%
You're never in the present.

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:01.840 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: Right, absolutely.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's very
hard to be experiencing

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.600 align:middle line:84%
more refined feelings if
you're going to the past

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.770 align:middle line:90%
or to the future.

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:10.210 align:middle line:90%
It's not the same.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: Well, and it
pulls you into fear.

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:12.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fear.

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:13.630 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: And so fear is--

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:18.520 align:middle line:84%
I love the way the angels
define fear in their new book.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:24.380 align:middle line:84%
Fear is anything less in
vibration than undiluted love.

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:25.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:30.820 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: So undiluted love
is heaven and its source,

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:34.690 align:middle line:84%
it's the great universe,
it's what we are made out of.

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:37.330 align:middle line:84%
So anything less
than that, we get

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.760 align:middle line:84%
to play with here
on schoolroom Earth.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And fierce old male
and old female,

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:46.330 align:middle line:84%
that's what they play with,
is they play with fear.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And fear pulls that
ego away from soul,

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.220 align:middle line:90%
away from its divinity.

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:55.090 align:middle line:84%
So again, we feel
that we are less than.

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And then, because we
have it within us,

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:00.320 align:middle line:90%
that's what we experience.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.400 align:middle line:84%
We don't have heaven
in our daily lives.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.750 align:middle line:90%
We have lack.

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:05.950 align:middle line:90%
We have poverty.

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:07.300 align:middle line:90%
We have suffering.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.890 align:middle line:90%
We have misery.

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:11.260 align:middle line:84%
In this new text
from the angels,

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:12.790 align:middle line:90%
they take care of everything.

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:13.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They do.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.120 align:middle line:84%
And like you said,
each chapter is

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:21.160 align:middle line:84%
very precise in the aspect of
these characteristics that it

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.730 align:middle line:84%
helps transform, the way the
work itself helps transform it,

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:28.010 align:middle line:84%
the words in the text, but also
the accompanying meditations.

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:32.170 align:middle line:84%
So let's go into the
old female and the traps

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:33.880 align:middle line:90%
and games of the old female.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.570 align:middle line:90%
Go for it.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:40.640 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: The old female is
probably even more treacherous,

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.050 align:middle line:90%
in some ways, than the old male.

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:46.550 align:middle line:90%
However, she does have--

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:50.750 align:middle line:84%
she does have some helpfulness
because fierce old female pulls

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:56.750 align:middle line:84%
us into guilt, number one,
shame, unworthiness, the need

00:11:56.750 --> 00:12:01.430 align:middle line:84%
to analyze ourselves, the
need to punish ourselves

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:05.790 align:middle line:84%
or want to blame others
or punish others.

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:08.840 align:middle line:84%
She really pulls us
into the past, right?

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And where we've been
victimized in the past, where

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.390 align:middle line:90%
we've been hurt in the past.

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:17.330 align:middle line:84%
The blessing, when
you recognize her,

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:22.250 align:middle line:84%
is she has pulled me into the
past, and if I'm in the past,

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:24.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm not in the present moment.

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:26.330 align:middle line:90%
And not only that.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:30.890 align:middle line:84%
If I'm in the past and I don't
transform this fear and these

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:34.710 align:middle line:84%
negative feelings, these
really yank-you-down-into-hell

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:37.580 align:middle line:84%
feelings, I'm going to--
that's what I'm going to have

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:39.090 align:middle line:90%
in my future.

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:43.670 align:middle line:84%
So she does give us
a blessing in that

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:47.450 align:middle line:84%
she can help us recognize
when we've fallen back

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:48.980 align:middle line:90%
into the past.

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And what we want to
do, human beings,

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:55.550 align:middle line:84%
is say, no, I'm
going to be here now.

00:12:55.550 --> 00:13:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Because when we are here
now, we have full access

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:03.672 align:middle line:90%
to source and to--

00:13:03.672 --> 00:13:05.255 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everything
is happening now.

00:13:05.255 --> 00:13:06.050 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: --undiluted love.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:07.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:09.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, I love that
about it because some

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:11.570 align:middle line:84%
of these meditations say,
as you enter through,

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:15.470 align:middle line:84%
you will see the old masculine,
you'll see the old feminine,

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:17.430 align:middle line:84%
and you'll hear
them talking to you.

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:20.060 align:middle line:84%
So it's already setting
you up to say, no worries,

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:21.830 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
be talking to you

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:25.160 align:middle line:84%
and now you're going to
essentially pull away

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.840 align:middle line:84%
from those messages and we're
going to go beyond that.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And so we can't really
shift without acknowledging

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:31.760 align:middle line:90%
where we've been.

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And I will talk
to the archangels

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:36.350 align:middle line:84%
about that collective
even DNA memory

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:39.200 align:middle line:84%
of where we've been that
is so stuck in humanity.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.230 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things is,
one of the first meditations

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:44.150 align:middle line:90%
is you go through a purple door.

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And again, when I
very first met you

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:50.860 align:middle line:84%
years ago through your
first book, what drew me

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.860 align:middle line:84%
in so deeply again, I'd go
into this altered state,

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:59.020 align:middle line:84%
is the crystal clear
beauty of the meditations

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:04.370 align:middle line:84%
which are based on frequency,
shape, color, nature.

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And so the purple door
features largely in this,

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:09.560 align:middle line:90%
but there's a reason for it.

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.220 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what
the purple door represents.

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:14.510 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: It's the
corpus callosum.

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:21.610 align:middle line:84%
So even this a symbolic because
the human brain has many parts.

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:27.100 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it has a left
globe and a right globe

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:29.990 align:middle line:84%
that we think of as
masculine and feminine.

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:32.710 align:middle line:84%
It's got an amygdala,
a limbic cortex,

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:36.670 align:middle line:84%
but it has a corpus callosum,
which actually is a doorway.

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And so that doorway takes
us from the male mind,

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:45.790 align:middle line:84%
which is rational and
logical and analytical,

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:51.430 align:middle line:84%
it's where the ego lives,
into the feminine brain.

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:53.740 align:middle line:90%
And the feminine brain is--

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:59.290 align:middle line:84%
it's bigger, it's more powerful,
it's creative, it's intuitive,

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:04.810 align:middle line:84%
and it's magical, and
it's where we can access--

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:09.880 align:middle line:84%
all of heaven is right there
through our creative brain.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And the purple door is
made of the violet fire--

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:16.940 align:middle line:90%
that's what the angels call it--

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:20.620 align:middle line:84%
the energy of the crown
chakra, and that energy

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:24.700 align:middle line:84%
transforms fear immediately,
it transforms it into love.

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:30.160 align:middle line:84%
And it works with a
very powerful quality

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.010 align:middle line:84%
of undiluted love,
which is forgiveness.

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:34.910 align:middle line:90%
Forgiveness as a power.

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And when we forgive,
especially that old male--

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.840 align:middle line:84%
and they call her
as the mean queen--

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:45.520 align:middle line:84%
when you forgive the past and
that guilt and shame and blame,

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:46.900 align:middle line:90%
then you're free.

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.300 align:middle line:84%
So the purple door is
made of violet fire

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.970 align:middle line:84%
and it's got a little
bit of fuchsia,

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:56.980 align:middle line:84%
which they say is the energy
of the third eye, the third eye

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:58.810 align:middle line:90%
at its highest vibration.

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:01.240 align:middle line:84%
The third eye helps
us, that chakra,

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:04.540 align:middle line:84%
that energy helps
us to see beyond.

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.990 align:middle line:84%
It's where the clairs are,
clairsentience, clairgnosis,

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:10.570 align:middle line:90%
clairaudience, clairvoyance.

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:13.420 align:middle line:84%
So we take a little
bit of that fuchsia

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:17.020 align:middle line:84%
at the highest vibration
for that third eye to work,

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:20.380 align:middle line:84%
dash it in, throw it
in with violet fire

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.510 align:middle line:90%
and you have the purple door.

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I love the
purple door and also what

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:26.170 align:middle line:90%
the purple door opens on to.

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And, Belinda, I know we
talked about this a week

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.410 align:middle line:90%
or two ago about the potential.

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:32.830 align:middle line:84%
We'll see where we are on
time, but if we have time,

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:37.390 align:middle line:84%
I copied off the purple door
meditation because it's short,

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:38.470 align:middle line:90%
it's beautiful.

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:40.810 align:middle line:84%
So if we have time
at the end, would you

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:43.420 align:middle line:84%
mind then if we--
you or I, either one

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:46.900 align:middle line:84%
can read it and let everybody
go into that very still

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:50.300 align:middle line:84%
magical place and just
follow along with the colors.

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:51.560 align:middle line:90%
I love it-- because I love it.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.900 align:middle line:84%
I want everyone to have a
chance to experience that.

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.000 align:middle line:90%
So we'll try to make that work.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.360 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that
is in this book

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.780 align:middle line:84%
is where the angels are
saying, if you choose

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:05.230 align:middle line:84%
to live in a provable
concrete world,

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:09.520 align:middle line:84%
this will lead to unfairness,
poverty, and suffering.

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:12.430 align:middle line:84%
And the scientific
materialism has

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:15.339 align:middle line:84%
been dominating the
mental landscape

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:18.410 align:middle line:84%
and scientific landscape
for a few hundred years now.

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:23.839 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what they're
intending to say with that.

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:28.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: When you pull the ego
into the masculine and you then

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:30.050 align:middle line:90%
lower the vibration--

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:33.040 align:middle line:84%
so they just want to explain
the divine masculine-- is there

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.030 align:middle line:90%
a divine masculine?

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:34.195 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:34.195 --> 00:17:34.930 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: Yes, of course.

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:35.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:38.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: He's
clarity and focus.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.200 align:middle line:84%
He's what brings things
into manifestation.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.950 align:middle line:84%
But when you lower that
vibration, it becomes concrete.

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:48.730 align:middle line:84%
The ego or the consciousness--
there's different

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:51.490 align:middle line:84%
terminologies, that
angels stick with ego--

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:56.710 align:middle line:84%
then it falls down and it
goes very concrete world

00:17:56.710 --> 00:18:00.820 align:middle line:84%
into control and
into predictability,

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:02.290 align:middle line:90%
and it's terrified.

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:04.270 align:middle line:90%
So everything becomes--

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:05.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Must be provable.

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: Absolutely,
intangible.

00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And again, they just
keep repeating right now,

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:14.080 align:middle line:90%
predictable, controllable.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:20.110 align:middle line:84%
But when you lift the vibration
of the ego just with love--

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:22.810 align:middle line:84%
you know, a very simple
thing that they say

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:28.570 align:middle line:84%
is just say, I surrender my
ego to the joy of my soul.

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And immediately you
just say those words,

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:31.750 align:middle line:90%
and you feel better.

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:34.870 align:middle line:84%
It takes the vibration
of ego, which

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:38.110 align:middle line:84%
is the part of us that
allows us to believe we're

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:39.820 align:middle line:90%
separate from one another.

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:42.310 align:middle line:90%
We get to experience fear.

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:45.250 align:middle line:84%
We get to perceive
that Regina is

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:46.990 align:middle line:90%
Regina and Belinda is Belinda.

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:51.100 align:middle line:84%
So you take that ego
and then you wrap it

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:53.830 align:middle line:84%
in the feminine,
the divine feminine

00:18:53.830 --> 00:19:00.490 align:middle line:84%
and you allow that ego to
be creative and responsive.

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And connected with
nature, it becomes genius.

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:07.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and that
genius cannot occur when

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:10.090 align:middle line:84%
you're constantly trying
to reduce things down

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:12.220 align:middle line:90%
to their concrete pieces--

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:14.950 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: Because we're
dreaming our reality is a being.

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: How can you
prove tomorrow when

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:19.820 align:middle line:90%
you haven't created it yet?

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:21.362 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
many people watching

00:19:21.362 --> 00:19:23.695 align:middle line:84%
this try to share these
concepts with friends and family

00:19:23.695 --> 00:19:24.495 align:middle line:90%
members.

00:19:24.495 --> 00:19:25.570 align:middle line:90%
Well, where's the proof?

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:27.640 align:middle line:84%
I haven't seen
any proof of this.

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And the fact of the
matter is that's coming

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:33.760 align:middle line:84%
from a place of fear and the
need to have knowable outcomes.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.260 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:39.490 align:middle line:84%
But also, it leaves people who
are willing to take the leap

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:43.010 align:middle line:84%
and have faith in the
non-material world,

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:45.670 align:middle line:84%
makes them feel quite vulnerable
and, oftentimes, judged

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:46.960 align:middle line:90%
by others too.

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.950 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: And Regina,
it's all about feeling.

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:54.490 align:middle line:84%
When you invite a
friend or family

00:19:54.490 --> 00:20:00.970 align:middle line:84%
member to taste undiluted love
through a simple affirmation

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:04.000 align:middle line:84%
or just taking a deep
breath, then in it

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.010 align:middle line:90%
becomes it's an experience.

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the 12
archangels are so about,

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:12.420 align:middle line:84%
allow undiluted
love, that vibration,

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:20.130 align:middle line:84%
that manifest heaven here
on Earth for you, feel it,

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:21.360 align:middle line:90%
feel it.

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And as you allow that feeling
to grow and to evolve,

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:27.800 align:middle line:90%
life changes.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've said
that on every show--

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:32.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Because it's true.

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:34.850 align:middle line:84%
OK, honey, do you
mind if we go ahead

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:36.140 align:middle line:90%
and talk to the 12 archangels?

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:37.130 align:middle line:90%
Are they ready to jump in?

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: They're right here.

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:38.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:38.580 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.163 align:middle line:84%
So we'll go ahead
and do that and I'll

00:20:40.163 --> 00:20:42.320 align:middle line:84%
ask a couple of
challenging questions.

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.120 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: OK.

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:49.940 align:middle line:90%


00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:53.953 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you are ready, we
look forward to your questions.

00:20:53.953 --> 00:20:55.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank
you, and thank you

00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:56.855 align:middle line:90%
so much for joining us here.

00:20:56.855 --> 00:21:00.260 align:middle line:90%


00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:01.940 align:middle line:84%
One of the questions
that's always

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:06.410 align:middle line:84%
been challenging in talking
with you and with others

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:10.070 align:middle line:84%
from beyond
interdimensionally is

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:12.440 align:middle line:84%
that we, humans, are getting
that there's something up,

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:16.560 align:middle line:84%
that we have been at somewhat
of an unfair advantage

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.340 align:middle line:84%
or disadvantage here
because we have been

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:22.100 align:middle line:90%
interfered with by some others.

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And it almost feels like
it's simply an uneven playing

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:31.820 align:middle line:84%
field when humans have such
good hearts and potential to be

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:34.790 align:middle line:90%
kept so small by intention.

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:36.440 align:middle line:84%
Can you speak to
this a little bit

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:39.260 align:middle line:84%
about why would other
species interfere

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:42.730 align:middle line:90%
with us to begin with?

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:45.690 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: We cannot answer
that question, Regina,

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:49.380 align:middle line:84%
because we have a better
question to answer.

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:51.970 align:middle line:90%


00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:56.280 align:middle line:84%
How are souls that come
from the central soul, that

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.350 align:middle line:84%
come from the
great universe, are

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:03.510 align:middle line:84%
going to discover their
incredible power if they

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:05.560 align:middle line:90%
are not tested?

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:10.210 align:middle line:84%
So from our perspective, we
see things a bit differently.

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:13.920 align:middle line:10%
We do not encourage
victim consciousness

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:19.680 align:middle line:10%
even if you want to see that
is coming from star systems

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.090 align:middle line:10%
elsewhere.

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:25.740 align:middle line:84%
From our place, we
are called to hold

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:28.440 align:middle line:84%
the vibration of
purest love, which

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.550 align:middle line:90%
is, love is the greatest power.

00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And so we say to you,
human beings, move beyond,

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:43.500 align:middle line:84%
evolve beyond who has tampered
with whom, who is interfering

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.480 align:middle line:90%
through the astral realm.

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:48.120 align:middle line:90%
We say it is all fear.

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:52.110 align:middle line:84%
When you understand that
only through fear can you

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:56.870 align:middle line:84%
be tampered with, then
you start to awaken

00:22:56.870 --> 00:23:01.130 align:middle line:84%
and you make a very simple
choice that we repeat over

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:04.220 align:middle line:84%
and over and over,
you choose love.

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:07.100 align:middle line:84%
But you do it with your
thoughts and you do it

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:12.380 align:middle line:84%
with your feelings and you be
here now and you hold the love.

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And you say, you intend, I am
a flowing fountain of love.

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:19.770 align:middle line:90%
I am a vortex of love.

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:22.680 align:middle line:90%
I am a lighthouse of love.

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And you rise above
any kind of energies

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:32.920 align:middle line:84%
that reach you through the
astral realm, anything.

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:37.420 align:middle line:84%
But not only that you
become a transformer

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:42.970 align:middle line:84%
of the astral planes where
we shall just say shenanigans

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:45.350 align:middle line:90%
can happen.

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:46.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:49.470 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for acknowledging
shenanigans can happen.

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:51.230 align:middle line:90%
So we know we're not crazy.

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:54.380 align:middle line:84%
The hard thing is people
think, am I-- am I crazy?

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:56.250 align:middle line:84%
Is there something
wrong with this picture?

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:58.670 align:middle line:84%
So I appreciate that little
bit of acknowledgment

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:00.320 align:middle line:90%
that shenanigans can happen.

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.840 align:middle line:84%
But I more appreciate
the fact that there's

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:05.645 align:middle line:84%
a much higher question and
answer that you gave us.

00:24:05.645 --> 00:24:07.340 align:middle line:90%
That was very beautiful.

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And so the notion,
because it kind of

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:12.450 align:middle line:84%
flows from that, of humans
feeling, I am not enough.

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:13.745 align:middle line:90%
I'm not good enough.

00:24:13.745 --> 00:24:17.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm the source of all problems.

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:21.560 align:middle line:84%
How did that come about and
then become perpetuated,

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:26.710 align:middle line:84%
even in kind of ancestral
memory in our DNA?

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:27.760 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: Oh, my.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:32.940 align:middle line:84%
This is quite the
story for a humanity.

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:37.950 align:middle line:84%
When the human being
first experienced

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:45.050 align:middle line:84%
fear, and fear infects
mostly the masculine, the ego

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:48.950 align:middle line:84%
part of you that has the
ability to believe that you are

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:51.830 align:middle line:84%
separate, then you
began to believe

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:57.400 align:middle line:84%
that you are separate from
source, separate from angels,

00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:01.990 align:middle line:84%
separate from trees and
flowers and amoebas.

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:05.860 align:middle line:84%
As that separation
began and fear came in

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:10.540 align:middle line:84%
to the genetic
coding, unworthiness,

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:13.630 align:middle line:84%
through the belief
in abandonment,

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:17.530 align:middle line:84%
that if there is a creator, if
there is a beginning, if there

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:21.220 align:middle line:84%
is a source, I,
as a human being,

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:23.050 align:middle line:90%
must have been abandoned.

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:25.640 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, something
is wrong with me.

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.630 align:middle line:90%
Therefore, I am unworthy.

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And then, again,
whether you want

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:35.050 align:middle line:84%
to say that it is beings
that came from other star

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:38.380 align:middle line:84%
systems that also
got lost in fear

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:42.850 align:middle line:84%
and began to manipulate
human beings and one

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:48.280 align:middle line:84%
another through the energy of
fear, fear still a vibration,

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:54.572 align:middle line:84%
it's still very seductive
and manipulative and--

00:25:54.572 --> 00:25:57.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why is
it so seductive?

00:25:57.150 --> 00:25:58.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: Oh, because
it's entertaining.

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we
go to horror movies

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:03.630 align:middle line:84%
to watch horrible
things happen to people

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:05.890 align:middle line:90%
and scream and have nightmares.

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:09.530 align:middle line:84%
Why is fear so
seductive to humans?

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: Because
it is entertaining.

00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And again, when the
ego has pulled away

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:19.460 align:middle line:84%
from its own divinity,
it can feel powerless.

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And the old male, fierce
old male and old female,

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:26.870 align:middle line:84%
say, ego, I know how to make
you feel powerful again.

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:29.090 align:middle line:84%
I know how to give
you what you want.

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:32.010 align:middle line:90%
Work with the power of fear.

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And so then if you have
noticed your world,

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:41.350 align:middle line:84%
your schoolroom Earth has become
more and more masculine, more

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:44.590 align:middle line:84%
and more dominated
by what we call

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:48.310 align:middle line:84%
the old male patriarchal
hierarchy, which

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:50.650 align:middle line:90%
then created religions.

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:52.360 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we have to
give a short story.

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:56.230 align:middle line:84%
We don't have days to talk
with our beautiful Regina.

00:26:56.230 --> 00:27:03.640 align:middle line:84%
So through religion, the
masculine, but the controlling,

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:07.000 align:middle line:84%
judging, persecuting
masculine has

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.410 align:middle line:84%
gained great power
working through fear

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:20.060 align:middle line:84%
that has moved humanity
even deeper into this lie.

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:22.340 align:middle line:90%
It's a terrible lie.

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:27.680 align:middle line:84%
It brings great sadness
to all of divine oneness

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:32.750 align:middle line:84%
that humanity or any
particle of creator's energy

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:35.960 align:middle line:90%
can be abandoned by source.

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:38.340 align:middle line:90%
This simply cannot happen.

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:44.550 align:middle line:84%
So we have here, we have a
very ancient story of illusion.

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:48.030 align:middle line:90%
The illusion is made of fear.

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:54.140 align:middle line:84%
Fear is the power that rules
religions and governments.

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:56.600 align:middle line:90%
And fear, again, is seductive.

00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:00.710 align:middle line:84%
It says, I can tell you how
to get a bigger paycheck.

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:04.370 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you how to
make yourself feel better

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:07.010 align:middle line:90%
about your miserable self.

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:09.740 align:middle line:84%
The answer you're
going to hear us

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:14.420 align:middle line:84%
say again until you roll your
eyes at the 12 archangels,

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:16.490 align:middle line:90%
the answer is love.

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:17.870 align:middle line:90%
Rise above it.

00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:21.320 align:middle line:84%
Recognize that fear
is a trickster.

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:25.580 align:middle line:84%
It may be entertaining, but it
takes money out of your wallet,

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:28.850 align:middle line:84%
years off of your
life, causes you

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:35.480 align:middle line:84%
to suffer as well as the
entire human collective and all

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.930 align:middle line:90%
of Earth.

00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:40.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:43.710 align:middle line:84%
When you work with Belinda
and this new body of work

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:47.130 align:middle line:84%
that she brought through,
which, as she said,

00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:49.590 align:middle line:84%
was very challenging
because it's so precise,

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:55.170 align:middle line:84%
there's so much there, you work
with the frequency of love,

00:28:55.170 --> 00:29:00.150 align:middle line:84%
the colors of love,
the colors of truth,

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:04.440 align:middle line:84%
and we could add many other
virtues and traits to them.

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:09.510 align:middle line:84%
But can you tell us a
little bit of how important

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:13.560 align:middle line:84%
it is for us to recognize
the power of these things

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:16.290 align:middle line:84%
on our planet that have these
pure frequencies that we can

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:20.220 align:middle line:90%
tap into any time like color?

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:23.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: Love is
everywhere if you

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:29.190 align:middle line:84%
need to feel what love feels
like, truly go and hug a tree

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:32.760 align:middle line:90%
or rub your pet's belly.

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:36.510 align:middle line:84%
Any kind of canine
angel's going to fill you

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:40.680 align:middle line:84%
with incredible love, and this
is true for your kitty cats,

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:44.880 align:middle line:84%
birds in the air,
everywhere you can

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:49.110 align:middle line:84%
find God's beautiful
rainbow of colors.

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:54.900 align:middle line:84%
We say that these colors are
raised from the central sun.

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:57.310 align:middle line:90%
And so they are your chakras.

00:29:57.310 --> 00:30:00.750 align:middle line:84%
You have the entire
rainbow and beyond.

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:03.900 align:middle line:84%
You have all of
the colors of love.

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:07.650 align:middle line:84%
But when you work
with the colors,

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:10.020 align:middle line:84%
then magical things
begin to happen.

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:13.740 align:middle line:84%
You engage your
feminine creative brain.

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:16.500 align:middle line:90%
You start to awaken your genius.

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:20.700 align:middle line:84%
You connect with angels
and the magical beings

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:26.850 align:middle line:84%
that are really very real
fairies and gnomes and nature

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:28.520 align:middle line:90%
spirits.

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:36.080 align:middle line:84%
So to help you to get there,
a very foundational color too,

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:39.140 align:middle line:84%
we'd like to share
with you, emerald,

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:41.300 align:middle line:90%
a beautiful bright green.

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:44.420 align:middle line:84%
Walk out in nature
in the springtime.

00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:45.590 align:middle line:90%
Look at the leaves.

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:47.820 align:middle line:90%
Look at the grass.

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Take a deep breath
and say, I want

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:56.370 align:middle line:84%
to feel, I want to
feel heart, I want

00:30:56.370 --> 00:31:02.760 align:middle line:84%
to feel the power of undiluted
love moving through my heart

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:09.150 align:middle line:84%
so that I have a better
understanding of my own power

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:12.060 align:middle line:84%
because you are
a powerful being.

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:14.470 align:middle line:90%
So that is emerald.

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And then our favorite color of
ruby, ruby or any shade of red,

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:24.860 align:middle line:84%
the color of your
blood, human being.

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:29.300 align:middle line:84%
This is the divine mother,
the divine feminine.

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:32.210 align:middle line:90%
The emerald is Mother Earth.

00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:36.890 align:middle line:84%
So we keep trying to encourage
you, come home to the mother.

00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:39.830 align:middle line:84%
Let her receive
abundance for you.

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:43.190 align:middle line:84%
Let her nurture you
and take care of you.

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:49.270 align:middle line:84%
You are all children of Mother
Earth if you are on the Earth.

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And you all have
access to the rays

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:56.500 align:middle line:90%
of the central sun from source.

00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:00.460 align:middle line:90%
Whatever you need, God has it.

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:02.290 align:middle line:90%
Receive it.

00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:07.570 align:middle line:84%
Receive it, and you
change your entire planet

00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:11.960 align:middle line:90%
for all concerned.

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:15.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You also used the
color blue with the Archangel

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Michael and the sword of
truth, and right now our planet

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:24.590 align:middle line:84%
is seeming to have lost its
bearings in terms of truth.

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:27.560 align:middle line:84%
There are algorithms
leading us this way,

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:30.720 align:middle line:84%
leading us that way,
artificial intelligence.

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:34.100 align:middle line:84%
But what we're being led away
from in engaging with that

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:37.340 align:middle line:90%
is our central sense of truth.

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And can you talk about blue
and Archangel Michael's sword

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:44.490 align:middle line:84%
for just a moment and
why this is so effective,

00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:47.390 align:middle line:84%
which is the color of the
throat chakra as well?

00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:51.860 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: Your will, human
beings, is vibrational.

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:56.300 align:middle line:84%
When you take your will, which,
yes, is your throat chakra,

00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:59.330 align:middle line:84%
but you ask for that
will, that energy

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:04.070 align:middle line:84%
to go to the will of your soul,
the highest vibration it can

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:09.370 align:middle line:84%
go, and yes, the color is a
rich cobalt sapphire blue,

00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:13.800 align:middle line:84%
so you can be in
this color, Belinda

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:17.130 align:middle line:84%
will tell you that you just
asked for Archangel Michael

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:22.620 align:middle line:84%
to put that laser light
singing sword down your spine.

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And you can't lie
to yourself anymore.

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:32.010 align:middle line:84%
How fabulous is this when you
can no longer lie to yourself

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:34.260 align:middle line:90%
and buy into fear?

00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:36.480 align:middle line:84%
The vibration of
your will goes up

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:39.930 align:middle line:84%
so that you know the
choice of your heart,

00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:43.170 align:middle line:84%
you know what makes you
happy, you know the work

00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:45.150 align:middle line:84%
that you want to
do, you know where

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:49.440 align:middle line:84%
you want to put your energy,
you know who you want to love.

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:53.910 align:middle line:84%
It helps you tremendously
to know your truth.

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:59.650 align:middle line:84%
And not only this, when you
have Archangel Michael's sword

00:33:59.650 --> 00:34:03.190 align:middle line:84%
down your spine,
that singing light

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:06.950 align:middle line:84%
of highest
vibrational truth, you

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:14.540 align:middle line:84%
say, oh, I can ask the angels
to put these swords everywhere

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:18.320 align:middle line:84%
and anywhere on
schoolroom Earth.

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:21.590 align:middle line:84%
And yes, you can, you
can put these swords

00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:25.880 align:middle line:84%
in the leaders' mouths
that run your planet

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:27.510 align:middle line:90%
from your perspective.

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:33.830 align:middle line:84%
We tell you that, truly, there
are other completely loving

00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:35.960 align:middle line:90%
leaders in charge.

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:42.409 align:middle line:84%
But from your perspective, you
believe these very powerful,

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:47.929 align:middle line:84%
terrifying sometimes
leaders have all the power.

00:34:47.929 --> 00:34:52.130 align:middle line:84%
Ask us to drop Archangel
Michael's sword's truth

00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:54.530 align:middle line:90%
down their spines.

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:56.060 align:middle line:90%
It is invited.

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:57.590 align:middle line:90%
It is welcomed.

00:34:57.590 --> 00:34:59.210 align:middle line:90%
It is allowable.

00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:01.630 align:middle line:90%
Why, you might ask?

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:04.690 align:middle line:84%
Because you are working
with undiluted love.

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And when you hold the
intention to work with love,

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:13.140 align:middle line:84%
then you begin to
understand your power,

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:20.180 align:middle line:84%
then you begin to understand
that all human beings are

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:22.190 align:middle line:90%
faces of the creator.

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:26.260 align:middle line:84%
Some have fallen
down in vibration,

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:32.140 align:middle line:84%
lift up their will through
their own soul because, see,

00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:35.950 align:middle line:84%
your ego does not drop
the sword in their spine

00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:40.300 align:middle line:84%
or put it in their mouth so
they begin to tell the truth.

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:43.660 align:middle line:90%
Their own soul must do this.

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And all souls belong to creator,
belong to the great universe.

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:53.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even if they tell
only themselves the truth,

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:57.130 align:middle line:84%
it's a start, even if the truth
doesn't make it past the lips

00:35:57.130 --> 00:35:59.380 align:middle line:84%
to the public for a
variety of reasons.

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:02.410 align:middle line:84%
I like that, as long as
we hold that in love,

00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:05.260 align:middle line:84%
then at least there's
the impetus for them,

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:07.450 align:middle line:84%
for the beings that
are lying to us

00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:09.700 align:middle line:84%
or lying to themselves to
at least tell themselves

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.680 align:middle line:84%
the truth, and
that's the beginning.

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: And yes,
Regina, human beings

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:17.650 align:middle line:84%
lie all the time,
not all human beings,

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:20.230 align:middle line:84%
but they do this
because of fear.

00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:25.630 align:middle line:84%
They do this because they are
afraid of being judged or being

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:27.790 align:middle line:90%
punished or being persecuted.

00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:31.030 align:middle line:84%
So don't give your
energy to that.

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:36.010 align:middle line:84%
For anyone who has the
courage to hear our words,

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:37.870 align:middle line:90%
know the truth.

00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:41.140 align:middle line:84%
When you walk with
Archangel Michael's sword

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:47.110 align:middle line:84%
in your spinal cord, when you
have your own throat chakra,

00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:49.750 align:middle line:90%
you are in the blue.

00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:53.070 align:middle line:84%
Then you will know
the truth from a lie.

00:36:53.070 --> 00:37:00.140 align:middle line:84%
You will know and then you
become a vibrational carrier,

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:04.290 align:middle line:84%
not of a virus,
but of the truth.

00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:08.430 align:middle line:84%
You carry the truth in
your energy field, and so

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:12.720 align:middle line:84%
all the people that you are
around, they begin to wake up.

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:17.280 align:middle line:84%
You may not know this,
but they begin to wake up

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:23.610 align:middle line:84%
and then they start to ask
questions, is this real?

00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:25.770 align:middle line:90%
Is this truth?

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:27.840 align:middle line:90%
Am I being deceived?

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:29.730 align:middle line:90%
Am I being lied to?

00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:32.580 align:middle line:90%
What is the whole story here?

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And then they start to
listen, even if they do not

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:39.180 align:middle line:84%
know they are doing
this, they begin

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:41.580 align:middle line:90%
to listen to their intuition.

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:45.930 align:middle line:84%
They begin to have that
feeling in their gut.

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:54.130 align:middle line:84%
So do not be alarmed with
the lies of the media.

00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:56.970 align:middle line:90%
These lies come from fear.

00:37:56.970 --> 00:38:02.070 align:middle line:84%
Choose truth, walk in
it, live it, be it,

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:04.020 align:middle line:90%
and change your world.

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:07.050 align:middle line:84%
We must give Belinda
a little break.

00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, we were
just going to do that.

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:10.800 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:17.340 align:middle line:90%


00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: Holy cow,
they're big today.

00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, they were
happy to be able to speak

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:25.330 align:middle line:90%
to us about these things.

00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:27.040 align:middle line:90%
I mean, again, you have to--

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:29.890 align:middle line:84%
this book is chock
full of meditations.

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:33.580 align:middle line:84%
All of them are based
on vibration and color

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:35.590 align:middle line:84%
and engaging the
mind and the will

00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:39.700 align:middle line:84%
and the imagination into
experiencing these colors

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:42.310 align:middle line:84%
and the imagery that comes
with them because that's

00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:44.660 align:middle line:90%
pure high frequency.

00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:47.050 align:middle line:84%
It's just pure high
frequency, that's why so hard

00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:50.715 align:middle line:84%
to stay seated upright
when you're reading them.

00:38:50.715 --> 00:38:52.090 align:middle line:84%
Belinda, do you
think it would be

00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:56.410 align:middle line:84%
appropriate to read the purple
door, the short meditation

00:38:56.410 --> 00:38:58.690 align:middle line:84%
the purple door to give
people, our audience

00:38:58.690 --> 00:38:59.990 align:middle line:90%
just a feeling of it?

00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:01.010 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: Sure.

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:02.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is it OK?

00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:04.250 align:middle line:84%
OK, Belinda, so we're
going to go for it.

00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And what I'd like to
ask is that everybody

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:08.020 align:middle line:84%
that's watching
this right now, go

00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:09.430 align:middle line:90%
into a nice, comfortable place.

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:11.590 align:middle line:84%
Sit down somewhere
comfortable, even lie down.

00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:14.170 align:middle line:84%
You don't really have to
be present to watch this.

00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to go ahead and
read the meditation so Belinda

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:20.230 align:middle line:84%
doesn't start crying
all over our sheet

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:25.030 align:middle line:84%
here as she is one to do with
these beautiful experiences.

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:27.160 align:middle line:84%
So just close your
eyes and relax

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:28.900 align:middle line:84%
and we'll begin and
read this-- and I'll

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:30.790 align:middle line:84%
read this short
little meditation here

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:33.700 align:middle line:84%
for you to go into
an experience, OK?

00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:38.710 align:middle line:84%
All right, so close your
eyes and breathe in deeply

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:41.290 align:middle line:90%
and exhale completely.

00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Focus your mind entirely on
breathing in and breathing out.

00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:50.035 align:middle line:84%
Repeat until you feel calm
and your mind is empty.

00:39:50.035 --> 00:39:52.540 align:middle line:90%


00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:56.710 align:middle line:84%
Say, thank you divine
inner child of my heart

00:39:56.710 --> 00:40:00.130 align:middle line:84%
and divine mother of
the great universe

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:02.410 align:middle line:84%
for painting a
purple door for me

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:06.760 align:middle line:84%
with the singing colors
of the central sun.

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:10.060 align:middle line:84%
See yourself walk up
to a tall, purple door

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:12.460 align:middle line:90%
with a high arc at the top.

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:16.660 align:middle line:84%
Look at the door and place
your non-dominant hand,

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:20.110 align:middle line:84%
the hand that you do not
normally use for writing,

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:24.630 align:middle line:84%
on the sparkling,
rainbow, crystal doorknob.

00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Feel the coolness
of the doorknob.

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:33.460 align:middle line:84%
Take a deep breath and feel the
joyful energy of undiluted love

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:35.905 align:middle line:90%
flow into the palm of your hand.

00:40:35.905 --> 00:40:38.410 align:middle line:90%


00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:41.830 align:middle line:84%
Open the door and
step into a brightly

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:47.340 align:middle line:84%
lit emerald field with a
clear, turquoise sky above.

00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:49.980 align:middle line:84%
Call out to your
divine inner child.

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:52.320 align:middle line:84%
Ask the child to
lie down next to you

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:58.110 align:middle line:84%
on the emerald grass that
feels as lush as velvet.

00:40:58.110 --> 00:41:00.330 align:middle line:84%
The ground of
Mother Gaia's heart

00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:03.720 align:middle line:84%
united with the
heart of creator is

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:07.170 align:middle line:90%
incredibly soft and comforting.

00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:10.650 align:middle line:84%
Reach out and hold the hand
of your divine inner child

00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:15.645 align:middle line:84%
and say, show me the
abundant joy that you know.

00:41:15.645 --> 00:41:19.290 align:middle line:84%
Teach me how to forgive
the past and bring

00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:21.660 align:middle line:84%
into reality, the
happy childhood

00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:25.020 align:middle line:90%
that you want me to experience.

00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:26.940 align:middle line:90%
I thank you.

00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:33.980 align:middle line:84%
I acknowledge that you're real
and I humbly ask for your help.

00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Feel the golden rays
of the central sun

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:43.650 align:middle line:84%
fill every cell of your humanity
with happiness and love.

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:49.420 align:middle line:84%
Life can only get
better from here on out.

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And with that happy thought, go
ahead and bring yourself back.

00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:54.150 align:middle line:84%
And if you want
to open your eyes

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:58.170 align:middle line:84%
and watch the very end of this
interview, feel free to do so.

00:41:58.170 --> 00:42:01.530 align:middle line:84%
Belinda, this was the
opening meditation

00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:05.220 align:middle line:84%
just to give people an
invitation into this world,

00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:06.510 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:06.810 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: Yes.

00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:08.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
it was designed for?

00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.950 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: Yes.

00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But every one takes
you deeper and deeper into very

00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:17.430 align:middle line:84%
specific emotions, whether
it's grief, whether it's greed,

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:18.750 align:middle line:90%
whatever--

00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:20.940 align:middle line:84%
how many meditations
are in there?

00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:21.810 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: 63.

00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:23.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, 63 meditations.

00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:25.410 align:middle line:84%
That's why I was knocked
out most of the time,

00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:26.460 align:middle line:90%
reading the book.

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And they're very specific with
very specific language and very

00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:35.370 align:middle line:84%
specific frequencies and colors
and imagery to transform those

00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:37.260 align:middle line:90%
into light and love.

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:38.927 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: And they
work just by reading.

00:42:38.927 --> 00:42:39.727 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They do.

00:42:39.727 --> 00:42:41.970 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: So for those
people who have trouble

00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:45.810 align:middle line:84%
with visualization, the language
of the words as you just

00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:48.300 align:middle line:90%
read it, the healing happens.

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And they send the healing all
the way to the atoms and DNA

00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:54.870 align:middle line:90%
particles.

00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:55.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:42:55.920 --> 00:43:01.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, Belinda, I'm glad that
you took the time to do this,

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:04.080 align:middle line:84%
because I know I talk
to you periodically

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:06.570 align:middle line:84%
and I know it really did
take quite a chunk out

00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:09.270 align:middle line:84%
of you to get this all done
because of the precision of it.

00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:10.480 align:middle line:90%
But I thank you for that.

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:13.980 align:middle line:84%
But I also want to say in the
meantime, your original book,

00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:17.190 align:middle line:84%
Lessons From The
12 Archangels also

00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:20.010 align:middle line:84%
are filled with these beautiful
meditations and colors

00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:21.840 align:middle line:90%
and very, very uplifting.

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:24.540 align:middle line:84%
So we can turn to those
as well to utilize.

00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:27.810 align:middle line:84%
But to wrap up our
conversation, right now

00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:30.510 align:middle line:84%
in these times, what are
some of the big themes that

00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:33.360 align:middle line:84%
are coming from your clients
and from the Archangels

00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:34.380 align:middle line:90%
back to them?

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:37.710 align:middle line:84%
Because we've just come out of
this pandemic period of great

00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:39.800 align:middle line:90%
fear.

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:42.980 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: The angels are
teaching through the courses

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:48.100 align:middle line:84%
that I channel,
how to receive, how

00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:50.260 align:middle line:84%
to work with the
energy of receiving.

00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And they say that
being creative really,

00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:59.110 align:middle line:84%
really helps us to receive
from source because we've

00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:02.740 align:middle line:84%
lived in lack and there's
so much abundance,

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:04.870 align:middle line:84%
there's so much
wealth to be had.

00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And the angels define
wealth as happiness.

00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:11.380 align:middle line:84%
They say it's far more than
just having plenty of money.

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:12.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely, yes.

00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:16.880 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: So they
very much want us

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:24.380 align:middle line:84%
to receive the message,
to awaken that feminine,

00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:28.280 align:middle line:84%
let the divine mother
love us and fill us

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:32.990 align:middle line:84%
with her acceptance
and her safety.

00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:35.570 align:middle line:90%
It's time for us to feel safe.

00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:38.030 align:middle line:84%
If we're safe, we
can be creative.

00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And so the first
thing we receive

00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:44.030 align:middle line:84%
is her emotional security
and her physical safety.

00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:46.808 align:middle line:84%
And then she sends us abundance
in whatever way we need it.

00:44:46.808 --> 00:44:48.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In whatever
way we need it.

00:44:48.350 --> 00:44:50.280 align:middle line:90%
Abundance can mean 1,000 things.

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:51.470 align:middle line:90%
It's not just about money.

00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:54.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people still have to
break this old belief system

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:56.780 align:middle line:84%
that it's all about
money and stuff.

00:44:56.780 --> 00:45:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And B, that you have to really
work hard and grind it out

00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:01.640 align:middle line:90%
to get stuff.

00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:04.640 align:middle line:84%
These are two old male
female belief systems

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:06.910 align:middle line:90%
that must be tossed out.

00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And let me ask you this
if they've given you

00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:11.920 align:middle line:84%
glimpses of the future,
what does abundance look

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:15.110 align:middle line:90%
like to humanity in the future?

00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:18.265 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: They ask, do you mean
to the entire schoolroom Earth?

00:45:18.265 --> 00:45:19.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm, to Earth.

00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:21.920 align:middle line:84%
What's that look like to
us humans in the future?

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:26.970 align:middle line:84%
How will it be manifesting
that they can share with us?

00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:36.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: They say for humans
to calm down, slow down, have

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:42.280 align:middle line:84%
far more enjoyable moments
than terrifying moments,

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:47.870 align:middle line:84%
love of nature, a
higher love of self

00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:54.110 align:middle line:84%
and better self care, greater
respect for one another,

00:45:54.110 --> 00:45:57.837 align:middle line:90%
and that war will be obsolete.

00:45:57.837 --> 00:45:58.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:00.350 align:middle line:90%
That's true abundance.

00:46:00.350 --> 00:46:02.900 align:middle line:90%
Don't need to have a third car.

00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:06.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: Well, they say
that our tastes will change.

00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:09.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, our
needs will change.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: Yes, and our
instant gratification

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:16.630 align:middle line:84%
of what we feel we have
to have will change.

00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:22.260 align:middle line:84%
There will still be plenty of
materialism that brings joy

00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:29.370 align:middle line:84%
and that brings real happiness,
but from the child within us--

00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:31.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's not the end game.

00:46:31.650 --> 00:46:36.710 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: --it's not the end
game and it will last longer.

00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:40.010 align:middle line:84%
Our satisfaction
will last much longer

00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:45.440 align:middle line:84%
with what we do let ourselves
enjoy and experience

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:48.132 align:middle line:90%
on this material plain.

00:46:48.132 --> 00:46:49.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you for that.

00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Any final thoughts before we
say goodbye for this time?

00:46:53.730 --> 00:46:56.610 align:middle line:10%
>>WOMACK: We say to
you, human beings,

00:46:56.610 --> 00:47:03.140 align:middle line:10%
be brave and courageous,
receiving the love that

00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:08.300 align:middle line:10%
is energy that will manifest
as all you need and all you

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:09.690 align:middle line:10%
desire.

00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:11.900 align:middle line:90%
We thank you for this.

00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:16.910 align:middle line:84%
We thank you for being
a world transformer.

00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:18.590 align:middle line:90%
We thank you.

00:47:18.590 --> 00:47:20.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And thank you.

00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:22.160 align:middle line:10%
Thank the archangels

00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:24.830 align:middle line:10%
