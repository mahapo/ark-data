>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Back by popular demand,

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.290 align:middle line:10%
Sheila Gillette and the
Theo Group-- in the past,

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.530 align:middle line:10%
we've spoken with the Theo
Group about everything

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.900 align:middle line:10%
from earthly
challenges of humanity

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.450 align:middle line:10%
to the unanswered mysteries.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And today, we'll be speaking
about a subject that's

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.090 align:middle line:84%
equally intriguing--
parallel lives.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.576 align:middle line:90%
So without ado, here's Sheila.

00:00:44.576 --> 00:00:45.825 align:middle line:90%
It's so good to see you again.

00:00:45.825 --> 00:00:46.320 align:middle line:90%


00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEILA GILLETTE: Great to
be with you again, Regina.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.370 align:middle line:90%
It's always so fun.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, we
haven't-- it's been what,

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.400 align:middle line:84%
close to a year since
we've done this or so.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Yeah, a
little over, I think.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.440 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: A little over
a year-- and last time,

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.960 align:middle line:10%
we had a little studio audience.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.430 align:middle line:10%
And people were asking about
the things that concerned them

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.210 align:middle line:10%
or that they wanted
to know about.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.232 align:middle line:84%
And since that time,
tell us a little bit

00:01:04.232 --> 00:01:05.690 align:middle line:84%
about what's happened
in your world

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.523 align:middle line:84%
with the Theo Group and
the work that you're

00:01:07.523 --> 00:01:10.386 align:middle line:84%
doing before we have go kind of
out of the way, unconscious--

00:01:10.386 --> 00:01:11.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Oh.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --while we
still have you here.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Well, it's been
a phenomenal year, Regina.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.070 align:middle line:84%
We've launched many new programs
and many, many new teachings

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.280 align:middle line:84%
with Theo that have
just been life changing.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.030 align:middle line:84%
People's lives
have been changed.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's just so
gratifying to see

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.070 align:middle line:90%
what's happening in the world.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.370 align:middle line:90%
People are opening up.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.690 align:middle line:84%
We've launched Thrive
programs, which

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.200 align:middle line:90%
are soul integrative programs.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.980 align:middle line:84%
Theo's teaching on how to get
through those limiting beliefs.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.825 align:middle line:84%
And then we started
something new,

00:01:41.825 --> 00:01:44.590 align:middle line:84%
a psychic and
spiritual exploration

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.950 align:middle line:84%
program that allows
people to get

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.890 align:middle line:84%
in touch with their
own psychic ability,

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.520 align:middle line:84%
their own abilities, their own
connectivity to their angels

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.530 align:middle line:90%
and spirit guides.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.410 align:middle line:90%
And that's been so much fun.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.900 align:middle line:84%
People are really engaged
and finding out they're

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.240 align:middle line:90%
more than they think they are.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And you know, for people
that maybe are seeing you

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.800 align:middle line:84%
on this show for the
first time or who

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.330 align:middle line:84%
for some reason aren't
aware of your work,

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.882 align:middle line:84%
the Theo Group's
always been really

00:02:11.882 --> 00:02:13.590 align:middle line:84%
big on letting people
know that they need

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.930 align:middle line:84%
to access their own sources,
and their own guides,

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.600 align:middle line:90%
even their own true self.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And one of the people very long
ago was Esther Hicks, right?

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: That's true, yeah.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.268 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She was a devotee
of the Theo Group's work.

00:02:25.268 --> 00:02:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And they told her, well, you
can do this too, you know?

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.794 align:middle line:84%
And she was doggedly
determined to do it.

00:02:30.794 --> 00:02:31.710 align:middle line:90%
And she broke through.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.084 align:middle line:84%
And then she found
her connection

00:02:33.084 --> 00:02:34.910 align:middle line:84%
with her group,
the Abraham Group.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:35.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that's one person
we bring up because others

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.920 align:middle line:90%
may know about her.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.022 align:middle line:84%
But so many other people
have broken through--

00:02:42.022 --> 00:02:42.980 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Many, many.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.813 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --to their
own guides as a result.

00:02:44.813 --> 00:02:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And is this becoming a
more prominent theme,

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.080 align:middle line:84%
would you say, from the Theo
Group, the need for humanity

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.750 align:middle line:90%
to really start connecting?

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes, it is.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.840 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know, it's
just not that I can do this

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.930 align:middle line:84%
or that Esther can
connect with Abraham.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:03.895 align:middle line:90%
We all can.

00:03:03.895 --> 00:03:08.190 align:middle line:84%
We all have guidance that's
ever present around us.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.430 align:middle line:90%
All we have to do is ask.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And so many times, our limiting
beliefs that we're not worthy

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.570 align:middle line:84%
are part of why people
don't believe in themselves.

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And the Law of
Attraction-- Theo told us

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.370 align:middle line:84%
the reason the Law of
Attraction doesn't work,

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.900 align:middle line:84%
the Law of Manifestation, is
that you don't believe it.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:29.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's true.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.680 align:middle line:90%
That is true.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So it's
a way of getting

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.810 align:middle line:84%
in touch with that
belief, releasing

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.920 align:middle line:84%
those restrictive
beliefs, and realizing

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.300 align:middle line:84%
that that which breathes you,
that which is inside you,

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.090 align:middle line:84%
is so much bigger than
you can even imagine.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And your connectivity to your
source and your higher self

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.990 align:middle line:90%
is right there.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And
you can utilize it.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the thing is,
people say, oh no, I really,

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.890 align:middle line:90%
really believe it.

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.386 align:middle line:84%
I really want to be a
professional ice skater,

00:04:00.386 --> 00:04:02.740 align:middle line:84%
you know, without owning
a pair of ice skates

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.140 align:middle line:90%
and knowing how to skate, right?

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.860 align:middle line:84%
But that the thing is--
that's a dramatic example.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.750 align:middle line:84%
But there is-- usually it's
a subconscious mechanism that

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.300 align:middle line:84%
is blocking people
from embracing

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.010 align:middle line:90%
what they say they truly want.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.410 align:middle line:84%
You can do vision
boards all day.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.785 align:middle line:84%
But if you have
a program running

00:04:17.785 --> 00:04:20.159 align:middle line:84%
saying, you can't do
it, you can't do it,

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:21.200 align:middle line:90%
it's not going to happen.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Well, it's the
thing you think most about.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.100 align:middle line:84%
You can put out the thought,
think all the good thoughts,

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.740 align:middle line:84%
but then what are the
thoughts that come after that?

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Those are the limitations,
those not-enoughnesses Oh, it's

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.560 align:middle line:90%
for somebody else.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And affirmations
are just wishes.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.376 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: You know, and you
can say as many as you want.

00:04:42.376 --> 00:04:45.280 align:middle line:84%
But then there has to
be some action steps.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And those action
steps are really

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.120 align:middle line:84%
looking into those
limiting beliefs.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.490 align:middle line:84%
Who inside of you
has that belief?

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.240 align:middle line:90%
What age?

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.770 align:middle line:84%
What was the situation
and circumstance

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.995 align:middle line:84%
that you adopted a belief about
yourself that just isn't true?

00:05:01.995 --> 00:05:03.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
they'll even go so far as

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.980 align:middle line:84%
to say, as I would as well, that
these may be carried forward

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.606 align:middle line:84%
from other times,
other lifetimes even.

00:05:08.606 --> 00:05:09.405 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:05:09.405 --> 00:05:10.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we
have no awareness

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.730 align:middle line:84%
that there is a deeply held
belief blocking us on any given

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:15.900 align:middle line:90%
number of subjects.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And that's what this
soul integrational process is

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.230 align:middle line:84%
about that Theo
has brought forth--

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.850 align:middle line:84%
and that we do a lot of
teaching in our Thrive classes

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.130 align:middle line:84%
and our Accelerator
classes of really getting

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.330 align:middle line:84%
in touch with those, as Theo
says, fragmented aspects

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.610 align:middle line:84%
of our soul that hold those
beliefs, where they came from,

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.119 align:middle line:84%
and how to change and release
them, rewriting the script.

00:05:38.119 --> 00:05:39.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Mhm,
rewriting the script--

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.180 align:middle line:84%
we're going to get into some
of that in this discussion with

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.222 align:middle line:90%
Theo a little later too--

00:05:43.222 --> 00:05:44.021 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Great.

00:05:44.021 --> 00:05:45.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --about
timelines and things.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.930 align:middle line:84%
Do you notice-- since I haven't
seen you for a year plus--

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.630 align:middle line:84%
have you noticed that there are
certain themes of questioning

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.566 align:middle line:84%
that come up, you know,
as the years go on where

00:05:58.566 --> 00:05:59.940 align:middle line:84%
certain types of
questions become

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.700 align:middle line:84%
more prominent at a
given time than others?

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.050 align:middle line:84%
And if so, what
would you say might

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.640 align:middle line:84%
be really kind of
prominent theme

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.730 align:middle line:84%
you're hearing over
and over from people?

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:11.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: The theme we're
talking about-- people

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.110 align:middle line:90%
want their lives to change.

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.630 align:middle line:84%
They're tired with
the status quo.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And they're willing to
take the steps to do it.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.480 align:middle line:84%
Those are the people
I'm hearing from.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: When they
get in touch with Theo,

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.720 align:middle line:90%
it's a university program.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It's not an
elementary program at all.

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.420 align:middle line:84%
There has to be a
commitment to really want

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.610 align:middle line:84%
to make the changes, or
things stay the same.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.290 align:middle line:84%
That desire and dream that
the person, the ice skater,

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.840 align:middle line:90%
may want, it can happen.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.257 align:middle line:84%
But there has to be a decision
made for it, not just a wish.

00:06:47.257 --> 00:06:48.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That reminds
me of something

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.320 align:middle line:84%
else I'm going to
ask them about.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.315 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for sharing.

00:06:51.315 --> 00:06:51.740 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:52.390 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: You're welcome.

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:54.264 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have a list
of questions already,

00:06:54.264 --> 00:06:57.120 align:middle line:84%
but I'm adding to
it by the minute.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.140 align:middle line:84%
So let's see-- so
right now, just

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.349 align:middle line:84%
give us an idea, because
you're a little-- you're OK,

00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:03.681 align:middle line:84%
but you're a little groggy
when you come back afterward.

00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:05.765 align:middle line:84%
So best to get everything,
all our business taken

00:07:05.765 --> 00:07:06.565 align:middle line:90%
care of up front.

00:07:06.565 --> 00:07:07.365 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: OK.

00:07:07.365 --> 00:07:10.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So again, the
levels of classes and courses

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.180 align:middle line:84%
that you slash Theo are
teaching right now are what?

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We have
the Thrive class,

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.810 align:middle line:84%
which is the introductory,
foundational class of the soul

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.080 align:middle line:90%
integrational process.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.750 align:middle line:84%
Then we have the
accelerator class

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.740 align:middle line:84%
that's starting in January
that's a six months course.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:32.150 align:middle line:84%
It's two live events
bookending and the six month

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.260 align:middle line:90%
online course.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's very much a deep dive
into that soul integration,

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:41.930 align:middle line:84%
the changing of limiting
beliefs, and envisioning

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.360 align:middle line:84%
how you want your life to
live, and making it happen.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And we have another course
called Psychic and Spiritual

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.920 align:middle line:84%
Exploration, which
is getting in touch

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.020 align:middle line:90%
with your own intuitive gifts.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:54.390 align:middle line:90%
And what are they?

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:59.120 align:middle line:84%
We describe and explain all the
different ways of receiving--

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.850 align:middle line:90%
clairaudience, clairvoyance--

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:02.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --clairsentience,
all of those ways

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.570 align:middle line:84%
that we receive
intuitive information.

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:10.020 align:middle line:90%
We explore those.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.280 align:middle line:90%
We talk about them.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.790 align:middle line:90%
And then we experiment.

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:14.150 align:middle line:90%
And it is so much fun.

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:15.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is really neat.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.850 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people
who haven't necessarily

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:21.460 align:middle line:84%
consciously touched in
with their intuitive side

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:25.780 align:middle line:84%
have an idea that, oh,
well, so-and-so channels,

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:30.170 align:middle line:84%
or so-and-so sees pictures,
so-and-so is dictated through.

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:33.200 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, it can be
a combination of the above.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.652 align:middle line:84%
And everyone is so
unique in how it happens.

00:08:35.652 --> 00:08:36.610 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Well, yeah.

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then
there's just knowing.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:40.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Well, and
it comes in a way,

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:43.950 align:middle line:84%
firstly, in a way that you're
psychologically and emotionally

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:46.090 align:middle line:90%
comfortable with.

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:49.570 align:middle line:84%
Because if it doesn't,
you'll shut off completely.

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.300 align:middle line:90%
You become frightened.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:55.750 align:middle line:84%
So it can be sensory perception
where your body speaks to you.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.810 align:middle line:84%
You get a feeling,
gut level feeling.

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And then it could be
you get a message.

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:03.490 align:middle line:90%
You hear something.

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:08.910 align:middle line:84%
Or visionary people get messages
and pictures and dreams.

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And then it can blend into a
combination of those things,

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:13.170 align:middle line:90%
as you said--

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:13.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:15.255 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --as
we're more comfortable

00:09:15.255 --> 00:09:16.520 align:middle line:90%
with our receptivity.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:22.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking back to a time, oh,
maybe 25 years, 30 years ago,

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.000 align:middle line:84%
just about 30 years ago when
I was playing with all of this

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.330 align:middle line:84%
and trying to get my wings
going so it was reliable,

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:29.840 align:middle line:90%
I could reliably connect.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And I had a couple years before
read Ruth Montgomery's book,

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:34.180 align:middle line:90%
A World Beyond.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:34.980 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it
wasn't surprising

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.620 align:middle line:84%
then when a day came
where I got the nudge

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.230 align:middle line:90%
to do automatic writing, right?

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:middle line:90%
Because I knew about it.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:45.305 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know about
much else at that time,

00:09:45.305 --> 00:09:48.390 align:middle line:84%
you know, other than
straight up psychic work.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, that
was an entry point.

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:52.920 align:middle line:84%
But it only lasted
actually a very short time.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And then it moved on to other
forms of receiving information.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.550 align:middle line:84%
So there's an
introductory period.

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:00.350 align:middle line:84%
Like you say, I was
psychologically primed

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:01.255 align:middle line:90%
for that, right?

00:10:01.255 --> 00:10:02.055 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Mhm.

00:10:02.055 --> 00:10:04.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, and that was
my lineage as well.

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:09.000 align:middle line:84%
I started with
automatic writing.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.950 align:middle line:90%
And it came through.

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And then I tranced
spontaneously and became

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:15.770 align:middle line:90%
a direct voice, medium--

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:16.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:18.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --and a
direct voice channel.

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And at the time this
all happened to me,

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.910 align:middle line:84%
the word channel
wasn't even connected--

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:23.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:24.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: --to this work--

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:24.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:27.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --as I'm sure it
was when you were starting out.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I didn't know in
those days what channeling was.

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:31.254 align:middle line:84%
I found out a few years
later, but not at the time.

00:10:31.254 --> 00:10:32.240 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yeah.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.177 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, so
here we are now.

00:10:34.177 --> 00:10:35.260 align:middle line:90%
And see there's one thing.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it's
a little bone I

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:39.950 align:middle line:84%
have to pick with it is that
we're now channeling has now

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:40.830 align:middle line:90%
been overused.

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:41.871 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Very much so.

00:10:41.871 --> 00:10:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And many
people who are basically

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.900 align:middle line:84%
getting intuitive guidance
from their higher self

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.950 align:middle line:84%
or maybe even their
guides call it channeling.

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:51.920 align:middle line:84%
But channeling is
something different.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.253 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Very different, mhm.

00:10:53.253 --> 00:10:56.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not like
doing an intuitive reading.

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you can explain the
difference between the two

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.405 align:middle line:84%
for anyone who
doesn't understand.

00:11:02.405 --> 00:11:04.280 align:middle line:10%
>>GILLETTE: An intuitive
reading is something

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:07.270 align:middle line:10%
that you feel, see, and know.

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:09.940 align:middle line:10%
Channeling is a different form.

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:11.730 align:middle line:90%
It's like I do.

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:15.040 align:middle line:84%
I was described as a
direct voice medium.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And
what that means is

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:22.100 align:middle line:84%
I allow, Theo, the
group Theo, the angels,

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:27.770 align:middle line:84%
to use my body to speak through
and to give the messages.

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:29.156 align:middle line:90%
And that's rare.

00:11:29.156 --> 00:11:30.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Mhm,
that is more rare.

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:32.130 align:middle line:90%
And I appreciate that.

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:36.310 align:middle line:84%
Because I've had the benefit of
knowing another clairchannel.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:38.820 align:middle line:84%
Not too long after I started
doing my auto-writing and all

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:42.300 align:middle line:84%
that, I met another woman whom
you know about named Linda

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.710 align:middle line:84%
and had the advantage of
that kind of information

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:46.120 align:middle line:90%
for decades.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time-- I think
you started even prior to her--

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.750 align:middle line:84%
she didn't even know
what channeling was.

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:54.070 align:middle line:84%
It didn't have a name
when she started doing it.

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:58.350 align:middle line:84%
But she ended up allowing her
body and her voice to be used.

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:00.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: I
didn't know either.

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:00.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:03.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And all of this
started happening to me

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:04.820 align:middle line:90%
in 1969--

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:05.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:06.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: --and '70.

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And so I had the angelic
guidance confirming.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:15.970 align:middle line:84%
And then they directed
some scientists to me.

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:17.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
they came, but I was

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:20.400 align:middle line:90%
toasted for my psychic ability.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.170 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't have
anybody to rely

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:26.330 align:middle line:84%
on other than somebody who told
me to read an Edgar Cayce book.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:29.755 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And then I went, oh,
that's what's happening to me.

00:12:29.755 --> 00:12:32.360 align:middle line:84%
Because what happened
to him happened to me

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.470 align:middle line:90%
with the voice coming through.

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:38.780 align:middle line:84%
So I was led to these things
by the guidance I was given.

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:41.780 align:middle line:84%
So hence, what
happened to me early on

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:46.010 align:middle line:84%
is I realized that I
wanted to be someone

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:47.960 align:middle line:84%
who would be there
for people opening up,

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.450 align:middle line:90%
because I didn't have anybody.

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:50.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:52.650 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And so that's
why we started the programs

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:54.890 align:middle line:90%
that we have, to be in support.

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
was with Esther,

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.675 align:middle line:90%
giving her support to open.

00:12:58.675 --> 00:12:59.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Because
it's extraordinary.

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:04.830 align:middle line:84%
But we're making the
extraordinary the ordinary

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:05.630 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:07.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The time is for
this to become ordinary.

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:10.034 align:middle line:84%
It's to become a normal
part of our lives.

00:13:10.034 --> 00:13:11.075 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Very much so.

00:13:11.075 --> 00:13:13.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And OK,
well, with that,

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.080 align:middle line:84%
why don't we go ahead and
talk with the Theo Group

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.630 align:middle line:90%
about some juicy topics today?

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:18.430 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: OK.

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:20.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so we'll
see you afterward

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:22.430 align:middle line:84%
and chat for a few minutes
after you're done, OK?

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:22.905 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: That would be great.

00:13:22.905 --> 00:13:24.642 align:middle line:84%
And I always love
your questions.

00:13:24.642 --> 00:13:25.442 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:25.442 --> 00:13:26.810 align:middle line:90%
So this will be fun.

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:42.540 align:middle line:90%


00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:44.850 align:middle line:90%
It is the beginning, is it not?

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:46.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes it is.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.330 align:middle line:90%
Hello, Theo.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We are
appreciative of the opportunity

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.170 align:middle line:90%
to be of service to you.

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:52.910 align:middle line:90%
You may ask?

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:54.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
Theo, this time I

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:58.560 align:middle line:84%
thought we would go into the
area of kind of non-linear time

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:02.690 align:middle line:84%
and the way in which
humans incarnate.

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:06.100 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of information
and misunderstood information

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:10.030 align:middle line:84%
on this planet as
to what a soul is

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:14.440 align:middle line:84%
capable of doing from
incarnation to incarnation

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.210 align:middle line:90%
and throughout timelines.

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:18.990 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to start
this line of questioning

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:20.285 align:middle line:90%
if you're OK with this.

00:14:20.285 --> 00:14:22.060 align:middle line:90%
Is this OK, this line?

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It is of
acceptance, your asking.

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:24.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:30.140 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to start with the
notion of parallel lives

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:34.580 align:middle line:84%
and whether or not a
soul has the capability

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:39.310 align:middle line:84%
to incarnate in more
than one body or vehicle

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:41.570 align:middle line:90%
at a given time.

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:43.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Parallel
lives-- there

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:47.530 align:middle line:84%
are such in multi-dimensional
experiences,

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:50.060 align:middle line:90%
for there is no time.

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:53.330 align:middle line:90%
A soul is vast.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:56.830 align:middle line:84%
One cannot perceive
how large the soul is.

00:14:56.830 --> 00:15:01.150 align:middle line:84%
That which breathes
you, inside of you,

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:04.480 align:middle line:84%
is much larger than you
can possibly imagine.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And it is a
multi-dimensional being.

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:13.960 align:middle line:84%
So one would not necessarily
incarnate into a physical form,

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:19.850 align:middle line:84%
but in dimensions having
experiences and learnings.

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:21.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:22.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if
a person is maybe

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:27.820 align:middle line:84%
dropping into another
reality spontaneously

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.949 align:middle line:84%
where they feel like they're
living literally a life that's

00:15:31.949 --> 00:15:33.740 align:middle line:84%
running parallel to
their own where they're

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:36.390 align:middle line:84%
having in this other
experience, you're

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:40.760 align:middle line:84%
saying that is likely
happening in another dimension?

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:45.590 align:middle line:84%
Or does it also happen-- well,
I'll ask you that in a minute.

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:48.250 align:middle line:84%
Is most likely happening
in another dimension then?

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:49.690 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:50.596 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:50.596 --> 00:15:51.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And is it--

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:54.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: You are aware of
double exposed photography

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:56.410 align:middle line:90%
or triple exposed, yes?

00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:57.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:00.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: You can
liken it to that image.

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:05.330 align:middle line:84%
There's an image upon an image
upon an image that exists, yes?

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:07.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:09.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So
that gives the mind

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:14.140 align:middle line:84%
some visual picture,
because humans think

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:17.370 align:middle line:90%
in pictures or experiences.

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:18.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:19.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So
that could be what

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:24.040 align:middle line:84%
we describe as a way
to try to understand

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.780 align:middle line:90%
that multi-dimensionality.

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.080 align:middle line:90%
There are layers.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:35.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Some people say that
in this field of potential,

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.410 align:middle line:84%
you make a decision,
and it sends you

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:41.900 align:middle line:84%
down one course of, you
know, experience or reality.

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.800 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Correct.

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Some people say
that those other potentials

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:51.640 align:middle line:84%
remain alive rather than going
dormant once the decision has

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.000 align:middle line:90%
been made to choose one.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.272 align:middle line:90%
What's actually going on there?

00:16:55.272 --> 00:16:57.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: They're
opportunities, aren't they?

00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:58.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:00.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So opportunities
are always there.

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:04.190 align:middle line:84%
There are no missed
opportunities.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:11.260 align:middle line:84%
The soul chooses perfectly
the line of action for growth.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.210 align:middle line:84%
But you're a multi-dimensional
being how being

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:17.940 align:middle line:90%
a finite human body experience.

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:23.859 align:middle line:84%
However, you are not
limited to that body.

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:28.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So any of
those other choice points

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:31.840 align:middle line:84%
might be playing out had
you made that decision

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.570 align:middle line:90%
in another dimension.

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:34.540 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:38.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you can say, I'm
going to be a scientist here,

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.050 align:middle line:84%
or I'm going to be
an actress there.

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps your physical
reality plays one of them out,

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:47.250 align:middle line:84%
but the other
aspects of yourself

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:49.650 align:middle line:84%
may be playing out
the other choices that

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:51.400 align:middle line:90%
could have been made.

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:54.000 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: It is possible, yes.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Might that
happen more with a soul who

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.520 align:middle line:84%
really wants both
and can't see how

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.460 align:middle line:90%
to do both in one incarnation?

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It can,
or it can happen

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:03.910 align:middle line:90%
in multiple incarnations.

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:05.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:09.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: But the
energy is there.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does this--
then would lead me on to--

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.340 align:middle line:84%
and I have a personal
question following

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:18.340 align:middle line:84%
it-- but the notion of
us a split incarnation

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:23.520 align:middle line:84%
where the same soul is occupying
two bodies then on Earth

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:27.250 align:middle line:84%
or wherever, but say in this
reality, at the same time.

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:29.130 align:middle line:90%
Does that ever occur?

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: That is what
one would call a twin flame.

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:33.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, that
is another word, yes.

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:34.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:36.890 align:middle line:90%
That does occur.

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:41.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it a common
thing or not so common?

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And can you explain under
what conditions a soul

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.090 align:middle line:90%
might choose to do this.

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:48.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It is not
so common, because there

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:52.380 align:middle line:84%
are those parts of the
soul that are always

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:56.350 align:middle line:84%
present whether
incarnate or not.

00:18:56.350 --> 00:19:02.330 align:middle line:84%
So there are times which
there is the choice that there

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:07.350 align:middle line:84%
are those parallel
lives lived in one time

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:09.680 align:middle line:90%
frame or incarnation.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.832 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:11.832 --> 00:19:14.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so this is
more of a personal question,

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.623 align:middle line:84%
because I've always
wondered about it.

00:19:15.623 --> 00:19:19.370 align:middle line:84%
My son Stuart and I seem to have
the same experiences in life.

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:21.310 align:middle line:90%
And it's to a bizarre extent.

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:23.850 align:middle line:84%
It can be very literal
from day to day.

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:26.000 align:middle line:90%
It can be overarching themes.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.940 align:middle line:84%
But we're having
the same experience,

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:30.171 align:middle line:90%
working on the same themes.

00:19:30.171 --> 00:19:32.420 align:middle line:84%
Even if we don't talk to
each other for a couple weeks

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.836 align:middle line:84%
at a time, it'll turn out we've
been doing the same thing,

00:19:34.836 --> 00:19:36.210 align:middle line:90%
cooking the same thing.

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:40.980 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like we're having
a similar incarnation, but him

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:44.690 align:middle line:84%
in a younger male body, a
generation younger, and me

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:46.290 align:middle line:90%
as his mother.

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:49.200 align:middle line:84%
What is actually happening
in a situation like that?

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: That is a
twin flame experience--

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:54.316 align:middle line:84%
the masculine and the
feminine expressed.

00:19:54.316 --> 00:19:55.640 align:middle line:90%


00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:58.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, I
really resisted that idea.

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:01.520 align:middle line:84%
But it's so funny, we
just laugh about it.

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.987 align:middle line:84%
I just say, hey, why don't I
just give you a call, Stuart,

00:20:03.987 --> 00:20:05.195 align:middle line:90%
and find out how I'm feeling?

00:20:05.195 --> 00:20:06.680 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.640 align:middle line:90%
Because it's so literal.

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, now
how interesting

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:20.380 align:middle line:84%
might that be to give birth
to a being who you're also

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:25.420 align:middle line:84%
going to incarnate, in terms
of rapid learning of the earth

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:27.350 align:middle line:90%
experience?

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:28.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:29.650 align:middle line:90%
But it's a soul's choice.

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:30.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:32.715 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And there's a
fuller understanding of it--

00:20:32.715 --> 00:20:33.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So--

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:35.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --and a reason
for it, for the soul

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:36.670 align:middle line:90%
chooses perfectly.

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:37.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:42.830 align:middle line:84%
So in that case, might
I, my being, my soul,

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:46.302 align:middle line:84%
have chosen to first
I occupy this body

00:20:46.302 --> 00:20:47.760 align:middle line:84%
and then give birth
to another body

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:51.980 align:middle line:84%
that I can occupy who is
picking up the information I've

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.850 align:middle line:84%
gathered over a lifetime,
and starting at that point,

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:57.740 align:middle line:84%
and vastly going to
transcend whatever

00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:59.970 align:middle line:90%
I know in his lifetime?

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:00.770 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible--

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:01.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: It is.

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:02.821 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that it's
for a rapid learning?

00:21:02.821 --> 00:21:04.970 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: It is.

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:07.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that
something that is--

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.360 align:middle line:84%
I assume that's not
a normal thing to do,

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.860 align:middle line:84%
but maybe for a person
that's impatient like me

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:12.820 align:middle line:90%
that would be normal?

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:15.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It's
extraordinary, isn't it?

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.600 align:middle line:84%
Or it would seem to be
in the conscious thinking

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:18.880 align:middle line:90%
of humankind.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:23.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it also seems very
efficient to just kind of tag

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.980 align:middle line:84%
in your incarnations rather
than waiting between.

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Why not just pick it up and
continue the body of learning?

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:32.220 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: It does that.

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And then there are those
who are in relationship,

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:41.070 align:middle line:84%
can vary in age as
well, expressing.

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:44.494 align:middle line:84%
Many have romanticized
this, you see?

00:21:44.494 --> 00:21:46.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, the
notion of twin flame.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Yes,
and also soul mate.

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:50.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:51.990 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And what
it is is connectivity

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:56.580 align:middle line:84%
on a vibrational level of
soul that is of its likeness.

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So a twin flame
romantic relationship

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:06.790 align:middle line:84%
is playing out the sexual
polarity of a soul with itself.

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:08.084 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:22:08.084 --> 00:22:10.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you expand
on that a little bit?

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And many have
work to do together and need

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:17.420 align:middle line:84%
the masculine and feminine
balance of that work--

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:21.710 align:middle line:84%
just as you and your son, he
giving the masculine side--

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:22.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:24.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --and you the
feminine, even though there

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:26.643 align:middle line:90%
is that within you both.

00:22:26.643 --> 00:22:27.443 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:22:27.443 --> 00:22:27.926 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes?

00:22:27.926 --> 00:22:29.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:31.264 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It's quite
complex, isn't it?

00:22:31.264 --> 00:22:32.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's very complex.

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:34.554 align:middle line:84%
When I finally got comfortable
with the notion that

00:22:34.554 --> 00:22:36.430 align:middle line:84%
might be the case,
I thought, that's

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:41.100 align:middle line:84%
really kind of an interesting
ride, super quick learning.

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:42.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:43.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And I can already see, I
look at something he's doing.

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:52.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think, ah, what
have I not learned

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:56.260 align:middle line:84%
in this time that would be
reflected in his being learning

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:58.560 align:middle line:84%
that aspect of
our soul, learning

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:00.990 align:middle line:90%
what he's learning now?

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:03.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And then
you retain it as well.

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:05.897 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, because
we learn in tandem.

00:23:05.897 --> 00:23:06.730 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Correct.

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When one of
us learns something,

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:09.660 align:middle line:84%
the other picks it
up really rapidly.

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:10.690 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:11.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.208 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well, thank you
for answering that.

00:23:13.208 --> 00:23:15.630 align:middle line:84%
I've kind of suspected
that might be the case.

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:20.460 align:middle line:84%
OK, so when we're looking--
I think the twin flame thing,

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:24.160 align:middle line:84%
it has been somewhat
misunderstood on this plane.

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We tend
to say, oh, this

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.580 align:middle line:84%
is my twin flame when it's
someone that we're just

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:29.910 align:middle line:90%
in resonance with.

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:32.120 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't necessarily
mean twin flame the way

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:32.920 align:middle line:90%
you're saying it--

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:33.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Correct.

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --as in a
split incarnation.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.152 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Correct.

00:23:36.152 --> 00:23:38.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It might just mean
a high degree of compatibility

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:39.720 align:middle line:90%
or recognition.

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:40.980 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Or soul family.

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:42.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or soul family.

00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:46.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And soul family of
souls of the same vibration.

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:49.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you talk a
little bit about soul family

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:54.210 align:middle line:84%
and how we continue to weave
together throughout time

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:59.350 align:middle line:84%
and, well, throughout non-linear
time, what appears to be time?

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: There are souls on
the same vibrational frequency

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:06.530 align:middle line:84%
that incarnate together to
support each other's growth

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:11.050 align:middle line:84%
time and time again,
interacting and changing roles,

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:14.830 align:middle line:84%
different actors in
the play, if you would,

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:19.950 align:middle line:84%
and meet and support each
other, and that times

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:25.260 align:middle line:90%
can be the foil in one's life.

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:27.460 align:middle line:90%
For where does one learn best?

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Not when it's easy, comfortable,
but when challenged.

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:33.670 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:34.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:36.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So they can
be those who challenge

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:40.590 align:middle line:84%
as well-- sacred
challenges, you might

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:43.525 align:middle line:90%
say, but of like understanding.

00:24:43.525 --> 00:24:46.200 align:middle line:90%


00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:50.370 align:middle line:84%
So when you communicate,
it is as you know them.

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:53.750 align:middle line:90%
You see them vibrationally.

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And you can interact on
a level of conversation

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.200 align:middle line:90%
that is understood.

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.450 align:middle line:90%


00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:00.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:02.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And those who
are not soul family, there's

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:04.485 align:middle line:90%
a missed communication.

00:25:04.485 --> 00:25:06.857 align:middle line:90%


00:25:06.857 --> 00:25:07.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Maybe an--

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:10.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: There's not
a match vibration really.

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:13.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Maybe there's no
ability to really understand

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:14.780 align:middle line:90%
each other.

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:14.940 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Correct.

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:17.398 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's like I just
don't understand how they think.

00:25:17.398 --> 00:25:19.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:20.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:23.150 align:middle line:84%
So it would be also
efficient to continue

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:26.520 align:middle line:84%
to incarnate among those where
you may have your challenges,

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:29.060 align:middle line:84%
but you can at least understand
the basis of thinking.

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:29.860 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And there can be
conversation and growth.

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:37.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Even in,
hm, opposite opinions,

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:38.250 align:middle line:90%
there's growth, you see?

00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:39.376 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:25:39.376 --> 00:25:40.175 align:middle line:90%
So let's--

00:25:40.175 --> 00:25:42.803 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Because you meet
on a level of understanding.

00:25:42.803 --> 00:25:45.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:46.220 align:middle line:90%
Of common understanding.

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:47.020 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:47.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:48.623 align:middle line:90%
And that goes deep.

00:25:48.623 --> 00:25:49.680 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.340 align:middle line:90%
And there are soul contracts--

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:52.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:55.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: -- that are made
to come into a particular time,

00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:58.365 align:middle line:84%
to meet at a particular
time, and to interact

00:25:58.365 --> 00:26:02.420 align:middle line:84%
at the particular time together
for whatever learning has been

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:04.172 align:middle line:90%
chosen.

00:26:04.172 --> 00:26:05.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:08.430 align:middle line:84%
What about the black
sheep in the family?

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:10.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: They could
be the contrary one, yes?

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:11.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.750 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean you're
not soul family, per se.

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:16.022 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people
say, I'm the black sheep.

00:26:16.022 --> 00:26:17.230 align:middle line:90%
I don't think like my family.

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:18.360 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
watching the show

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.400 align:middle line:84%
would say they're black sheep,
because they leapt ahead

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.020 align:middle line:90%
in their thinking.

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:21.850 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:25.530 align:middle line:84%
We're not speaking of
linear family at all here.

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:26.920 align:middle line:90%
It can be.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.050 align:middle line:90%
Oftentimes, it is not.

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:33.350 align:middle line:84%
So those who say, I am the
black sheep, I don't fit in,

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:35.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm not of the
same understanding

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:40.180 align:middle line:84%
of these beings-- that
happens to those who are

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:42.320 align:middle line:90%
the way shower to a new way.

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.757 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:26:43.757 --> 00:26:44.840 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: So it is true.

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:47.510 align:middle line:84%
They are not soul
family, but they

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:50.990 align:middle line:84%
will meet their soul family
that will be supportive,

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:53.670 align:middle line:84%
and connected, and are
not always together

00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:56.120 align:middle line:90%
in the same location.

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:57.310 align:middle line:90%
They are global.

00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:58.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:58.400 --> 00:26:59.200 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes?

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And, well, certainly technology
is allowing for more of that

00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:06.110 align:middle line:84%
now, for people
to find their soul

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:08.500 align:middle line:84%
families through
technology, online,

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:10.070 align:middle line:84%
such as what we're
doing right now.

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:13.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so it's, again,
this efficiency, right--

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:18.200 align:middle line:84%
of speeding up, of meeting
with the like resonance beings

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.000 align:middle line:90%
of soul family--

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:19.080 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: That it is.

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.705 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --where it might have
taken forever to find your soul

00:27:21.705 --> 00:27:23.040 align:middle line:90%
family in times past.

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Yes, but you're
living in a different time.

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:25.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:27.480 align:middle line:10%
>>GILLETTE: The fifth
dimensionary energy

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:31.040 align:middle line:10%
has brought this forth,
this rapid movement

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:38.570 align:middle line:10%
of growth, this 100 years of
great invention, if you would,

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:41.050 align:middle line:10%
your technology, bringing
the world together,

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:46.330 align:middle line:10%
a global community, a
common unity of humankind,

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:50.110 align:middle line:10%
which allows for
education to come forth,

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:51.960 align:middle line:10%
and that you all
can work together,

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:54.070 align:middle line:10%
and the meeting of soul family.

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:56.395 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:27:56.395 --> 00:27:59.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about looking at
this from another point of view

00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:05.490 align:middle line:84%
that is more challenging in that
as each soul is a co-creator

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:09.720 align:middle line:84%
and has a hand in
their own reality, what

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:13.030 align:middle line:84%
is a proper, from your
perspective, way for us

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:17.090 align:middle line:84%
to view things which we
find really abhorrent, where

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:19.350 align:middle line:84%
say a person has chosen
to incarnate and be

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:25.180 align:middle line:84%
part of a family that has major
violence patterns and such.

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And we watch this,
especially children.

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And we say, oh,
this is horrible.

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:30.930 align:middle line:84%
What's happened to
this little child?

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:32.590 align:middle line:90%
And your heart bleeds.

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:35.830 align:middle line:84%
You want to reach out, and you
want to save the little child.

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:37.454 align:middle line:90%
These are touchy areas.

00:28:37.454 --> 00:28:39.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: They are
touchy, because you learn

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:42.440 align:middle line:90%
compassion in human experience.

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:47.060 align:middle line:84%
However, one must trust and
not judge the soul's journey.

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:49.980 align:middle line:84%
Not to be in judgment,
for you know not

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:53.620 align:middle line:84%
what the soul has
chosen to learn from.

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:58.110 align:middle line:84%
But to love the soul, the
divinity of that being-- yes--

00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:02.980 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to like the
personality or their actions

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:04.914 align:middle line:90%
in their human experience.

00:29:04.914 --> 00:29:05.890 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:06.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of
the thought goes more

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:11.780 align:middle line:84%
toward the victim,
the perceived victim.

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:16.290 align:middle line:84%
But that person has incarnated
into that family pattern

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:17.230 align:middle line:90%
for a reason.

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Yes-- to
have the soul learning,

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:22.800 align:middle line:84%
and to have the information,
to have the compassion.

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:24.890 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes?

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:25.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:26.886 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Understand this.

00:29:26.886 --> 00:29:28.825 align:middle line:84%
There's a terrorist
in each and every one

00:29:28.825 --> 00:29:33.400 align:middle line:90%
of you, that part of self.

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And what we speak of in the
integrative process, the soul

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:41.300 align:middle line:84%
integration, is how to
discover that, soothe

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:44.030 align:middle line:84%
and love that part of
self because it is only

00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:46.920 align:middle line:84%
based in fear and
lack of understanding

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:52.490 align:middle line:84%
in all beliefs, that then can
bring that part of self home

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:54.850 align:middle line:84%
into the wholeness of the
being and the recognition

00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:58.620 align:middle line:90%
of the divinity that you are.

00:29:58.620 --> 00:29:59.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:02.940 align:middle line:90%
And what of societies?

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:07.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, on earth it's such
a mixed bag of levels.

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:10.320 align:middle line:84%
I don't even like the word
levels-- of differences--

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:13.500 align:middle line:84%
in the way in which we learn,
in the way in which we choose

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:16.110 align:middle line:84%
to learn, the patterns
we're seeking and trying

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:19.940 align:middle line:84%
to adopt-- such a vast
difference in the way people

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:24.260 align:middle line:84%
live, where what is not even
remotely acceptable in one

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:29.100 align:middle line:84%
culture, or soul group even, is
totally acceptable in another.

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:34.590 align:middle line:84%
Is this common to have this
variance of experience,

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:37.700 align:middle line:84%
and knowledge, and
learning on a given planet?

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:38.500 align:middle line:90%
Or are we unique?

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It is for
the earthly plane.

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:43.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so I'm saying,
are we unique in that sense?

00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:46.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It is unique to
the learning of the emotions.

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:49.820 align:middle line:84%
But it's also the beautiful
tapestry of the human species,

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:50.620 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:51.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:55.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So it is to
look with different lenses,

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:59.100 align:middle line:84%
not in judgment to better than,
lesser than, right or wrong--

00:30:59.100 --> 00:30:59.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --but the uniqueness
but also the common threads,

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:06.340 align:middle line:90%
the commonalities of all of you.

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:08.250 align:middle line:84%
They're just
different expressions.

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:09.655 align:middle line:90%
Are they not?

00:31:09.655 --> 00:31:10.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They are.

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:14.160 align:middle line:84%
I think part of my
question was, as you say,

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.840 align:middle line:84%
this is normal for
the earth plane.

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:19.750 align:middle line:84%
But are there many
other singular species

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:22.880 align:middle line:84%
out there that have
such a variance of ways

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:26.800 align:middle line:84%
in which living happens on
their planets, in their systems?

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:28.850 align:middle line:90%
Is that as varied as we are?

00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:29.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: It is.

00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:33.180 align:middle line:84%
But know there are
billions of other planets.

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:35.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, inhabited.

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:36.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:36.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.729 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Billions of them.

00:31:37.729 --> 00:31:39.228 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
sometimes we think

00:31:39.228 --> 00:31:40.460 align:middle line:90%
of this as a bit of a zoo.

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:44.335 align:middle line:84%
You know, just throw a
little of this and that in.

00:31:44.335 --> 00:31:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And there has been much said
through the works of people

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:52.250 align:middle line:84%
and historically that this is
more of an experiment of sorts

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:53.540 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:55.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Everything is
an experiment, isn't it?

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:56.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:57.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes?

00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:58.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Life
is an experiment.

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:05.070 align:middle line:84%
But recognize your planet
has many living things--

00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:05.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:08.790 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: --many cultures.

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:11.720 align:middle line:84%
You have the human
species that have

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:16.770 align:middle line:84%
varied and different cultures
that they express through.

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:23.450 align:middle line:84%
You have animal species that
have their own culture, yes?

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:26.750 align:middle line:84%
So it is quite
diverse, if you would.

00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:30.990 align:middle line:84%
Again, we speak of the
beautiful tapestry of the earth.

00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:33.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and animals
sleeping with people-- I mean,

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:35.980 align:middle line:84%
how many of us have our
little dogs, and cats,

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:40.169 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know, chipmunks
sleeping in our beds at night?

00:32:40.169 --> 00:32:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And I've always
thought, what must it

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:44.890 align:middle line:84%
look like from outside species
to see the way in which all

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:47.820 align:middle line:84%
of these different species
here mix it up and live side

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:48.750 align:middle line:90%
by side--

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:50.161 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:32:50.161 --> 00:32:51.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and
adapt to each other.

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:55.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And adapt, and live
comfortably together if they so

00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:56.530 align:middle line:90%
choose.

00:32:56.530 --> 00:33:00.960 align:middle line:84%
It is fear that
dominates the judgement.

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:03.820 align:middle line:84%
It is perpetuated by
the thought that one

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:06.310 align:middle line:90%
is lesser than another.

00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:09.410 align:middle line:84%
What is happening in this
fifth dimensionary energy,

00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:14.730 align:middle line:84%
present now, is the recognition
that you're all the same

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:17.980 align:middle line:84%
and that you can
survive upon this planet

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:24.895 align:middle line:84%
by fulfilling that with
love, not judgment and fear.

00:33:24.895 --> 00:33:25.695 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:25.695 --> 00:33:28.500 align:middle line:90%


00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:30.760 align:middle line:84%
Yesterday, I did a
couple of interviews

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:35.720 align:middle line:84%
that were intriguing that had
to do with species that we have

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:40.010 align:middle line:84%
always called extraterrestrial
that actually the two

00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:41.890 align:middle line:84%
interviewees were
saying, I think

00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:43.280 align:middle line:84%
we're calling it
something wrong.

00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:46.240 align:middle line:84%
Because there are species,
other species of humanoids,

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.370 align:middle line:84%
who have lived alongside
us, maybe out of sight,

00:33:48.370 --> 00:33:51.680 align:middle line:84%
maybe underground,
maybe in remote places,

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.370 align:middle line:84%
perhaps as long as
we've been here.

00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:55.210 align:middle line:84%
Is that the way
you see it as well?

00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:56.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: We do.

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:58.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And can you
tell us a little bit

00:33:58.130 --> 00:33:59.320 align:middle line:90%
about the earth itself?

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:02.800 align:middle line:84%
Because now, you know,
there are explorations

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:05.630 align:middle line:84%
trying to find out what
truly is at the core, how

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:10.120 align:middle line:84%
we have this rush of oxygen at
the core, how we have humanoid

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:13.020 align:middle line:84%
species living underneath,
deep underneath the earth

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:14.840 align:middle line:90%
or underneath the oceans.

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.960 align:middle line:84%
Can you just give
us your reflection

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:20.870 align:middle line:84%
on what that looks like
from where you are?

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:23.120 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: It's true.

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:29.530 align:middle line:84%
There are many species
upon this planet living.

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:34.390 align:middle line:84%
But there's also those who have
incarnate that look like you.

00:34:34.390 --> 00:34:36.890 align:middle line:84%
You are all what you
would call alien--

00:34:36.890 --> 00:34:38.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:41.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: --if you would, yes?

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:44.989 align:middle line:84%
Because you've all lived other
places, universally speaking.

00:34:44.989 --> 00:34:46.179 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:46.179 --> 00:34:50.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So you are
visitors to this planet.

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:52.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so those
who are underground,

00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:57.480 align:middle line:84%
while they may not look exactly
like we do or feel emotionally

00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:00.850 align:middle line:84%
in the same way we
do, have existed

00:35:00.850 --> 00:35:03.800 align:middle line:84%
in their own way in their
own culture here for perhaps

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:05.534 align:middle line:90%
as long as humanity or longer?

00:35:05.534 --> 00:35:06.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: They have.

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:08.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And why is it now that this
is starting to surface,

00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:14.260 align:middle line:90%
no pun intended?

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:17.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It is the energy
that is about the earth.

00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:17.890 align:middle line:90%
It's a time.

00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's been a
quickening of time

00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:23.580 align:middle line:84%
and an elevation of vibration
from the third dimension

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:27.310 align:middle line:84%
to the higher dimensions
of the earthly plane.

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:29.390 align:middle line:84%
The fifth is fully
around the earth

00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:33.560 align:middle line:84%
now, which is a greater
understanding of all that is.

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:36.470 align:middle line:84%
The sixth will be
expressed in physical form.

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:39.760 align:middle line:84%
There are 12 dimensions
about the earth.

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And as the individual
incarnates in those

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:48.120 align:middle line:84%
are expressed more
fully on the earth,

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:52.660 align:middle line:84%
the sixth will be the one that
is fully expressed physically.

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:58.230 align:middle line:84%
But those in the sixth dimension
will be connected at all times

00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:00.410 align:middle line:90%
to the others.

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:02.454 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What do you
mean, to the others?

00:36:02.454 --> 00:36:04.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Seventh, eighth,
ninth, tenth, 11th, and 12th.

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, the other
fields, the other planes.

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:10.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Science has already
attested to 11 dimensions.

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:10.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:14.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: They will
recognize the 12th soon.

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:16.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:20.800 align:middle line:84%
As for the human
interface with the beings

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:23.870 align:middle line:84%
I was just mentioning,
the fear seems

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:29.440 align:middle line:84%
to come from people who
have relayed information

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:32.810 align:middle line:84%
of having encounters with
the humanoid type species

00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:36.530 align:middle line:84%
under the earth-- and that
they feel overwhelmed,

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:40.430 align:middle line:84%
because the other has greater
telepathic ability, perhaps

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:42.770 align:middle line:84%
a greater ability
of mastery of mind

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:45.170 align:middle line:84%
to affect the mind of
the person standing

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:47.870 align:middle line:84%
before them making them
feel stunned, or powerless,

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:49.700 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it is.

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:51.470 align:middle line:84%
Can you speak to
this a little bit,

00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:56.560 align:middle line:84%
and maybe explain the reality
of that, and how it would best

00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:59.730 align:middle line:84%
be viewed by people on the
surface of the earth that

00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:03.180 align:middle line:84%
might encounter some of
these beings one day?

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:05.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So it is a
perception, isn't it?

00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:06.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:09.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: What we're
speaking to now is that you all

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:11.820 align:middle line:90%
have that capability.

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:14.261 align:middle line:84%
You just haven't believed
that it's possible.

00:37:14.261 --> 00:37:15.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they've
been using it.

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.690 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're speaking
about in the fifth dimensionary

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:24.413 align:middle line:84%
energy and beyond,
is those capabilities

00:37:24.413 --> 00:37:30.550 align:middle line:84%
are emerging and being utilized
on a daily basis by all of you

00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:32.740 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:35.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're mesmerizing
each other without knowing it.

00:37:35.350 --> 00:37:36.390 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:38.940 align:middle line:84%
You're communicating
telepathically.

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:40.350 align:middle line:90%
You think of someone.

00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:41.690 align:middle line:90%
You engage with him.

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:43.260 align:middle line:90%
You visualize them.

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:45.310 align:middle line:90%
And they call you on the phone.

00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:47.570 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:50.270 align:middle line:84%
Or they make contact
in some way with you,

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:53.342 align:middle line:84%
because they've felt the
vibration, the connectivity.

00:37:53.342 --> 00:37:54.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:56.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So it's
already happening.

00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:57.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And we're starting to
recognize that it's happening.

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And going back to the question
I asked you a moment ago, I

00:38:03.010 --> 00:38:06.130 align:middle line:84%
think another area of fear
among humans about this

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:09.240 align:middle line:84%
in this type of encounter
comes around the fact

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:12.716 align:middle line:84%
that the emotional body is
perceived very differently

00:38:12.716 --> 00:38:14.340 align:middle line:84%
of the beings that
they're encountering

00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:18.450 align:middle line:84%
from under the surface, the
other humanoid entities.

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:24.010 align:middle line:84%
There doesn't seem to be
that kind of familiar warmth

00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:29.410 align:middle line:84%
that the human species knows
and recognizes in each other.

00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:32.040 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about the emotional
structure of the others

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:34.740 align:middle line:84%
and what it's going to
take for the two species

00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:39.660 align:middle line:84%
to effectively live
alongside in open one day?

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:41.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: They're
more observatory.

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:43.610 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
figure you out just

00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:45.480 align:middle line:84%
as you are trying
to figure them out,

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:50.020 align:middle line:84%
you see, and
understand one another.

00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:54.440 align:middle line:84%
But you've also met, have you
not, those who are not warm--

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:56.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm, definitely.

00:38:56.780 --> 00:39:02.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --that have a
certain persona within them,

00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:03.820 align:middle line:90%
that are the watchers--

00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:04.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:06.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --or
the observers, yes?

00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:07.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:13.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Very similar, just
different personality traits.

00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:16.235 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And of course, anybody
listening now would say, well,

00:39:16.235 --> 00:39:18.000 align:middle line:90%
you have to ask them.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.610 align:middle line:84%
But are they actually
experimenting on us

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:23.800 align:middle line:84%
like we experiment on
other animal species?

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And is that an agreed upon thing
between the humanoid beings

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:31.690 align:middle line:90%
and the human race?

00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:33.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It is agreed
upon, and they're not

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:38.015 align:middle line:90%
harming, just fearful.

00:39:38.015 --> 00:39:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Many are
frightening, yes.

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:43.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It's
not to be afraid.

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And they can enrich the
physical body vibrationally--

00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:50.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:52.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: --to better health.

00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:54.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:56.840 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for sharing that.

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:59.110 align:middle line:84%
Because it's interesting,
I just talked

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:01.440 align:middle line:84%
with other people for two
hours about this yesterday.

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And one of the people says
we should be very afraid,

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:07.780 align:middle line:84%
you know, to be frightened
of those who are different,

00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:09.610 align:middle line:90%
others of all kinds.

00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:11.631 align:middle line:84%
And I don't really
see it that way.

00:40:11.631 --> 00:40:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: That's all
conspiratorial, isn't it?

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:14.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:18.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: To be afraid is what
has created the divisiveness

00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:20.450 align:middle line:90%
within species--

00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:21.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:23.520 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: --within countries.

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:24.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:30.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: What we speak about
is holding that space of love

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:35.350 align:middle line:84%
is very transformative
and in doing such,

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:38.740 align:middle line:90%
allows the openness of learning.

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:39.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:42.280 align:middle line:84%
I hear what you're saying,
and I agree with that.

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:43.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
really nothing that

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:46.340 align:middle line:84%
was said in that
conversation I'm

00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:52.120 align:middle line:84%
referring to about the way in
which others might treat us

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:54.725 align:middle line:84%
that we don't do to ourselves
and do to other species

00:40:54.725 --> 00:40:55.525 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:40:55.525 --> 00:40:57.855 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: You do much
worse unto yourselves.

00:40:57.855 --> 00:40:58.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, we do.

00:40:58.730 --> 00:40:59.280 align:middle line:90%
We've done--

00:40:59.280 --> 00:40:59.690 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:01.714 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --horrid
things as human to human.

00:41:01.714 --> 00:41:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why I don't find
that a really good argument

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:07.086 align:middle line:90%
that we should be frightened.

00:41:07.086 --> 00:41:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: That's an
old paradigm, isn't it?

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:11.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, an old paradigm.

00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:15.160 align:middle line:84%
Now I'd like to
ask you a question

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:17.020 align:middle line:90%
having to do with time frames.

00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:19.690 align:middle line:84%
As you mentioned earlier,
time is non-linear.

00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And an area that is
interesting is the notion

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:29.600 align:middle line:84%
of being able to connect with
ourselves in what we would

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:34.970 align:middle line:84%
commonly refer to as a
past time or experience

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:40.610 align:middle line:84%
to effect a future outcome or
let's say a present outcome.

00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:42.530 align:middle line:84%
Can we go back,
essentially-- there

00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:44.470 align:middle line:84%
have been movie
themes about this--

00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:49.290 align:middle line:84%
and make a decision differently
or redo something in the past

00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:51.734 align:middle line:90%
and change our present outcome?

00:41:51.734 --> 00:41:52.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Of course.

00:41:52.650 --> 00:41:54.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you tell us
a little bit about that?

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:55.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:59.790 align:middle line:84%
It's done the soul integrated
process continually with some,

00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:02.625 align:middle line:84%
where you discover a part
of fragmentation that

00:42:02.625 --> 00:42:05.960 align:middle line:84%
has been from another
time that has influenced

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.840 align:middle line:84%
the present lifetime
and the way one

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:13.620 align:middle line:84%
reacts to situations
and circumstances.

00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:18.320 align:middle line:84%
So when one recognizes
this part of self that

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:25.630 align:middle line:84%
is held in the past experience
and then soothes, and comforts,

00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:31.510 align:middle line:84%
and loves that part of self,
it changes that dynamic

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:34.830 align:middle line:90%
with the revelation of it.

00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So for us to
do this consciously,

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:43.680 align:middle line:84%
can it be something as simple
as holding a state that we would

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:46.400 align:middle line:84%
consider to be more of a
perfected state of whatever

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:50.650 align:middle line:84%
that reality is in mind and
essentially merge with that?

00:42:50.650 --> 00:42:53.030 align:middle line:90%
Can we do something that simple?

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: You recognize the
situation and circumstance

00:42:55.750 --> 00:43:00.060 align:middle line:84%
that occurred that
fragmented your soul.

00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:04.560 align:middle line:84%
The higher self of you,
the adult self of you

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:07.660 align:middle line:84%
in this lifetime
or the higher self,

00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:11.860 align:middle line:84%
soothes and comforts that
part of self of the past

00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:16.130 align:middle line:84%
and brings it forward
into this time fully--

00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:17.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:43:17.770 --> 00:43:19.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE:
--unencumbered from those

00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:27.250 align:middle line:84%
old believes by the love and
the, hm, change in the belief.

00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there has to
be, from what I have witnessed

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:34.430 align:middle line:84%
and experienced,
an absolute call

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:38.260 align:middle line:84%
it belief that this is possible
and this is how it works.

00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:39.157 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:43:39.157 --> 00:43:40.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can't
have doubt and get

00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:41.990 align:middle line:90%
the outcome you're looking for.

00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:43.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: When
you do the process,

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.212 align:middle line:90%
you will not have doubt.

00:43:44.212 --> 00:43:45.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:47.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: For it it's
real in your reality.

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:49.320 align:middle line:90%
And it's understood.

00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:51.206 align:middle line:90%
And you have that communication.

00:43:51.206 --> 00:43:54.330 align:middle line:90%


00:43:54.330 --> 00:43:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet
each soul's journey

00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:01.800 align:middle line:84%
presents us with a challenge
here and the challenge there

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:03.480 align:middle line:90%
for our own learning.

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:08.520 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't necessarily
mean that we will absolutely

00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:11.180 align:middle line:84%
change a present outcome if
it's not within the soul's

00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:12.326 align:middle line:90%
desire, right?

00:44:12.326 --> 00:44:13.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: That's correct.

00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:15.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There may
be something we simply

00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:16.944 align:middle line:84%
have to contend with
for our learning.

00:44:16.944 --> 00:44:18.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It's all
learning, isn't it?

00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:19.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:21.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It's just how
you perceive the learning

00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:23.820 align:middle line:90%
that you can change.

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:28.060 align:middle line:84%
You can either think
of it as difficult,

00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:30.830 align:middle line:84%
or you can think of
it as an opportunity.

00:44:30.830 --> 00:44:31.800 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:32.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:34.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Inviting
it in to see

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:38.180 align:middle line:84%
how much you can learn from
it rather than the resistance

00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:42.950 align:middle line:84%
to it-- for it becomes
much easier to invite

00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:46.370 align:middle line:84%
the opportunity to
learn and gain as much

00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:51.940 align:middle line:84%
that can be gained from
the experience moving

00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:55.870 align:middle line:84%
forward and knowing that you
then have compassion for others

00:44:55.870 --> 00:44:59.592 align:middle line:90%
and can assist them in likeness.

00:44:59.592 --> 00:45:01.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So sometimes it
might mean your being needs

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:05.620 align:middle line:84%
to be in physical pain in order
to have compassion for those

00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:07.610 align:middle line:90%
with pain and yourself.

00:45:07.610 --> 00:45:09.510 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Correct.

00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:15.730 align:middle line:84%
OK, now on a similar
note, about time--

00:45:15.730 --> 00:45:17.740 align:middle line:84%
because in human
terms, of course,

00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:21.100 align:middle line:84%
we have a very difficult
time with the notion

00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:23.180 align:middle line:90%
of non-linear time.

00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:26.510 align:middle line:84%
Because our entire construct
has been set up in our minds.

00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:30.670 align:middle line:84%
We're mentally interwoven with
the notion of one, two, three.

00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:32.577 align:middle line:84%
It's 12 o'clock, 3
o'clock, 6 o'clock.

00:45:32.577 --> 00:45:34.160 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, it's
this year or that.

00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:35.450 align:middle line:90%
And so we are linear.

00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:37.250 align:middle line:84%
We're very linear
in our thinking.

00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:41.320 align:middle line:84%
But experiences happen
all the time to people

00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:48.940 align:middle line:84%
where it almost seems as
though what you experience

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:51.900 align:middle line:90%
has already occurred.

00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:53.612 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I
think something.

00:45:53.612 --> 00:45:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And the words are
right there in my head.

00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:56.160 align:middle line:90%
I say something.

00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And boom, on the news, someone
says those exact words a minute

00:45:58.990 --> 00:45:59.790 align:middle line:90%
later.

00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:03.300 align:middle line:84%
What's actually
happening in these cases

00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:04.860 align:middle line:90%
that we all experience?

00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: That you're
connected to the vibration

00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:09.880 align:middle line:90%
of all that is.

00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:11.770 align:middle line:90%
And so you are aware.

00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:16.240 align:middle line:84%
Some call that
pre-cognition, yes?

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:17.340 align:middle line:90%
It's intuition.

00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:18.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:19.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: It's an awareness.

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:21.560 align:middle line:90%


00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:25.780 align:middle line:84%
There is also the thinking of
an individual placing an intent,

00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:29.921 align:middle line:84%
and then they receive the
message and contact you.

00:46:29.921 --> 00:46:30.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, that too.

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:31.720 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:34.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But this would
be simply like time

00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:36.240 align:middle line:90%
slipping back and forth.

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:38.410 align:middle line:84%
You say something as though
it's already occurred,

00:46:38.410 --> 00:46:40.880 align:middle line:84%
and then it happens a
second or a minute later.

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:41.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:43.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The exact thing
happens a second or a minute

00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:43.450 align:middle line:90%
later.

00:46:43.450 --> 00:46:44.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: A time delay.

00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:46.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A time delay, exactly.

00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes?

00:46:46.850 --> 00:46:50.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where that
brings us to the question,

00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:52.530 align:middle line:84%
if it's even a
couple second time

00:46:52.530 --> 00:47:00.830 align:middle line:84%
delay, how far in this
fuzzy spectrum of time

00:47:00.830 --> 00:47:04.380 align:middle line:84%
can reality have already been
created before we hook up

00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:08.640 align:middle line:84%
with it in the third dimensional
sense or in our physical realm?

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:11.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It can be very
far ahead or moments away,

00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:13.190 align:middle line:90%
as you spoke.

00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:16.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I ask you this
because one scientist says

00:47:16.310 --> 00:47:20.330 align:middle line:84%
that there's a-- they
use the word positive,

00:47:20.330 --> 00:47:21.660 align:middle line:90%
negative aspect to time.

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:23.240 align:middle line:84%
There's a mirrored
aspect of time

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:25.340 align:middle line:84%
in that you almost
can't make a mistake,

00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:28.040 align:middle line:84%
because the reality in
the other reversed pattern

00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:32.380 align:middle line:84%
has already occurred-- which
sounds-- you listen to that

00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:35.690 align:middle line:84%
and think, that's rather
fatalistic on one hand.

00:47:35.690 --> 00:47:39.310 align:middle line:84%
But then when we get into
subjects and the word entropy,

00:47:39.310 --> 00:47:41.840 align:middle line:84%
for example, that the
world of physics uses,

00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:46.400 align:middle line:84%
where the likelihood of you
choosing a particular reality

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:50.460 align:middle line:84%
is so high, in a sense, you
can say that you have already

00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:51.475 align:middle line:90%
created an outcome--

00:47:51.475 --> 00:47:52.275 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:47:52.275 --> 00:47:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --just because
you're programmed

00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:58.079 align:middle line:84%
into a predictive
behavior almost.

00:47:58.079 --> 00:47:59.120 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: That is true.

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:01.910 align:middle line:84%
But also you've been making
choices all along the way--

00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:02.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
part of it, yes.

00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:03.918 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --that
you're creating.

00:48:03.918 --> 00:48:06.080 align:middle line:84%
So if you make a
decision for something,

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:09.100 align:middle line:84%
then the universal field
or the quantum field

00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:12.450 align:middle line:84%
of which you speak about is
there to attach and align

00:48:12.450 --> 00:48:14.030 align:middle line:90%
with it to make it so.

00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:15.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where does
will come into it then?

00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:17.940 align:middle line:90%
We make choice, choice, choice.

00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And then you have will to
follow through on something.

00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:21.860 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:26.600 align:middle line:84%
When a decision is made,
a no-doubted decision,

00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:27.440 align:middle line:90%
you will do it.

00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:29.280 align:middle line:90%
It is a must.

00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:34.400 align:middle line:84%
That's where the energy
aligns to make it so.

00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:40.440 align:middle line:84%
Because you have made the
decision a must without doubt.

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:42.590 align:middle line:84%
Where you're talking
about is the wobble

00:48:42.590 --> 00:48:44.810 align:middle line:90%
between the decision--

00:48:44.810 --> 00:48:45.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:47.990 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: --and the belief.

00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:49.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:49.530 --> 00:48:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So what you
are talking about now

00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:57.640 align:middle line:90%
is a decision made.

00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:00.990 align:middle line:84%
The belief is
steadfast, for it's

00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:04.530 align:middle line:90%
without doubt you will do this.

00:49:04.530 --> 00:49:07.600 align:middle line:84%
So then the quantum
field aligns,

00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:11.320 align:middle line:84%
bringing all that is
necessary structurally,

00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:16.380 align:middle line:84%
whether it's money, people,
or things, to have the outcome

00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:18.072 align:middle line:90%
that you've decided for.

00:49:18.072 --> 00:49:20.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then that brings
up another question, which

00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:26.950 align:middle line:84%
is, what if the decision
you've made is not in alignment

00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:33.040 align:middle line:84%
with what the soul is trying
to accomplish in this lifetime?

00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:34.840 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: That never happens.

00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:35.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:38.440 align:middle line:90%
Any random decision then?

00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:39.240 align:middle line:90%
If it's like--

00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:40.330 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: There are not.

00:49:40.330 --> 00:49:42.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so you're saying
even what seems to be random,

00:49:42.830 --> 00:49:45.450 align:middle line:84%
even what seems to be
frivolous, is actually still

00:49:45.450 --> 00:49:46.730 align:middle line:90%
in alignment with the soul.

00:49:46.730 --> 00:49:48.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Soul-directed.

00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:50.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if it's
soul-directed in that sense,

00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:54.640 align:middle line:84%
then once you have made
a decision concretely

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:58.740 align:middle line:84%
and you are exerting
your will behind that,

00:49:58.740 --> 00:49:59.950 align:middle line:90%
it should come to pass.

00:49:59.950 --> 00:50:03.690 align:middle line:84%
There shouldn't be
any conflict there.

00:50:03.690 --> 00:50:06.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We see
it as such, yes.

00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:08.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why do people
have so much trouble then

00:50:08.890 --> 00:50:10.800 align:middle line:90%
manifesting what they wish?

00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:12.840 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Because they
don't believe they can.

00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:14.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there's still
the underlying belief they

00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:15.690 align:middle line:90%
don't deserve it or whatever.

00:50:15.690 --> 00:50:16.731 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: That's-- yes.

00:50:16.731 --> 00:50:18.250 align:middle line:90%
It is the wobble we speak about.

00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:20.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:20.290 --> 00:50:22.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: They can
make a decision for it,

00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:23.540 align:middle line:90%
but they must believe in it.

00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:27.720 align:middle line:84%
That's where we say, when
there are no-doubtedness.

00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:32.070 align:middle line:84%
What happens when a decision
is made, there is resistance.

00:50:32.070 --> 00:50:36.620 align:middle line:84%
That is the part of self,
the unworthy part that

00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:40.130 align:middle line:90%
comes or surfaces.

00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:47.330 align:middle line:84%
It is like, the, mm, rocket
ship going to outer space.

00:50:47.330 --> 00:50:49.940 align:middle line:90%


00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:51.150 align:middle line:90%
It takes off.

00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:59.210 align:middle line:84%
It has certain boosters
that send it forward.

00:50:59.210 --> 00:51:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And then it meets the
gravitational pull

00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:04.320 align:middle line:90%
of the earth.

00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:09.710 align:middle line:84%
A person has that gravitational
pull to the old way of being.

00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:11.890 align:middle line:84%
The rocket ship
has booster rockets

00:51:11.890 --> 00:51:17.280 align:middle line:84%
that then engage to push on
through the gravitational pull

00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:18.080 align:middle line:90%
to outer space.

00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:18.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:19.180 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes?

00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:20.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:23.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: With a person,
their booster rocket

00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:26.100 align:middle line:84%
is the beliefs, the
no-doubtedness that

00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:29.810 align:middle line:84%
allows them to push through
the gravitational pull

00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:36.290 align:middle line:84%
of resistance and lack of belief
to align with the outcome.

00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:38.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:42.080 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: That's where the
no-doubtedness serves them.

00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:44.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when you have
that feeling of no-doubtedness,

00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:48.150 align:middle line:84%
as you call it, that usually
is the soul speaking.

00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:48.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:52.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not just a
whimsical idea that sounds,

00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:53.326 align:middle line:90%
you know-- it's passing.

00:51:53.326 --> 00:51:54.126 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:51:54.126 --> 00:51:57.505 align:middle line:84%
And most often, it is illogical
to condition-based thinking.

00:51:57.505 --> 00:51:58.305 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:51:58.305 --> 00:51:59.990 align:middle line:90%
And that's a very good point.

00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:01.560 align:middle line:84%
Because it comes
out of left field.

00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:02.360 align:middle line:90%
And we think, what?

00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:03.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm supposed to sell my house.

00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And I'm supposed to
pack up my family

00:52:05.590 --> 00:52:07.890 align:middle line:90%
and leave and go to wherever?

00:52:07.890 --> 00:52:10.200 align:middle line:90%
But I can't do that.

00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:11.750 align:middle line:84%
So those kinds of
things that happen,

00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:14.249 align:middle line:84%
but you just know it in your
being, you have to do it,

00:52:14.249 --> 00:52:15.290 align:middle line:90%
that's the soul speaking.

00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:16.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And you
move through that.

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:16.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you move through.

00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:17.780 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:19.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:23.340 align:middle line:84%
Theo, we're going to
have to bring Sheila back

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:24.140 align:middle line:90%
in a little bit.

00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:26.980 align:middle line:84%
But along this line
of questioning,

00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:31.896 align:middle line:84%
you can see what I may have
missed-- [LAUGHTER] or not.

00:52:31.896 --> 00:52:33.270 align:middle line:84%
Can you see anything
else that we

00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:36.890 align:middle line:84%
might benefit from knowing
around understanding these time

00:52:36.890 --> 00:52:40.402 align:middle line:84%
frames and our souls
intention differently?

00:52:40.402 --> 00:52:41.860 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: The
understanding comes

00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:43.980 align:middle line:90%
from evidence in one's life.

00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:45.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:47.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: All people
have evidentiary

00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:51.410 align:middle line:84%
in their life of a decision
made without doubt,

00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:52.790 align:middle line:90%
and it all worked out.

00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:54.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, indeed.

00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:57.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So rely
on that evidence.

00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:01.700 align:middle line:84%
People believe in
what they conceive,

00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:07.390 align:middle line:84%
not what they're told, and
what they can recognize

00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:09.520 align:middle line:90%
as proof in their life.

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:14.800 align:middle line:84%
So rely on the evidence
of your own outcomes, yes?

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:18.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: You've all had them.

00:53:18.250 --> 00:53:19.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:21.150 align:middle line:90%
And it always works out.

00:53:21.150 --> 00:53:22.405 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: And it works out.

00:53:22.405 --> 00:53:23.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:26.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: But when another
opportunity presents itself,

00:53:26.410 --> 00:53:27.910 align:middle line:90%
then you wobble once again.

00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:30.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You back into doubt.

00:53:30.330 --> 00:53:33.014 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So rely
on the evidence, yes?

00:53:33.014 --> 00:53:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, it
should make life

00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:36.710 align:middle line:84%
a much more relaxing
and enjoyable experience

00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:38.350 align:middle line:90%
for people.

00:53:38.350 --> 00:53:41.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: But know, when
you have that wobble, when

00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:45.180 align:middle line:84%
you have that fear, the
flight of the butterfly

00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:48.870 align:middle line:84%
on the inner--
yes-- that is when

00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:52.210 align:middle line:90%
your dream is large enough.

00:53:52.210 --> 00:53:53.755 align:middle line:90%
If it is not, it's too easy.

00:53:53.755 --> 00:53:56.394 align:middle line:90%


00:53:56.394 --> 00:53:58.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I think there's
a little bumper sticker

00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:02.400 align:middle line:84%
about, have drug dreams
big enough to grow into.

00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:04.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Correct, excellent.

00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:06.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Don't dream small.

00:54:06.110 --> 00:54:07.040 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:08.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very good.

00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:11.550 align:middle line:84%
Theo, thank you so much for--
you've certainly helped me

00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:12.970 align:middle line:90%
understand a couple of things.

00:54:12.970 --> 00:54:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And I know our audience
has appreciated it as well.

00:54:16.170 --> 00:54:19.940 align:middle line:84%
So until next time, I say
thank you, and go well.

00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:22.377 align:middle line:90%
And we'll invite Sheila back.

00:54:22.377 --> 00:54:24.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We are
appreciative of the opportunity

00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:26.260 align:middle line:90%
to be of service.

00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:28.650 align:middle line:90%
God's love unto you.

00:54:28.650 --> 00:54:29.450 align:middle line:90%
Good day.

00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:30.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good day.

00:54:30.450 --> 00:54:43.622 align:middle line:90%


00:54:43.622 --> 00:54:44.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Hi, Regina.

00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:46.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hi, Sheila.

00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:48.812 align:middle line:84%
So do you recall any of
that-- I mean, some of it?

00:54:48.812 --> 00:54:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Little
bits and pieces, yeah.

00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:52.103 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was there
anything you found

00:54:52.103 --> 00:54:54.400 align:middle line:84%
kind of maybe interesting
to take a look at from where

00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:55.200 align:middle line:90%
you were sitting?

00:54:55.200 --> 00:55:01.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Mm, well,
you know, they're just--

00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:04.560 align:middle line:84%
what I'm hearing-- you know,
I'm continually growing.

00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:07.040 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing this
for four decades.

00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And every time Theo
speaks, I grow.

00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:13.220 align:middle line:84%
I get something
that's present from me

00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:15.900 align:middle line:90%
to listen to for my life.

00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that so
encourages me now is we're

00:55:23.950 --> 00:55:29.000 align:middle line:84%
just on that threshold of really
becoming all we can become.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:29.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:32.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And to me,
it's very exciting.

00:55:32.530 --> 00:55:36.210 align:middle line:10%
And, you know, they're
confirming so much more now

00:55:36.210 --> 00:55:37.240 align:middle line:10%
than they've ever done.

00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:38.040 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:41.220 align:middle line:10%
>>GILLETTE: Because we're ready
to understand the concepts

00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:44.150 align:middle line:10%
and the precepts of
who we really are--

00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.950 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:46.265 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --and the
power within that.

00:55:46.265 --> 00:55:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:48.061 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So it's
an exciting time.

00:55:48.061 --> 00:55:49.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we
covered a lot of ground.

00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:50.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Oh, good.

00:55:50.290 --> 00:55:51.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad to hear it.

00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:53.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you'll have
to watch the interview when it

00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:53.650 align:middle line:90%
comes out--

00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:54.025 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:54.025 --> 00:55:54.680 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: I will.

00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:55.530 align:middle line:90%
I definitely will.

00:55:55.530 --> 00:55:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and see
what we talked about.

00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: I don't
remember, so I--

00:55:57.700 --> 00:55:59.400 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:01.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, well, Sheila,
until next time then,

00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:04.004 align:middle line:84%
thank you so much for
being here with us.

00:56:04.004 --> 00:56:05.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Oh,
it's such pleasure

00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:06.560 align:middle line:90%
to see you again, Regina.

00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:08.754 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for inviting me.

00:56:08.754 --> 00:56:11.420 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: To have direct contact
with the Theo Group and Sheila,

you can start by going to
Sheila's website, asktheo.com.

Until next time, thank you for
joining me here on Open Minds.
