00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Earth was designed
to be a living library.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.920 align:middle line:84%
It was supposed to be a planet
where they were taking genetics

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.080 align:middle line:84%
from all kinds of
different star systems

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.970 align:middle line:84%
and combining them
into one planet

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.140 align:middle line:90%
to see what would happen.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.970 align:middle line:84%
What people don't
realize is actually

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.780 align:middle line:84%
the human race were a composite
of 22 different star races.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.040 align:middle line:90%
It could be more than that.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.040 align:middle line:84%
>> And sometimes I think
a lesson that we all need

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.689 align:middle line:90%
to learn is that--

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.760 align:middle line:84%
especially here on
Earth that not everybody

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.470 align:middle line:84%
is coming in with
the same perspective

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.620 align:middle line:90%
or the same agendas.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>> George Washington
actually received visions,

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.140 align:middle line:84%
and he actually was visited
by Pleiadian beings.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.000 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
don't realize that.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.780 align:middle line:84%
The whole concept of our
Declaration of Independence

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.090 align:middle line:84%
and our Bill of
Rights actually was

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.550 align:middle line:90%
downloaded from the Pleiadians.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.440 align:middle line:84%
The cautionary tale
that we've learned

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.180 align:middle line:84%
from all these
other star systems

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.580 align:middle line:84%
is that you always have
to have the spirituality

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.755 align:middle line:84%
integrated into it in order to
have a higher level society.

00:01:06.755 --> 00:01:11.300 align:middle line:90%


00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.790 align:middle line:10%
>> Debbie Solaris has
ignited the imagination

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.580 align:middle line:10%
of our community with her
stories of the back history

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.010 align:middle line:10%
of our planet from a
Galactic point of view.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.280 align:middle line:84%
In this view, we're all
hybrids of one kind or another,

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.400 align:middle line:84%
and those influences
affect us to this day.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.567 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back, Debbie.

00:01:26.567 --> 00:01:27.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you for having me back.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.817 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be here.

00:01:28.817 --> 00:01:29.850 align:middle line:90%
>> You're very popular.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.670 align:middle line:84%
People love hearing
about-- everyone

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.837 align:middle line:84%
loves hearing about themselves,
and their neighbors,

00:01:33.837 --> 00:01:35.962 align:middle line:84%
and the people they love,
and the people they hate.

00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:36.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:37.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.610 align:middle line:84%
>> And so I think that this
story particularly gets us

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.460 align:middle line:84%
because I think we're all
trying at a point in time,

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.640 align:middle line:84%
where we're beginning to
wake up again to understand

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.680 align:middle line:90%
we're connected with our cosmos.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And of course, then all
the stories out of military

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.930 align:middle line:84%
and otherwise regarding
exposure and contact

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.880 align:middle line:84%
with aliens and
ETs of all kinds.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're
just starting to say,

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:59.990 align:middle line:90%
am I in this story somewhere?

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.920 align:middle line:90%
And you say, yes.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, absolutely.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.770 align:middle line:10%
I think the thing that
we're all exploring nowadays

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.650 align:middle line:10%
is our connection with
the greater cosmos

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.270 align:middle line:10%
and how that plays a part,
even with us personally.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>> I think so.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.653 align:middle line:84%
I mean, historically,
when you're just

00:02:14.653 --> 00:02:17.585 align:middle line:84%
trying to survive, just plow
the land, and you're tired

00:02:17.585 --> 00:02:19.460 align:middle line:84%
and you have dinner and
fall in bed at night,

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.283 align:middle line:84%
you don't really
contemplate these things.

00:02:21.283 --> 00:02:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And we're at a
point in time where

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.580 align:middle line:84%
there's enough luxury of
extra time and humanity

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.190 align:middle line:84%
that we actually can
contemplate these things.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and I think even
since COVID has-- yeah.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Even more so.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.870 align:middle line:10%
You've noticed that?

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:33.720 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.670 align:middle line:10%
>> In your practice?

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:35.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.525 align:middle line:84%
>> Cause people call you to
get personal readings to help

00:02:37.525 --> 00:02:38.573 align:middle line:90%
figure out who they are.

00:02:38.573 --> 00:02:39.740 align:middle line:90%
What they're connected with.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say my input of
reading bookings have increased

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.710 align:middle line:90%
exponentially since COVID.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:47.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, people are
more introverted.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.670 align:middle line:84%
They're looking more into who
they are, what life's about,

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.630 align:middle line:84%
and what they want to
do and not do anymore.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>> So let's start--

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.970 align:middle line:84%
I know we're going to
cover a little bit of what

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.380 align:middle line:84%
we did before, but what
happened last time is

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.170 align:middle line:84%
we only got halfway through what
I wanted to talk to you about.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So now we're
doing the other half,

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.220 align:middle line:84%
but we have to still fill
a little back story in.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Here, we're beginning
with the human race on Lyra.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.620 align:middle line:84%
So let's set the stage
for the human race.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the reason
why Lyra and Vega--

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.190 align:middle line:84%
so Vega being a star within
the Lyra constellation--

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.710 align:middle line:84%
was so important
was because that

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.420 align:middle line:84%
was the home of
human consciousness.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.550 align:middle line:84%
That's where
everything began as far

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.780 align:middle line:84%
as our physicality in our galaxy
and actually in our universe

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.100 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.650 align:middle line:84%
So when the co-creators decided
to create a physical reality,

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.080 align:middle line:84%
they created it in
the Lyra system,

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.060 align:middle line:84%
and they used the god-template,
which is the Father God

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.350 align:middle line:84%
consciousness and Mother Goddess
consciousness template in order

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:54.500 align:middle line:84%
to create this split between the
two different types of energies

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.040 align:middle line:84%
within this particular
system in order

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.490 align:middle line:84%
to create this new
experiment into the descent

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.500 align:middle line:90%
into physicality.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.240 align:middle line:84%
So my understanding with Lyra
is that most of the Lyran system

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.730 align:middle line:84%
was Father God
consciousness oriented

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.960 align:middle line:84%
with Vega being the outlier
with the Mother Goddess

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.230 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And so you had two
different human races

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.750 align:middle line:84%
that were created
in the Lyran system.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.520 align:middle line:84%
So Lyra had mostly
the kind of what they

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.270 align:middle line:90%
call the Nordic white Lyrans.

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.930 align:middle line:84%
Vega had more the blue
skinned darker beings that

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.180 align:middle line:84%
were more of the Mother Goddess
consciousness representation,

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.970 align:middle line:84%
but yes, Lyra
played a huge part,

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.520 align:middle line:84%
and it was where
our story began.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>> And when you read some
accounts, for example,

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.505 align:middle line:84%
of the beings that were in
Atlantis, we go back to the--

00:04:49.505 --> 00:04:51.380 align:middle line:84%
because here you're
talking about the Lyrans,

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.880 align:middle line:90%
the original beings.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.150 align:middle line:84%
People here being 12
feet tall, 400 to 500

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.950 align:middle line:90%
pounds, very large in stature.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.600 align:middle line:84%
I've even gone
back in regressions

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.130 align:middle line:90%
and seen this myself.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.890 align:middle line:84%
But also the color
of skin on Atlantis.

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.710 align:middle line:84%
There were supposedly
said to be people

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.990 align:middle line:84%
that had white skin,
red skin, blue skin--

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.060 align:middle line:90%
>> All kinds of color.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Powder white
skin, black skin.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.640 align:middle line:84%
So we were a very mixed race
from the very beginning.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.420 align:middle line:84%
>> And this had to do
with this hybridization

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:22.220 align:middle line:90%
and the influence.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.950 align:middle line:84%
So talk about that a
little bit in principle

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.850 align:middle line:84%
about Atlantis and Lemuria and
these hybrid programs and how

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:30.650 align:middle line:90%
they--

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.692 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what
originated most of the races.

00:05:32.692 --> 00:05:33.492 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:05:33.492 --> 00:05:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>> The differentiation in the
races is genetic hybridization

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.340 align:middle line:90%
from aliens.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.280 align:middle line:84%
This is something
I talk about a lot,

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.500 align:middle line:90%
even when I do Akashic readings.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.880 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people think that, oh,
humans came from Adam and Eve.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, Adam and Eve
was just an allegory.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.410 align:middle line:84%
it was just an allegorical
story explaining

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.630 align:middle line:84%
the beginning of
creation in our galaxy,

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.210 align:middle line:84%
but it's not really--
there's not really

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't think a being
that's called Adam and Eve.

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there-- they
were just representations

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.090 align:middle line:90%
of Lyra and Vega.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:03.600 align:middle line:84%
At least that's
the way I see it.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.960 align:middle line:84%
So even some of the biblical
stories that explain creation

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.803 align:middle line:84%
explain it in a way
that's more allegorical.

00:06:11.803 --> 00:06:12.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it has to be.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.345 align:middle line:84%
You just get down to
some of the basics

00:06:14.345 --> 00:06:19.340 align:middle line:84%
like, where did Adam and Eve's
sons find their wives anyway?

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.360 align:middle line:90%
They're the only people.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that story
falls apart really fast.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:23.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it does.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.920 align:middle line:84%
>> So you have to
take it as allegory.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.300 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you can't take
it literal for sure.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.130 align:middle line:84%
But actually what
was really happening

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.130 align:middle line:84%
was Earth was designed
to be a living library.

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:38.360 align:middle line:84%
It was supposed to be a planet
where they were taking genetics

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.490 align:middle line:84%
from all kinds of
different star systems

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.380 align:middle line:84%
and combining them
into one planet

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.950 align:middle line:90%
to see what would happen.

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:47.540 align:middle line:84%
So what would happen if we put
in all these different genetics

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.880 align:middle line:84%
from this star system
or that star system

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.240 align:middle line:90%
or whatever star system?

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.870 align:middle line:84%
But what people don't
realize is actually

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:56.990 align:middle line:84%
the human race were a
composite of 22 different star

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.260 align:middle line:90%
races at least.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.060 align:middle line:90%
At least.

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.390 align:middle line:84%
I would say-- usually
I hear the number 22,

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.710 align:middle line:90%
but it could be more than that.

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.360 align:middle line:84%
But these are beings that
were visiting Earth long

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.420 align:middle line:90%
before Atlantis and Lemuria.

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.090 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis and Lemuria were
just another experiment.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:16.700 align:middle line:84%
It was just-- so
you had beings that

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.890 align:middle line:84%
were coming from Andromeda,
beings that were coming

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:21.470 align:middle line:84%
from Sirius, beings that
were coming from Arcturus

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:22.400 align:middle line:90%
or the Pleiades.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.040 align:middle line:90%
And all of them, they--

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.150 align:middle line:84%
because of their
physicality was different,

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:33.740 align:middle line:84%
they used their genetics
to combine and create

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.560 align:middle line:90%
this new composite human race.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And so you had all kinds
of different skin tones

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.180 align:middle line:84%
because where these
beings would come from,

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.530 align:middle line:84%
they came from very
different physical realities

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:49.010 align:middle line:90%
and physical environments.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.135 align:middle line:84%
>> They would adapt certain
colors of skin to those

00:07:51.135 --> 00:07:51.935 align:middle line:90%
environments.

00:07:51.935 --> 00:07:52.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, exactly.

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:58.310 align:middle line:84%
>> So maybe you had read
beings that came from Antares,

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:01.670 align:middle line:84%
or you had blue beings
that came from Andromeda,

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:05.870 align:middle line:84%
or light blue skin
that came from Sirius.

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:09.650 align:middle line:84%
So all of those are going to
play a part in what humans

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:12.110 align:middle line:90%
ended up looking like.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:13.850 align:middle line:90%
I know with Andromeda--

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:16.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use Andromeda
as an example here.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.650 align:middle line:84%
There were some
beings from Andromeda

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:22.970 align:middle line:84%
that looked very Asian, and
Andromeda had many colonies

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:24.860 align:middle line:90%
in Southeast Asia.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:29.120 align:middle line:84%
So because Andromedans
tend to look more similar,

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.520 align:middle line:84%
that's why you see
Asian people that

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.340 align:middle line:84%
look very similar, as
opposed to say Europeans

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.470 align:middle line:90%
that have more diversity.

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:38.240 align:middle line:90%
So that could also play a part.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.409 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I think so.

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And I find that very rich and
interesting in our history

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:47.010 align:middle line:84%
because that means it has a
lot of subtext psychologically,

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:48.860 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the
influences and the way

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.920 align:middle line:84%
cultures organize
themselves on this planet.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And we're all very different in
different parts of the world.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And so I mean some
people I don't

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.220 align:middle line:84%
know why feel threatened
by that notion,

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.620 align:middle line:84%
but I find it
absolutely fascinating,

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.660 align:middle line:84%
and it makes us all
the more interesting

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:06.993 align:middle line:90%
a species personally.

00:09:06.993 --> 00:09:08.660 align:middle line:84%
Can I ask you a quick
personal question?

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:09.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, sure.

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:11.060 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, not personal but
something you just touched

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.100 align:middle line:84%
on because people don't
really talk about it--

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.840 align:middle line:90%
Antares.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.580 align:middle line:84%
We haven't talked
about it either.

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:18.810 align:middle line:90%
Can we just take a moment?

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:19.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>> It's for a reason because
I've read some documents,

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:24.150 align:middle line:84%
and the author uses
the name Antares,

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:26.820 align:middle line:84%
and they're-- it's the most
sublime things I've ever read.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.730 align:middle line:84%
So tell us about
Ontaris for a moment.

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:33.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually Antares is a
very important star system

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:35.350 align:middle line:90%
in our galaxy.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:38.910 align:middle line:84%
It's actually located in the
constellation of Scorpio,

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:41.880 align:middle line:84%
and it's one out of
two major stargates

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.990 align:middle line:84%
that's in our galaxy, the
other one being Arcturus.

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:50.520 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of times you hear of
the Antares-Arcturus midway

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:56.010 align:middle line:84%
station because these two
stargates play off each other.

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:59.880 align:middle line:84%
But what Antares was
as opposed to Arcturus,

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:04.650 align:middle line:84%
Antares was the point where the
beings from Andromeda galaxy,

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:07.470 align:middle line:84%
the co-creator
beings that started

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:09.270 align:middle line:84%
this whole experiment
in our galaxy,

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:11.160 align:middle line:90%
came in through that stargate.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.720 align:middle line:84%
So they're actually a portal
between Andromeda galaxy

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.670 align:middle line:90%
and the Milky Way.

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:21.120 align:middle line:84%
So you had these very
higher dimensional beings

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.320 align:middle line:90%
that came through the stargate.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, Antares also has
their own star race.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.512 align:middle line:84%
They've since ascended, and
they're very high dimensional,

00:10:31.512 --> 00:10:33.720 align:middle line:84%
so I don't even think they're
in physicality anymore.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:37.950 align:middle line:84%
But those beings look
like mantis beings, so--

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:39.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:41.490 align:middle line:84%
--they're more
insectoid, and they

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:44.970 align:middle line:84%
were considered to be the
gatekeepers of the stargate

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:46.780 align:middle line:90%
that I was mentioning.

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And so these beings-- because
Antares is a red star system,

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:53.010 align:middle line:90%
they had a reddish tone to them.

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And these beings
were also visiting

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.700 align:middle line:84%
Earth in the beginning
of Earth's history,

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:01.680 align:middle line:84%
so we have even some genetics
here on Earth from Antares.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:04.230 align:middle line:90%
Now, we need to go back.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:08.390 align:middle line:84%
Because the Lyran story
leads to the Draconian story.

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:09.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:12.340 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's go into that, into
the Pleiades because we've got

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:13.140 align:middle line:90%
to get to--

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:16.992 align:middle line:84%
God, we have a lot to get
to, a lot of other places.

00:11:16.992 --> 00:11:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And we're also
talking a little bit

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:21.270 align:middle line:84%
about the reptilian species,
which is always a fascination.

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:23.430 align:middle line:84%
Let's start with the
Draconian part of the story.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:28.590 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so Lyra was a beautiful
paradise star system.

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:30.330 align:middle line:84%
They had beautiful
paradise planets.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.400 align:middle line:84%
They existed for
thousands of years.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.390 align:middle line:84%
They went through
their own evolution.

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:37.170 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people think
that, oh, Lyra was created,

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:39.300 align:middle line:84%
and boom, they got
destroyed by Draco,

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.670 align:middle line:84%
but it actually took thousands
and thousands of years

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:43.620 align:middle line:90%
before they got to that point.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.380 align:middle line:84%
The Draconian started
getting interested in Lyra

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:49.590 align:middle line:84%
because they were looking for
resources because they didn't

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:53.130 align:middle line:84%
have much resources in
their particular star

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:54.180 align:middle line:90%
system of Draco.

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:55.860 align:middle line:90%
Draco was quite barren.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And they actually came--
they're a race of beings

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.423 align:middle line:84%
that came from a
different universe,

00:12:00.423 --> 00:12:02.340 align:middle line:84%
and that's another thing
people don't realize.

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:06.250 align:middle line:84%
Is that they have existed
for billions of years,

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:08.010 align:middle line:84%
even before they came
to the Milky Way.

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:10.650 align:middle line:84%
So they had really
advanced technologies.

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:13.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they were even
beyond the other beings

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.850 align:middle line:90%
here in this galaxy.

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:17.697 align:middle line:84%
So they saw Lyra,
and they said, wow,

00:12:17.697 --> 00:12:19.530 align:middle line:84%
they got-- they're
really rich in resources.

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:25.920 align:middle line:84%
We're going to just
take over their system.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't have
any regard because they

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:31.140 align:middle line:84%
were self-serving type of
beings for the most part,

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:34.043 align:middle line:84%
and I wouldn't say every
single reptilian is bad.

00:12:34.043 --> 00:12:36.460 align:middle line:84%
I think we're going to talk
about that a little bit later.

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:42.000 align:middle line:84%
But for example, there is
different castes systems

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.440 align:middle line:90%
within the reptilians.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.800 align:middle line:90%
So the dragons were not as bad.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.480 align:middle line:84%
They were more
neutral, but then you

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.540 align:middle line:84%
had the warrior caste
beings that were constantly

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.480 align:middle line:84%
in a rivalry with
the dragon beings,

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.060 align:middle line:90%
so they wanted to be top tier.

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And so they felt
like, hey, if we

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:01.890 align:middle line:84%
start conquering all
these different systems

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:05.760 align:middle line:84%
in this galaxy, we're going
to become the top tier beings.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.640 align:middle line:90%
We're going to be the top dog.

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.590 align:middle line:84%
So they decided to
start off with Lyra

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:14.220 align:middle line:84%
because Lyra was located
right next door to Draco.

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:19.290 align:middle line:84%
It was very close, and they saw
all these wonderful resources

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:22.180 align:middle line:84%
and thought, well, we can
sure use those resources,

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.750 align:middle line:84%
and so that's what started
the Lyra Draconian wars.

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is what we've
talked about before.

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:30.090 align:middle line:84%
We've touched on, and that
is just because a species

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:32.010 align:middle line:84%
is technologically
advanced does not mean

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:33.388 align:middle line:90%
they're spiritually developed.

00:13:33.388 --> 00:13:34.680 align:middle line:90%
These are two different things.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:38.250 align:middle line:84%
Two different frequency
bands, agendas, et cetera.

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes,
we confuse those,

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.150 align:middle line:84%
and people,
especially humans, can

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:45.750 align:middle line:84%
be quite dazzled by the
technological part of things

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:49.347 align:middle line:84%
and be swayed away from the
spiritual aspect of ourselves.

00:13:49.347 --> 00:13:51.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's what
happened to the Lyrans.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.880 align:middle line:84%
They saw all this technology
that the Draconians had,

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:57.930 align:middle line:84%
and they were bamboozled
by all the technology.

00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:00.780 align:middle line:84%
Like thinking, wow, we could
use some of that technology.

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.825 align:middle line:84%
Maybe if we become friends with
these beings, which was a--

00:14:03.825 --> 00:14:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>> They don't make friends.

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:06.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, they
don't make friends.

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:07.620 align:middle line:90%
No, they don't.

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:13.080 align:middle line:84%
No, they don't make friends,
but they were naive.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.430 align:middle line:84%
They thought hey-- because they
were not as developed as these

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:19.340 align:middle line:90%
being, so they wanted to--

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:22.400 align:middle line:84%
they thought, hey, if we have
some sort of treaty with them,

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.787 align:middle line:84%
we'll be able to share
resources with each other,

00:14:24.787 --> 00:14:27.120 align:middle line:84%
but that wasn't what the
Draconians wanted to do at all.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.240 align:middle line:90%
They just wanted to take over.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>> It's interesting because it
just popped into my head that

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:35.580 align:middle line:84%
famous line in the Bible,
"and the meek shall inherit

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:36.380 align:middle line:90%
the Earth."

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And that people have looked at
that so many different ways,

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:41.360 align:middle line:84%
but when you look
at it galactically

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:46.220 align:middle line:84%
and you look at the Lyrans, for
example, and the Draconians,

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:49.280 align:middle line:84%
you start seeing it in
a different light, which

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:53.240 align:middle line:84%
is a gentleness of spirit
or perhaps maybe a higher

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.520 align:middle line:84%
spiritual development,
which by nature tends

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:56.630 align:middle line:90%
to be more passive.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:57.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:00.050 align:middle line:84%
>> And so that's
kind of interesting--

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:01.810 align:middle line:90%
as to what ends up happening.

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:05.037 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but unfortunately
the Draconians were from

00:15:05.037 --> 00:15:07.370 align:middle line:84%
a different consciousness
because they weren't even from

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:08.660 align:middle line:90%
our universe.

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:11.210 align:middle line:84%
So they had a whole
different perspective

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:15.020 align:middle line:84%
on things than, say, the
Lyrans or the other star races.

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:16.760 align:middle line:90%
So that would have a play.

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I think
a lesson that we all

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:20.720 align:middle line:90%
need to learn that--

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.760 align:middle line:84%
especially here on
Earth that not everybody

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.500 align:middle line:84%
is coming in with
the same perspective

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.270 align:middle line:90%
or the same agendas.

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:28.490 align:middle line:90%
We're not all the same, and--

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:30.630 align:middle line:84%
>> We're all learning
different ranges of lessons.

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:31.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:33.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:37.610 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's the backdrop, and
then we have the Pleiadians.

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:39.290 align:middle line:90%
I put down here trying to--

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:41.720 align:middle line:84%
they ultimately tried
to separate themselves

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.577 align:middle line:90%
from the Lyran ancestors.

00:15:43.577 --> 00:15:46.160 align:middle line:84%
So let's get into the Pleiadians
story because a lot of people

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.390 align:middle line:90%
relate to Pleiadians.

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:48.740 align:middle line:90%
People love Pleiadians.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.087 align:middle line:90%
>> Pleiadians, yeah.

00:15:50.087 --> 00:15:51.170 align:middle line:90%
>> We all love Pleiadians.

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:51.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:56.090 align:middle line:84%
And why were they trying to
separate from the Lyran trauma?

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:59.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's a great story.

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think Lyssa
Royal Holt alluded

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:05.840 align:middle line:84%
to this in her book,
"The Prism of Lyra,"

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.340 align:middle line:84%
which is one of
my favorite books.

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:13.590 align:middle line:84%
But I think what happened
in the Pleiades was

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:17.790 align:middle line:84%
the Pleiades was located 500
light years away from Lyra,

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:22.230 align:middle line:84%
so the Lyrans that were
escaping the system

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:24.420 align:middle line:84%
headed towards the
Pleiades because they

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:27.070 align:middle line:84%
were trying to get as far
away from Draco as possible,

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:29.648 align:middle line:84%
and this was a very
far off star system.

00:16:29.648 --> 00:16:32.190 align:middle line:84%
Even when you look at the night
sky and you see the Pleiades,

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:33.570 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they look far away.

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:34.370 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they're--

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:35.912 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could
see like a little--

00:16:35.912 --> 00:16:38.460 align:middle line:84%
you can see it with the naked
eye, but it's not that bright.

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:42.900 align:middle line:84%
But they were heading to
the Pleiades, so by the time

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:46.200 align:middle line:84%
they got there, they've gone
through a lot of trauma.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.970 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was not an easy trip.

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:50.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it took years
to get to the Pleiades.

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:55.280 align:middle line:84%
So I think they were so
traumatized that they

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.930 align:middle line:90%
wanted just to start over.

00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:59.000 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to
reinvent themselves.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.640 align:middle line:84%
They just wanted to
have a new identity.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And so they called
themselves Pleiadians.

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:08.300 align:middle line:84%
They created a whole
new civilization.

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:11.559 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want to be attached
to their Lyran ancestor trauma

00:17:11.559 --> 00:17:12.359 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And so they started looking
very much into love and light.

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:19.160 align:middle line:90%
It was all about the positive.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And this is I think the
cautionary tale of how

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.030 align:middle line:84%
sometimes even looking
at love and light,

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:28.190 align:middle line:84%
which leads to
spiritual bypassing--

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:31.820 align:middle line:84%
when you're only looking at the
light and not the dark aspects

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.940 align:middle line:84%
of life, that can also
be just as damaging

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:36.830 align:middle line:90%
as only looking at the dark.

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And so the Pleiadians
had gotten so

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:44.180 align:middle line:84%
pollyannaish with
their approach to life

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.410 align:middle line:90%
that it really hurt them.

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And they too fell into I think
some inner psyche work, where

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:57.260 align:middle line:84%
they had to look at the
dark aspects of themselves

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.690 align:middle line:84%
in order to survive
as a civilization.

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:05.960 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise how can you
live in a physical reality

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.740 align:middle line:84%
if you're only looking at
light aspects and not at dark?

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:14.240 align:middle line:84%
Because we live in a
duality type of situation,

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:17.300 align:middle line:84%
usually in this
particular universe.

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.468 align:middle line:84%
We're free will-- is it's
a free will universe.

00:18:19.468 --> 00:18:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the Earth is living in
a dimension between the light

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:25.040 align:middle line:84%
and dark, and depending on
where you are personally,

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.290 align:middle line:84%
you can resonate with
either side at any given--

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:28.560 align:middle line:90%
on any given day even.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:29.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.193 align:middle line:90%
And the same thing--

00:18:30.193 --> 00:18:32.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot of
people don't realize

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:36.290 align:middle line:84%
that the Pleiadians went
through their own evolution.

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:38.000 align:middle line:84%
So they went through
a similar evolution

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.740 align:middle line:84%
that we did here
on Earth, so they

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:41.738 align:middle line:84%
had to go through
all the same lessons.

00:18:41.738 --> 00:18:43.280 align:middle line:84%
So that's why now,
they're showing up

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.500 align:middle line:84%
here on Earth as our
teachers and guides

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.730 align:middle line:84%
because they've gone
through all this already.

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:50.270 align:middle line:90%
But these beings were--

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:51.800 align:middle line:90%
I think just--

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:55.400 align:middle line:84%
I think they were
just so traumatized

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:59.030 align:middle line:84%
from the wars their
ancestors have gone through,

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:00.020 align:middle line:90%
a lot of trauma.

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:02.180 align:middle line:84%
And then we even see
now with Pleiadians,

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:05.960 align:middle line:84%
where in Pleiadian
starseeds that they

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.000 align:middle line:84%
carry some of the trauma
signatures in their own DNA.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.720 align:middle line:84%
So if they're in situations
even here on Earth--

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:14.817 align:middle line:84%
let's say you're a
Pleiadians starseed,

00:19:14.817 --> 00:19:17.150 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have some
physical issues that might pop

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:19.220 align:middle line:84%
up if you're not taking
good care of yourself,

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:22.250 align:middle line:84%
if you're not on the
right track with--

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:25.520 align:middle line:84%
maybe if you're undergoing a lot
of stress or a lot of trauma,

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:29.030 align:middle line:84%
those same old Lyran
trauma signatures

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:30.000 align:middle line:90%
are going to show up.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.330 align:middle line:84%
>> So have you found when
you're working with people,

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:35.210 align:middle line:84%
depending on the
hybrid type they are,

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:38.400 align:middle line:84%
that there are particular types
of ailments that certain hybrid

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.200 align:middle line:90%
types carry?

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely.

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:40.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, really?

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:46.020 align:middle line:84%
So what would a Pleiadian
pattern of unwell or ill health

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:46.820 align:middle line:90%
be?

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:48.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that would-- that's--

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:51.720 align:middle line:84%
we can go into a lot of
deep stuff with that.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:55.370 align:middle line:84%
But what I see a
lot with Pleiadian

00:19:55.370 --> 00:20:01.580 align:middle line:84%
influenced humans is that a
lot of them when they undergo

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:05.810 align:middle line:84%
a lot of stress or they go
through trauma in their life,

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:08.000 align:middle line:84%
they tend to have
blood sugar issues.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.810 align:middle line:84%
So I see a lot of
Pleiadian starseeds

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:16.340 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of Pleiadian people
that struggle with hypoglycemia

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:20.390 align:middle line:90%
or prediabetes or diabetes.

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:24.170 align:middle line:84%
Because Pleiadians are
very empathic people.

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:26.240 align:middle line:84%
They pick up on other
people's energies.

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:30.530 align:middle line:84%
And so when they're not
feeling really good--

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:31.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Reach for sugar.

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:32.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Reach for sugar.

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, to sweeten
everything back up.

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And we have chemical cascades
in our bodies that go with it,

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:39.345 align:middle line:84%
but you're saying that's
part of their nature

00:20:39.345 --> 00:20:41.610 align:middle line:84%
is to try to balance it
with something sweet.

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:42.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:43.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Going back to
what they remember.

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:44.750 align:middle line:90%
>> They remember.

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:47.840 align:middle line:84%
Because Pleiades was such a
high-dimensional star system

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.580 align:middle line:84%
that everything
was perfect there.

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:52.940 align:middle line:84%
It was-- at least that's
what they evolved to.

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:56.930 align:middle line:84%
On a mental level, you see a lot
of Pleiadians that fall into--

00:20:56.930 --> 00:21:03.080 align:middle line:84%
or Pleiadian starseeds that fall
into co-dependent relationships

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:07.010 align:middle line:84%
because they always
see the best in people.

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:08.480 align:middle line:90%
They always love--

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.355 align:middle line:90%
>> Hard to miss.

00:21:09.355 --> 00:21:10.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, they're
always like, oh,

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:12.470 align:middle line:84%
I see the potential
in that person.

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:14.960 align:middle line:84%
Like just-- want to-- if
they just love them enough,

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.010 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
become great people.

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And so they fall into these
really unhealthy relationships,

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:22.100 align:middle line:84%
until they get well
integrated themselves,

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:23.730 align:middle line:90%
and then they figure it out.

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:24.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:28.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, continuing on that,
we go to George Washington.

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.530 align:middle line:84%
It said that he communicated
with Pleiadians.

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:33.350 align:middle line:84%
They gave him some
visions for the future.

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:35.700 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to go
into John Adams as well

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.060 align:middle line:84%
and the American
flag, so take it away.

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:40.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I love this story.

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:43.460 align:middle line:84%
I love that our country,
the United States,

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:46.550 align:middle line:84%
was so influenced
by extraterrestrials

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:49.400 align:middle line:84%
that there was a reason why
the United States was created.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:54.690 align:middle line:84%
Was to create this
Democratic free country

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:58.600 align:middle line:84%
on our planet to be a
model for other countries.

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:03.030 align:middle line:84%
So I just love this story,
but George Washington actually

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:04.770 align:middle line:84%
received visions,
and he actually

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:07.380 align:middle line:90%
was visited by Pleiadian beings.

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.250 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
don't realize that.

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:13.830 align:middle line:84%
But the whole concept of our
Declaration of Independence

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:16.110 align:middle line:84%
and our Bill of
Rights actually was

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:18.180 align:middle line:90%
downloaded from the Pleiadians.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:20.220 align:middle line:84%
Because these were systems
that they were using

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:23.430 align:middle line:90%
in their own civilization.

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Well-structured societies
that had been refined

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:28.440 align:middle line:84%
to the point where those
principles actually worked

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:31.200 align:middle line:84%
because the consciousness
of the people was there.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly, yeah.

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.670 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's what I find so
exciting about this story.

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:38.610 align:middle line:84%
Is that our United
States was actually

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:42.510 align:middle line:84%
influenced by these beautiful
beings from the Pleiades

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:44.280 align:middle line:84%
and maybe from
even other systems.

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:48.030 align:middle line:84%
But the cute story
I want to tell

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:50.400 align:middle line:84%
about John Adams and
the American flag

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:56.490 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the way the
American flag was designed.

00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:58.800 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people think
that the 13 stars

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:02.880 align:middle line:84%
represented the 13 colonies
in the original American flag.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.770 align:middle line:84%
Actually, that couldn't
be further from the truth.

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:10.860 align:middle line:84%
My understanding is that
John Adams put 13 stars

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:13.170 align:middle line:84%
because it represented
the 13 stars

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:15.240 align:middle line:84%
within the Lyran
system, which was

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:18.720 align:middle line:90%
the home of human consciousness.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.420 align:middle line:84%
>> And we have to remember
a lot of these fellows were

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:22.650 align:middle line:90%
Freemasons of their day.

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:23.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly, yeah.

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:28.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so these-- so John
Adams and the other founding

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:31.830 align:middle line:84%
fathers of our country,
they knew star systems.

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:33.720 align:middle line:84%
>> They understood
occult science.

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>> So they knew that certain
star systems carried certain

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:42.900 align:middle line:84%
energies, and they wanted to
represent these energies within

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:44.470 align:middle line:90%
the founding of our country.

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:46.470 align:middle line:84%
So the 13 stars
actually represents

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:52.330 align:middle line:84%
the constellation of Lyra, and
I think that's how it started.

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And then as we added, of course,
more states, the flag expanded.

00:23:57.630 --> 00:24:02.550 align:middle line:84%
But even the colors, I think,
represent certain star systems.

00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:03.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:04.830 align:middle line:90%
I find that fascinating.

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:07.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm wondering-- and maybe
somebody in the audience can

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:08.550 align:middle line:90%
write us and tell--

00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:10.380 align:middle line:84%
how they may have
been influenced

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:14.490 align:middle line:84%
by the work of Francis Bacon
because of his deep occult

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:17.040 align:middle line:84%
knowledge and understanding
and his writing of the book

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:19.080 align:middle line:90%
"America, the New Atlantis."

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.480 align:middle line:84%
So I'm guessing that
there must have been--

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.030 align:middle line:84%
he must have also had some
of that knowledge woven

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:28.850 align:middle line:84%
into his education,
esoteric education.

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:32.630 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's go on to Sirius;
the Sirian colonization

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:34.610 align:middle line:84%
and the Sirian beings
because here we're

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:38.250 align:middle line:84%
talking about technology coming
back into the picture again

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:42.950 align:middle line:84%
but also they were highly
influential in the Egyptian--

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:46.190 align:middle line:84%
that chapter of our human
history, so let's go for it.

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:50.000 align:middle line:10%
>> So Sirius, because it's
located so close to Earth--

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.200 align:middle line:10%
so Sirius, at least Sirius A,
is only about eight light years

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.960 align:middle line:10%
from Earth, so that's
relatively close.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:00.230 align:middle line:84%
I think the only star
system that's closer

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:05.240 align:middle line:84%
is probably Alpha Centauri,
which is 3.7 light years away,

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.930 align:middle line:90%
but Sirius is pretty close.

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And so the Sirian
beings, which comprised

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:12.350 align:middle line:84%
of many different
types of beings--

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:15.830 align:middle line:84%
so it wasn't just humanoids
that were on Sirius.

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:17.450 align:middle line:90%
They had cat beings.

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:19.040 align:middle line:90%
They had fish people.

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.200 align:middle line:90%
They had reptilians.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they had
elemental beings.

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:24.680 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they had bird beings.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:28.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was quite a
bit of diversity in Sirius.

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:32.330 align:middle line:84%
Cause Sirius I think after
the Lyran Draconian wars,

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:34.370 align:middle line:84%
all of these beings
were escaping the wars,

00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:36.890 align:middle line:84%
and even reptilians
were escaping the wars,

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:39.290 align:middle line:90%
so they all converged in Sirius.

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:41.750 align:middle line:84%
So Sirius had a
lot of diversity.

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And so you get all these
different types of beings that

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:47.300 align:middle line:84%
come together in one
star system or even

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.340 align:middle line:84%
just three different star
systems because there

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:54.410 align:middle line:84%
is Sirius A, B, and C. And
that's going to create I

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:58.340 align:middle line:84%
think a lot of evolution
within their society.

00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:01.850 align:middle line:84%
So they became very
technologically advanced.

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And Sirius, my
understanding with what

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:07.460 align:middle line:84%
I see in the Akashic Records
is they were very focused

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:10.040 align:middle line:84%
in technology
because they didn't

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:12.860 align:middle line:84%
want to go through
another Lyran situation.

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:17.360 align:middle line:84%
They knew that in order for them
to survive as physical beings,

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.090 align:middle line:84%
they had to have that
higher level technology.

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:22.670 align:middle line:84%
So their big focus
was on technology

00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:25.580 align:middle line:84%
for I would say generations,
until they started

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:27.558 align:middle line:84%
becoming more esoteric
and spiritual,

00:26:27.558 --> 00:26:29.600 align:middle line:84%
and then they developed
a Sirian mystery schools,

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:32.390 align:middle line:90%
and that's a whole other story.

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:35.030 align:middle line:84%
But the Sirians were visiting
Earth during this time

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:37.220 align:middle line:84%
because they had starships,
and they were curious.

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And they were beings that
knowledge meant a lot to them,

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:43.790 align:middle line:90%
collecting information.

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And so they were visiting
Earth quite a bit,

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:48.650 align:middle line:90%
and they colonized Earth.

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:52.400 align:middle line:84%
So Earth is heavily influenced
from Sirius from the beginning

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:56.990 align:middle line:84%
but especially in certain
civilizations like Atlantis

00:26:56.990 --> 00:27:00.290 align:middle line:84%
and Lemuria and even
Egypt, especially Egypt.

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And what-- was there a
dominance of one of the races

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:06.950 align:middle line:90%
there that was coming to Earth?

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:08.848 align:middle line:84%
I mean, was it mostly
reptilians or was it--

00:27:08.848 --> 00:27:10.640 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say it was
a combination of all.

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:11.750 align:middle line:90%
>> A combination of all of them.

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:13.310 align:middle line:84%
Again, back to the
story of Atlantis

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:15.500 align:middle line:84%
of all these different colors
of skin and types of people.

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I think it was like--

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:18.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was
reptilians showing up.

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:19.850 align:middle line:90%
There was humanoids.

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:23.720 align:middle line:84%
There was-- the normal
people were visiting Africa--

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:24.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Aquatic people, yeah.

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:26.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Aquatic people, yeah.

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:29.420 align:middle line:84%
So the Nommo people
are the aquatic beings

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:31.130 align:middle line:90%
that are amphibian.

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:34.220 align:middle line:84%
They look like mermaids
or a lot of people

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:36.960 align:middle line:84%
refer to them as mermaids, but
they're not really mermaids.

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:40.430 align:middle line:84%
They're like half
fish half human.

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And so they were
visiting Africa,

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:45.800 align:middle line:84%
and they had a big influence
on the Dogon people.

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, with who--

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:49.210 align:middle line:84%
that's kind of well known
that their orientation

00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:50.010 align:middle line:90%
is towards Sirius.

00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:50.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Sirius, yeah.

00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:56.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so we see a lot of--

00:27:56.690 --> 00:28:01.160 align:middle line:84%
I would say a lot of
our societal structures

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.840 align:middle line:90%
came from Sirius.

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:05.390 align:middle line:84%
A lot of our knowledge
about medicine.

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:09.590 align:middle line:84%
A lot of our knowledge about
healing all came from Sirius.

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:12.320 align:middle line:84%
Language I think came
from the Pleiades.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.180 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of our
language, which was

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:16.910 align:middle line:84%
based on Tamal, which
is a Pleiadian language

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:18.860 align:middle line:90%
came from the Pleiades.

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:21.620 align:middle line:84%
But pretty much all the
other societal structures

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:24.770 align:middle line:84%
that we have on this planet
today came from Sirius.

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:27.410 align:middle line:84%
They had a big
influence on Egypt.

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:29.180 align:middle line:84%
There was many
Sirian beings that

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:33.440 align:middle line:84%
were specifically interested
in Egypt because Egypt

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:36.710 align:middle line:84%
was the converging point
after the fall of Atlantis

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:38.090 align:middle line:90%
and Lemuria.

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:41.060 align:middle line:84%
So Egypt was considered
to be the next great hope.

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:44.850 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to bring both the
masculine and feminine energies

00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:45.650 align:middle line:90%
in.

00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And Sirus being a more
feminine star system

00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:50.330 align:middle line:84%
brought in that more
feminine energy,

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:55.130 align:middle line:84%
whereas Orion was more
the masculine energy.

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:58.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and you see that
throughout the depictions

00:28:58.490 --> 00:28:59.480 align:middle line:90%
of the gods--

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.990 align:middle line:90%
heavily female and male.

00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:01.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:05.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Side by side, starting with
the origin story with Osiris

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:06.440 align:middle line:90%
and Isis.

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:09.110 align:middle line:90%
>> So that did happen.

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:12.320 align:middle line:84%
You started getting that merging
the masculine and feminine,

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.110 align:middle line:84%
which oddly of course was
wiped out not long after that

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:17.150 align:middle line:84%
and reverted to
patriarchy again.

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:18.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:20.660 align:middle line:90%
>> --under whichever influences.

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:23.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so one of the species
you were talking about,

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:26.690 align:middle line:84%
the Pleiadians being here
as guides for humanity now

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:29.780 align:middle line:84%
and the Sirians have inculcated
much of their culture

00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:31.320 align:middle line:90%
into our cultures.

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:34.040 align:middle line:84%
But also we hear a lot
about the Arcturians,

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:35.900 align:middle line:90%
and these beings also--

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:39.020 align:middle line:84%
many people talk about
having Arcturian guides.

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:42.740 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about that, and
let's talk about their stargate

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:45.860 align:middle line:84%
and what happened in the
interface with the Draconians.

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:46.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely.

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:48.795 align:middle line:84%
It's a story that a lot of
people don't know about.

00:29:48.795 --> 00:29:50.027 align:middle line:90%
It was one that--

00:29:50.027 --> 00:29:51.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't think
I've read it anywhere.

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:54.030 align:middle line:84%
I actually saw it in
the Akashic Records.

00:29:54.030 --> 00:30:00.410 align:middle line:84%
So myself being an
Arcturian starseed myself,

00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:02.900 align:middle line:90%
so I identify with Arcturus.

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:04.610 align:middle line:84%
I think I've been in
many other systems,

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:06.173 align:middle line:90%
but that's the system--

00:30:06.173 --> 00:30:08.090 align:middle line:84%
>> That might be the one
you're most recently.

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:08.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:09.403 align:middle line:90%
>> A lot of people--

00:30:09.403 --> 00:30:11.128 align:middle line:84%
that's one thing
I do want to say.

00:30:11.128 --> 00:30:13.670 align:middle line:84%
When you're reading people, and
when other people are saying,

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:16.370 align:middle line:84%
oh, they sure look
like a Pleiadian to me.

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:19.890 align:middle line:84%
Many people-- many of us have
been through many star systems.

00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:21.530 align:middle line:84%
This is just the
latest iteration,

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:24.110 align:middle line:84%
and we picked up things of
each of them along the way.

00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:25.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely, yeah.

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:28.047 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's something that I
think people don't realize is

00:30:28.047 --> 00:30:30.380 align:middle line:84%
that-- they come to me for
readings, and they think, oh,

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:32.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell them, oh,
you're definitely Pleiadians,

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:33.500 align:middle line:90%
or you're definitely Lyran.

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:34.917 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm like,
oh, you've been

00:30:34.917 --> 00:30:36.585 align:middle line:90%
to this star, this star system.

00:30:36.585 --> 00:30:37.460 align:middle line:90%
They're like, really?

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:38.240 align:middle line:90%
I've been in all of those?

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.040 align:middle line:90%
I said, oh, yeah.

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:42.977 align:middle line:84%
That's not even-- that's
scratching the surface.

00:30:42.977 --> 00:30:44.435 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the Arcturians.

00:30:44.435 --> 00:30:45.393 align:middle line:90%
>> The Arturians, yeah.

00:30:45.393 --> 00:30:46.700 align:middle line:90%
Let's get into the Arcturians.

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:49.130 align:middle line:84%
So the Arcturians,
remember when I

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:51.920 align:middle line:84%
was talking before about
Antares and Arcturus

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:53.720 align:middle line:90%
being the two major stargates?

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:58.280 align:middle line:84%
So Arcturus is the other
stargate, other major stargate.

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And Arcturus represents
the masculine energy

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:05.900 align:middle line:84%
of the integration
from the etheric realm

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:07.340 align:middle line:90%
into the physical.

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:10.160 align:middle line:84%
So it was a stargate
that processed souls

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.950 align:middle line:90%
in between death and life.

00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:15.890 align:middle line:84%
So when a soul passes on,
they have to go somewhere

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:17.360 align:middle line:90%
to get processed before--

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:19.850 align:middle line:84%
to get ready for their
next incarnation.

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And so Arcturus was a
different consciousness

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:28.160 align:middle line:84%
that was developed during the
development of this galaxy

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:32.030 align:middle line:84%
in order to be the
guardians of this galaxy.

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:34.400 align:middle line:84%
So they had to
have that, I guess,

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:38.660 align:middle line:84%
outward perspective because
they were the ones that were I

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:42.380 align:middle line:84%
guess refereeing the
whole experiment.

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And so Arcturians
because they had

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:50.070 align:middle line:84%
this different consciousness
evolved very rapidly.

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And so they had advanced
technologies from very early

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:55.040 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:58.430 align:middle line:84%
They were very advanced
spiritually as well

00:31:58.430 --> 00:32:01.160 align:middle line:84%
in order to help guide all
these other star systems.

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:03.740 align:middle line:84%
But what a lot of
people don't realize

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:07.670 align:middle line:84%
is that Arcturus too because it
was located so close to Draco

00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:09.688 align:middle line:90%
also was attacked by Draco.

00:32:09.688 --> 00:32:10.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Those darn Draconians.

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:12.373 align:middle line:90%
>> Draconians, I know.

00:32:12.373 --> 00:32:14.540 align:middle line:84%
They're just-- they're just
a bunch of troublemakers

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:17.810 align:middle line:84%
and bullies, but they wanted
to take over the stargate

00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:22.070 align:middle line:84%
because they wanted to
have control of the souls.

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:23.990 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so they wanted
to have the control--

00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:27.650 align:middle line:84%
they wanted to be able to
dictate, maybe use the souls

00:32:27.650 --> 00:32:30.830 align:middle line:90%
as slaves, I don't know.

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:33.480 align:middle line:84%
>> So the Arcturians had to
do battle with them as well?

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:34.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:35.150 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:38.060 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, OK, so looking
at these Arcturians,

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:40.850 align:middle line:84%
we have to look at the
dimensionality of people too.

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:43.910 align:middle line:84%
This is all playing out in
multidimensions in addition

00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:45.800 align:middle line:90%
to the rest of the mess.

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.253 align:middle line:84%
And so the
Arcturians-- now, this

00:32:48.253 --> 00:32:49.670 align:middle line:84%
is just what I've
heard people say

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:51.500 align:middle line:84%
and I've read a couple of books
about people who've written

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:52.790 align:middle line:90%
about their Arcturian guides.

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And they always seem to
say they're very tall

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:58.160 align:middle line:90%
and they're blue.

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:01.820 align:middle line:84%
Have you experienced a similar
thing in seeing them or?

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:05.030 align:middle line:84%
>> I think Arcturians can
come in different heights.

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:08.570 align:middle line:84%
I think sometimes-- they're one
of the few star races that can

00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:12.890 align:middle line:84%
actually I think transcend
dimensions within--

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:17.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they can go from ninth
dimension to fifth dimension,

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:20.210 align:middle line:84%
so it depends on what
dimensionality you're

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:21.170 align:middle line:90%
seeing them in.

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:23.360 align:middle line:84%
So there are some
Arcturians that

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:27.320 align:middle line:84%
look small because they're
pulling their vibration down.

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:29.870 align:middle line:84%
But then as they get
higher dimensional,

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:31.280 align:middle line:90%
they get much taller.

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And they did tend to have
bluish greenish skin.

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:37.400 align:middle line:84%
So and they usually
have the three fingers,

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.640 align:middle line:84%
and they have the large eyes
with the pupil in the irises.

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:45.230 align:middle line:84%
But so they don't look anything
like light grey aliens.

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:48.213 align:middle line:90%


00:33:48.213 --> 00:33:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>> I didn't want to pull you
off on that one, but I want--

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:53.330 align:middle line:84%
the multidimensional part is
interesting because another

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:55.310 align:middle line:90%
fallacy in our thinking.

00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:57.070 align:middle line:84%
Humans think very
hierarchically.

00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:57.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:00.650 align:middle line:84%
>> And so we think if something
is of a higher dimensional

00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:03.350 align:middle line:84%
field, meaning less
density for the most part,

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:04.970 align:middle line:84%
that it's higher
in consciousness.

00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:07.080 align:middle line:90%
That is not necessarily true.

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:08.100 align:middle line:90%
>> No, not at all.

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>> And so we have to
stop thinking, oh,

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.819 align:middle line:84%
they're sixth dimensional.
sixth dimensional and what?

00:34:13.819 --> 00:34:16.389 align:middle line:90%
And what level of consciousness?

00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:17.790 align:middle line:90%
A completely different thing.

00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:19.582 align:middle line:84%
So here you're talking
about the Arcturians

00:34:19.582 --> 00:34:22.370 align:middle line:84%
that are working in between
these higher dimensions,

00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:26.300 align:middle line:84%
but so are the Draconian and
so are the reptilians working

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:29.889 align:middle line:84%
at these higher
dimensions of density,

00:34:29.889 --> 00:34:32.900 align:middle line:84%
but though not
necessarily on a par

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:34.670 align:middle line:84%
in terms of spiritual
development again.

00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:36.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, not at all.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.650 align:middle line:84%
So you have Draconian that
also are in sixth density,

00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:42.170 align:middle line:84%
but they're oriented
towards the dark.

00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:44.090 align:middle line:90%
And the dark is not always evil.

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:45.800 align:middle line:90%
The dark is just the dark.

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.900 align:middle line:84%
So they have, like I said,
a different perspective

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:48.700 align:middle line:90%
on things.

00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:51.320 align:middle line:84%
But the Arcturians
when they were

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:56.870 align:middle line:84%
going through the
whole stargate attacks,

00:34:56.870 --> 00:34:59.780 align:middle line:84%
it really affected
their psyche, where

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:02.720 align:middle line:84%
I think they struggled
with negative thinking.

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:09.817 align:middle line:84%
They struggled with this
feudalistic attitude of maybe

00:35:09.817 --> 00:35:11.150 align:middle line:90%
we're not going to survive this.

00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:13.730 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we're going to lose
everything because they

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:15.440 align:middle line:90%
saw what happened to Lyra.

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And so fortunately for
the Arcturians they had,

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:22.040 align:middle line:84%
I would say, advanced
enough technology

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.530 align:middle line:84%
that they were easily able
to withstand the Draconian

00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:25.590 align:middle line:90%
attacks.

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:28.160 align:middle line:84%
But it still affected
them, so you see this a lot

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.720 align:middle line:84%
with Arcturians
starseeds, where we

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:31.280 align:middle line:84%
could fall into
negative thinking

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:35.510 align:middle line:84%
or we could fall into maybe
this feudalistic attitude of,

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:37.970 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'm just going to give
up because things are not

00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:40.070 align:middle line:90%
working to my favor.

00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:41.570 align:middle line:90%
>> So fatalism.

00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:43.010 align:middle line:90%
Fatalism would be a hallmark.

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:45.950 align:middle line:84%
But the ones who are able to
keep the energy and the spirit

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:48.390 align:middle line:90%
up are serving humanity today.

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:49.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:51.950 align:middle line:84%
You get a lot of beautiful
Arcturian starseeds

00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:54.920 align:middle line:84%
and Arcturian beings that are
acting as guides for people

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:57.710 align:middle line:84%
that are really having an
influence on planet Earth,

00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:59.300 align:middle line:90%
positive influence because--

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Any kind of particular
trajectory or with the kind

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:04.100 align:middle line:84%
of thing they work
with in particular,

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:06.260 align:middle line:90%
or is it more individual?

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:09.290 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say our variants
tend to lead towards--

00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:14.510 align:middle line:84%
they tend to be spiritual
guides, teachers, and healers.

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:16.520 align:middle line:84%
And they tend to be
more psychospiritual

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:22.250 align:middle line:84%
oriented in healing as opposed
to physical healing, which

00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:24.320 align:middle line:90%
was the Sirian hallmark.

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:28.190 align:middle line:84%
So the Sirians were really
into physical healing.

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:31.940 align:middle line:84%
So you get a lot of folks that
are maybe Sirian starseeds that

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:34.490 align:middle line:84%
decide to go into
medicine because that's

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:35.450 align:middle line:90%
what they're used to.

00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:39.590 align:middle line:84%
But with the Arcturian beings
and Arcturian starseeds,

00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:41.840 align:middle line:84%
we're more oriented
towards a psychospiritual

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:44.990 align:middle line:84%
because we tend to be
natural psychologists.

00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:46.040 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:47.488 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, OK, good.

00:36:47.488 --> 00:36:49.780 align:middle line:84%
So we can start looking for
these things in each other.

00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:50.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely.

00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:51.410 align:middle line:90%
>> It's fun.

00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:52.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's fun.

00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:54.290 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a party
trick, but it's fun.

00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:55.550 align:middle line:90%
>> It is fun, yeah.

00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:59.600 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so let's go to Orion
because so many millions

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:04.160 align:middle line:84%
of years and wars and so many of
our ancient and even megalithic

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:08.720 align:middle line:84%
sites are ordered toward Orion,
situated to recognize Orion.

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.098 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about Orion.

00:37:10.098 --> 00:37:12.140 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about-- let's
get in a little bit more

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:13.200 align:middle line:90%
to the reptilian story.

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.000 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.735 align:middle line:84%
We've gone through
so much stuff,

00:37:15.735 --> 00:37:17.610 align:middle line:84%
and we've still barely
scratched the surface.

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:17.870 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:20.328 align:middle line:84%
>> But we only have a little
time left, so let's go for it.

00:37:20.328 --> 00:37:22.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, let's go for Orion.

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:25.130 align:middle line:84%
I personally love
Orion because I

00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:27.890 align:middle line:84%
remember when I was watching
the whole "Star Wars" movies

00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:30.290 align:middle line:90%
and the saga of "Star Wars."

00:37:30.290 --> 00:37:32.750 align:middle line:84%
The first thing that came
to my mind was, oh, my God.

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:33.740 align:middle line:90%
This looks like Orion.

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:36.230 align:middle line:90%
This reminds me of Orion.

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:39.380 align:middle line:84%
So I always jokingly
referred to Orion

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:41.120 align:middle line:84%
being a lot like
the Cantina scene

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:43.420 align:middle line:90%
from the original "Star Wars."

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:45.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's like my
own personal joke,

00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:47.390 align:middle line:90%
but it was a lot like that.

00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:50.120 align:middle line:84%
Orion was probably the
most diverse star system

00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:53.420 align:middle line:84%
in our galaxy as far as the
different types of beings

00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:55.640 align:middle line:84%
because it was such
a huge constellation.

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:56.510 align:middle line:90%
It's huge.

00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:57.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a
big constellation.

00:37:57.890 --> 00:37:59.390 align:middle line:90%
Has a lot of stars.

00:37:59.390 --> 00:38:03.200 align:middle line:84%
But so you had beings that were
inhabiting these different star

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:06.500 align:middle line:84%
systems within the Orion
system that came from Draco,

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:13.430 align:middle line:84%
or came from Zeta Reticuli,
or came from Procyon, or Lyra,

00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:14.570 align:middle line:90%
and Vega.

00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:18.230 align:middle line:84%
I would say probably
more of a Vega influence

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:23.420 align:middle line:84%
on Orion as far as humanoids,
but there was insectoid beings

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:25.610 align:middle line:90%
that also lived in Orion.

00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:29.420 align:middle line:84%
So you had this melting pot
of all these different races,

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:35.390 align:middle line:84%
and so there was constant wars
and turf battles over Orion.

00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:40.370 align:middle line:84%
So you had the Draconians
and the tall Greys,

00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:42.440 align:middle line:84%
and the short Greys,
the small Greys

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:45.440 align:middle line:84%
that influenced most
of the outlier stars

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:47.630 align:middle line:90%
in the Orion constellation.

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:49.130 align:middle line:90%
And then you had the belt stars.

00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:51.320 align:middle line:84%
So you had the belt
stars that was mostly

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:53.240 align:middle line:90%
maybe humanoid-oriented.

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.880 align:middle line:84%
So you had most-- so they were
more the freedom fighters.

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:58.010 align:middle line:84%
They were more like what
I call the good zone.

00:38:58.010 --> 00:39:00.230 align:middle line:90%
Then you had the empire zone.

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:03.500 align:middle line:84%
So these two factions
were constantly in battle

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:06.050 align:middle line:90%
with each other.

00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And of course because
Orion was definitely

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:13.150 align:middle line:84%
a duality consciousness
type of star system,

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:16.390 align:middle line:84%
this occurred for millions
and millions of years.

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:18.640 align:middle line:84%
Orion didn't get
shifted into the light

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:20.380 align:middle line:90%
until fairly recently.

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:23.710 align:middle line:84%
I would say fairly
recently in our history.

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard to quantify
when that happened

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:28.330 align:middle line:84%
because in the higher
dimensional realms

00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:30.520 align:middle line:84%
there is no linear
time so sometimes it's

00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:31.700 align:middle line:90%
hard to quantify.

00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:32.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Time is tricky.

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:34.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, kind of quantify that.

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:37.930 align:middle line:84%
But the influence
they had on Earth

00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:42.340 align:middle line:84%
was that the Orion beings
were also visiting Earth.

00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:45.880 align:middle line:84%
They were also looking for
colonization opportunities,

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:47.380 align:middle line:90%
and Earth was quite habitable.

00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:50.440 align:middle line:84%
It was a jewel in
our star system.

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:53.850 align:middle line:84%
It's very unlike most
planets out there.

00:39:53.850 --> 00:39:59.050 align:middle line:84%
So they were also looking
for opportunities on Earth,

00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:03.730 align:middle line:84%
and these beings also
had their influences

00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:06.850 align:middle line:90%
on the Atlantean civilization.

00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:10.300 align:middle line:84%
They had a big influence
in Egypt and even

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:12.610 align:middle line:84%
in some of the Middle
Eastern cultures--

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:16.510 align:middle line:84%
the Mesopotamia
and the Sumerians.

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:19.480 align:middle line:84%
So you see a lot of Orian
influence in those cultures.

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:23.110 align:middle line:84%
>> But it seems from what
I've heard you say before that

00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:26.140 align:middle line:84%
the reptilians were one of
the groups that came here from

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:28.960 align:middle line:84%
Orion and really
did their number--

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:32.320 align:middle line:84%
wreaked havoc with
humanity, and they also

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:34.960 align:middle line:90%
colonized all over the Earth.

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:37.120 align:middle line:84%
So their influence
is everywhere,

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:38.980 align:middle line:84%
but the one thing
that's fascinating

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:41.560 align:middle line:84%
about the reptilians
is that they're

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:43.570 align:middle line:90%
said to be master geneticists.

00:40:43.570 --> 00:40:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And then if you hear the stories
out on the internet today,

00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:50.560 align:middle line:84%
you're going to still
hear that probably

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:53.620 align:middle line:84%
as the most referred to species
in terms of what's going on

00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:55.810 align:middle line:84%
in our world from
top down control,

00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:57.370 align:middle line:90%
hidden influence and so forth.

00:40:57.370 --> 00:40:59.860 align:middle line:84%
Fingers always end up
pointing at the reptilians.

00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:01.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely.

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:03.820 align:middle line:84%
>> I think as far as
my understanding with

00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Earth's history is that the
reptilians came here early.

00:41:08.170 --> 00:41:09.670 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they--

00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:12.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean because they were
always looking for resources.

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:15.910 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you know Earth is another
one of those planets that

00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:18.350 align:middle line:90%
has a lot of resources.

00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:21.100 align:middle line:84%
So they were looking to
colonize Earth very early on.

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Maybe around the same time
as the Sirians if not before.

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:30.940 align:middle line:84%
But they were also wanting
to tinker with genetics.

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of the
dinosaurs-- you see dinosaurs,

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:38.458 align:middle line:84%
they were an offshoot
of reptilian genetics.

00:41:38.458 --> 00:41:40.000 align:middle line:84%
So they were trying
to see what would

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.790 align:middle line:84%
happen if we take our
genetics and create

00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:46.720 align:middle line:84%
these big massive beings and
that populated the planet.

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:48.560 align:middle line:90%
And then they got wiped out.

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And so then they started
tinkering with human genetics.

00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:53.590 align:middle line:84%
So what happens if we
insert our own genetics

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:56.980 align:middle line:84%
into these human beings
and see what happens?

00:41:56.980 --> 00:41:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And so you hear a lot of
stories about the Annunaki

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:04.060 align:middle line:84%
and how they tinkered
with our genetics,

00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:06.040 align:middle line:84%
and our genetics
went from 12 strand

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:08.110 align:middle line:84%
to two strands, which
is currently still

00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:08.980 align:middle line:90%
this two strand.

00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:13.960 align:middle line:84%
But so these beings
were also I think

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:17.440 align:middle line:84%
trying to escape Orion
at a certain point

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:21.160 align:middle line:84%
because Orion was shifting
to unity consciousness.

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to keep
their control and power

00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:25.450 align:middle line:84%
over at least some
sort of star system.

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:27.520 align:middle line:84%
>> To go to a more
naive planet and tinker.

00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:30.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, tinker around
with that, right.

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:33.550 align:middle line:84%
So they came to
Earth and started

00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:37.180 align:middle line:84%
having an influence on
the Atlantean culture.

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:39.670 align:middle line:84%
So they infiltrated
some of the--

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:41.920 align:middle line:84%
because Atlantis was very
spiritual in the beginning,

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:44.462 align:middle line:84%
but then they became more and
more corrupted as time went by.

00:42:44.462 --> 00:42:47.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, people don't understand
the length of the history

00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:48.190 align:middle line:90%
of Atlantis.

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:50.770 align:middle line:84%
This is-- you're talking at
least a half a million years.

00:42:50.770 --> 00:42:50.848 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:42:50.848 --> 00:42:51.648 align:middle line:90%
It was a long time.

00:42:51.648 --> 00:42:52.930 align:middle line:90%
>> So it was not this--

00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:54.790 align:middle line:84%
the period of time
that they refer to

00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:57.910 align:middle line:84%
with from Plato's
renderings, which was just

00:42:57.910 --> 00:43:00.580 align:middle line:84%
before the final deluge
and fall that was just

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:04.480 align:middle line:84%
the tail, tail end of what
was a magnificent Atlantean

00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:05.920 align:middle line:90%
culture that was--

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:09.730 align:middle line:84%
apparently it was sinking and
breaking off from the North

00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:12.592 align:middle line:84%
down to the South, and
that was the remnant of it.

00:43:12.592 --> 00:43:14.800 align:middle line:84%
So what you're talking about
was in the earlier days.

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:15.850 align:middle line:90%
>> In the earlier days.

00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:17.920 align:middle line:84%
>> So we have very
little time left.

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:20.080 align:middle line:90%
>> So let's look at how these--

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:23.063 align:middle line:84%
we've talked a little bit about
each of these beings as guides

00:43:23.063 --> 00:43:24.730 align:middle line:84%
and how they're
affecting us and working

00:43:24.730 --> 00:43:28.090 align:middle line:84%
with us as personal guides but
then how the reptilians might

00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:30.140 align:middle line:84%
still be working
with us as well.

00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:33.615 align:middle line:84%
And I look at that and think of
things like master geneticists.

00:43:33.615 --> 00:43:35.740 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that's
coming to the fore because

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:37.750 align:middle line:84%
of everything that
happened with COVID

00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:42.010 align:middle line:84%
and vaccinations versus
drugs and so forth

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:45.470 align:middle line:84%
is the notion of manipulation of
the DNA through pharmaceuticals

00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:46.270 align:middle line:90%
even.

00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:48.370 align:middle line:84%
So might this manipulation
still be going

00:43:48.370 --> 00:43:50.380 align:middle line:90%
on today in a more subtle form?

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:53.440 align:middle line:84%
>> My understanding
with some of the--

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:57.070 align:middle line:84%
I would say some of the
medical agendas, the not so

00:43:57.070 --> 00:43:58.930 align:middle line:84%
I guess benevolent
medical agenda

00:43:58.930 --> 00:44:02.890 align:middle line:84%
is that they're trying to
retrofit the planet to fit

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:06.080 align:middle line:90%
a more reptilian type of--

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:06.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Mentality.

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:09.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Mentality or physicality.

00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:09.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:14.440 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so they're trying-- they
may be even trying to wipe out

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:18.100 align:middle line:84%
other star systems like Lyran
genetics or Pleiadian genetics

00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:21.310 align:middle line:84%
or even some of the
humanoid Sirian genetics.

00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:24.170 align:middle line:90%


00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:25.630 align:middle line:84%
So my-- I mean,
this is something

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:27.340 align:middle line:84%
I hope to talk
about at some point,

00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:30.250 align:middle line:84%
but I will do some
research around.

00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:33.940 align:middle line:84%
But I'm curious
to know, well, how

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:37.030 align:middle line:84%
are some of these
pharmaceuticals are adversely

00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:40.630 align:middle line:84%
affecting people from other
star systems that have genetics

00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:42.160 align:middle line:90%
from other star systems.

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:43.127 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:44:43.127 --> 00:44:44.710 align:middle line:84%
Because we're all
different in that we

00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:47.470 align:middle line:84%
each have our own signature,
just like our own thumbprint.

00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:51.220 align:middle line:84%
We have to-- maybe just end
with a final comment here.

00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:52.900 align:middle line:90%
We have help of all kinds.

00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:54.440 align:middle line:90%
We have our higher selves.

00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:58.480 align:middle line:84%
We have our guides from
all kinds of star systems

00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:01.510 align:middle line:84%
that are here really trying
to help humanity remember who

00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:04.480 align:middle line:84%
we are on a spiritual level
and not to be so dazzled

00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:06.160 align:middle line:90%
by the technology.

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:09.277 align:middle line:84%
Any final comments on what
our true choice is now?

00:45:09.277 --> 00:45:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Even though we're still
part of this cosmos,

00:45:11.110 --> 00:45:13.930 align:middle line:84%
we're still being visited, and
we're still being influenced.

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:17.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, no, it's a great segue
into some closing thoughts,

00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:21.970 align:middle line:84%
but I think we're always going
to be dealing with technology.

00:45:21.970 --> 00:45:24.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the technology
is equally as important

00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:26.320 align:middle line:84%
because we need to have
that technology in order

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:28.950 align:middle line:84%
to become part of the
greater galactic family.

00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:30.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, just to even travel.

00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:31.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Travel, exactly, yeah.

00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:34.400 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's always
going to be in the forefront.

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:37.000 align:middle line:84%
But I think the
cautionary tale that we've

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.850 align:middle line:84%
learned from all these other
star systems is that you always

00:45:39.850 --> 00:45:43.690 align:middle line:84%
have to have the spirituality
integrated into it in order

00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:48.010 align:middle line:84%
to have a higher-level
society, in order to be

00:45:48.010 --> 00:45:49.580 align:middle line:90%
able to keep that balance.

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:51.430 align:middle line:84%
Because if you have
too much technology,

00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:53.590 align:middle line:84%
we learn the lesson
of the Atlanteans.

00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:57.460 align:middle line:84%
That their civilization
fell because they

00:45:57.460 --> 00:45:59.710 align:middle line:84%
were advancing more
technologically and not so much

00:45:59.710 --> 00:46:02.140 align:middle line:90%
spiritually anymore.

00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
star systems like Lyra

00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:06.760 align:middle line:84%
that had beautiful
spirituality, but they

00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:09.140 align:middle line:84%
didn't have the technology,
and they fell as well.

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:11.930 align:middle line:84%
So I think they need
to go hand in hand.

00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
Pleiadians did it right.

00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:16.900 align:middle line:84%
I think they are one of
the few star systems that--

00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:19.510 align:middle line:84%
and Arcturians and
Sirians as well--

00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:21.160 align:middle line:84%
where they did
have that balance,

00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:24.670 align:middle line:84%
where they were very
interested in developing

00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:27.010 align:middle line:84%
spiritually and connecting
with the higher realms.

00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:29.740 align:middle line:10%
So I think that's the
journey that we're

00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:32.510 align:middle line:10%
going to be seeing more
and more in the future.

00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:33.320 align:middle line:90%
>> I love that.

00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:35.222 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for wrapping
it up so nicely.

00:46:35.222 --> 00:46:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And that we're
sitting right there.

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:37.900 align:middle line:90%
We can choose right now.

00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:40.000 align:middle line:84%
We as a species
get to choose what

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.910 align:middle line:84%
the direction is going to be
if we stand up and are heard.

00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:44.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, no.

00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:48.700 align:middle line:10%
I think I'm seeing more just
influences of I think even

00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:53.230 align:middle line:10%
within my clients and people
that come to me for readings

00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:55.840 align:middle line:10%
or for consultations that--

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:58.090 align:middle line:10%
I think a lot of us are
getting more and more

00:46:58.090 --> 00:47:01.880 align:middle line:10%
interested in spirituality and
how we're connected with that,

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:04.010 align:middle line:10%
so I have a lot of
hope for the future.

00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>> I do too.

00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:05.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I think
it's going to be a--

00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:07.900 align:middle line:84%
I think we're going
to see a golden age.

00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:08.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:09.910 align:middle line:84%
We're going through that
bumpy patch right now.

00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:11.260 align:middle line:84%
We've been through
a lot of them.

00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:12.350 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much, Debbie,
and I want to say--

00:47:12.350 --> 00:47:13.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you for having me.

00:47:13.690 --> 00:47:17.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And also I love the artwork
and the glossary you have

00:47:17.950 --> 00:47:20.260 align:middle line:84%
on your website so
people can go through.

00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:22.990 align:middle line:84%
Just very quickly, just
like all these little

00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:26.380 align:middle line:84%
how to do this in five steps,
questionnaires and all that--

00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:28.360 align:middle line:84%
is there any way without
having a reading--

00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:30.310 align:middle line:90%
because you're way booked out--

00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:32.950 align:middle line:84%
that people can get a
glimpse into who they are?

00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:34.250 align:middle line:90%
Are there any tools for that?

00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:35.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely.

00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:38.020 align:middle line:84%
They can go to my website, which
has that beautiful Galactic

00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:38.890 align:middle line:90%
History section.

00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:40.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it's gorgeous.

00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:43.360 align:middle line:84%
>> And they can also go
on my YouTube channel.

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:46.180 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of samples of
different people's readings.

00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:48.995 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of times people love
to listen to those because they

00:47:48.995 --> 00:47:51.370 align:middle line:84%
get insights into themselves,
even though it might not be

00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:53.000 align:middle line:90%
personally their reading but--

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:53.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:57.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so they get little
tidbits of information through

00:47:57.090 --> 00:47:57.890 align:middle line:90%
that as well.

00:47:57.890 --> 00:47:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect.

00:47:58.510 --> 00:47:58.930 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:47:58.930 --> 00:47:59.930 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Debbie.

00:47:59.930 --> 00:48:01.055 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you for having me.

00:48:01.055 --> 00:48:03.472 align:middle line:84%
>> Until next time, and we'll
finish the rest of this one.

00:48:03.472 --> 00:48:04.888 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, we'll
does that keep it--

00:48:04.888 --> 00:48:06.910 align:middle line:84%
we'll just keep going
on with the story, yeah.

00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:08.702 align:middle line:84%
>> To learn more about
