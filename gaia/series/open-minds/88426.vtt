>>REGINA MEREDITH:
In my experience,

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.430 align:middle line:10%
there are people who claim
to be gurus but know little,

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.730 align:middle line:10%
and those who don't
but know much.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Today's guest, Nigel Taylor,
is in the latter category.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Deeply ensconced in the spirit
of life from a very young age,

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.600 align:middle line:84%
Nigel has spent a lifetime
immersed in the world's

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.540 align:middle line:84%
greatest spiritual
teachings, only

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.250 align:middle line:84%
to emerge with his
own understanding

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.820 align:middle line:90%
of the nature of reality.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.540 align:middle line:84%
In his book, "The Power Before
Thought," Nigel helps define--

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.390 align:middle line:84%
or suggests, in his words-- how
we interface with the waking

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.550 align:middle line:84%
dream and how we
can find our power

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.067 align:middle line:84%
to live beyond the mass cultural
hypnosis, as you call it.

00:01:03.067 --> 00:01:04.400 align:middle line:90%
So good to have you here, Nigel.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NIGEL TAYLOR: Lovely
to be here, Regina.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:05.400 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.108 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I have
to say, this book is

00:01:07.108 --> 00:01:10.010 align:middle line:84%
only around 150 pages, and
it's one of the more powerful,

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.750 align:middle line:84%
that it's almost in
its own category.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.480 align:middle line:90%
And I've read a lot of them.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.200 align:middle line:90%
But yours is--

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.740 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: I bet you have.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.823 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yours is superb.

00:01:16.823 --> 00:01:18.532 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Thank you
for those kind words.

00:01:18.532 --> 00:01:20.447 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I wanted
to say something first.

00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:21.660 align:middle line:90%
I have it written down here.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.380 align:middle line:84%
In the book, you start with a
quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson,

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.060 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think most people
can relate to this.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.200 align:middle line:10%
It says, "To be yourself in
a world that is constantly

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.980 align:middle line:10%
trying to make you something
else is the greatest

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:35.926 align:middle line:10%
accomplishment."

00:01:35.926 --> 00:01:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to ask why you
chose that quote, because it

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.390 align:middle line:84%
kind of sets the stage
for the book very well.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.056 align:middle line:84%
Once you finish the
book, you know that.

00:01:42.056 --> 00:01:43.260 align:middle line:90%


00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.700 align:middle line:10%
>>TAYLOR: Well, in a nutshell,
when we look at the world

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.680 align:middle line:10%
as it is today, people are,
in many, many instances,

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.600 align:middle line:10%
right across the
planet, acting out

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.120 align:middle line:10%
of a predetermined structure or
cultural structure which says,

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.360 align:middle line:10%
this is who you are.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.930 align:middle line:84%
This is the way you must behave
inside this time frame which

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.200 align:middle line:90%
you call your life.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.270 align:middle line:84%
We utilize the
understanding of spirit

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.410 align:middle line:84%
to be something that is
separate from who we are.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, we tend
to be governed.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.620 align:middle line:84%
If we live inside
the world of spirit

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.910 align:middle line:84%
and we focus upon, say,
a theology or a New Age

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.030 align:middle line:84%
spiritual path,
we tend to follow

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.970 align:middle line:84%
particular precepts
inside there.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.000 align:middle line:84%
However, we often become
tied to those precepts,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.670 align:middle line:84%
rather than finding the original
thought, our authentic voice

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.170 align:middle line:90%
of who we truly are.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.860 align:middle line:84%
We're born with an
authentic voice.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.900 align:middle line:90%
We're born with an originality.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.990 align:middle line:84%
But from birth, we are told
what to do-- by teachers,

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.310 align:middle line:90%
by priests, by politicians.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And the end result
is that we grow

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.480 align:middle line:84%
into what we call-- or I call,
at this instance, mass cultural

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.420 align:middle line:90%
hypnosis.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.920 align:middle line:84%
The authenticity, like Ralph
Waldo Emerson is saying,

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.260 align:middle line:84%
is if you can do that,
if you can actually

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.730 align:middle line:84%
become unique to yourself and
live out of that path of truth,

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.840 align:middle line:84%
you will change not
only your world,

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.870 align:middle line:84%
you'll change the world of every
single person on this planet.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet as
we know, we are not

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.814 align:middle line:84%
encouraged to find
that individuality.

00:03:08.814 --> 00:03:09.730 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Far from it.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very few people
are actually ever encouraged

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.820 align:middle line:84%
from birth to find
their true essence.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.070 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yes.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.050 align:middle line:90%
Sadly so.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.280 align:middle line:90%


00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.900 align:middle line:84%
There are individuals
who will actually

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.500 align:middle line:84%
pursue their path, to the great
disdain of many of those--

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.770 align:middle line:84%
actually, it takes enormous
courage to stand out

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.970 align:middle line:84%
and to truly go inside
and find out who you are.

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And the reason it's not
popular is because there is not

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.060 align:middle line:84%
a reward system that's set up
inside the physical reality we

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.750 align:middle line:90%
live in.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.850 align:middle line:84%
The reward system and
knowing who you are,

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.360 align:middle line:90%
it can't be matched.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.450 align:middle line:84%
However, the fear
of annihilation,

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.100 align:middle line:84%
the fear of actually going
to that place and saying,

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.160 align:middle line:84%
let me confront
every aspect of who

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.260 align:middle line:84%
I am, let me look deeply
into the mirror of truth,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.850 align:middle line:84%
and really come to a
space of understanding,

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.450 align:middle line:84%
has got its own reward, which
is far superior to anything

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.160 align:middle line:84%
you could put in
the marketplace.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.560 align:middle line:84%
However, we are
literally structured

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.110 align:middle line:84%
with the voices
of infinite others

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.810 align:middle line:84%
as to who we are, what we are,
and how we should culturally

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.240 align:middle line:84%
and hypnotically
follow as a life path.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.360 align:middle line:84%
OK, now you have been
teaching this kind of essence

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.720 align:middle line:90%
since you were 17.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.880 align:middle line:84%
You were obviously pretty lit
up as a very young person.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.170 align:middle line:90%


00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.360 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.450 align:middle line:84%
That's quite-- that's
40 years of teaching.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:36.430 align:middle line:90%
How'd that happen?

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, it actually
started because I didn't really

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:40.955 align:middle line:90%
fit into my school structure.

00:04:40.955 --> 00:04:42.830 align:middle line:90%


00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.140 align:middle line:90%
I think I was 15, 16.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.530 align:middle line:84%
I was doing physics,
and I was in my--

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.340 align:middle line:84%
what would have been the fourth
year of a five-year high school

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.340 align:middle line:84%
structure in the
'70s, '60s and '70s.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.114 align:middle line:84%
And my soccer coach
took me home--

00:04:57.114 --> 00:04:58.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Your soccer coach?

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.880 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Soccer coach, yeah.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.296 align:middle line:84%
Took me home, sat
down, and waited

00:05:00.296 --> 00:05:01.830 align:middle line:90%
until my father got home.

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.150 align:middle line:90%
And he laid down the rules.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.460 align:middle line:84%
And he said, if he's going
to continue to play soccer,

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.840 align:middle line:90%
he has to do something better.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.750 align:middle line:84%
He's fouled everything
that's here.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, part of what
I did-- I grew up

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:12.970 align:middle line:90%
in a working-class family.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.560 align:middle line:84%
I had a job on the
days I wasn't playing

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.410 align:middle line:90%
soccer, which was a postman.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.370 align:middle line:84%
I earned enough money to
be able to save the money

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.080 align:middle line:84%
to invest in
something I saw in one

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.350 align:middle line:84%
of those, like, National
Enquirer magazines, literally.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.890 align:middle line:84%
But what it was, it was
a mind training program.

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you were
15, 16, making your money

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000 align:middle line:90%
to invest in mind power.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.420 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Because I wanted
to understand the mind.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.260 align:middle line:84%
So I sent off for this
correspondence course.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.780 align:middle line:84%
I trained myself, and I have
never, ever looked back.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And so as a consequence, when
I went into the school system--

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.620 align:middle line:84%
I went to university and I
was sent into primary school

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.461 align:middle line:84%
to start with, to actually--
before I'd really even started

00:05:51.461 --> 00:05:53.460 align:middle line:84%
university, they said,
you're a trainee teacher.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.720 align:middle line:90%
Go and teach.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.235 align:middle line:84%
And the moment I walked
in, I didn't haven't

00:05:58.235 --> 00:05:59.920 align:middle line:90%
a clue what teaching was.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the first
superintendent that came out,

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.070 align:middle line:84%
and he looked at me, and
he said, come here, son.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.910 align:middle line:90%
He said, give up now.

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.710 align:middle line:90%
You will never be a teacher.

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:11.240 align:middle line:84%
And that was when
I realized that I

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.360 align:middle line:84%
didn't fit in the
structure they had.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And my whole concept of looking
at the way in which thought

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.280 align:middle line:84%
processes were actually
understood inside an education

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.080 align:middle line:84%
system were very, very
different to the way

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.104 align:middle line:84%
I personally was
experiencing it.

00:06:26.104 --> 00:06:26.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.269 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: So the
consequence of that

00:06:28.269 --> 00:06:32.460 align:middle line:84%
was that as I progressed
through high school teaching,

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.980 align:middle line:84%
I not only learned
from the kids,

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.892 align:middle line:84%
but I shared with them ways
of meditation and motivation.

00:06:37.892 --> 00:06:39.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wow, how
lucky were they?

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.710 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, I had
wonderful kids to work with.

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.916 align:middle line:84%
You know, they
were really unique.

00:06:43.916 --> 00:06:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And so they taught me more
than I could teach them.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did kick you
out of the school system,

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.510 align:middle line:84%
ultimately, for doing
this heretical stuff?

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.770 align:middle line:90%


00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.757 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: I had phenomenal
staff I worked with,

00:06:53.757 --> 00:06:55.590 align:middle line:84%
and I went to a number
of different schools.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.870 align:middle line:84%
However, the one thing that
might the difference was when

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.060 align:middle line:84%
education moved from being
something which you could

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.270 align:middle line:84%
actually-- like Plato
would say, in principle,

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.220 align:middle line:84%
you can train anybody
to do anything.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.470 align:middle line:84%
But you educate people
by drawing out of them

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:15.120 align:middle line:90%
their innate wisdom.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.350 align:middle line:84%
And so when it
went from actually

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:22.820 align:middle line:84%
being able to assist children,
or pre-university students,

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.370 align:middle line:84%
to actually give
forth understanding,

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:29.470 align:middle line:84%
not getting them to rote
repeat-- when it went from, OK,

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:30.720 align:middle line:90%
this is what you've got to do.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.430 align:middle line:84%
You've got to train
these for the economy.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.430 align:middle line:84%
You can't-- and I was
teaching economics, right?

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say, you know, but
they've got to be human beings.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.420 align:middle line:84%
They've got to
live in the world.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.295 align:middle line:84%
And once they said, this is
it, you are now a trainer,

00:07:43.295 --> 00:07:46.390 align:middle line:84%
and you must keep all these
records, et cetera, I said,

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:47.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm out.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:47.605 align:middle line:90%
I'm finished.

00:07:47.605 --> 00:07:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
went and took what

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:53.300 align:middle line:84%
I was doing in a small scale
and I trained with some--

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.120 align:middle line:90%


00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:54.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Masters.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:56.640 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Very good people.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.510 align:middle line:84%
I've had phenomenal
teachers over my life.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:00.930 align:middle line:90%
And I still have.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:01.640 align:middle line:90%
I still have.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.937 align:middle line:90%
This is instructive, too, see?

00:08:02.937 --> 00:08:03.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.540 align:middle line:90%


00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:08.170 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now that we know
you a little bit better,

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:10.320 align:middle line:84%
let's go back to
the notion of maya.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.390 align:middle line:84%
Because this is really at the
crux of the theme of the book.

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:15.440 align:middle line:90%
Explain what maya is.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Maya is
a Sanskrit word.

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.640 align:middle line:84%
In the context in which
we use it in the book,

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.460 align:middle line:84%
it's a Sanskrit
word which literally

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:28.560 align:middle line:84%
means to be an engineer or
an architect of an idea,

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.280 align:middle line:90%
to actually construct a thought.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And so if you actually take
the fundamentals of the Eastern

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:39.980 align:middle line:84%
philosophy, the Brahmanistic
and Vedic teachings,

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:44.210 align:middle line:84%
they will tell us that the
whole of creation is maya.

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
ways of looking at it.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Some say, well, therefore,
maya is an illusion.

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:56.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's an illusion in that
it has the ultimate reality

00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:00.650 align:middle line:84%
of dissolving at the end
of a grand cosmic cycle.

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:04.390 align:middle line:84%
However, from the
perspective of the source,

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:06.760 align:middle line:84%
the absolute principle--
by whatever name

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.020 align:middle line:90%
we use, and it doesn't matter.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.750 align:middle line:90%
We can use any name at all.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.950 align:middle line:84%
That's part of the
problem, of course--

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:16.020 align:middle line:84%
is that the universe
and the cosmos, per se,

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:20.040 align:middle line:90%
is a meditation in itself.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And as a meditation, it
contains all possibilities.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.240 align:middle line:90%
Everything is there.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.490 align:middle line:90%


00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:29.250 align:middle line:84%
The actual unfolding
of that meditation

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:33.770 align:middle line:84%
is through the act and
presence of the force of maya.

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:35.040 align:middle line:90%


00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.000 align:middle line:84%
Rather than seeking
to erase maya

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.510 align:middle line:84%
from our life, what we do
is we seek to rise above it.

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:44.225 align:middle line:84%
And as we seek to
rise above it, it

00:09:44.225 --> 00:09:48.070 align:middle line:84%
means you become a master
at the lower levels of mind,

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:49.760 align:middle line:84%
at the lower levels
of the dream,

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.560 align:middle line:90%
at the lower levels of idea.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.780 align:middle line:84%
Learn that there are
specific laws which

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:59.320 align:middle line:84%
govern each level of creation,
master them, and rise up

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.380 align:middle line:90%
to the next level.

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:05.610 align:middle line:84%
For instance, you can hear that
gravity says you can't fly.

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:07.660 align:middle line:84%
Aerodynamics says
this is how you do it.

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:10.580 align:middle line:10%
So we move through
different levels of reality

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.870 align:middle line:10%
until the maya,
ultimately-- we go back

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:17.220 align:middle line:10%
from this myriad of
infinite possibilities

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:21.210 align:middle line:10%
which we call life, and we go
back closer and closer until we

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:23.350 align:middle line:10%
get to our source
point, and we dissolve

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:27.790 align:middle line:10%
in the meditation of the actual
force of the principle of love

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:28.550 align:middle line:10%
itself.

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:29.790 align:middle line:90%
We go into that space.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:31.873 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're going
to go further and deeper

00:10:31.873 --> 00:10:34.450 align:middle line:84%
into that part of the story as
our conversation progresses.

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:38.560 align:middle line:84%
Because there's quite a bit
to contend with and unravel

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.660 align:middle line:90%
in that process.

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.060 align:middle line:84%
This isn't a quick
process, which is--

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:45.120 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, I'm sure
it could be if we were not

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:49.024 align:middle line:84%
living in that
ocean of illusion.

00:10:49.024 --> 00:10:49.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And once one finds their way
to that feeling or that place,

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:55.580 align:middle line:84%
it makes it a lot easier
to go back there--

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:55.840 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yes, it does.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Than it does to
get there the first time.

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we're
going to construct

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:00.410 align:middle line:90%
our conversation in this way.

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:01.640 align:middle line:90%


00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:02.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.770 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things you
talk about that's interesting

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:08.670 align:middle line:84%
is the greater good,
how so much of society

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:11.290 align:middle line:84%
has been fabricated
for the greater good.

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:13.060 align:middle line:84%
But you have a completely
different notion

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.240 align:middle line:84%
of what the greater
good actually means,

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.710 align:middle line:90%
and the compromise within that.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:20.330 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, you know, the
principle of the greater good,

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.740 align:middle line:84%
from the perspective of
society as we are told,

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:26.120 align:middle line:84%
is there are
sacrifices which must

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.060 align:middle line:84%
be made in order for the
benefit of the greater society.

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:36.000 align:middle line:84%
So if it means, for instance,
we have a need for people

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.250 align:middle line:84%
to give up a specific
activity in order

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:41.720 align:middle line:84%
to benefit the
greater community,

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.270 align:middle line:84%
then that would
be for the greater

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:45.740 align:middle line:84%
good of the whole
community itself.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:49.360 align:middle line:84%
The greater good, the
way that I'm seeing it

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.980 align:middle line:84%
from the perspective
of spirit, is

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:54.620 align:middle line:84%
that everything we do,
every thought we have,

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:57.680 align:middle line:84%
every aspect of
our soul journey,

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:02.650 align:middle line:84%
is tempered by a series of very
simple governing principles.

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:04.290 align:middle line:90%


00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:07.740 align:middle line:84%
Is what I'm doing-- which
is first and foremost

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.770 align:middle line:90%
from the volition of my thought.

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:12.200 align:middle line:84%
Is what I'm doing
taking me closer

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.770 align:middle line:84%
to that which will bring
about greater love, greater

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:18.500 align:middle line:84%
light, greater joy,
greater happiness?

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:22.820 align:middle line:84%
Not just for what I perceive
myself to be, but for the whole

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:25.310 align:middle line:90%
of creation in which I live?

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:29.540 align:middle line:84%
So the governing principle
is not the cultural myth.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:33.770 align:middle line:84%
It is the abiding truth
that we are so much more

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:37.610 align:middle line:84%
than this physical being who
we perceive ourselves to be.

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:41.470 align:middle line:84%
Hence, if we're taking an
act based upon our thought

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:43.520 align:middle line:84%
process-- and that's
another whole area.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going
to talk about lower

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.260 align:middle line:90%
thought in a moment.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:45.885 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:12:45.885 --> 00:12:49.620 align:middle line:84%
But if we take an
act and we are truly

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:53.250 align:middle line:84%
trying to achieve something
inside the greater good,

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:55.660 align:middle line:84%
there are some fundamental
questions to ask.

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And the primary one, as
far as I'm concerned,

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:02.090 align:middle line:84%
is, is this act which I
am actually undertaking,

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:06.660 align:middle line:84%
no matter what it is,
leading me closer to love?

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.901 align:middle line:84%
Or is it moving
me away from love?

00:13:08.901 --> 00:13:10.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And isn't that
really-- shouldn't that

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:12.650 align:middle line:84%
be the one and only
question we ever

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:14.680 align:middle line:84%
ask ourselves every
minute of every day?

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.097 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: I would
absolutely agree with that.

00:13:17.097 --> 00:13:19.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that's not part
of considering the greater good,

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.460 align:middle line:90%
as a rule.

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:21.370 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: As a social
norm, no, it's not.

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:24.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is laden with
wars for the greater good.

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:26.231 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: If we were to
look at the greater good,

00:13:26.231 --> 00:13:29.870 align:middle line:84%
we would not be now looking at
what's happening in the world

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:30.930 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:33.960 align:middle line:84%
As we talk here, the
events that are unfolding

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.480 align:middle line:84%
in the world-- the
greater good is not

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.830 align:middle line:84%
being served by
conflict in any area.

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:41.170 align:middle line:90%
That is not the greater good.

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:43.290 align:middle line:84%
That is serving the
mass cultural hypnosis,

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.250 align:middle line:84%
and that's serving
lower thought forms.

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's serving the lower maya,
the lower ideational aspects

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:53.321 align:middle line:90%
of creation.

00:13:53.321 --> 00:13:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And see, those have got a
vibration all of themselves.

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:58.000 align:middle line:84%
They're entities
unto themselves.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:58.895 align:middle line:90%
Fear is an entity.

00:13:58.895 --> 00:14:00.575 align:middle line:90%


00:14:00.575 --> 00:14:02.700 align:middle line:84%
You can look at anything--
like cancer's an entity.

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:04.240 align:middle line:90%
Fear is an entity.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.510 align:middle line:90%
Love is not an entity.

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:07.390 align:middle line:90%
Love is our truth.

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And getting there means
dissolving everything

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:13.384 align:middle line:84%
that in any way would
prevent us from knowing that.

00:14:13.384 --> 00:14:14.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
though, in the book,

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.570 align:middle line:84%
you're talking
about the separation

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:20.830 align:middle line:84%
from that, in that we're not
living our greatest potential.

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:24.180 align:middle line:84%
Very, very few humans are
living their greatest potential,

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:28.010 align:middle line:84%
and because we're trapped in
the field of lower thought.

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:31.360 align:middle line:84%
Tell us exactly what you mean
by lower thought within this.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.390 align:middle line:90%


00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:36.075 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Lower
thought-- the easiest way

00:14:36.075 --> 00:14:39.140 align:middle line:84%
to look at lower
thought is to consider

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:43.030 align:middle line:84%
the vibrational
nature of creation.

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:46.110 align:middle line:10%
The lower thought aspects
are whereby we're living out

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:49.942 align:middle line:10%
of a series of myths,
a series of-- they

00:14:49.942 --> 00:14:51.400 align:middle line:10%
could be personal
myths, they could

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.790 align:middle line:10%
be family myths--
which are propagating

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:59.690 align:middle line:10%
the continuance of an order
which is not moving us out

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:04.640 align:middle line:10%
in an evolutionary arc, back
into a higher sense of not

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:11.390 align:middle line:10%
only love, but also the greater
concept of healing our self

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:13.055 align:middle line:10%
to heal all of creation.

00:15:13.055 --> 00:15:14.120 align:middle line:90%


00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:20.780 align:middle line:84%
For instance, we are--
everything in creation

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:22.616 align:middle line:90%
is a thought form.

00:15:22.616 --> 00:15:23.115 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:15:23.115 --> 00:15:23.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:25.838 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: So everything in
creation's a thought form.

00:15:25.838 --> 00:15:29.720 align:middle line:10%
You're a though form in my
mind, and I am one in your mind.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:33.660 align:middle line:10%
How I relate to you, if I
see you and I experience you

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:36.600 align:middle line:10%
as a beautiful being that has
got eternal love and great joy

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:40.120 align:middle line:10%
and happiness, wisdom, et
cetera, as opposed to if I saw

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.250 align:middle line:10%
you-- well, you
remind me of an auntie

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:45.850 align:middle line:10%
I had that, et cetera--
that is my creation.

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:49.990 align:middle line:10%
And the lower thought
forms are-- in some way,

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:55.300 align:middle line:10%
they diminish the beauty and
the majesty of the divinity

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:59.920 align:middle line:10%
or the purity of the soul who is
actually brought into my life.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:04.720 align:middle line:84%
Now if I diminish you in
my life, I diminish myself.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And so the lower
vibrational thought forms

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:11.050 align:middle line:84%
are ones that actually diminish
any aspect of creation.

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:12.630 align:middle line:90%


00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:15.880 align:middle line:84%
So we could look
at, for instance,

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.690 align:middle line:84%
religious disorder,
whereby, say,

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:20.140 align:middle line:84%
a Catholic and a
Protestant would

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:25.000 align:middle line:84%
argue for each their own
god against the other god.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.924 align:middle line:84%
And what they do is they
diminish their own beauty

00:16:27.924 --> 00:16:29.840 align:middle line:84%
because they diminish
another person's beauty.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:30.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
they're taking everything

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:32.150 align:middle line:90%
to a lower frequency range.

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:33.400 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: They're taking
it to a lower frequency.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.120 align:middle line:90%
To a lower frequency.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.911 align:middle line:84%
And of course, inside
that lower frequency,

00:16:35.911 --> 00:16:39.600 align:middle line:84%
once you have separation,
once you have separation,

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.720 align:middle line:84%
there is then the fear of
what that separation means.

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.730 align:middle line:84%
You know, the realization
is that if you

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:49.230 align:middle line:84%
were separate from
me, that separation

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:50.475 align:middle line:90%
means I don't have control.

00:16:50.475 --> 00:16:51.970 align:middle line:90%


00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And if there's no
control, then that

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:58.840 align:middle line:84%
means I need to do something to
master the environment, which

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:02.950 align:middle line:84%
is an external perception rather
than the internal perception.

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:08.250 align:middle line:10%
Whereas if I can take myself
to a place of equanimity,

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:13.230 align:middle line:10%
whereby I can be rocked left
and right but find peace,

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:15.150 align:middle line:10%
whether I'm amongst--
say, for instance,

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:17.780 align:middle line:10%
say if I was in
Israel right now.

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.980 align:middle line:10%
To be in a war-torn
scenario like that

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:25.569 align:middle line:10%
and to be amongst any situation
and to be able to find peace

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:29.980 align:middle line:10%
would be to actually rise above
the vibrations of separation.

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, a true master,
man or woman,

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:35.370 align:middle line:84%
who has reached a
place of knowing

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:38.630 align:middle line:84%
who they are can walk
amongst them, have no fear.

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:42.530 align:middle line:84%
Because the no fearing
means that their life

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:47.200 align:middle line:84%
is recognized as an instrument
of that grand meditation.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.270 align:middle line:84%
That they're actually
here to serve a purpose,

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:52.550 align:middle line:90%
to uplift all of creation.

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:55.520 align:middle line:84%
They're not just simply
there for the purposes

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:58.350 align:middle line:84%
of decorating the planet,
which is what so much

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:00.979 align:middle line:84%
of what is happening
today happens to be about.

00:18:00.979 --> 00:18:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know,
it's interesting,

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.060 align:middle line:84%
because as you're saying
that-- and as you said,

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:07.400 align:middle line:84%
you can either diminish
me upon meeting,

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.710 align:middle line:84%
or you can put me in an exalted
position in your own mind,

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:12.280 align:middle line:90%
honoring that spark within.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.470 align:middle line:90%
That's our choice.

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And when we get into the habit--
it's just a habit, really, more

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:20.280 align:middle line:84%
than anything, which has an
addictive cycle, including

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.950 align:middle line:84%
a chemical cycle,
of criticizing,

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:25.430 align:middle line:84%
gossiping, judging,
and so forth-- as soon

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:28.630 align:middle line:84%
as we engage in that, you can
feel the separation happening

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:30.940 align:middle line:84%
between you and
the object of that.

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And then once you
feel separation,

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:37.270 align:middle line:84%
most people it seems then
go into fear of the other.

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:39.125 align:middle line:90%
The fear follows the separation.

00:18:39.125 --> 00:18:40.850 align:middle line:90%


00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:41.360 align:middle line:90%
Is that--

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.300 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: That's
absolutely-- that's exactly--

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:46.050 align:middle line:84%
that's exactly where we
are at this moment in time.

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:49.730 align:middle line:84%
The fear-- well, you
often hear it said,

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:51.200 align:middle line:90%
love is letting go of fear.

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:54.626 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very
well-known statement.

00:18:54.626 --> 00:18:56.000 align:middle line:84%
I would posit that
that in itself

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:02.450 align:middle line:84%
is a cultural New
Age expression.

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not that fear and
love are diametrically opposed.

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:09.730 align:middle line:90%
They're not.

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:11.130 align:middle line:90%
There is something higher.

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:14.000 align:middle line:84%
It's like a false
argument, a false debate,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.500 align:middle line:84%
about something that
keeps us inside the dream

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:18.830 align:middle line:90%
and away from the truth.

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:22.180 align:middle line:84%
The higher principle
is that what

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:26.150 align:middle line:84%
we think of as love and
hate-- and if they were

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:30.730 align:middle line:84%
at opposite extremes-- are
simply not what this is about.

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:33.480 align:middle line:84%
The higher principle
is that we say

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:37.310 align:middle line:84%
indifference is the killer,
where we don't know who we are,

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:40.727 align:middle line:84%
and we don't know what love is,
and we don't know what hate is.

00:19:40.727 --> 00:19:41.810 align:middle line:90%
Because we recognize hate.

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:42.980 align:middle line:90%
We can deal with it.

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:46.220 align:middle line:84%
If we recognize what we think
love is, we can honor it

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:47.280 align:middle line:90%
and we can work with it.

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.480 align:middle line:90%


00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:55.310 align:middle line:84%
But it's impossible to actually
love anything, anybody,

00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:58.220 align:middle line:84%
unless you're in that
holy moment of now.

00:19:58.220 --> 00:19:59.890 align:middle line:90%
People speak about hate.

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:02.300 align:middle line:90%


00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:06.340 align:middle line:84%
Hate is an impossibility
in this moment.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:06.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:08.106 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: It's not possible.

00:20:08.106 --> 00:20:10.900 align:middle line:10%
And yet what people
fail to realize

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:13.950 align:middle line:10%
is they take--
they'll build hate,

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:17.010 align:middle line:10%
but they're building it based
on all these past lower thought

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:19.450 align:middle line:10%
projections, bringing
it into this moment,

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:21.560 align:middle line:10%
and projecting into
the future, which

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:25.585 align:middle line:10%
amplifies separation and
then multiplies the fear.

00:20:25.585 --> 00:20:26.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.770 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: And then the fear
creates the greater separation.

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And going back
to the word indifference,

00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:32.212 align:middle line:84%
it seems to me that
that mass cultural

00:20:32.212 --> 00:20:33.920 align:middle line:84%
hypnosis you're talking
about-- and we'll

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.520 align:middle line:84%
get into why and
how and where that

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:39.470 align:middle line:84%
comes from-- that
fosters indifference.

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:41.157 align:middle line:90%


00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:42.740 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: It's no
question in my mind.

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:44.530 align:middle line:84%
It absolutely
fosters indifference.

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:50.360 align:middle line:84%
Because you think about-- if
you turn on mainstream media,

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:53.630 align:middle line:84%
if you see enough images
of death and destruction,

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:55.600 align:middle line:84%
and you hear it, and
you're in the airport,

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.370 align:middle line:84%
and whether you want to watch
it or not, its on there--

00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:00.470 align:middle line:90%
you become numb.

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And in this world
today, people become

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:08.180 align:middle line:84%
numb to the realities of what
is happening inside the dream.

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.930 align:middle line:10%
And so it's easier to
therefore become indifferent.

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:12.360 align:middle line:90%


00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:13.430 align:middle line:90%
That's bad, isn't it?

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:14.430 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's terrible.

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:14.670 align:middle line:90%
It's very sad.

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:16.050 align:middle line:90%
What can you do about it?

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:17.060 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah, exactly.

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:19.940 align:middle line:90%
But there is so much one can do.

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:21.770 align:middle line:90%
There is so much that we can do.

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:26.140 align:middle line:10%
We can change this world, and
it's-- the reason it's not

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:29.420 align:middle line:10%
actually accepted and run with
as simply as what we're talking

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:34.430 align:middle line:10%
about here is because it takes a
willingness to step out of that

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:38.230 align:middle line:10%
stream of lower consciousness
and to actually look at who you

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:38.850 align:middle line:10%
are.

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:42.935 align:middle line:84%
And then to own it, and to make

fan of Osho's work.

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:53.707 align:middle line:10%
>>TAYLOR: I think it
was-- he was a wild--

00:21:53.707 --> 00:21:54.540 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Wild, yes.

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:56.270 align:middle line:10%
>>TAYLOR: Absolutely
phenomenal spiritual teacher.

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:57.395 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Brilliant person.

00:21:57.395 --> 00:21:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah,
brilliant, phenomenal.

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:03.800 align:middle line:84%
But he once said,
the easiest way

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:06.194 align:middle line:90%
to avoid truth is to believe.

00:22:06.194 --> 00:22:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Believe in
something external.

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:09.280 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.910 align:middle line:84%
What a simple and
true statement.

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:11.410 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: That's
all there is to it.

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:13.049 align:middle line:90%
Simple.

00:22:13.049 --> 00:22:15.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk now
about the power of-- we're

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:17.620 align:middle line:84%
backtracking a little
bit, just to kind of get

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:19.620 align:middle line:84%
what this really
means, the meat of it.

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.470 align:middle line:90%
The power of thought forms.

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And you tell a story in
your book about Joan's dog.

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:29.320 align:middle line:84%
Because-- and I'll comment,
I'll make a comment afterward

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:32.320 align:middle line:84%
about it-- this is
how it really works.

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.700 align:middle line:90%
So tell us about Joan's dog.

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:36.020 align:middle line:90%


00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:38.660 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: It was a
fascinating experience.

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:40.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one of the
things-- obviously

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:43.680 align:middle line:84%
to put this in context-- one
of the parts of my journey

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.750 align:middle line:84%
is to act as an
instrument to heal.

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:48.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm not the healer.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.280 align:middle line:90%
I am simply the instrument.

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:50.940 align:middle line:90%
And that happens to be.

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:53.170 align:middle line:84%
Because if I did it, it
would be a complete disaster.

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:54.070 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:58.650 align:middle line:84%
Now having said that, this
lady comes in for a healing.

00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And she's in the room,
and I'm in a space

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:03.300 align:middle line:90%
of what I call surrender.

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:05.750 align:middle line:84%
So I have to get
out of my own way.

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And when I get
out of my own way,

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:10.804 align:middle line:84%
then I can perceive in a
higher vibrational state.

00:23:10.804 --> 00:23:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:13.980 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Which is what
any healer will tell you.

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:16.360 align:middle line:84%
Some will feel, some
will sense, and others

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.480 align:middle line:90%
will experience it differently.

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:22.560 align:middle line:84%
But I'm looking at her, and the
first thing I see, in spirit,

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.300 align:middle line:90%
is this little brown dog.

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:29.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at this thing,
and I said, do you have a dog?

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:30.750 align:middle line:90%
She goes, no.

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:33.341 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm looking-- and
I'm being shown this dog.

00:23:33.341 --> 00:23:35.090 align:middle line:84%
This dog's right in
front of me, you know,

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:37.410 align:middle line:84%
because I have the
spiritual support mechanism.

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:39.530 align:middle line:90%
And I said, does she have a dog?

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:41.340 align:middle line:84%
I said, are you sure
you don't have a dog?

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:41.450 align:middle line:90%
She says--

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:42.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She says,
well, I would know.

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:43.080 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: No.

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:43.825 align:middle line:90%
She said no.

00:23:43.825 --> 00:23:45.130 align:middle line:90%


00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:47.404 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, ask again.

00:23:47.404 --> 00:23:49.260 align:middle line:84%
So I said-- and
I thought, surely

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:50.590 align:middle line:90%
she'd know if she had a dog.

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Joan, do
you-- are you absolutely

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:56.250 align:middle line:90%
certain you don't have a dog?

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:59.270 align:middle line:90%
She goes, oh my god.

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And then she just
cracked up laughing.

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:03.465 align:middle line:84%
And she literally-- and
I thought, OK, well,

00:24:03.465 --> 00:24:04.910 align:middle line:90%
what's so funny?

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And I said-- and then
she told me the story.

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:11.190 align:middle line:84%
And what it was, from
a very early age--

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:13.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking she
was about eight.

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:17.270 align:middle line:84%
She was a member of a very
large family, Italian family.

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:19.750 align:middle line:90%
And they all wanted a pet.

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:20.812 align:middle line:90%
They wanted a dog.

00:24:20.812 --> 00:24:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And the father and mother
said, we can't afford that.

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:25.090 align:middle line:84%
You know, we don't have
the funds to do it.

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:28.810 align:middle line:84%
It's bad enough feeding you kids
without having to feed the dog.

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:33.310 align:middle line:84%
So they sat down as a group
and they created a dog

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:34.120 align:middle line:90%
in their mind.

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.430 align:middle line:90%
Now this is a classic, right?

00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:38.350 align:middle line:90%
Because they create the dog.

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:39.892 align:middle line:84%
They went through
what type of dog,

00:24:39.892 --> 00:24:41.850 align:middle line:84%
and it had to be a spaniel,
it had to be brown,

00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:42.620 align:middle line:90%
and it had to be this.

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:43.620 align:middle line:90%
And they gave it a name.

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:44.600 align:middle line:90%
They gave everything.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.430 align:middle line:84%
Now what they did with
this dog, right up

00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:50.860 align:middle line:84%
into their adult years, was
they would take it for a walk,

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:53.079 align:middle line:84%
they would feed it, they
would call it to the table,

00:24:53.079 --> 00:24:54.120 align:middle line:90%
they would put it to bed.

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.570 align:middle line:90%
They had a place for it.

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:58.010 align:middle line:84%
And all of the whole
family recognized this dog.

00:24:58.010 --> 00:24:59.562 align:middle line:84%
They'd walk into
the house, and-- I

00:24:59.562 --> 00:25:01.480 align:middle line:84%
don't know what the dog's name
was, let's say it was Rupert.

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.200 align:middle line:84%
Come here, Rupert, type
of thing, and then bang,

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.750 align:middle line:90%
the dog would be in their mind.

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:06.630 align:middle line:90%
Now fast forward.

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:07.800 align:middle line:90%


00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:11.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of guessing the lady
was in her early, mid 50s.

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And this dog shows up in
her session of healing.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:20.300 align:middle line:84%
The point of it showing up
was to illustrate to her

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:24.390 align:middle line:84%
that we are multidimensional
beings, that we exist

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:27.520 align:middle line:84%
across a full spectrum
of reality, which

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:31.590 align:middle line:84%
most people never give
a second thought to.

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:36.245 align:middle line:10%
And that all of the thoughts
we have that we give power to

00:25:36.245 --> 00:25:39.740 align:middle line:10%
are going to be with us
throughout our existence,

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:43.190 align:middle line:10%
not only-- and this is the
key point-- not only in

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:46.460 align:middle line:10%
this incarnation, but
these thought forms

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:49.810 align:middle line:10%
will track us throughout
infinite incarnations,

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:53.860 align:middle line:10%
until we have learned the power
of consciousness to create.

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:56.240 align:middle line:10%
And so this little
fella, this little dog,

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.600 align:middle line:10%
was there teaching her.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:01.346 align:middle line:84%
And then the point was, OK,
what are the dogs in your life?

00:26:01.346 --> 00:26:02.012 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:02.012 --> 00:26:03.680 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: What are
the dogs in your life?

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:05.804 align:middle line:84%
What are the thought forms
which are following you?

00:26:05.804 --> 00:26:07.295 align:middle line:84%
Do have a thought
form of poverty?

00:26:07.295 --> 00:26:08.790 align:middle line:90%


00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:09.590 align:middle line:90%
One of anger?

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:10.110 align:middle line:90%
One or hurt?

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:10.940 align:middle line:90%
One of grief?

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:11.960 align:middle line:90%
One of suffering?

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:14.600 align:middle line:84%
One of a loss of a
parent or something?

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:17.804 align:middle line:84%
And these are the ones which
then came up for healing.

00:26:17.804 --> 00:26:19.220 align:middle line:10%
And when they came
up for healing,

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:24.200 align:middle line:10%
it was like, if these are in the
essence of the multidimensional

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.810 align:middle line:10%
being that you are-- if this
is the tuning fork that's

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:31.264 align:middle line:10%
tuning at 432 hertz, and
I knock this one here

00:26:31.264 --> 00:26:33.430 align:middle line:10%
and I put another one,
that's going to be 432 hertz.

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:35.180 align:middle line:90%
That's going to ring with it.

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:39.490 align:middle line:10%
If you're carrying the energy
of any thought form-- hence,

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:41.810 align:middle line:10%
let's go back to mass
cultural hypnosis.

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:47.740 align:middle line:84%
The thought form of, OK,
somebody of one faith

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:49.090 align:middle line:90%
hates someone of another faith.

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:50.425 align:middle line:90%
Hate, right?

00:26:50.425 --> 00:26:53.430 align:middle line:84%
Or a thought form
of, you know, war

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:56.130 align:middle line:84%
is inevitable because of
the nature of the society

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:56.860 align:middle line:90%
we live in.

00:26:56.860 --> 00:27:01.190 align:middle line:84%
These thought forms are
passed across time and space.

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And if we in any way buy
into the teachings-- which

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:08.795 align:middle line:84%
are put out in mass media,
in magazines, et cetera--

00:27:08.795 --> 00:27:12.620 align:middle line:84%
then these become
reinforcing of the tone,

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:15.670 align:middle line:84%
and we vibrate at that lower
essence, which you spoke about

00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:16.950 align:middle line:90%
in the beginning.

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And so we carry
these around with us.

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:22.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, once we recognize them,
we can do something about it.

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:26.740 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to carry
poverty, hatred, anger, hurt,

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:29.500 align:middle line:84%
frustration, the
delusion that we

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:31.240 align:middle line:90%
are separate from other beings.

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:34.900 align:middle line:84%
We can heal ourselves, bring all
that back into ourselves, which

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:36.930 align:middle line:84%
is the process of
self-reflection.

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And we can be human,
rather than just act

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:43.600 align:middle line:84%
as a vehicle which is here
to decorate the planet.

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.322 align:middle line:90%
We can do something.

00:27:45.322 --> 00:27:46.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And I interviewed Tom
Campbell, the author

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:51.900 align:middle line:84%
of "My Big TOE," which
is Theory of Everything.

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:55.304 align:middle line:84%
And he's a physicist, and he was
one of the original people that

00:27:55.304 --> 00:27:56.970 align:middle line:84%
was working with
Robert Monroe when they

00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:57.990 align:middle line:84%
were building all
the experiments.

00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.820 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: I knew Robert Monroe.

00:27:58.820 --> 00:27:59.320 align:middle line:90%
I loved him.

00:27:59.320 --> 00:27:59.870 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:00.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:02.350 align:middle line:90%
And a wonderful man.

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And his-- the way
he terms reality

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:10.850 align:middle line:84%
is that it's a mass rendering,
as though you would render

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:14.500 align:middle line:84%
an image-- a video
image on a computer

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:17.650 align:middle line:84%
to come together and
become a physical reality.

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:19.880 align:middle line:84%
That it was a mass
rendering of consciousness.

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:23.870 align:middle line:84%
So this mass cultural
hypnosis you're talking about

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:29.810 align:middle line:84%
is a rendering of reality that
is as alive as its own entity,

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:30.960 align:middle line:90%
as her dog was.

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:31.900 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Absolutely.

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:32.690 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:34.356 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
we're going to create

00:28:34.356 --> 00:28:36.470 align:middle line:84%
that as a physical reality
over time, in some way.

00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:37.345 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: And we are.

00:28:37.345 --> 00:28:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is-- this is
where the power of prophecy

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:45.067 align:middle line:84%
can be quite degrading
to the human spirit.

00:28:45.067 --> 00:28:46.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Talk about that.

00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:47.669 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
power of prophecy

00:28:47.669 --> 00:28:50.210 align:middle line:84%
and what's happening when you're
in a psychic session, what's

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:51.560 align:middle line:90%
actually being read.

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:53.160 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of
thoughts on that, too.

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:55.618 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, we're talking
prophecy in a grander scheme.

00:28:55.618 --> 00:28:56.900 align:middle line:90%


00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:59.576 align:middle line:10%
Prophecy in a grander
scheme, my perception--

00:28:59.576 --> 00:29:00.450 align:middle line:10%
this is a perception.

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:04.120 align:middle line:10%
And by the way, you know nothing
I say here is an absolute.

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:06.980 align:middle line:84%
Because if we go there, we're
completely screwed, right?

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:08.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You say everything
you say is just a suggestion.

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:09.976 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: It's a suggestion.

00:29:09.976 --> 00:29:13.150 align:middle line:84%
Because the idea is people can
learn from anything anybody

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:15.747 align:middle line:84%
says but rise above
it and go beyond it.

00:29:15.747 --> 00:29:17.330 align:middle line:84%
Now prophecy-- to
my line of thinking,

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:18.621 align:middle line:90%
there's two levels of prophecy.

00:29:18.621 --> 00:29:19.850 align:middle line:90%


00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:24.720 align:middle line:84%
The base level of prophecy is
the very low spiritual essence

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.480 align:middle line:84%
whereby, if we're
talking dimensions,

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.680 align:middle line:84%
if we speak dimensions,
you basically--

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.290 align:middle line:84%
if you could imagine,
like here, this

00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:33.950 align:middle line:84%
is five-sensory-- sight,
sound, taste, touch, smell.

00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:36.410 align:middle line:84%
Then we step out a little
bit into a higher vibration.

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:37.734 align:middle line:90%
We're in our astral body.

00:29:37.734 --> 00:29:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And then we move
all the way back,

00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:40.714 align:middle line:90%
and we keep going 180 degrees.

00:29:40.714 --> 00:29:41.380 align:middle line:90%
We're over here.

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:44.980 align:middle line:84%
We are pure, absolute,
complete mergence

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:46.940 align:middle line:84%
into the meditation,
the love, the light.

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:49.260 align:middle line:84%
Now anything less
than that mergence,

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:54.130 align:middle line:84%
and we are moving around
inside the spectrum of thought.

00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:57.600 align:middle line:84%
Multidimensional-- parallel
universes, alternate realities,

00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.710 align:middle line:84%
past lives, future
lives, et cetera.

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:03.460 align:middle line:84%
All of those, time disappears
and takes on different nature

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:05.325 align:middle line:84%
and becomes a
different possibility.

00:30:05.325 --> 00:30:06.450 align:middle line:90%


00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:10.040 align:middle line:84%
At the lowest level
in the movement

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:12.590 align:middle line:84%
into the spiritual
realm, in the psychic,

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:13.840 align:middle line:90%
in the very low psychic area--

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:15.256 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
lower astral realm.

00:30:15.256 --> 00:30:17.320 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Lower
astral realm, we are

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:21.862 align:middle line:84%
subject to impressions
which are-- ultimately,

00:30:21.862 --> 00:30:23.820 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the day,
they're our impressions.

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:26.150 align:middle line:84%
But they are
impressions which come

00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:29.670 align:middle line:84%
from the multifaceted aspect
that we are, which might have,

00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:32.400 align:middle line:84%
at least in humanity,
seven billion parts.

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And then all the past life
aspects and soul aspects.

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:40.650 align:middle line:10%
So when we move into this
psychic and the lower astral

00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:43.510 align:middle line:10%
realm, the prophecy
oftentimes becomes

00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:47.980 align:middle line:10%
very, very much a reinforcement
of the energies, which

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:52.010 align:middle line:10%
are the dogs and the other
thought forms, which actually

00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:55.160 align:middle line:10%
surround the soul at
that level of creation.

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And so a low-level
psychic reader-- and I

00:30:58.370 --> 00:30:59.870 align:middle line:84%
say this with
respect, because there

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:01.510 align:middle line:84%
are people who are
truly wonderful,

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:03.120 align:middle line:84%
and there are people,
it's like, questionable.

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:03.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Gotcha.

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:06.860 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: So what happens is
at the low level, what they're

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:09.867 align:middle line:84%
doing is bringing
their own 432 hertz

00:31:09.867 --> 00:31:11.950 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is-- that's
the good energy, right?

00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:13.200 align:middle line:90%
I should pick a different one.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:16.880 align:middle line:84%
But they're bringing in
their own lower vibration.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:20.310 align:middle line:84%
They're actually reading
from the low-level vibration

00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:25.340 align:middle line:84%
of themselves into the auric
field of the soul that they're

00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:28.020 align:middle line:84%
working with, and then
they're giving a prophecy

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:29.270 align:middle line:90%
based upon that.

00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:32.170 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, it will
be self-fulfilling

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:34.795 align:middle line:84%
because the vibration
is so aligned

00:31:34.795 --> 00:31:36.420 align:middle line:84%
that the soul who's
getting the reading

00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:39.270 align:middle line:84%
will then reinforce the
already existing dogs.

00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:39.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because they're
thinking about it.

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:41.425 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Because they're
thinking and they're creating,

00:31:41.425 --> 00:31:43.040 align:middle line:84%
and then they're
living out of it.

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:46.920 align:middle line:84%
Now the high level, the
high-level prophecies,

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.990 align:middle line:84%
are the likes of
the great beings

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:54.540 align:middle line:84%
who really are ecstatic
with love and light and joy.

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:55.392 align:middle line:90%
These are the Rumis.

00:31:55.392 --> 00:31:56.225 align:middle line:90%
These are the Hafiz.

00:31:56.225 --> 00:31:59.990 align:middle line:84%
These are the-- the great ones,
like the Christ and the Buddha.

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:05.955 align:middle line:10%
These are the great beings
who have created a pathway

00:32:05.955 --> 00:32:08.330 align:middle line:10%
to literally-- I'm just trying
to think of the right word

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:09.760 align:middle line:10%
to use.

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:13.660 align:middle line:84%
It's like we penetrate
through the thickness

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:17.340 align:middle line:84%
of the veil of heavy
cultural thought forms.

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:22.570 align:middle line:10%
These beings are already so
highly evolved and enlightened

00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:26.860 align:middle line:10%
that they shine a path through
and they enlighten-- wherever

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:29.000 align:middle line:10%
they go, they have
this radiant energy

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.870 align:middle line:10%
which changes everything
in their presence.

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:33.030 align:middle line:90%
There are no miracles.

00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:34.780 align:middle line:84%
They are the miracle,
and they remind us

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:36.000 align:middle line:90%
that we're the miracle.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.300 align:middle line:10%
Now when they reach
this higher level,

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:40.250 align:middle line:10%
these thought
forms which they're

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:44.000 align:middle line:10%
putting in place-- like peace,
compassion, love, truth,

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.010 align:middle line:10%
righteousness,
nonviolence, equanimity,

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:49.420 align:middle line:10%
all of those overridingly
beautiful energies,

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:51.385 align:middle line:10%
they couch in subtle teachings.

00:32:51.385 --> 00:32:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And the subtle teachings
can be parables.

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:55.810 align:middle line:84%
They can be
metaphors, et cetera.

00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And they give them as
a prophetic message

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:02.230 align:middle line:84%
for when we're
ready to actually be

00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:05.410 align:middle line:84%
able to walk into
those subtle teachings.

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the
experience of what

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:09.474 align:middle line:84%
those masters have
already put in place.

00:33:09.474 --> 00:33:10.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:13.570 align:middle line:10%
>>TAYLOR: So great teachings--
the poetry of Rumi,

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:16.847 align:middle line:10%
et cetera, all of that is
like, you can dance in it.

00:33:16.847 --> 00:33:17.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:20.230 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: It's like Jabbar.

00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:24.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you remember--
he was a mystic, a Sufi mystic,

00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:25.460 align:middle line:90%
way back.

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:27.360 align:middle line:90%
I think it was about 1200.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:32.810 align:middle line:84%
But he never, ever spoke in
the language of his people.

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:34.744 align:middle line:90%
He always spoke rubbish.

00:33:34.744 --> 00:33:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And so people would
go to him and they'd

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:38.610 align:middle line:84%
have these beautiful experiences
of love and enlightenment

00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:38.990 align:middle line:90%
and joy--

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:39.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Makes sense.

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.124 align:middle line:84%
They can't attach a
thought form to it.

00:33:41.124 --> 00:33:43.700 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Because that is the
origin of the word "gibberish."

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:44.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting!

00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:45.460 align:middle line:10%
>>TAYLOR: And that's where
we get "gibberish" from,

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:47.420 align:middle line:10%
because he was
talking gibberish.

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:48.560 align:middle line:10%
Because no one could--

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:50.560 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: But he was
giving them the experience.

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Because like
Bob Monroe used to say,

00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:56.420 align:middle line:84%
I will not use language
which you can identify with.

00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Because if I use language
you identify with,

00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:00.092 align:middle line:84%
you will go into
that thought form

00:34:00.092 --> 00:34:02.300 align:middle line:84%
and you would have the
limitation of that experience.

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:03.175 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:34:03.175 --> 00:34:03.950 align:middle line:90%


00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:04.714 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:04.714 --> 00:34:05.956 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: I was
getting carried away.

00:34:05.956 --> 00:34:06.420 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:07.628 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it's wonderful.

00:34:07.628 --> 00:34:08.760 align:middle line:90%
There's-- we can carry on.

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:11.051 align:middle line:84%
I have so many more things
I want to talk to you about.

00:34:11.051 --> 00:34:13.989 align:middle line:84%
One of the things you talk about
within this whole illusion,

00:34:13.989 --> 00:34:16.830 align:middle line:84%
the dream that we
create, is the notion

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:20.010 align:middle line:84%
of karma, which you say is
very much misunderstood.

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:23.619 align:middle line:84%
In fact, even what the word
means is misunderstood.

00:34:23.619 --> 00:34:24.889 align:middle line:90%


00:34:24.889 --> 00:34:29.199 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: You know, the
way I perceive it, again,

00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:34.300 align:middle line:84%
is that through the time frame
of-- I'm kind of guessing

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:37.060 align:middle line:84%
the 1900s, with the
Theosophical movement,

00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:41.489 align:middle line:84%
through all the movement of what
ultimately became the Western

00:34:41.489 --> 00:34:43.734 align:middle line:84%
mystery traditions, in
the West in the 1900s--

00:34:43.734 --> 00:34:45.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, Helena
Blavatsky and all that.

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah, and the
classical physics, Newtonian.

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:52.540 align:middle line:84%
There came this mechanistic
model of the world.

00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And the mechanistic
model of the world

00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:58.730 align:middle line:84%
is a cause-effect model, a
very linear cause-effect model.

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:01.030 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened
is, it's like, well,

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:02.950 align:middle line:90%
as you sow, so shall you reap.

00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And that becomes
the law of karma.

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:07.170 align:middle line:90%
And yes, it is, in a way.

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:10.350 align:middle line:84%
However, karma-- again,
a Sanskrit word--

00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:13.717 align:middle line:84%
simply means one thing,
and that is action.

00:35:13.717 --> 00:35:14.550 align:middle line:90%
That's all it means.

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:15.690 align:middle line:90%
It means action.

00:35:15.690 --> 00:35:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Now we can attribute
anything we want to it.

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:20.930 align:middle line:90%
But karma means action.

00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:24.970 align:middle line:84%
Now the place of action is
in the physical reality,

00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:29.150 align:middle line:84%
where we are engaged actively
in one of two things.

00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:33.300 align:middle line:84%
We're either moving away from
love or moving towards love.

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:36.170 align:middle line:84%
Now the way I have
understood this,

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:39.580 align:middle line:84%
and that's simply
one suggestion,

00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:45.690 align:middle line:84%
is that this vehicle, the
physical vehicle, through which

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:49.630 align:middle line:84%
we inhabit as a
spiritual being, we've

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:53.230 align:middle line:84%
got all the gifts
available to us to act.

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And how we act is going to
make the world of difference

00:35:56.280 --> 00:36:00.160 align:middle line:84%
to what vibrations we share with
the other aspects of ourselves

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:03.160 align:middle line:84%
which we're interacting
with at all levels of being.

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:08.410 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, when we look at
this body-- this body, to me,

00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:11.449 align:middle line:90%
at birth, is my blessing body.

00:36:11.449 --> 00:36:13.490 align:middle line:84%
Now some people say, well,
it's your karmic body.

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:14.531 align:middle line:90%
This is my blessing body.

00:36:14.531 --> 00:36:16.900 align:middle line:84%
This is all the
blessings I've got.

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:18.230 align:middle line:90%
It involves my talents.

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:20.460 align:middle line:84%
It involves all the
possibilities that I have.

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And some of the talents
may be sickness.

00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:25.260 align:middle line:90%
It may be weaknesses, et cetera.

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:28.680 align:middle line:84%
It's got everything that
marks me for who I am.

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:30.930 align:middle line:84%
But the beauty of
the blessing body,

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:34.260 align:middle line:84%
which is the capacity
to play actions

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:37.620 align:middle line:84%
in this physical reality
of linear time-space,

00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:42.080 align:middle line:84%
is that if we actually
constantly move towards love,

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:45.830 align:middle line:84%
away from that which is the
illusion of what we think

00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:48.950 align:middle line:84%
love is and into the experience
of love, which we can't put

00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:54.520 align:middle line:84%
words to, then what happens
is an act of grace intervenes.

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And karma gets
dissolved, or effaced.

00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:01.610 align:middle line:10%
Now I'm not talking about
some character sitting up

00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:04.760 align:middle line:10%
there saying, let me see,
what did Regina to today?

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.620 align:middle line:90%
Oh, she was good, you know?

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:07.140 align:middle line:90%
Bang!

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:07.760 align:middle line:90%
That's gone.

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:09.480 align:middle line:90%
It's not about that.

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:14.070 align:middle line:84%
It's about the energy balance
in the entire meditation

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:16.160 align:middle line:84%
of the absolute
principle of love.

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:19.420 align:middle line:84%
As we move into
that space of love,

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:24.410 align:middle line:84%
the more we do that, the
blessing body effaces actions--

00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:26.620 align:middle line:84%
which may be in these
parallel universes,

00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:28.880 align:middle line:84%
like the little
dogs, which becomes

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:31.740 align:middle line:84%
like the shadows and the
fears of previous life

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:33.520 align:middle line:90%
and previous incarnations.

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:36.805 align:middle line:84%
So inherently, karma,
therefore, is a blessing

00:37:36.805 --> 00:37:39.490 align:middle line:84%
that we can work
with to look at who

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:42.630 align:middle line:84%
we are, to master the
energies of our life,

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:46.550 align:middle line:84%
and to use it to rise above the
limitations that are imposed

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:48.630 align:middle line:84%
upon us when we accept
other people's thought

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:50.230 align:middle line:90%
forms as our own.

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:51.647 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Essentially
dissolving--

00:37:51.647 --> 00:37:52.521 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Dissolving.

00:37:52.521 --> 00:37:53.280 align:middle line:90%
Effacing--

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:53.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All the rest.

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:54.735 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Absolutely.

00:37:54.735 --> 00:37:55.315 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:55.315 --> 00:37:56.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
I mean obviously,

00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:58.330 align:middle line:84%
that's kind of the
end of the story.

00:37:58.330 --> 00:38:00.820 align:middle line:90%
That's where we want to end up.

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:04.540 align:middle line:84%
OK, so when we're looking at
the creation of the reality,

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:09.320 align:middle line:84%
you also point to the notion
that quantum physics itself

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:16.110 align:middle line:84%
has already essentially proven
that nothing exists until you

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:18.350 align:middle line:84%
witness it, believe
it, and dream it.

00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: It's an
observation, yes.

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:21.253 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If it's not an
observation, it does not exist.

00:38:21.253 --> 00:38:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Now this has been-- I've
interviewed many people

00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:24.623 align:middle line:90%
in the world of quantum physics.

00:38:24.623 --> 00:38:27.260 align:middle line:84%
So let's just say they've
come to that conclusion.

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:29.047 align:middle line:84%
Nothing exists
until it's observed.

00:38:29.047 --> 00:38:29.630 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yes.

00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:30.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:32.546 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what does that
mean for our creation of life?

00:38:32.546 --> 00:38:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And then talking
about observation,

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:38.040 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to have you carry
this into how what we observe,

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:42.010 align:middle line:84%
even externally, even down
into a physical reality--

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:44.929 align:middle line:84%
and the man who viewed the
pictures, who had the illness

00:38:44.929 --> 00:38:45.470 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:47.840 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the notion
of creation of reality

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:49.590 align:middle line:90%
in a quantum sense, that way.

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:51.741 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, you know,
the principle-- and I'm

00:38:51.741 --> 00:38:52.740 align:middle line:90%
not a quantum physicist.

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:53.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:56.320 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: But the principle
of the quantum physicists

00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:00.650 align:middle line:84%
simply tells us that by the
very act of observation,

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:02.860 align:middle line:90%
something becomes manifest.

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:05.870 align:middle line:84%
In other words, wherever you
place your conscious awareness,

00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:07.800 align:middle line:90%
such shall be the outcome.

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:10.980 align:middle line:84%
Now in terms of
how that manifests,

00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:14.860 align:middle line:84%
therefore, it's like-- let's
just go through a basic model

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:15.500 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:17.400 align:middle line:90%
And I explained it in the book.

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:20.080 align:middle line:84%
It's basically-- we're
not our physical body.

00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:21.260 align:middle line:90%
We believe we are.

00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:23.290 align:middle line:84%
We act as though we
are, but we're not.

00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:26.140 align:middle line:84%
The physical body is,
at the end of the day,

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:28.590 align:middle line:84%
if we just keep pushing down
into the furthest reaches,

00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:29.590 align:middle line:90%
we can say it's energy.

00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And then beyond energy, it
is simply a field of light.

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And beyond a field of light,
we can't even define it.

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:38.440 align:middle line:84%
We could-- we do get attached
to the physical body.

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:40.510 align:middle line:84%
We believe we're
the physical body.

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:42.820 align:middle line:84%
We act as if it's
the physical body.

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And as a consequence, therefore,
we are tied to our karma,

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:48.290 align:middle line:84%
because this is the
physical reality.

00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:52.160 align:middle line:84%
Now quantum physics says, but
that's an illusion, you know?

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:55.470 align:middle line:84%
The physical body is
not really an existence.

00:39:55.470 --> 00:39:57.540 align:middle line:90%
It's a field of possibility.

00:39:57.540 --> 00:40:00.250 align:middle line:84%
When you go back to your
emotional body, which

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:02.140 align:middle line:84%
doesn't necessarily
exist separate,

00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:03.925 align:middle line:90%
but it's a higher experience--

00:40:03.925 --> 00:40:06.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the hierarchy,
it's above the physical.

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:08.310 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: It's a higher-- yeah.

00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:10.994 align:middle line:84%
Now how many people act as if
they're their emotional body?

00:40:10.994 --> 00:40:11.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:13.035 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: We defend
our emotions,

00:40:13.035 --> 00:40:14.800 align:middle line:84%
and we argue for
emotions, and that's

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.540 align:middle line:90%
the same thing as Rajneesh said.

00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:20.017 align:middle line:84%
You know, well, hey, if
you want to avoid truth,

00:40:20.017 --> 00:40:21.100 align:middle line:90%
then believe in something.

00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:22.800 align:middle line:90%
So we argue for these emotions.

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:25.300 align:middle line:84%
We're greater than our physical,
greater than our emotional,

00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:26.841 align:middle line:84%
we're greater than
our mental-- we're

00:40:26.841 --> 00:40:28.510 align:middle line:84%
greater than anything
we can conceive.

00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:31.061 align:middle line:84%
And I put in the book, and I
know that this doesn't always

00:40:31.061 --> 00:40:32.560 align:middle line:84%
sit too well with
people, but you're

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:35.720 align:middle line:84%
greater than anything you
can conceive, including God.

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:36.387 align:middle line:90%
You say, oh my--

00:40:36.387 --> 00:40:38.344 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm going to
get to that in a moment.

00:40:38.344 --> 00:40:38.870 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:41.960 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Now pulling this-- now
that doesn't mean to say-- it's

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:42.914 align:middle line:90%
our concept of God.

00:40:42.914 --> 00:40:43.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:44.180 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:45.280 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Now pushing
this back further,

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.820 align:middle line:84%
and coming to where you
were on those photographs--

00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:49.610 align:middle line:84%
which I believe
you're talking about--

00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:51.026 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The man,
the client that

00:40:51.026 --> 00:40:52.180 align:middle line:90%
came in who had phys-- yes.

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:54.640 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: So this client
comes in for a healing session

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:57.789 align:middle line:84%
and has a significant
illness going on.

00:40:57.789 --> 00:40:59.580 align:middle line:84%
Now there's actually
a couple of dimensions

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:01.610 align:middle line:84%
to this, one of
which is in the book.

00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:04.850 align:middle line:84%
The client comes in and
has this physical illness.

00:41:04.850 --> 00:41:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm watching what's
unfolding in spirit,

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:10.720 align:middle line:84%
and the first thing I see
are a series of images,

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:11.472 align:middle line:90%
like photographs.

00:41:11.472 --> 00:41:13.180 align:middle line:84%
This is like, there
are some photographs.

00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
do you have anything

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:17.910 align:middle line:84%
to do with photography,
photographs, et cetera?

00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And the answer was yes,
you know, I do photography.

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And in actual fact, I work
with photographs for magazines.

00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:28.352 align:middle line:90%
Or I did.

00:41:28.352 --> 00:41:29.560 align:middle line:90%
"Did" was the operative word.

00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that was--
these images were his life.

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:31.990 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yes.

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And the point was that I was
pressed in spirit to say, well,

00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:39.060 align:middle line:90%
these images are important.

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:40.847 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about these
images, and tell me

00:41:40.847 --> 00:41:42.180 align:middle line:90%
when you were working with them.

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Because the images which I was
being shown were images of war,

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:47.880 align:middle line:90%
death, and destruction.

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:51.700 align:middle line:84%
They were extremely hard to
even see in spirit, to look at.

00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:52.905 align:middle line:90%
They were violent images.

00:41:52.905 --> 00:41:55.074 align:middle line:90%


00:41:55.074 --> 00:41:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And I know most of your viewers
will know exactly what I'm

00:41:57.490 --> 00:41:59.781 align:middle line:84%
talking about, and I don't
want to bring the images up.

00:41:59.781 --> 00:42:01.490 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine,
because it goes back

00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:04.270 align:middle line:84%
to-- I think it was in
Cambodia, the monk which

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:06.687 align:middle line:90%
was self-immolating himself.

00:42:06.687 --> 00:42:07.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:09.730 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: So having said that,
this wasn't that time frame,

00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:11.200 align:middle line:90%
but this was a war scenario.

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.550 align:middle line:84%
Could have been Bosnia,
I think, at the time.

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:18.390 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, the point
was that this client

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:21.975 align:middle line:84%
had been working with these
photographs, and then stopped.

00:42:21.975 --> 00:42:23.510 align:middle line:90%


00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And the question was, when did
you stop and why did you stop?

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:30.990 align:middle line:84%
I stopped because I
actually became very sick.

00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:31.540 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:34.426 align:middle line:84%
It was the exact same time--
there was a time frame.

00:42:34.426 --> 00:42:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And the point which
was made, and which

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:39.770 align:middle line:84%
was very, very important,
was that these images, which

00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:43.510 align:middle line:84%
are photographic images,
actually, there was--

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:46.030 align:middle line:84%
through the multidimensional
aspect of our being,

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:48.600 align:middle line:84%
through our parallel
universes, through past life,

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:53.010 align:middle line:84%
present life, future life,
through the impressions which

00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:58.600 align:middle line:84%
were in spirit upon these
images, which were taken

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:01.460 align:middle line:84%
by this person, cut and
prepared for a magazine,

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:06.530 align:middle line:84%
had impacted her soul and
had linked her whole being

00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:09.460 align:middle line:84%
across time and space
to the being that

00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:11.511 align:middle line:90%
had the suffering at the moment.

00:43:11.511 --> 00:43:13.010 align:middle line:84%
Now she wasn't--
he wasn't, rather--

00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:16.930 align:middle line:84%
present at the time of those
particular events taking place,

00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:18.674 align:middle line:90%
but the observation--

00:43:18.674 --> 00:43:19.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The imprint.

00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:21.214 align:middle line:10%
>>TAYLOR: Of those
images, the imprint,

00:43:21.214 --> 00:43:23.290 align:middle line:10%
was so profound that
what happened was

00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:28.400 align:middle line:10%
it caused an imprint upon
her own energetic or quantum

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.510 align:middle line:10%
level of reality.

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:33.760 align:middle line:10%
Because she collapsed, or
he collapsed, into reality

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:38.370 align:middle line:10%
those experiences so real
that they started to manifest

00:43:38.370 --> 00:43:40.270 align:middle line:10%
in the actual physical body.

00:43:40.270 --> 00:43:44.359 align:middle line:84%
They became blockages in
the actual physical body.

00:43:44.359 --> 00:43:44.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:45.980 align:middle line:90%
OK, interesting.

00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:48.410 align:middle line:90%
Now-- OK.

00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:52.134 align:middle line:84%
Let's extend this into the
mass cultural hypnosis.

00:43:52.134 --> 00:43:53.496 align:middle line:90%


00:43:53.496 --> 00:43:55.705 align:middle line:84%
These images are being shown
on television every day.

00:43:55.705 --> 00:43:56.662 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: All the time.

00:43:56.662 --> 00:43:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're in a very, very
bad period of history today.

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:02.600 align:middle line:84%
These horrid images from
Palestine are flying around

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:08.630 align:middle line:84%
the internet today, that really,
it's-- I feel it's almost

00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:11.560 align:middle line:84%
damaging to take
it in in that way.

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:12.682 align:middle line:90%
We know what's going on.

00:44:12.682 --> 00:44:14.390 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: There's
absolutely no question.

00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it's going
to damage our psyche forever.

00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And so this is being
perpetuated, however,

00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:23.900 align:middle line:84%
by the mass cultural
hypnosis, which you say

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:28.350 align:middle line:84%
is overseen and
inspired by unseen

00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:31.270 align:middle line:84%
forces that live in
another dimensional field.

00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:32.270 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about it.

00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:35.760 align:middle line:84%
Because we have the
essence of the brilliant

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:39.730 align:middle line:84%
we won't give a name to, and
the brilliant in ourselves,

00:44:39.730 --> 00:44:41.760 align:middle line:84%
that's constantly
being challenged

00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:45.250 align:middle line:84%
by actual beings who exist
in other dimensions that

00:44:45.250 --> 00:44:47.090 align:middle line:90%
are perpetuating this darkness.

00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:47.704 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yes.

00:44:47.704 --> 00:44:48.203 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:48.203 --> 00:44:49.320 align:middle line:90%


00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:56.600 align:middle line:84%
There is no question in my mind,
in my experience, that there

00:44:56.600 --> 00:45:00.810 align:middle line:84%
is-- let me put it this way
and just see if we can follow.

00:45:00.810 --> 00:45:02.900 align:middle line:90%


00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:05.970 align:middle line:84%
We look at time, and we
tend to think of time

00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:08.930 align:middle line:84%
by a clock or a calendar,
and we monitor things,

00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:10.180 align:middle line:90%
and we say, well, that's life.

00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:12.555 align:middle line:84%
You know, that was my life,
that's my grandfather's life,

00:45:12.555 --> 00:45:13.630 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:16.780 align:middle line:84%
But the actual
principle of time is

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:20.240 align:middle line:84%
something which is part of
the hypnosis that we live in.

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:23.429 align:middle line:10%
Now once we get outside
of the physical reality

00:45:23.429 --> 00:45:24.970 align:middle line:10%
and outside of the
emotional reality,

00:45:24.970 --> 00:45:26.960 align:middle line:10%
and go right back
into spirit and just

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:29.100 align:middle line:10%
keep going further
back, what we find

00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:32.075 align:middle line:10%
is that the great teachings
of all traditions-- be it

00:45:32.075 --> 00:45:35.080 align:middle line:10%
the Mayan or be it the
Vedas-- speak about time

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:40.790 align:middle line:10%
as a cyclical, grand possibility
which is forever unfolding.

00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is there is
this involution of beingness

00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:48.700 align:middle line:84%
into a space where
we all realize

00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:51.100 align:middle line:90%
that we are literally one.

00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:54.500 align:middle line:84%
And then we break away
and take the brilliance

00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:57.730 align:middle line:84%
of what we've learned as
we've gone into time back

00:45:57.730 --> 00:46:00.840 align:middle line:84%
to that point within the
heart of the meditation.

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:06.370 align:middle line:84%
So in that journey of coming to
this oneness, we get to a place

00:46:06.370 --> 00:46:12.040 align:middle line:84%
where we've had infinite
experiences of pursuing love.

00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:13.105 align:middle line:90%
Infinite experiences.

00:46:13.105 --> 00:46:14.410 align:middle line:90%


00:46:14.410 --> 00:46:18.180 align:middle line:84%
In that journey, there are
not only the soul beings

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:22.020 align:middle line:84%
that we've had, but we have
had experiences of pain, hurt,

00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:23.440 align:middle line:90%
suffering, anguish, darkness.

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:24.890 align:middle line:90%


00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:28.670 align:middle line:84%
Those parts which, if we don't
heal them, they break away.

00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:30.400 align:middle line:84%
And they resonate
with each other,

00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:33.680 align:middle line:84%
and then they take up
their own form in spirit.

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And they become-- like
an angel is a form to us,

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:39.370 align:middle line:84%
these become demons,
which are forms to us.

00:46:39.370 --> 00:46:42.280 align:middle line:84%
Now an angel is as real
as you and I are here.

00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:44.080 align:middle line:84%
I have no question
at all about that.

00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:46.050 align:middle line:90%
But a demon is, as well.

00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:48.690 align:middle line:10%
And so there is
this-- inside us,

00:46:48.690 --> 00:46:50.210 align:middle line:10%
there is this
battle that's going

00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:52.800 align:middle line:10%
on between the
truth of who we are,

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:56.320 align:middle line:10%
which is our light essence, our
love, and then the darkness.

00:46:56.320 --> 00:47:00.072 align:middle line:84%
But these aspects
of our-- and I'm

00:47:00.072 --> 00:47:01.530 align:middle line:84%
going to use the
word demon, right?

00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:03.385 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the
easiest way to say it.

00:47:03.385 --> 00:47:04.593 align:middle line:90%
The shadow part of ourselves.

00:47:04.593 --> 00:47:05.500 align:middle line:90%


00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:09.030 align:middle line:84%
They belong to a
hierarchy in the same way

00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:10.730 align:middle line:90%
as we belong to a family.

00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:13.610 align:middle line:10%
And so these aspects
actually start

00:47:13.610 --> 00:47:17.570 align:middle line:10%
to endeavor to
manipulate the greatest

00:47:17.570 --> 00:47:22.040 align:middle line:10%
gift we have inside creation,
and that is the imagination.

00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:23.390 align:middle line:10%
There is nothing more powerful.

00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:24.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:25.910 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: And so we
have the imagination,

00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:28.400 align:middle line:84%
which means we can
think outside the box.

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:31.050 align:middle line:84%
We can find ways to love like
we've never loved before.

00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:34.910 align:middle line:84%
However, if you can
control the imagination,

00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:37.710 align:middle line:84%
if you can limit the
expanse of light,

00:47:37.710 --> 00:47:40.580 align:middle line:84%
if you can bring
darkness into a corner

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:44.427 align:middle line:84%
and then eradicate the light
simply by bringing darkness--

00:47:44.427 --> 00:47:45.760 align:middle line:90%
the light never ceases to exist.

00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:46.426 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:46.426 --> 00:47:48.620 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: What you will do
is you will instill fear.

00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And it is literally-- these
beings do exist in spirit.

00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:56.160 align:middle line:84%
I've met them, and
I have no question

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:57.430 align:middle line:90%
at all about these characters.

00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:57.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:57.730 --> 00:48:00.040 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: I mean, I've come
face-to-face with them.

00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And they are--
they're in my reality.

00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:04.900 align:middle line:90%
They're part of who I am.

00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And so as a consequence
of that, our greatest gift

00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:13.410 align:middle line:84%
is to be able to constantly have
the courage, the willingness,

00:48:13.410 --> 00:48:16.830 align:middle line:84%
the forthrightness, to
actually step up to the plate

00:48:16.830 --> 00:48:21.260 align:middle line:84%
and challenge every single
part of our shadow self.

00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:23.797 align:middle line:84%
Because that may be in the
physical, the emotional,

00:48:23.797 --> 00:48:24.880 align:middle line:90%
the mental, the spiritual.

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:27.380 align:middle line:84%
It goes all the way up till we
get into that space of light.

00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:28.450 align:middle line:90%


00:48:28.450 --> 00:48:29.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
within this process,

00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:31.370 align:middle line:84%
it means challenging
what we have

00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:33.850 align:middle line:90%
held to be true to ourselves.

00:48:33.850 --> 00:48:36.790 align:middle line:84%
On all levels, but part of
it is what's essentially

00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:38.394 align:middle line:84%
being cast from
the outside to us--

00:48:38.394 --> 00:48:39.810 align:middle line:84%
and you say this
in the book, that

00:48:39.810 --> 00:48:42.090 align:middle line:84%
the fear you were talking
about, the anger, the fear,

00:48:42.090 --> 00:48:46.270 align:middle line:84%
and so forth-- in order to be
manipulated by something larger

00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:50.610 align:middle line:84%
and even beyond us, it needs
to be reduced to an image.

00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is how the mass
cultural hypnosis works.

00:48:55.550 --> 00:48:58.930 align:middle line:84%
Everything that is
desired to keep you small

00:48:58.930 --> 00:49:01.550 align:middle line:84%
and away from your
true imagination

00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:03.242 align:middle line:90%
is reduced to an image.

00:49:03.242 --> 00:49:04.950 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about this
phenomenon and give

00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:06.680 align:middle line:90%
examples of how that works.

00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, I mean, if
you look at the greatest

00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:15.760 align:middle line:84%
images which people aspire to--
it'll put atheists in this,

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:18.310 align:middle line:84%
and you'll understand
where I'm going with this--

00:49:18.310 --> 00:49:21.310 align:middle line:90%
is that we anthropomorphize God.

00:49:21.310 --> 00:49:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And so we create
an image of God.

00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:26.770 align:middle line:84%
So Jesus is God,
or Mother Mary is

00:49:26.770 --> 00:49:29.370 align:middle line:90%
the mother of the living Christ.

00:49:29.370 --> 00:49:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the
Buddha, who I understand,

00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:33.410 align:middle line:90%
they say is not a religion.

00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:35.180 align:middle line:90%
But here's the issue.

00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:36.530 align:middle line:90%


00:49:36.530 --> 00:49:40.540 align:middle line:84%
Every thought process
is a religion.

00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:44.700 align:middle line:84%
Because every single
one has its own god.

00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:45.960 align:middle line:90%


00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:48.910 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physics has
the great god Random,

00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:51.720 align:middle line:84%
and all of the lesser
deities to which they pray.

00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:55.750 align:middle line:84%
You know, the god of biology,
the god of quantum physics,

00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:57.985 align:middle line:84%
whatever-- these are
all lesser deities.

00:49:57.985 --> 00:50:03.140 align:middle line:84%
The atheist has the great god
of Atheism, the lack of belief,

00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:04.680 align:middle line:90%
to which they pray.

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And then they still have
a belief in themselves--

00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:07.900 align:middle line:90%
which is fine.

00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:10.870 align:middle line:84%
It's oftentimes healthier
than a lot of the others.

00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:13.080 align:middle line:90%
But we image things.

00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:15.980 align:middle line:84%
Now the great master beings
that have walked on this planet

00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:20.420 align:middle line:84%
have always said,
come to this form.

00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:22.600 align:middle line:84%
All right, so that might
be the form of Christ

00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:24.466 align:middle line:90%
or the form of Buddha.

00:50:24.466 --> 00:50:26.360 align:middle line:90%
But test it.

00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Test it and really push every
single part of that test,

00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:33.710 align:middle line:84%
and go through the form and
come out the other side.

00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:35.710 align:middle line:84%
Because if you get
stuck on the form,

00:50:35.710 --> 00:50:38.035 align:middle line:84%
you will never know the
truth of your own being.

00:50:38.035 --> 00:50:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
makes perfect sense.

00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And to name it and then
believe in what you have named

00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:44.270 align:middle line:84%
cuts off your
experience completely.

00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:45.000 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: It limits.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:45.500 align:middle line:90%
It limits.

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And so all the while-- now I
made the point in the book.

00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:51.300 align:middle line:84%
But if you actually look
at all of the images which

00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:53.490 align:middle line:84%
are being projected
upon us-- I mean,

00:50:53.490 --> 00:50:56.230 align:middle line:84%
there are images, not only
the ones we spoke about,

00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:58.650 align:middle line:84%
from violence or
more, et cetera.

00:50:58.650 --> 00:51:01.240 align:middle line:84%
But the pop culture
has got images.

00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:02.876 align:middle line:84%
Now there's nothing
wrong with that.

00:51:02.876 --> 00:51:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And the spiritual journey
is not about being,

00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:06.660 align:middle line:84%
oh, I must be than
holier than thou.

00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:08.840 align:middle line:84%
Because nothing
could be more boring,

00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:11.330 align:middle line:84%
because the great spiritual
beings that I've known

00:51:11.330 --> 00:51:13.720 align:middle line:84%
have always said, one,
I'm going to have fun.

00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:16.010 align:middle line:84%
Two, I'm going to make a
joke out of everything.

00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'll come back
to that in a moment.

00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:20.850 align:middle line:84%
But the real thing
is to actually

00:51:20.850 --> 00:51:23.830 align:middle line:84%
have the willingness,
the willingness

00:51:23.830 --> 00:51:27.750 align:middle line:84%
to break through every single
thought form and realize,

00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:30.660 align:middle line:84%
if you can imagine something,
you have limited yourself.

00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:32.840 align:middle line:90%
You must rise above it.

00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:35.250 align:middle line:90%
See, because mind is my end.

00:51:35.250 --> 00:51:35.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: It's literally
that same thing.

00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so let's
go back to the joke,

00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:39.860 align:middle line:90%
because it is all a game.

00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:40.526 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Right.

00:51:40.526 --> 00:51:44.065 align:middle line:84%
I spoke to you about-- when we
met once before, I spoke to you

00:51:44.065 --> 00:51:48.310 align:middle line:84%
about one of my great teachers
was somebody I loved immensely.

00:51:48.310 --> 00:51:49.170 align:middle line:90%
I still do.

00:51:49.170 --> 00:51:50.207 align:middle line:90%
His name's Jack Curtis.

00:51:50.207 --> 00:51:50.735 align:middle line:90%
He's passed.

00:51:50.735 --> 00:51:51.790 align:middle line:90%


00:51:51.790 --> 00:51:55.190 align:middle line:84%
Jack came to a program
I was teaching.

00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:56.615 align:middle line:90%
Now this is the irony.

00:51:56.615 --> 00:51:57.500 align:middle line:90%


00:51:57.500 --> 00:51:59.000 align:middle line:84%
He came to a program
I was teaching.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know-- I
knew him as a friend

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:04.840 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't know what
he really did know.

00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:06.967 align:middle line:84%
And he came up to me one
day, and he said, Nigel,

00:52:06.967 --> 00:52:09.300 align:middle line:84%
would you like to get together
and discuss some of this?

00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:12.571 align:middle line:84%
He said, I think I could share
a couple of things with you.

00:52:12.571 --> 00:52:14.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, the bottom line
was, as I shared with you,

00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:17.280 align:middle line:84%
Jack wrote for a
few mystery schools.

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:20.160 align:middle line:84%
He was a brilliant man, a
Queen's Counselor in Australia,

00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:23.700 align:middle line:84%
black belt, and he
was in the military.

00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:28.460 align:middle line:84%
He's extremely
well-trained in everything.

00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:32.010 align:middle line:84%
Now Jack, when he passed,
I was at his bedside.

00:52:32.010 --> 00:52:33.670 align:middle line:90%


00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:36.280 align:middle line:84%
This was a profound
experience, to be

00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:37.635 align:middle line:90%
with this man at his passing.

00:52:37.635 --> 00:52:39.190 align:middle line:90%


00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:41.370 align:middle line:84%
I held his hand when you
took his last breath,

00:52:41.370 --> 00:52:46.482 align:middle line:84%
and his words were,
"Nigel, it is all a joke."

00:52:46.482 --> 00:52:47.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I love it.

00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:48.950 align:middle line:90%


00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:50.925 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Because he
saw it for what it was,

00:52:50.925 --> 00:52:52.110 align:middle line:84%
that we had bought
in to things--

00:52:52.110 --> 00:52:53.693 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we
take it so seriously.

00:52:53.693 --> 00:52:55.630 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: We took
it so seriously.

00:52:55.630 --> 00:52:57.869 align:middle line:84%
This is why Rajneesh, and
this is why all these--

00:52:57.869 --> 00:52:59.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They were
always jokesters.

00:52:59.410 --> 00:53:01.050 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Every--
like all of them.

00:53:01.050 --> 00:53:01.550 align:middle line:90%
All of them.

00:53:01.550 --> 00:53:03.170 align:middle line:84%
It's like, and if
you get serious,

00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:04.990 align:middle line:90%
it's like Paramahansa Yogananda.

00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:07.389 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like-- he--
I remember-- Yogananda,

00:53:07.389 --> 00:53:08.805 align:middle line:84%
one of the-- and
I'm paraphrasing.

00:53:08.805 --> 00:53:11.140 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
Yogananda always said.

00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:13.780 align:middle line:10%
He said, you look at
the power of the waves.

00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:16.600 align:middle line:84%
You feel the
majesty of the winds

00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:18.030 align:middle line:90%
when it comes in a hurricane.

00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:20.480 align:middle line:90%
You absolutely embrace the heat.

00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And he said, but this pales,
all, to the significance of one

00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:29.140 align:middle line:90%
thought when you master it.

00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:31.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Isn't
that-- yes, how true.

00:53:31.770 --> 00:53:32.420 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:34.804 align:middle line:84%
Nigel, we're out of time,
and we only got about halfway

00:53:34.804 --> 00:53:35.720 align:middle line:90%
through the interview.

00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:36.005 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:53:36.005 --> 00:53:37.310 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: [LAUGHTER]
Oh, I apologize.

00:53:37.310 --> 00:53:38.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, no,
it's wonderful.

00:53:38.530 --> 00:53:39.750 align:middle line:84%
So I was going to
say, would you be

00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:41.420 align:middle line:84%
willing to come back
and do this again?

00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:42.220 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Oh, of course.

00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:44.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's so much
more of this profound nature

00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:46.070 align:middle line:84%
that we haven't even
scratched the surface of.

00:53:46.070 --> 00:53:48.445 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, it's been my
privilege to share with you.

00:53:48.445 --> 00:53:49.699 align:middle line:90%
And I will say this.

00:53:49.699 --> 00:53:51.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm very grateful you're
doing what you're doing.

00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:52.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:54.580 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Because so many people
can benefit from all the work

00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:54.740 align:middle line:90%
you're doing.

00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:55.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's do
more of this together.

00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:57.854 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, I want
to read one last thing.

00:53:57.854 --> 00:53:59.037 align:middle line:90%
This is a Rumi quote.

00:53:59.037 --> 00:54:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And you can make quick
comment before we sign off.

00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:03.680 align:middle line:10%
It says, "Your task is
not to seek for love,

00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:08.360 align:middle line:10%
but merely to seek and find all
of the barriers within yourself

00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:10.870 align:middle line:10%
that you have felt against it."

00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:11.530 align:middle line:90%
We are love.

00:54:11.530 --> 00:54:12.644 align:middle line:90%
That's the essence of us.

00:54:12.644 --> 00:54:13.810 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: That's who we are.

00:54:13.810 --> 00:54:16.343 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the thing
is, you know, it's

00:54:16.343 --> 00:54:18.611 align:middle line:84%
like, how can anything ever
be said that's more rich

00:54:18.611 --> 00:54:19.110 align:middle line:90%
than that?

00:54:19.110 --> 00:54:22.147 align:middle line:84%
Because what he's saying,
in a nutshell, is you

00:54:22.147 --> 00:54:26.120 align:middle line:84%
will never know love until
you become your truth.

00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:28.870 align:middle line:84%
When you look at
everything-- it's

00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:32.390 align:middle line:84%
like, you drop--
I'm trying to think.

00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:34.260 align:middle line:84%
You know, there
used to be a machine

00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:36.427 align:middle line:84%
you'd drop all these
different-color slides in front

00:54:36.427 --> 00:54:36.926 align:middle line:90%
of.

00:54:36.926 --> 00:54:38.260 align:middle line:90%
It was used for healing.

00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was
called a Bioptron light.

00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And what they would do is
they'd have this Faraday cage,

00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:47.670 align:middle line:84%
and they'd drop in all these
different levels of light.

00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:49.440 align:middle line:10%
Based upon the frequency
of the disease,

00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:50.940 align:middle line:10%
they would pull out
specific things.

00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:51.840 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:54.324 align:middle line:10%
>>TAYLOR: Now if we
kept pulling these out,

00:54:54.324 --> 00:54:56.490 align:middle line:10%
what you're doing is you're
letting the light shine.

00:54:56.490 --> 00:54:57.900 align:middle line:10%
And all he's saying is--

00:54:57.900 --> 00:54:58.630 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Pulling
out the filters.

00:54:58.630 --> 00:54:59.880 align:middle line:10%
>>TAYLOR: Look at who you are.

00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:00.710 align:middle line:90%
Take this away.

00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:01.330 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

00:55:01.330 --> 00:55:02.520 align:middle line:90%


00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:03.670 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:05.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
it's-- it's beautiful.

00:55:05.290 --> 00:55:06.112 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:55:06.112 --> 00:55:07.570 align:middle line:84%
I thought we should
finish on that.

00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:11.170 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to say, until
next time, thank you so much.

00:55:11.170 --> 00:55:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: My absolute pleasure.

00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:14.141 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Regina.

00:55:14.141 --> 00:55:15.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again,
Nigel Taylor's book

00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:17.330 align:middle line:84%
is titled "The Power
Before Thought."

00:55:17.330 --> 00:55:19.390 align:middle line:90%
It's truly enlightening.

00:55:19.390 --> 00:55:22.170 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
