00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: A subject
of great fascination to me

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.990 align:middle line:84%
is the field of microscopy,
and one of its great heroes

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.470 align:middle line:84%
was a man named
Royal Raymond Rife.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.970 align:middle line:10%
His breakthrough
with the invention

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.500 align:middle line:10%
of the universal
microscope allowed science

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.480 align:middle line:10%
to peer into how life works at
incredibly high magnifications.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.160 align:middle line:10%
This was the world's
first glimpse

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.540 align:middle line:10%
into living cancer cells,
virus, and bacteria.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.770 align:middle line:84%
More so, Rife knew
how to reverse

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.470 align:middle line:84%
the damage they caused
by using frequencies.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.500 align:middle line:84%
Remember, this was
nearly 100 years ago,

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.440 align:middle line:84%
while medicine today still
looks for the cure for cancer.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.850 align:middle line:84%
Steve Ross knows more
about Rife's life and work

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.460 align:middle line:84%
than anyone, and
he joins us today

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.400 align:middle line:84%
to tell us about
the troubling tale

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.300 align:middle line:90%
of Rife's life and his work.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And furthermore, you
have a treat ahead.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.970 align:middle line:84%
We are going to
be showing images

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.950 align:middle line:84%
that have never
been seen before.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.010 align:middle line:84%
When you start peering into life
at 3.5 million magnification,

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.150 align:middle line:84%
you realize all
of these diseases

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.930 align:middle line:84%
should have been
eradicated ages ago.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.190 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVEN ROSS: A
very long time ago.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very long time ago.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.578 align:middle line:84%
And Steve, you know what I'd
like to do, if you don't mind,

00:01:16.578 --> 00:01:17.920 align:middle line:90%
is you found this quote.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.010 align:middle line:90%
Do you mind if I read it?

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.730 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Please.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:20.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.020 align:middle line:84%
Because I think it's really
at the heart of everything

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.100 align:middle line:84%
that we'll be talking
about after this.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.800 align:middle line:84%
This was a quote by Benjamin
Rush, founding father,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.060 align:middle line:90%
Declaration of Independence.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.450 align:middle line:84%
"Unless we put medical
freedom into the Constitution,

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.850 align:middle line:84%
the time will come when
medicine will organize

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.090 align:middle line:84%
into an undercover dictatorship
to restrict the art of healing

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.770 align:middle line:84%
to one class of men and deny
equal privileges to others.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.700 align:middle line:84%
The Constitution of
the Republic should

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.730 align:middle line:84%
make a special privileges
for medical freedoms

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.410 align:middle line:90%
as well as religious freedom."

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: It's very
apropos, and I think

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.050 align:middle line:84%
it sets the tone for
virtually everything we're

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.830 align:middle line:90%
going to be discussing today.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was a
concern even in those days.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And you and I have
talked off camera.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.436 align:middle line:90%
We know each other.

00:02:07.436 --> 00:02:09.060 align:middle line:84%
We've had three
interviews before this.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.643 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:02:09.643 --> 00:02:13.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this was even
a concern 500 years ago.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.720 align:middle line:84%
Something has been going
on by way of a corruption

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.430 align:middle line:84%
all along to keep people away
from the things that heal.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.260 align:middle line:10%
>>ROSS: When we
look at Paracelsus,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.170 align:middle line:10%
who lived 1493 to
around 1540, in 1512,

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.730 align:middle line:10%
he was talking in his writings
about the apothecaries

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.090 align:middle line:10%
and what they were
concocting were actually

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.420 align:middle line:10%
worse than the original
health problems--

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.679 align:middle line:10%
that people were dying
from the therapy.

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:41.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sound familiar?

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.540 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Exactly.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And we can jump ahead
right now and look

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.930 align:middle line:84%
at the TV commercials that
saturate us every evening.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.990 align:middle line:84%
One of them in particular
struck me the other day.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.520 align:middle line:90%
It was for psoriasis.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.775 align:middle line:84%
And one of the side
effects was labeled fatal.

00:02:58.775 --> 00:03:01.102 align:middle line:90%
Now, fatal to me means the end.

00:03:01.102 --> 00:03:03.685 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Maybe better to have
a skin disease than to be dead.

00:03:03.685 --> 00:03:03.950 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Absolutely.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:04.450 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.730 align:middle line:84%
So somehow, we
have not corrected

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.070 align:middle line:90%
something that was going on.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, back in Paracelsus'
day, he was basically

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.930 align:middle line:84%
run out of most towns because
he told the apothecaries,

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.200 align:middle line:84%
you have to tell us what's
really in these concoctions.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.820 align:middle line:90%
It is killing people.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.790 align:middle line:90%
They refused to do it then.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And basically, even though we
do know some of the ingredients,

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.810 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at such
devastating adverse effects.

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.660 align:middle line:84%
So I think the tone of our
talk today is two-fold.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.560 align:middle line:84%
One, there seems
to be a limitation

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.600 align:middle line:84%
of the type of therapies
that are being integrated

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.210 align:middle line:90%
into the system of this country.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And number two, the therapies
that we're using-- they're

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.080 align:middle line:90%
not working.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.480 align:middle line:90%
They are absolutely not working.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the others
are being very intentionally

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.505 align:middle line:90%
pushed aside.

00:03:59.505 --> 00:04:02.040 align:middle line:90%


00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.954 align:middle line:90%
Patents are not allowed.

00:04:03.954 --> 00:04:04.620 align:middle line:90%
They're revoked.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.990 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:06.489 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All kinds
of things happen

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.650 align:middle line:84%
to stop the genuinely
effective therapies

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.180 align:middle line:84%
that we should have been
using for hundreds of years,

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.350 align:middle line:84%
certainly since the
advent of electricity.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to give a little
tiny bit of back story here.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.490 align:middle line:84%
Steven and I-- when
I first met you,

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:22.300 align:middle line:84%
what we realized is in
the 1980s, mid '80s, you

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.210 align:middle line:84%
and I were chasing around-- you
were with the World Research

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.130 align:middle line:84%
Foundation, and me
as a journalist--

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.570 align:middle line:84%
were chasing around these
obscure stories of physicists

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.300 align:middle line:84%
and vibrational
healing and so forth.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.063 align:middle line:84%
And we knew these
obscure people that

00:04:36.063 --> 00:04:37.750 align:middle line:84%
have been totally
obscured by now.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.680 align:middle line:84%
But one of them,
Bernard Muschlein,

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.980 align:middle line:84%
was looking at things
that is exactly what we're

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.340 align:middle line:90%
going to be talking about today.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.490 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: That's correct.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He told me--
and it's the first time

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.363 align:middle line:84%
I had heard that,
almost 30 years ago.

00:04:47.363 --> 00:04:50.200 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Cancer isn't
what people think it is.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.159 align:middle line:90%
It's a virus.

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:52.450 align:middle line:90%
There are mutations that occur.

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.360 align:middle line:84%
We can see it--"
because they were

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.390 align:middle line:90%
looking through the Ergonom 400.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Which was a
very powerful microscope

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.020 align:middle line:90%
that was developed.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.920 align:middle line:84%
But again, that came
in the '70s and '80s.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.650 align:middle line:10%
And we have Royal Rife, who had
the most incredible microscope

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.530 align:middle line:10%
in the 1920s to 1930s.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.370 align:middle line:10%
And there's is another topic
that's very important here.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.820 align:middle line:10%
They saw what was
called pleomorphism.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, pleomorphism is a
mutation that takes place

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.870 align:middle line:84%
in certain elements
in the body where

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.530 align:middle line:90%
they mutate to another form.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.370 align:middle line:84%
Only through the
Rife microscope were

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.330 align:middle line:84%
they able to see that when
the environment has changed

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.060 align:middle line:84%
that there is this
mutation that takes place.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.650 align:middle line:84%
So they can hunt all they
want in standard medicine

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.820 align:middle line:90%
for some type of cure.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.540 align:middle line:84%
But this pleomorphism
means there

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.940 align:middle line:90%
is a mutation that takes place.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.560 align:middle line:84%
This is why we've
been reading lately

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.090 align:middle line:84%
that the pharmaceutical
products are not

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:00.760 align:middle line:84%
working for these different
bacterias because they mutate.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.219 align:middle line:90%
Well, it has to be addressed.

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:03.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's get into
some of the nuances.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.190 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot to talk
about in this hour.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.490 align:middle line:84%
Some of the nuances--
you had the Ergonom 400,

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:11.910 align:middle line:90%
which we both experienced.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.860 align:middle line:84%
I was lucky enough to-- it
was in Kurt Olbrich's closet,

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.270 align:middle line:84%
and I did a report on
it on CNN at the time

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.850 align:middle line:84%
as the first
journalist in the world

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.400 align:middle line:84%
to see the new version
of what Rife had done.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.630 align:middle line:84%
But Rife had something else--
this prismatic lens he had.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.590 align:middle line:84%
He was able to
identify, through color,

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.822 align:middle line:84%
through this prismatic
crystal lens, frequencies

00:06:31.822 --> 00:06:36.062 align:middle line:84%
of virtually all of the
known ailments of the day.

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:37.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: That's correct.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.510 align:middle line:84%
He's used counter
rotating prisms.

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And he did something
that's called heterodyning.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.050 align:middle line:90%
But he did it with light.

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, most people, physicists,
know heterodyning with sound.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.960 align:middle line:90%
You have one frequency.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.530 align:middle line:90%
You put another frequency.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:53.920 align:middle line:90%
They create a third frequency.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.220 align:middle line:90%
That's heterodyning.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.130 align:middle line:84%
But Rife did it with
light to the point

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.970 align:middle line:84%
that every virus,
bacteria, microbe

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:07.170 align:middle line:84%
illuminated in its own
natural frequency, which

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:08.790 align:middle line:90%
was also a color.

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:13.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, this was reported in
the Smithsonian Institute,

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:18.060 align:middle line:84%
the printing vehicle of
the US government in 1944,

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:24.580 align:middle line:84%
where they actually discussed
the various colors for typhus.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.880 align:middle line:90%
Cancer was a ruby red color.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.515 align:middle line:84%
So once it was determined there
was a particular frequency

00:07:30.515 --> 00:07:33.540 align:middle line:84%
for each virus
and bacteria, that

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:39.230 align:middle line:84%
is the life force of that
particular particle or element.

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And by the laws of resonance,
they used frequency generators

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:48.970 align:middle line:84%
generating that same frequency
beamed against that specimen,

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.940 align:middle line:90%
and it was instantly destroyed.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And articles were
written about it in the day.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.400 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't as though
it went unnoticed.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.885 align:middle line:90%
It was very well noticed.

00:07:56.885 --> 00:07:58.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: It was
very well noticed.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:07:58.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very visible.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And you brought
up a very good point here.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.920 align:middle line:84%
When I go on to some of
these information centers,

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:08.940 align:middle line:84%
like the Wikipedias, and
even when you Google,

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.110 align:middle line:84%
there is a very strange
phenomenon taking place.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:14.670 align:middle line:84%
What they've done
to Royal Rife is

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:19.230 align:middle line:84%
say he purported to
have a cure for cancer

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.350 align:middle line:90%
or he was using frequency.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:24.120 align:middle line:90%
And he had a microscope.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.320 align:middle line:90%
They have made it so trite.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.770 align:middle line:84%
But at the very time
that it was taking place,

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:33.140 align:middle line:84%
the greatest
scientists in the world

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:35.740 align:middle line:84%
were talking about
his microscope.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:39.169 align:middle line:84%
And here's the
phraseology they used.

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:41.539 align:middle line:84%
"I'm dreaming about
the things I thought

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:43.020 align:middle line:90%
through the microscope."

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:46.280 align:middle line:84%
Another individual from the
University of California

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.040 align:middle line:84%
said, "If this Rife ray
proves to be successful,

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:54.830 align:middle line:84%
it'll be the greatest discovery
in therapeutic history."

00:08:54.830 --> 00:09:00.160 align:middle line:84%
The doctors represented the Mayo
Clinic, John Hopkins, Harvard,

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.039 align:middle line:90%
USC Medical School.

00:09:02.039 --> 00:09:03.330 align:middle line:90%
And we actually have a picture.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.413 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I'm so
excited that you brought it.

00:09:05.413 --> 00:09:11.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: This is the original
picture of a 1931 dinner

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:18.480 align:middle line:84%
party celebrating the end of
disease and especially cancer.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.402 align:middle line:90%
And the doctors here--

00:09:19.402 --> 00:09:20.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And the year again?

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:23.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: 1931,
Pasadena, California.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:30.420 align:middle line:84%
So when I hear reports now--
Rife thought he had something--

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:33.540 align:middle line:84%
well, a lot of other people
thought he had something, too,

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:39.350 align:middle line:84%
because these were the greatest
researchers-- EC Rosa, now Mayo

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Clinic, Arthur Kendall,
Northwestern University.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.460 align:middle line:10%
What we have, and the reason
I do know the story, is we

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:51.540 align:middle line:10%
have 500 personal letters
of all of these doctors

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.840 align:middle line:10%
and their work logs.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.950 align:middle line:10%
And another special
treat that I brought here

00:09:56.950 --> 00:10:01.250 align:middle line:10%
was within five years of the
picture that I showed you,

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:05.350 align:middle line:10%
a lot of these doctors
claimed they never met Rife.

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:06.904 align:middle line:90%
They never discussed cancer.

00:10:06.904 --> 00:10:08.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank god those
letters still exist.

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:09.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Absolutely.

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And here is the original
guest book from Royal Rife.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.880 align:middle line:90%
Let's see if we can--

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:20.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:25.525 align:middle line:84%
And this documented the people
that came through his clinic.

00:10:25.525 --> 00:10:29.210 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Exactly-- to visit
his clinic and the microscope,

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:31.714 align:middle line:84%
several of which claimed
that they'd never met him.

00:10:31.714 --> 00:10:32.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And there it is in
their own writing.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.023 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: And here they are.

00:10:35.023 --> 00:10:38.080 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
times we hear about

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.330 align:middle line:84%
and people talk
about conspiracies.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.610 align:middle line:84%
I want to make this very
clear to your audience.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:45.550 align:middle line:90%
This is not a conspiracy.

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:47.090 align:middle line:90%
This is fact.

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:52.050 align:middle line:84%
The fact is he developed a
super microscope more powerful

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:55.620 align:middle line:84%
than anything in
existence at the time.

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:59.620 align:middle line:84%
He was able to see things that
other people have not even

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:02.600 align:middle line:90%
seen, basically, today.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:08.530 align:middle line:84%
And they set up healing centers
where they treated patients

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:12.450 align:middle line:84%
with their theories and
were very, very successful.

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:15.390 align:middle line:90%
And we have those records, also.

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:17.100 align:middle line:90%
They were very, very successful.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:21.100 align:middle line:84%
So you and I are kind of
overviewing because there's

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:22.980 align:middle line:90%
much more to the story here.

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and I want
go into his personal story,

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:28.580 align:middle line:84%
because people need to hear what
happens to the great geniuses.

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:31.320 align:middle line:84%
A lot of you who have been
watching this show and others

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:35.040 align:middle line:84%
already know that you oftentimes
have some kind of misfortune

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.660 align:middle line:84%
come your way if you're
particularly genius in a given

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:40.140 align:middle line:84%
area that can help
humanity, especially when it

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:40.849 align:middle line:90%
comes to healing.

00:11:40.849 --> 00:11:41.431 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:11:41.431 --> 00:11:42.380 align:middle line:90%
And I see this a lot.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:45.110 align:middle line:84%
I've got to call
myself as a librarian.

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And our world research
has 35,000 books

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.210 align:middle line:90%
dating to the 1400s.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:56.840 align:middle line:84%
We hold many, many items
like Rife and the Nemescope.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:00.070 align:middle line:84%
I have seen over the
years what has happened

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:03.900 align:middle line:84%
to the brilliant people
who try to come out

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:05.050 align:middle line:90%
with something innovative.

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:06.279 align:middle line:90%
Now, Paracelsus stated--

00:12:06.279 --> 00:12:08.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going to ask
you, what happened to him?

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:10.290 align:middle line:84%
He died under rather
dicey circumstances.

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:11.164 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Well, he did.

00:12:11.164 --> 00:12:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And before he died,
his comment was

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:18.570 align:middle line:84%
you can never come out with
anything new, because you will

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:23.080 align:middle line:84%
interrupt the theory of one
of the medical professors

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:28.230 align:middle line:84%
in the university who will
bombast you and place all

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:33.020 align:middle line:84%
this pressure against you
because their theories must be

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.180 align:middle line:84%
holding up, or they wouldn't
be the college professors

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:37.480 align:middle line:90%
that they are.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.320 align:middle line:84%
This is what he was
complaining about--

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.278 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In the 1500s.

00:12:40.278 --> 00:12:41.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: --1512.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:46.500 align:middle line:84%
He ended up dying-- basically,
they found him with a slit

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.494 align:middle line:84%
from the top of his
head down to his waist.

00:12:49.494 --> 00:12:50.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Accidental causes?

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:52.919 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Of course,
you know how that is.

00:12:52.919 --> 00:12:54.710 align:middle line:84%
He was obviously doing
something incorrect.

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:56.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He slipped.

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:58.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: But he was
run out of many towns

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:02.154 align:middle line:84%
because he just didn't like what
they were doing at the time.

00:13:02.154 --> 00:13:04.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and also,
he was a master alchemist.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.500 align:middle line:90%
He was a master healer.

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:06.960 align:middle line:84%
People were having
instantaneous,

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.690 align:middle line:90%
spontaneous healings, I'm sure.

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:11.160 align:middle line:84%
The medical community was not
fond of what he was doing.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.260 align:middle line:84%
It posed a great challenge
to the orthodoxy, as it was,

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:14.760 align:middle line:90%
of the day.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:15.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:16.715 align:middle line:84%
But isn't it nice to
know how far we've

00:13:16.715 --> 00:13:18.233 align:middle line:90%
progressed since 1512?

00:13:18.233 --> 00:13:19.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not much.

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:20.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Not much at all.

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:20.751 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:13:20.751 --> 00:13:23.310 align:middle line:90%
So let's go back to Rife.

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:26.920 align:middle line:84%
Again, this whole notion
that these books--

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.130 align:middle line:84%
there are hand written
books with these frequencies

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:33.330 align:middle line:84%
that still exist-- a frequency
for each and every disease.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:37.680 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get into why,
with various types of devices

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.280 align:middle line:84%
today, it's not working
the same, anyway.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:44.180 align:middle line:84%
But first, tell us about
Royal Raymond Rife,

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:47.910 align:middle line:84%
what happened to him after
he came out with all of this,

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:51.580 align:middle line:84%
and then the legacy of his
microscope and other goods.

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Well, let's
backtrack just a little bit

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:56.770 align:middle line:84%
and let your audience
be aware that Rife

00:13:56.770 --> 00:14:00.380 align:middle line:84%
was a chauffeur for
a man named Timken

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:03.630 align:middle line:84%
in San Diego who had
a ball bearing factory

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:08.380 align:middle line:84%
and was making ball bearings
for the carriages at the time.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And Rife told him
that he thought

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:14.780 align:middle line:84%
that he could build a
device that would far

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:17.760 align:middle line:84%
outshine anything
that was in existence.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And Timken provided him
$1 million, basically.

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Back in the mid-- I'd say,
1915, that is a lot of money

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:33.590 align:middle line:84%
then and now, but
back then especially.

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:36.560 align:middle line:84%
Rife put together
a whole shop and he

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.590 align:middle line:90%
creates the super microscope.

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.770 align:middle line:90%
But let's put it in proportion.

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:44.070 align:middle line:84%
Basically, research microscopes
that are in use today

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:46.702 align:middle line:90%
do 1,800 magnification.

00:14:46.702 --> 00:14:47.535 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In natural

00:14:47.535 --> 00:14:48.120 align:middle line:90%
light.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.829 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: In natural light,
looking at living specimens.

00:14:50.829 --> 00:14:51.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's average?

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:52.270 align:middle line:90%
2,000?

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:52.970 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Correct.

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:54.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In
natural light today?

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:55.053 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Today.

00:14:55.053 --> 00:14:55.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why?

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:56.380 align:middle line:90%
That's rather--

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:58.005 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Well, because
there's something

00:14:58.005 --> 00:14:59.770 align:middle line:84%
called the theoretical
limitations

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:01.890 align:middle line:90%
with the light and a light beam.

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, we've heard of
electron microscopes,

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:07.550 align:middle line:84%
but-- They may have
great magnification,

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:12.150 align:middle line:84%
but they put the
specimen in a vacuum,

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:15.870 align:middle line:84%
bombard it with electronics,
and you cannot look at anything

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:16.370 align:middle line:90%
live.

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:16.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it's all dead.

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:19.190 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Nor can you
look at it in color.

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:20.960 align:middle line:90%
Nor can you look in depth.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.260 align:middle line:90%
You only have gray scales.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.100 align:middle line:90%
So here comes Rife.

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And in the 1920s, he
builds his microscope

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:34.890 align:middle line:84%
that basically, his universal
did 60,000 magnification.

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:36.550 align:middle line:90%
60,000.

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:41.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, that is so much greater
than what is used today.

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:44.660 align:middle line:84%
Plus, they could see
in color, because they

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:47.140 align:middle line:84%
were seeing the
frequency colors.

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:50.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, I do want to
make this statement,

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:53.550 align:middle line:84%
because there's a lot of
people-- if you go and Google,

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:56.400 align:middle line:84%
there must be a million
and a half sites.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:57.530 align:middle line:90%
I will say this.

00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:59.770 align:middle line:84%
I want to say this
to your audience.

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:03.350 align:middle line:84%
I would like to know, out of all
these people, how many of them

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:06.340 align:middle line:84%
have ever had the
Rife microscope,

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:08.980 align:middle line:84%
ever read any of the
letters or notes.

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And they are writing all
kinds of things out there

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:13.200 align:middle line:90%
and building machines.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:13.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:14.310 align:middle line:90%
It's all hearsay.

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: We have had--
I have personally

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:20.764 align:middle line:84%
had the universal Rife
microscope for over four years.

00:16:20.764 --> 00:16:22.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I want to
get into that story.

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:26.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And so I don't want to
make this sound like I have it,

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:29.220 align:middle line:90%
you don't, but I'm going to.

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:33.200 align:middle line:84%
We are more familiar with it
than all the people who copy.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.460 align:middle line:84%
They remind me of the old game
we played in school called

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:40.120 align:middle line:84%
telephone, where somebody
whispers in somebody's ear,

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:44.640 align:middle line:84%
and at the end of the line,
it comes out as [GIBBERISH].

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:48.740 align:middle line:84%
People take and people take
and copy and talk about Rife,

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:52.660 align:middle line:84%
and he did this, and people
tell me, yeah, he was murdered.

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:55.150 align:middle line:84%
They really do not know
what they're talking about.

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:58.220 align:middle line:84%
So what we're sharing
here is coming

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:02.550 align:middle line:84%
from their actual letters
from having the microscope.

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:05.530 align:middle line:84%
I do not proclaim
that I'm a physicist,

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:08.010 align:middle line:84%
but I do have enough
knowledge to know

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:11.960 align:middle line:84%
what they were attempting
to do by their own words.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.920 align:middle line:90%
They had it.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.920 align:middle line:90%
They knew they had something.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:19.069 align:middle line:84%
They experimented,
and they proved

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:24.390 align:middle line:84%
that they could devitalize
and destroy cancer

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:27.849 align:middle line:84%
over and over and over
with no side effects.

00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:29.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And just
before we sat down,

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.930 align:middle line:84%
you handed me this letter,
which was written by Rife.

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "I've never
made any claims or statements

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:38.280 align:middle line:84%
that virus was the
causative agent in cancer.

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.530 align:middle line:90%
But I know it is."

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And this gets back to what
we saw through the Ergonom

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:43.807 align:middle line:90%
400 all those years ago.

00:17:43.807 --> 00:17:44.390 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:45.806 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, you
said something.

00:17:45.806 --> 00:17:48.530 align:middle line:84%
It's really beyond
my imagination

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:52.530 align:middle line:84%
that they're only using
2,000 magnification when

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:54.740 align:middle line:90%
this other technology exists.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, you said
something key there,

00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:00.530 align:middle line:84%
which is there is
no theoretical basis

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:05.830 align:middle line:84%
to believe that we can
see anything beyond 2,000.

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:09.380 align:middle line:84%
That's almost in the
cave in the Dark Ages

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.560 align:middle line:84%
compared to what's
actually been out there.

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing--
Kurt Olbrich,

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:14.850 align:middle line:84%
who's the inventor
of the Ergonom 400

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:16.350 align:middle line:84%
told me the same
thing in the '80s.

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:19.410 align:middle line:84%
He said when he took it
to the top in Europe--

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:22.060 align:middle line:84%
I think it was in Germany--
the top optical physicists,

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:26.070 align:middle line:84%
he said, there is no reason
this should work, but it does.

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:27.250 align:middle line:90%
And I will find the theory.

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:29.417 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a little
more positive statement.

00:18:29.417 --> 00:18:30.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, at the beginning of the
article from the Smithsonian

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:36.980 align:middle line:84%
Institute, as it leads in
to Royal Rife, it says,

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:40.520 align:middle line:84%
"Royal Rife who, for
many years, have built

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:45.790 align:middle line:84%
microscopes that far surpassed
the theoretical limitations."

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:49.070 align:middle line:84%
I read that and go, how do
you surpass a limitation?

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:51.960 align:middle line:84%
A limitation means
it's a limitation.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Theoretical limitation
is a limitation in thought.

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:55.570 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: That's right.

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, I don't know
if you're aware of this,

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.300 align:middle line:84%
but we talked about
Bernard Muschlein.

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:02.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:03.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: When Bernard
Muschlein came

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:08.040 align:middle line:84%
to speak at a World
Research Congress in 1986,

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:12.820 align:middle line:84%
I had the Rife microscope at
our World Research Foundation

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:13.980 align:middle line:90%
facility.

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:15.530 align:middle line:90%
He got to see it.

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:18.360 align:middle line:84%
He was not involved
with the Ergonom 400.

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:22.960 align:middle line:84%
He goes back to Germany, and
he starts telling these people,

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:26.030 align:middle line:84%
"I just saw this incredible
microscope from the '20s."

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And a friend of his
says, "Oh, there

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.850 align:middle line:84%
is another man in
another part of Germany

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:36.020 align:middle line:90%
who is building microscopes."

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:38.650 align:middle line:90%
Muschlein goes to Kurt Olbrich.

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:40.430 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't using it for medicine.

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:42.918 align:middle line:84%
He was looking for
flaws in computer chips.

00:19:42.918 --> 00:19:43.876 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:19:43.876 --> 00:19:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And
Muschlein said to him

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:47.290 align:middle line:90%
are you using this for medicine?

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:48.800 align:middle line:90%
He goes, well, no.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.050 align:middle line:90%
They don't need this, do they?

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:50.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And a beautiful friendship
was born from that.

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Absolutely.

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:55.264 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And Muschlein actually
drove me to Kurt's place

00:19:55.264 --> 00:19:58.070 align:middle line:84%
at like 150 miles an
hour on the Autobahn.

00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:59.450 align:middle line:90%
I still remember that.

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:03.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: So the Rife
led Muschlein there.

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:09.070 align:middle line:84%
It is an incredible device
that they had developed again

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:11.290 align:middle line:84%
and, I believe,
really perfected.

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:13.800 align:middle line:84%
They took terminal
cancer patients

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:19.660 align:middle line:84%
to the Mary Ellen Scripps Ranch
in La Jolla, California-- 14

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:21.100 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And after 30 days, 12 of them
were judged clinically cured

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:28.891 align:middle line:90%
of cancer.

00:20:28.891 --> 00:20:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What was the
protocol they used?

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:31.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: They used the
Rife frequency device.

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:32.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They used
the frequency device.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:33.750 align:middle line:90%
Oh, goodness.

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And the doctors who were
involved with that-- Alvin Ford

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:41.910 align:middle line:84%
was the president of
the American Association

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:45.850 align:middle line:84%
of Pathologists who
was on that committee

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:47.940 align:middle line:84%
and was one of the
ones who proclaimed

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:51.500 align:middle line:84%
that these patients had
been rectified of cancer.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:57.120 align:middle line:84%
So when I hear, again, that
Rife thought he had something

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.510 align:middle line:84%
and there were a
few people involved,

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:02.230 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about the
president of the American

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:05.090 align:middle line:90%
Association of Pathologists.

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:08.730 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about heads
of research departments.

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:12.970 align:middle line:84%
The greatest one, though--
and I brought an article which

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:14.700 align:middle line:84%
your audience will
be able to see--

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:18.130 align:middle line:84%
was from John Hopkins,
Lewellys Barker.

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And the article said
Lewellys Barker had just

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:24.220 align:middle line:84%
come from Royal Rife, whose
microscope is 10 times more

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:27.030 align:middle line:90%
powerful than any in existence.

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Rife said, according
to everyone,

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:31.470 align:middle line:84%
it's impossible,
because he's violating

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:33.100 align:middle line:90%
all the laws of optics.

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:35.030 align:middle line:84%
So I told Rife,
they're going to have

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:36.996 align:middle line:84%
to make some new laws,
then, because they

00:21:36.996 --> 00:21:38.050 align:middle line:84%
don't know what
they're talking about.

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:40.341 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's right-- just
like the other physicists

00:21:40.341 --> 00:21:40.960 align:middle line:90%
told Olbrich.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.820 align:middle line:90%
Very true.

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:44.360 align:middle line:84%
Let's get into what
actually happened to Rife,

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:45.830 align:middle line:90%
for all of his good work.

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Well, he
develops a microscope.

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:53.230 align:middle line:84%
He starts having one
prestigious doctor after another

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:57.990 align:middle line:84%
come to his laboratory,
page through or look

00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:01.010 align:middle line:84%
through this microscope,
become so overwhelmed.

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:02.190 align:middle line:90%
They tell somebody.

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:03.660 align:middle line:90%
They tell somebody.

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And we end up with the picture
and all those various doctors

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:11.390 align:middle line:84%
from the mail, from John
Hopkins, from Harvard.

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, there was a
letter that we have.

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:20.520 align:middle line:84%
Basically, the American Medical
Association contacted Rife

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:25.070 align:middle line:84%
and said, we would like
a piece of the action.

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:26.030 align:middle line:90%
What action?

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:30.315 align:middle line:84%
Well, we would like part of all
the sales of any microscopes

00:22:30.315 --> 00:22:32.030 align:middle line:90%
that you develop.

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:35.270 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, why?

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:37.090 align:middle line:90%
You're not involved with that.

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:40.690 align:middle line:84%
It was interesting to note
that the AMA-- and I have

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:46.730 align:middle line:84%
an original letter here from
Scientific America asking why.

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:51.580 align:middle line:10%
This is the original letter,
basically, from 1932,

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:54.860 align:middle line:10%
Scientific America
saying, why is it

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:57.010 align:middle line:10%
there has been no account
in the medical journals

00:22:57.010 --> 00:23:01.140 align:middle line:10%
of this incredible
invention that you have?

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And that is the reason,
because he said,

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:06.150 align:middle line:84%
we're not giving you
a piece of the action.

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:09.430 align:middle line:84%
So that kind of
made it difficult,

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:13.980 align:middle line:84%
because the AMA was not
telling other doctors.

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:17.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, Rife was also working
with the International Cancer

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:23.040 align:middle line:84%
Institute, forerunner
of the Cancer Society.

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:23.940 align:middle line:90%
They came out.

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:25.910 align:middle line:84%
They had given him
a little grant.

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:27.590 align:middle line:90%
And they visited him.

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
oh, wait a minute.

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:33.090 align:middle line:84%
We've observed
everything you've done.

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:37.340 align:middle line:84%
You've worked with human
cancers and you've cured them.

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:39.780 align:middle line:90%
That's not going to work for us.

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:42.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm paraphrasing, but I
have the original letters.

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:46.570 align:middle line:84%
We want you to continue
working with rat cancers.

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:47.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:50.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And then, if you
come up with something,

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.710 align:middle line:84%
we'll see where we
can proceed next.

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:53.084 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But lay
off the humans.

00:23:53.084 --> 00:23:54.430 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Lay off the humans.

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:57.430 align:middle line:84%
I also have a letter where
the doctors with Rife

00:23:57.430 --> 00:24:02.050 align:middle line:84%
said, there is a woman
named Mott Sly who

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:08.390 align:middle line:84%
is able to produce a cancer in
rats in any part of their body

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:12.440 align:middle line:84%
that she wants,
any type of cancer.

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:14.300 align:middle line:84%
I read this letter--
and this letter

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:17.640 align:middle line:84%
was written in the '30s-- and
I'm thinking, wait a minute.

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:20.220 align:middle line:84%
Somebody actually
had enough awareness

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:24.800 align:middle line:84%
to produce any type of
cancer in any type of rat

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.014 align:middle line:90%
that they wanted.

00:24:27.014 --> 00:24:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And then other
people are claiming

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:30.280 align:middle line:84%
they didn't know
anything about cancer.

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:31.310 align:middle line:90%
They're investigating.

00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:33.720 align:middle line:90%
They're doing research.

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:36.410 align:middle line:84%
The International
Cancer Institute

00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:39.440 align:middle line:90%
canceled any money with Rife.

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And now, this is when it
gets more interesting.

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.600 align:middle line:84%
Most of the doctors
with Rife were basically

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:50.700 align:middle line:84%
told not to work with him
anymore, which they stopped.

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:53.180 align:middle line:90%
They left Rife.

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:56.590 align:middle line:90%
This was around 1935, 1936.

00:24:56.590 --> 00:25:00.460 align:middle line:84%
In 1940, Rife was
still trying to see

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:02.090 align:middle line:90%
if he could make inroads.

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:03.980 align:middle line:10%
But all of his
greatest supporters--

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:07.030 align:middle line:10%
Milbank Johnson had
checked into a hospital

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:09.140 align:middle line:10%
for a routine medical exam.

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:12.430 align:middle line:10%
He never checked out of
Pasadena County Hospital.

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:16.770 align:middle line:10%
Arthur Kendall, a great
supporter-- he went to Mexico,

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:18.690 align:middle line:10%
was never heard from again.

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:20.530 align:middle line:90%
Rife was left alone.

00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:25.210 align:middle line:84%
But in 1944, the Smithsonian
Institute interviews

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Rife because they thought this
was a new development, tell

00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:34.000 align:middle line:84%
the story, and then
nothing happened.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.730 align:middle line:90%
The doctors left Rife.

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:38.670 align:middle line:90%
Rife became basically a drunk.

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And he was in the San
Diego area and was

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.480 align:middle line:84%
befriended by a man
named John Crane.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And John Crane heard the
story, took Rife in, and really

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:53.920 align:middle line:84%
was given all of those
materials at that time.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:59.300 align:middle line:84%
In Rife's obituary-- he
died in 1971-- he said,

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:04.170 align:middle line:84%
all I wanted to do was
build a microscope that

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:07.540 align:middle line:84%
would help medicine,
because he didn't originally

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:09.770 align:middle line:90%
do it for cancer.

00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:14.330 align:middle line:84%
He did it because he knew that
he could build a device that

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:17.130 align:middle line:84%
would really help and
be something extremely

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:19.170 align:middle line:90%
beneficial for humanity.

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:23.170 align:middle line:84%
What happened to him
is really a travesty.

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:27.980 align:middle line:84%
But I want people to think about
the people who have had cancer.

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:30.420 align:middle line:90%
That's who we should cry about.

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:33.510 align:middle line:84%
It's not about the
conspiracies, Regina.

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:34.979 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
about all the people

00:26:34.979 --> 00:26:37.020 align:middle line:84%
that could have been helped
instead of mutilated.

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:37.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Absolutely.

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:38.661 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It makes me very sad.

00:26:38.661 --> 00:26:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Because I ask always
about a Pepsi Challenge.

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:46.890 align:middle line:84%
My Pepsi Challenge
would be pharmaceuticals

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:49.250 align:middle line:90%
against electromagnetism.

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:55.300 align:middle line:84%
Electromagnetism, frequency,
is the basis of all existence.

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:58.340 align:middle line:10%
And as we get into
another segment

00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:01.590 align:middle line:10%
and people start to hear about
the great researchers who

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:05.050 align:middle line:10%
proved that as cancer
tumor is growing,

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:07.790 align:middle line:10%
there's a change in the
electrical potential,

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:11.150 align:middle line:10%
there is a more positive
charge on that tumor.

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:12.850 align:middle line:84%
Who is the man who
discovered that?

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:14.940 align:middle line:84%
Oh, Bjorn Nordenstrom,
the chairman

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:17.789 align:middle line:84%
of the Nobel Assembly
of Medicine in Sweden.

00:27:17.789 --> 00:27:19.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when we have
our next conversation,

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:22.430 align:middle line:84%
we'll talk about
how he was treated.

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:26.650 align:middle line:84%
So you came in
contact with Crane.

00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:28.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: I came in
contact with John Crane

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:33.080 align:middle line:84%
and was given the Rife
microscope, the universal.

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.620 align:middle line:90%
There's all kinds of talks.

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:36.660 align:middle line:84%
There were some
other microscopes.

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:41.430 align:middle line:84%
But none were as powerful
as that universal microscope

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:42.830 align:middle line:90%
and what it was able to do.

00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:47.120 align:middle line:84%
So I did have that microscope,
was able to see it.

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:50.530 align:middle line:84%
It was not in complete
working condition at the time,

00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:53.520 align:middle line:84%
but it was there,
as I said, with all

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.930 align:middle line:90%
the original documents.

00:27:55.930 --> 00:28:00.400 align:middle line:84%
So I am very aware of what
they were trying to do,

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:03.670 align:middle line:84%
where the pressure was
coming from at the time.

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And it was just too
much for not only

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:08.250 align:middle line:84%
Rife, but if people
take a good look

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:10.890 align:middle line:84%
at the picture of the doctors
in that dinner party--

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:13.223 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, that wonderful
assembly of end of cancer.

00:28:13.223 --> 00:28:15.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: --they were not
exactly the supermans.

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:19.130 align:middle line:84%
They were not going to go out
and jeopardize their careers.

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:20.900 align:middle line:90%
So they all folded.

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And there was no
internet at the time.

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:23.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:25.258 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: With the
internet, and with shows

00:28:25.258 --> 00:28:30.190 align:middle line:84%
like that you have here, a lot
of people hear these stories.

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:33.640 align:middle line:84%
But back in his time,
they disappeared.

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:37.820 align:middle line:84%
I started part of our segment
talking about pleomorphism.

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, pleomorphism is something
that the medical profession

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:43.560 align:middle line:84%
does not like
because they'd like

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:47.100 align:middle line:84%
you to believe that there's
a silver bullet answer.

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:50.610 align:middle line:84%
There is no silver
bullet answer.

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:56.130 align:middle line:84%
There are rods and different
shapes to these microbes

00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:57.790 align:middle line:90%
that they mutate.

00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:03.280 align:middle line:84%
They took a bacillus coli,
a substance in the body,

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:07.200 align:middle line:84%
and they could turn it into
a deadly typhus pathogen

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:12.370 align:middle line:84%
just by altering the frequency
of the environment it was in,

00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:15.320 align:middle line:84%
which means you
don't catch cancer.

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:19.160 align:middle line:84%
You may not catch any of
these diseases and illnesses.

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:23.270 align:middle line:84%
They are in all of our
bodies, and they come out

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:26.190 align:middle line:90%
when the environment is changed.

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:27.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:30.990 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Food, the
thought, the mind--

00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:32.790 align:middle line:90%
it alters the environment.

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:35.260 align:middle line:84%
That is the way medicine
should be looking.

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:36.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:41.340 align:middle line:10%
And Crane, just because he
was in possession of this,

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:45.180 align:middle line:10%
he ran into some ill
fortune along the way, too.

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:46.230 align:middle line:10%
He was drugged.

00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:48.430 align:middle line:10%
I think his lab was broken into.

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:49.800 align:middle line:90%
I think he was beaten.

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.800 align:middle line:84%
He was an old man, and
all these horrible things

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.060 align:middle line:90%
were happening to him.

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:56.542 align:middle line:84%
And it's lucky that you
ended up with the scope.

00:29:56.542 --> 00:29:57.750 align:middle line:90%
But then the scope went away?

00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:58.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:59.237 align:middle line:90%
It did.

00:29:59.237 --> 00:30:00.070 align:middle line:10%
That's a long story.

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:01.045 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if we have
enough time for that.

00:30:01.045 --> 00:30:01.713 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we
don't have time for it.

00:30:01.713 --> 00:30:02.470 align:middle line:10%
It went away.

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:03.080 align:middle line:10%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:05.350 align:middle line:10%
And it is around.

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:08.390 align:middle line:10%
My associates know where it is.

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:10.520 align:middle line:10%
So it hasn't disappeared.

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.060 align:middle line:90%
It is around.

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:14.910 align:middle line:90%
This is not a wives' tale.

00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:17.720 align:middle line:84%
All the newspaper
articles, pictures

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.570 align:middle line:90%
that appeared at the time.

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:21.030 align:middle line:90%
It was real.

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:23.260 align:middle line:90%
It was bona fide.

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:25.500 align:middle line:90%
Why is it not in use today?

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:32.150 align:middle line:84%
It is just as dangerous today
to buck against the system.

00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:36.860 align:middle line:84%
The old boy system of the quote
that you read of Benjamin Rush

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:39.450 align:middle line:90%
is so prevalent.

00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:41.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to repeat
these figures again

00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:42.760 align:middle line:90%
in the other segment.

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:45.370 align:middle line:84%
But I want to share
them right now.

00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:51.470 align:middle line:84%
The pharmaceutical lobby
between 1998 and 2008

00:30:51.470 --> 00:31:01.980 align:middle line:84%
spent $1.5 billion at the
federal level-- $1.5 billion.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:05.530 align:middle line:84%
That was reported
in Reader's Digest.

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:08.080 align:middle line:84%
It was done by a
research organization

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:10.480 align:middle line:90%
for ethics and politics.

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.770 align:middle line:84%
You have to ask
yourself, why is there

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:14.900 align:middle line:90%
a lobby for pharmaceuticals?

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:16.810 align:middle line:90%
Why would they need a lobby?

00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:18.840 align:middle line:90%
Well, here's your answer.

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:22.350 align:middle line:84%
They have made sure that
anything in the electromagnetic

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:27.910 align:middle line:84%
spectrum cannot really
have its fair assessment.

00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And Rife-- it's just as
bad now, but in his day,

00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:34.080 align:middle line:90%
there was no hope.

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:37.020 align:middle line:84%
There really was not the
proliferation of information.

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And Rife became a
drunk, passed away.

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:44.065 align:middle line:84%
And now, I'm very sad to
say that these people who

00:31:44.065 --> 00:31:49.050 align:middle line:84%
have run around with Rife
devices, stealing Rife's name,

00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:52.730 align:middle line:84%
and getting it banned by
different state authorities

00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:56.920 align:middle line:84%
as illegal and unauthorized
contraptions have now

00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:03.050 align:middle line:84%
made it even more difficult that
the right Rife information will

00:32:03.050 --> 00:32:05.077 align:middle line:84%
ever be out there and
tested accurately.

00:32:05.077 --> 00:32:06.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But there are
some things going on

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:08.190 align:middle line:90%
and the world is changing.

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is
going to be corrected.

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And I am here because
you are a positive person,

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:14.947 align:middle line:84%
and so am I, so we
know that it will.

00:32:14.947 --> 00:32:16.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know
that there are things

00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:20.390 align:middle line:84%
that are happening behind the
scenes that may bring this back

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:22.824 align:middle line:84%
around for a full
proper evaluation.

00:32:22.824 --> 00:32:23.490 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Correct.

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:24.948 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I
think we might even

00:32:24.948 --> 00:32:27.730 align:middle line:84%
start seeing some inroads
getting past the big pharma

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:29.150 align:middle line:90%
industry in this.

00:32:29.150 --> 00:32:33.765 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, this takes us to the
Nemescope, an equally shocking

00:32:33.765 --> 00:32:34.265 align:middle line:90%
story.

00:32:34.265 --> 00:32:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And the images-- and
these are the images

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:38.565 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned in the
open of the show.

00:32:38.565 --> 00:32:40.440 align:middle line:84%
These are not things
you've ever seen before.

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:43.660 align:middle line:84%
Very few people in the world
have ever seen these images.

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:47.610 align:middle line:84%
These are viruses and
molecular structure

00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:50.000 align:middle line:84%
of common substances
such as honey

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.270 align:middle line:84%
that are being magnified
at 3 million times.

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:55.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: 3.5 million.

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:59.671 align:middle line:84%
And remember the Rife
scope was doing 60,000.

00:32:59.671 --> 00:33:01.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk
about the Nemescope.

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:05.960 align:middle line:84%
Who was the inventor
and his story.

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:08.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he also met
a tragic ending.

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:12.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Yes, Elmer
Nemes-- and this

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.860 align:middle line:84%
is a drawing,
because it was really

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:17.150 align:middle line:90%
never completely patented.

00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:21.460 align:middle line:84%
But this Nemes
microscope was developed

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:25.490 align:middle line:84%
in North Hollywood, California,
and very, very close actually

00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:27.720 align:middle line:84%
to where I grew up in
Sun Valley, California.

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Probably not
far from Rife, even.

00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:30.733 align:middle line:84%
He was in southern
Cal too, wasn't he?

00:33:30.733 --> 00:33:32.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Exactly, in San Diego.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.150 align:middle line:84%
So they were very, very
close in 19-- basically,

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:37.090 align:middle line:90%
in the early 1950s.

00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:42.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, this Nemescope and its
principles are so profound.

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:48.250 align:middle line:84%
Firstly, not only did it
magnify 3.5 million diameters--

00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:50.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can
see atomic structure.

00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:53.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: The atomic
structures, and everything

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:58.630 align:middle line:84%
in color-- I should
add that this book that

00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:03.130 align:middle line:84%
is in your facility now is
the only Nemes presentation

00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:06.530 align:middle line:90%
book that is in existence.

00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And what we have here
is atoms with the lines

00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:12.665 align:middle line:90%
of force between the atoms.

00:34:12.665 --> 00:34:14.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I don't
know if you can

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:16.199 align:middle line:84%
see them-- these
little shadowy lines.

00:34:16.199 --> 00:34:16.985 align:middle line:90%
That's invisible.

00:34:16.985 --> 00:34:17.610 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: That is

00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:18.280 align:middle line:90%
invisible.

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:18.679 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is invisible.

00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:19.199 align:middle line:90%
That's energy--

00:34:19.199 --> 00:34:20.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: You would
never see that with--

00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:22.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
communication happening

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:25.075 align:middle line:90%
between these atoms of honey.

00:34:25.075 --> 00:34:26.969 align:middle line:90%
Communication.

00:34:26.969 --> 00:34:28.940 align:middle line:90%
Live communication.

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:31.081 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: What is
fascinating about that is,

00:34:31.081 --> 00:34:36.400 align:middle line:84%
and in conjunction,
this picture are

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:41.750 align:middle line:84%
the lines of force of a magnet,
the north and south pole pull

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:44.366 align:middle line:84%
of a magnet, that nobody-- no
human eye has ever seen that.

00:34:44.366 --> 00:34:46.449 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These are lines
of force-- non physical.

00:34:46.449 --> 00:34:49.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: The lines of
force of the magnet.

00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:54.949 align:middle line:84%
This Nemescope was, I've got
to say, the most incredible.

00:34:54.949 --> 00:34:58.310 align:middle line:90%
Here is a picture of cytoplasm.

00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:59.805 align:middle line:90%
Look at the geometric structure.

00:34:59.805 --> 00:35:02.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And the
beauty of nature.

00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:05.920 align:middle line:90%
So now we have this Nemescope.

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:09.840 align:middle line:84%
And when Elmer
Nemes was describing

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:13.400 align:middle line:84%
what was involved
here, his premise

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:18.340 align:middle line:84%
was the electrons used in
the electron microscopes

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:20.480 align:middle line:90%
were devitalizing or destroying.

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:25.590 align:middle line:84%
He was using something
around the neutrino level,

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:29.870 align:middle line:84%
and it would excite the
elements they were looking at,

00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:32.600 align:middle line:90%
causing irradiation.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And through this
radiation, the colors

00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:41.980 align:middle line:84%
came out-- the life force,
the energy that was there.

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:48.650 align:middle line:84%
So Nemes, in 1957, happened
to have his Nemescope being

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:51.840 align:middle line:90%
repaired at a camera shop.

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:56.590 align:middle line:84%
And the way the story was
related by one of his closest

00:35:56.590 --> 00:36:02.240 align:middle line:84%
supporters, Betty Lee Morales,
who was an ex-CIA agent

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:06.207 align:middle line:84%
and a good friend of Nemes--
she had this presentation book--

00:36:06.207 --> 00:36:07.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This book.

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:09.840 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: --this book
off the premises

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:14.800 align:middle line:84%
when somebody broke in and
stole the Nemescope, never

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.430 align:middle line:90%
to be seen again.

00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And a little bit
after that, Nemes

00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:21.380 align:middle line:90%
was killed in a bar room brawl.

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:23.000 align:middle line:90%
And that was end of Nemes.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.300 align:middle line:84%
That was the end of
this super microscope.

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:28.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And did
he only have one?

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:29.895 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: There was only one.

00:36:29.895 --> 00:36:31.395 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There was
one. microscope.

00:36:31.395 --> 00:36:37.170 align:middle line:84%
And I asked you off camera
if you knew where it went

00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:39.980 align:middle line:84%
and what it might
be used for today.

00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:41.470 align:middle line:90%
And you said you had an idea.

00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:42.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: I had an idea.

00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And it was provided to me
by a researcher who actually

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:49.670 align:middle line:84%
formerly worked
for the government

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:53.240 align:middle line:84%
and stated that part
of it, they believe

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:59.192 align:middle line:84%
the laws behind what he had done
went into the stealth program.

00:36:59.192 --> 00:37:00.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Military
stealth program.

00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:01.540 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:05.100 align:middle line:84%
But there's no
validation of that.

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:08.090 align:middle line:84%
There's very little
of Nemes other

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:09.890 align:middle line:90%
than these incredible pictures.

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:11.349 align:middle line:90%
And this--

00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:11.890 --> 00:37:12.840 align:middle line:90%
So let's show this.

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:16.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: This is the
cancer virus taken

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:21.420 align:middle line:90%
at 3.5 million magnification.

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:22.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 3.5 million.

00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:23.465 align:middle line:90%
So no one's seen this.

00:37:23.465 --> 00:37:24.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Nobody.

00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:25.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The world of medicine
has never ever seen this.

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Absolutely
never seen this.

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:28.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so this
thing Bernard Muschlein

00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:29.910 align:middle line:84%
was talking about
all those years

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:33.510 align:middle line:84%
ago, about this pleomorphism,
and the whole notion

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:36.580 align:middle line:84%
that cancer is a virus-- that's
just getting some traction

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:38.240 align:middle line:84%
today among the
alternative community.

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:40.554 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Well, these existed--

00:37:40.554 --> 00:37:41.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --back then.

00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:41.790 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:41.980 align:middle line:90%
It did.

00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:43.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not
like it wasn't known.

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:44.343 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:37:44.343 --> 00:37:45.840 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:51.335 align:middle line:84%
Nemes did not have the
great doctors that Rife had.

00:37:51.335 --> 00:37:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to jump ahead
a little bit, because there's

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:56.440 align:middle line:84%
always people in there-- there's
always the doubting Thomases.

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:59.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't know,
and we can't be sure

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:02.090 align:middle line:90%
what these pictures are.

00:38:02.090 --> 00:38:03.840 align:middle line:84%
I would prefer that
people, if they

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:05.440 align:middle line:84%
want to say something
like that, they

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:09.100 align:middle line:84%
disprove what's here, because
we have too many people who

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:13.600 align:middle line:84%
see facts and they'd say,
oh, I don't believe that.

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:17.450 align:middle line:84%
But they don't give an
opposite explanation.

00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:23.020 align:middle line:84%
These are photographs taken
at 3.5 million magnification.

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:26.450 align:middle line:84%
And if somebody else
has a picture at 3.5

00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:28.240 align:middle line:84%
that's different than
this, they should

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:34.060 align:middle line:84%
be the ones talking, because the
pictures here of these viruses

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:35.350 align:middle line:90%
are so unique.

00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:38.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's amazing.

00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:42.100 align:middle line:84%
This is the geometric
structure of magnesium?

00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:43.170 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:45.160 align:middle line:90%
They did all kinds of elements.

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:46.780 align:middle line:90%
This is iron nucleids.

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:49.765 align:middle line:84%
These are atoms
of iron nucleids.

00:38:49.765 --> 00:38:50.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Look at that.

00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:53.285 align:middle line:84%
As Jay was saying, there's
a toroidal energy effect

00:38:53.285 --> 00:38:54.350 align:middle line:90%
around each one.

00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:57.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: We are looking
at the actual energy.

00:38:57.010 --> 00:39:01.590 align:middle line:84%
So we look at-- here
is a leukemia virus.

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:04.010 align:middle line:84%
Nobody talks about that there's
anything with leukemia--

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:04.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a virus.

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:05.420 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: It's a virus.

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:10.150 align:middle line:84%
This is a picture of leukemia
virus as purported by Nemes.

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:13.270 align:middle line:84%
I am not the one
who's validating it.

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:17.980 align:middle line:84%
I am just a caretaker
of these materials.

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:22.680 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of all this
is not to rag on anybody,

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:27.080 align:middle line:84%
but to say let's do
research with tools

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:33.470 align:middle line:84%
that work in an area that's
going to derive benefit.

00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:36.100 align:middle line:90%
There was Dr. Baylor.

00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:38.339 align:middle line:90%
In 1984, Dr. Baylor--

00:39:38.339 --> 00:39:39.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of Baylor University?

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:40.495 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Well, no, he--

00:39:40.495 --> 00:39:41.115 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Different.

00:39:41.115 --> 00:39:42.406 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yeah, he was different.

00:39:42.406 --> 00:39:49.060 align:middle line:84%
He said, after 35 years of
intense research and money,

00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:53.550 align:middle line:84%
the outcome for cancer
has not changed one iota.

00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:55.290 align:middle line:90%
The outcome is death.

00:39:55.290 --> 00:39:58.670 align:middle line:84%
In other words, our
medicines are not

00:39:58.670 --> 00:40:00.980 align:middle line:90%
coming to any kind of solution.

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:03.170 align:middle line:84%
The equivalent would
be if I brought you

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:04.860 align:middle line:90%
to a new continent, Regina.

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:06.980 align:middle line:90%
I said, here is this continent.

00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:11.470 align:middle line:84%
I want you to explore it,
but you can only go north.

00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:12.970 align:middle line:90%
But I want you to tell me.

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:16.040 align:middle line:84%
North is our
pharmaceutical approach,

00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:18.810 align:middle line:90%
where we are not chemical.

00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:20.980 align:middle line:90%
We are electrical.

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:24.120 align:middle line:84%
Every physicist,
every biologist knows

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:27.600 align:middle line:90%
we are electromagnetic beings.

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:28.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:32.670 align:middle line:84%
Let me ask you a
theoretical question.

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:39.460 align:middle line:84%
If this microscope had
been in use, wide use

00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:42.410 align:middle line:84%
through universities
and so forth,

00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:46.010 align:middle line:84%
and the protocols
of Rife were still

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:48.920 align:middle line:84%
put in use by properly
calibrated machines,

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:52.070 align:middle line:84%
what would the profile of
disease look like today?

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:53.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: The profile
of disease would

00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:57.500 align:middle line:84%
be, if there was any
modification at all,

00:40:57.500 --> 00:40:59.910 align:middle line:84%
we would be able to
see the frequency

00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:04.960 align:middle line:84%
of the altered mutated
pleomorphized item,

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:07.650 align:middle line:84%
and we would be able to
destroy it exactly the same.

00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:10.440 align:middle line:84%
What happens when a
singer hits a note

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:11.884 align:middle line:90%
and there is a glass, resonant?

00:41:11.884 --> 00:41:12.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:13.140 align:middle line:90%
Shatters it.

00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:14.880 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: It shatters it.

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:18.440 align:middle line:84%
This is very simplistic,
but it's the same thing.

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:23.010 align:middle line:84%
The frequency doesn't just
destroy one cancer cell.

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:25.650 align:middle line:84%
It would destroy
all the cancer cells

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:27.970 align:middle line:90%
resonating at that frequency.

00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:30.570 align:middle line:84%
In Rife's letters,
they had already

00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:34.740 align:middle line:84%
seen there were different
elements with tuberculosis.

00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:36.030 align:middle line:90%
They saw some rods.

00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:37.670 align:middle line:90%
They saw some other elements.

00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:40.130 align:middle line:84%
They kept finding
the frequencies.

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:41.280 align:middle line:90%
Now, how did they do it?

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:44.510 align:middle line:84%
Because the color
of those elements,

00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:47.190 align:middle line:84%
those microbes,
bacteria, germs, had

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:51.522 align:middle line:84%
changed to the point, new color,
new frequency, we destroy it.

00:41:51.522 --> 00:41:52.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Color is frequency.

00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:54.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Color is a
rate of frequency.

00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:57.580 align:middle line:84%
So the world of
medicine would have

00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:01.810 align:middle line:84%
meant there would have been
no Siebel Geigy, no Murk,

00:42:01.810 --> 00:42:06.560 align:middle line:84%
no-- they would have either
been in electromagnetics--

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:11.440 align:middle line:84%
because why would you have
needed a chemical when you have

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:14.370 align:middle line:84%
a frequency that has
already destroyed

00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:16.920 align:middle line:90%
the microbe or bacteria?

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:19.500 align:middle line:84%
The theory that these
people wanted-- well,

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:21.540 align:middle line:84%
how do you keep
yourself healthy?

00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:25.310 align:middle line:84%
You would come into
an institune location

00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:27.451 align:middle line:84%
where all your frequencies
would be balanced.

00:42:27.451 --> 00:42:29.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
didn't mean "institute."

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:30.310 align:middle line:90%
You meant "institune."

00:42:30.310 --> 00:42:31.260 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Institune.

00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:32.830 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly right.

00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And you would have your
frequencies balanced.

00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:38.810 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
areas that I would

00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:41.380 align:middle line:90%
have liked to have gone into.

00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:43.130 align:middle line:90%
And we will in the second show.

00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:44.338 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We still have time.

00:42:44.338 --> 00:42:49.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: OK, because the great
researchers of this country

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:55.670 align:middle line:84%
and of the world have shown
when a cancer tumor is growing,

00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:58.245 align:middle line:84%
there is a change in the
electrical potential or charge.

00:42:58.245 --> 00:42:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, we
mentioned that.

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:02.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And it wasn't
just Bjorn Nordenstrom.

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:05.040 align:middle line:90%
It goes over and over.

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:06.980 align:middle line:90%
It goes back in time.

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:10.780 align:middle line:84%
I brought a book to show in
our next segment from 1877

00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:17.280 align:middle line:84%
where the medical doctor cured
a man of a chest cancer using

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:21.140 align:middle line:84%
electricity 100 years
before Dr. Nordenstrom

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:23.270 align:middle line:84%
was receiving all
of this credit.

00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:28.690 align:middle line:84%
We have doctors over at Yale
University who-- they developed

00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:34.410 align:middle line:84%
devices that could measure on
your body changes of frequency.

00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And they knew that a cancer
would form there three weeks

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:41.240 align:middle line:90%
before a tumor ever came.

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:44.290 align:middle line:84%
So what would the
landscape be, Regina?

00:43:44.290 --> 00:43:49.030 align:middle line:84%
The landscape would be one where
preventive health care would

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:54.400 align:middle line:84%
already start before the tumor
or any of these other devices

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:55.720 align:middle line:90%
would even show up.

00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:58.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, there is a
complementary technology

00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:01.810 align:middle line:84%
to that right now, which
is maybe a beginning point.

00:44:01.810 --> 00:44:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with
the technology created

00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:06.470 align:middle line:90%
by Konstantin Karotkov.

00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.970 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:08.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
now being made.

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:10.480 align:middle line:84%
They're in the
process of making it

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:13.460 align:middle line:84%
available to the public
at a very low price.

00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:16.560 align:middle line:84%
So any practitioner,
healer, or even family

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:20.560 align:middle line:84%
who can run a computer and stick
their fingers in a box can see.

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:23.680 align:middle line:90%
And I've seen this.

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:24.660 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: As I have.

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:25.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's very accurate.

00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:25.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: It is phenomenal.

00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:27.460 align:middle line:90%
It is so Star Trek-y that--

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:28.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my god.

00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:31.110 align:middle line:84%
You stick each of
your 10 fingers

00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:34.990 align:middle line:84%
in this little box where
the light is blocked out.

00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:39.057 align:middle line:84%
And this pad begins reading
the frequencies, which,

00:44:39.057 --> 00:44:40.640 align:middle line:84%
of course, in the
ends of your fingers

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:42.600 align:middle line:84%
are attached to
the meridians that

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:45.980 align:middle line:84%
go through all the organs of the
body, the vitality of the body.

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And it shows the whole spectrum
of your health-- exactly where

00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:51.340 align:middle line:84%
your energy's off, where
the frequency's off

00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:53.340 align:middle line:90%
or something's developing.

00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:55.690 align:middle line:84%
That's going to be on
the market right away.

00:44:55.690 --> 00:44:57.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And it's been
around a long time.

00:44:57.580 --> 00:45:01.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, I do want to at least
add in this segment something

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:02.460 align:middle line:90%
positive.

00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:06.080 align:middle line:84%
We are starting the
World Research Fund.

00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And the World Research Fund
through our world research

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.850 align:middle line:84%
is intended to take this
massive amounts of monies

00:45:13.850 --> 00:45:16.960 align:middle line:84%
and channel them
into energy medicine,

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:21.350 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetics, microscopes,
resurrecting the Rife

00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:24.097 align:middle line:84%
microscope, resurrecting
the Nemescope.

00:45:24.097 --> 00:45:26.180 align:middle line:84%
There's other microscopes,
which we'll talk about.

00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:28.956 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Hopefully resurrecting
the Tesla frequency device

00:45:28.956 --> 00:45:29.455 align:middle line:90%
generator.

00:45:29.455 --> 00:45:30.312 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Definitely.

00:45:30.312 --> 00:45:32.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The problem is-- and
I want you to get into this,

00:45:32.770 --> 00:45:34.310 align:middle line:84%
but you already
mentioned it earlier.

00:45:34.310 --> 00:45:35.851 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's
something that needs

00:45:35.851 --> 00:45:37.980 align:middle line:90%
to be clarified even further.

00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:40.960 align:middle line:84%
People that have these
Rife devices-- and I

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:43.580 align:middle line:84%
know some really good people
and practitioners who have them.

00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And they are getting
some luck with them.

00:45:45.590 --> 00:45:48.510 align:middle line:84%
They are having some luck
in healing with them.

00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:52.140 align:middle line:84%
But they don't have the
degree of refined calibration

00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:56.110 align:middle line:84%
and targeting for the particular
disease, whatever, virus,

00:45:56.110 --> 00:45:58.280 align:middle line:84%
bacteria, et cetera,
that Rife's had.

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what
you take exception to is

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:03.212 align:middle line:90%
it's not accurately calibrated.

00:46:03.212 --> 00:46:03.920 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: It isn't.

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And in this letter
from 1935-- I'm

00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:11.400 align:middle line:84%
just going to read it--
between Milbank Johnson.

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:13.230 align:middle line:84%
"The basic principle
of this device

00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:16.240 align:middle line:84%
is to control a
desired frequency.

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:20.200 align:middle line:84%
These frequencies vary upon
the organisms being treated.

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:22.720 align:middle line:84%
The frequency with
its carrier wave

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:26.960 align:middle line:84%
goes through a last stage
50 Watt output tube.

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:29.940 align:middle line:84%
This tube acts as a
differential antenna,

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:33.870 align:middle line:84%
and it's important that there
is an inert gas in this tube."

00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:38.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, I certainly am not
going to just give too much

00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:41.110 align:middle line:84%
over a show like this,
because people will run.

00:46:41.110 --> 00:46:43.890 align:middle line:84%
But they had a very
definite reason

00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:45.700 align:middle line:90%
why they did what they did.

00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:49.422 align:middle line:84%
Even though they had old radio
tubes, they were using gas.

00:46:49.422 --> 00:46:50.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Noble gasses.

00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: All I hear is these
people go, you know what?

00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:54.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm smarter than Rife.

00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And I developed this new state
of the art with circuitry

00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:00.447 align:middle line:90%
and it does this.

00:47:00.447 --> 00:47:02.655 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a little box
that puts out frequencies

00:47:02.655 --> 00:47:04.155 align:middle line:84%
at a certain rate
through electrons.

00:47:04.155 --> 00:47:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Yes, but they had
more things going for them.

00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:06.674 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:06.674 --> 00:47:09.120 align:middle line:84%
It was passing through many
more processes of refinement.

00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:09.786 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Exactly.

00:47:09.786 --> 00:47:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And who's to say that one of
those processes that these very

00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:middle line:84%
smart thinking people
today have bypassed

00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:19.790 align:middle line:90%
is making a difference?

00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:22.980 align:middle line:84%
Because they did not sit and
treat people with the multiple

00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:24.690 align:middle line:90%
frequencies at one time.

00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:27.100 align:middle line:84%
Nor were there
treatments for an hour.

00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:29.750 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of these devices,
when I've been asked--

00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:32.724 align:middle line:84%
and I had the Rife
microscope back in 1984.

00:47:32.724 --> 00:47:33.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:39.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: So I have said, look,
if you're claiming your device

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:42.290 align:middle line:84%
works, I would like to know
you have a Rife device--

00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:45.900 align:middle line:84%
and you know we like Rife--
where is your documentation?

00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:52.330 align:middle line:84%
Show me a before and an after
using your Rife machine.

00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:54.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which, of
course, nobody can do.

00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:54.470 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Well, of course.

00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:56.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so everyone's
out there saying,

00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:59.270 align:middle line:84%
no, no, I think that this
particular virus operates

00:47:59.270 --> 00:48:02.527 align:middle line:84%
at this particular frequency,
which might be 8.255 Hertz.

00:48:02.527 --> 00:48:03.110 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:48:03.110 --> 00:48:05.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But in
fact, can you cause

00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:12.314 align:middle line:84%
damage if you're then treating
it and it's actually at 8.283?

00:48:12.314 --> 00:48:13.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: One of the
most dangerous things

00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:15.565 align:middle line:90%
in our universe is frequency.

00:48:15.565 --> 00:48:16.648 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And electricity.

00:48:16.648 --> 00:48:18.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: It is a savior.

00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:19.690 align:middle line:90%
It can be a destroyer.

00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:22.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what happens if
it's calibrated incorrectly

00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:26.020 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying to work
with a person with, say,

00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:28.220 align:middle line:90%
a cancer of some kind?

00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:29.720 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: It will not do anything.

00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:33.410 align:middle line:84%
However, I'm not claiming these
Rife machines are that bad.

00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:36.970 align:middle line:84%
But the amount of studies
that have shown people

00:48:36.970 --> 00:48:40.800 align:middle line:84%
near high tension wires,
miners under the ground

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:44.380 align:middle line:84%
with the lights at the top
of the caves that they're in,

00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:46.870 align:middle line:84%
basically, or the
mines that they're in,

00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:50.170 align:middle line:84%
have increased incidences
of leukemia and cancer.

00:48:50.170 --> 00:48:55.330 align:middle line:84%
So one frequency will cause
cancer, or many frequencies,

00:48:55.330 --> 00:49:01.310 align:middle line:84%
and other millivolts of
electricity can destroy it.

00:49:01.310 --> 00:49:04.580 align:middle line:84%
I just don't like
what is being done.

00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And when somebody has answered
who has these machines,

00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:11.000 align:middle line:84%
well, Steve, you know
with the FDA and the AMA--

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm worried about the doctor.

00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:13.410 align:middle line:90%
Here's what I say.

00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:15.560 align:middle line:90%
Scratch out the doctor's name.

00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:17.720 align:middle line:90%
Scratch out the patient's name.

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:20.350 align:middle line:90%
Show me a before and after.

00:49:20.350 --> 00:49:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And oh, yes, by the way, did
your patient change their diet?

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:26.360 align:middle line:90%
Are they meditating?

00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:28.692 align:middle line:90%
Are they listening to music?

00:49:28.692 --> 00:49:29.900 align:middle line:90%
Because then you don't know--

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:31.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All those things
change the environment, which

00:49:31.590 --> 00:49:33.670 align:middle line:84%
is changing and it's in a
state of flux all the time.

00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:35.670 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: But did that work
and not their machine?

00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:37.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:42.120 align:middle line:84%
You want to wait until the Rife
microscope or better has been

00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:46.980 align:middle line:84%
returned or completed, and
then look at the calibration,

00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:48.950 align:middle line:84%
however these machines
are calibrated.

00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying it's in
everyone's best interest

00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:54.470 align:middle line:84%
to try to recreate the
original thought, if not

00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:55.580 align:middle line:90%
exact technology.

00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: I would think,
because the difference is

00:49:57.830 --> 00:50:00.240 align:middle line:84%
the results that they
were getting back then

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:02.820 align:middle line:84%
and the caliber
of the researchers

00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:05.440 align:middle line:84%
and what they had to say
in their follow up letters

00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:07.560 align:middle line:84%
and what they were
doing is not happening.

00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:12.280 align:middle line:84%
I believe part of that, Regina,
is the positive thinking

00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:14.190 align:middle line:90%
of the story of Rife.

00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And then I give you this
machine that I have developed,

00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:20.390 align:middle line:90%
and I told you that story.

00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:22.040 align:middle line:90%
How much is that worth?

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:25.800 align:middle line:84%
Because what I have learned
is the Rife machines always

00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:29.925 align:middle line:84%
work at first for people,
and then they tell me,

00:50:29.925 --> 00:50:32.310 align:middle line:84%
gosh, it wasn't so
effective later.

00:50:32.310 --> 00:50:35.550 align:middle line:84%
Or after two weeks, it
wasn't having the same--

00:50:35.550 --> 00:50:37.970 align:middle line:90%
or I gave my machine away.

00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And then that Rife
name ends up to be--

00:50:41.410 --> 00:50:43.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to say it's trashed.

00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:45.520 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a purist.

00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:47.700 align:middle line:90%
I say start from the original.

00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:49.960 align:middle line:90%
And I mean the originals.

00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:51.660 align:middle line:90%
And then back track.

00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, I've
met too many people

00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:57.370 align:middle line:84%
who tell me they're
great physicists

00:50:57.370 --> 00:50:58.995 align:middle line:84%
and they know better,
but they're not

00:50:58.995 --> 00:50:59.870 align:middle line:90%
doing the same thing.

00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:01.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They don't have
access to the information.

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:01.946 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Correct.

00:51:01.946 --> 00:51:06.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, there is another
device, another microscope

00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:07.720 align:middle line:90%
that's on the horizon.

00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:09.520 align:middle line:90%
And it's coming very close?

00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:10.830 align:middle line:90%
Has a patent?

00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:11.916 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: It is patented.

00:51:11.916 --> 00:51:14.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what will
that offer along this line?

00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:15.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: This other
microscope is going

00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:20.400 align:middle line:84%
to offer a depth very,
very close to the Rife.

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:24.050 align:middle line:84%
I have seen pictures
through this microscope.

00:51:24.050 --> 00:51:29.010 align:middle line:84%
The inventors need a little
bit of financial resources

00:51:29.010 --> 00:51:31.450 align:middle line:84%
to complete it the way
that they would like.

00:51:31.450 --> 00:51:33.620 align:middle line:84%
But the patent has
already been granted.

00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And what was exciting was
they are seeing particles,

00:51:37.830 --> 00:51:41.420 align:middle line:84%
living organisms
in gold, in silver.

00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:45.060 align:middle line:84%
They are looking
at a world again

00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:49.610 align:middle line:84%
that is so unique to what
we are familiar with.

00:51:49.610 --> 00:51:50.430 align:middle line:90%
I laugh.

00:51:50.430 --> 00:51:53.350 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about billions
being spent for research

00:51:53.350 --> 00:51:56.890 align:middle line:84%
and they're using Mickey
Mouse microscopes.

00:51:56.890 --> 00:51:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And even the ones that
are purportedly more

00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:02.890 align:middle line:84%
powerful with their shadows
and not seeing clearly,

00:52:02.890 --> 00:52:05.470 align:middle line:90%
money needs to be spent.

00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:09.950 align:middle line:84%
I hope and wish, I pray, that
there are opulent people who

00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:15.790 align:middle line:84%
are watching this program
and will say, you know what?

00:52:15.790 --> 00:52:18.110 align:middle line:84%
If I go the standard
route, I'm going

00:52:18.110 --> 00:52:20.090 align:middle line:84%
to die of cancer like
all of the big movie

00:52:20.090 --> 00:52:21.780 align:middle line:90%
stars, all the politicians.

00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:23.940 align:middle line:84%
They had plenty of
money, but they're

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:26.730 align:middle line:90%
looking in the wrong direction.

00:52:26.730 --> 00:52:33.720 align:middle line:84%
Let's make a commitment to spend
$5 million out of $20 billion,

00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:37.980 align:middle line:84%
set up electromagnetic
research areas.

00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:40.160 align:middle line:90%
We have the basic frequencies.

00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:43.250 align:middle line:84%
We know what was being
done-- and really

00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:48.000 align:middle line:84%
see what we can come up
with instead of this old boy

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.760 align:middle line:84%
network that never really
derives any benefit.

00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:53.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
reality is some

00:52:53.550 --> 00:52:58.380 align:middle line:84%
of these things are being done
with some success already,

00:52:58.380 --> 00:53:01.640 align:middle line:84%
but not within the US, because
what happens if you try

00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:04.987 align:middle line:84%
to use an electromagnetic
healing device in the US?

00:53:04.987 --> 00:53:07.320 align:middle line:84%
When you were telling me
this-- I had heard this before,

00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:10.050 align:middle line:84%
but every time, it just
gets my blood boiling.

00:53:10.050 --> 00:53:13.230 align:middle line:84%
What happens if you
set out to do that?

00:53:13.230 --> 00:53:15.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: In my book,
And Nothing Happened

00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:18.900 align:middle line:84%
But You Can Make It Happen,
I have a whole sequence

00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:22.100 align:middle line:90%
of different items like this.

00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:24.182 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want to
mention the diapoles.

00:53:24.182 --> 00:53:26.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if that was
one you were thinking.

00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:27.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
I do want to talk

00:53:27.050 --> 00:53:28.850 align:middle line:84%
about that in some
depth in the next show.

00:53:28.850 --> 00:53:29.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yeah.

00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:32.520 align:middle line:84%
The diapoles accelerated
wound healing twice

00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:36.400 align:middle line:84%
normal speed, documented
at 20 US universities,

00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:37.960 align:middle line:90%
used in the Olympics.

00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:40.150 align:middle line:84%
The FDA banned it
as a quack device

00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:42.240 align:middle line:90%
because it was mislabeled.

00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:43.170 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:53:43.170 --> 00:53:45.710 align:middle line:84%
Because it said it
accelerated healing.

00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:49.180 align:middle line:84%
The FDA said that is
obviously mislabeled

00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:50.920 align:middle line:90%
because nothing can do that.

00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And it was banned for 15 years
in the United States-- used

00:53:55.450 --> 00:54:00.240 align:middle line:84%
in several Olympics, used over
in Europe, until the diapoles

00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:05.030 align:middle line:84%
corporation beat the FDA in
court when the judge asked,

00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:07.680 align:middle line:90%
FDA, what do you got?

00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:09.190 align:middle line:90%
They got 35 studies.

00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:10.427 align:middle line:90%
You have nothing.

00:54:10.427 --> 00:54:12.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there are
some good things happening.

00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:15.140 align:middle line:84%
What I was referring
to is if an MD decided

00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:19.100 align:middle line:84%
he wanted to use some kind
of electrical healing device,

00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:19.760 align:middle line:90%
they're not--

00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Well, they
could lose their--

00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:21.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They'll lose
their license right away.

00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:24.210 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: They could, because
that would be automatic.

00:54:24.210 --> 00:54:26.677 align:middle line:84%
They would not even be
allowed, because you

00:54:26.677 --> 00:54:28.630 align:middle line:84%
know where the
pharmaceutical was spending

00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:31.800 align:middle line:84%
a lot of their money
with the government?

00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:35.659 align:middle line:84%
To legislate laws that
chemotherapy and radiation--

00:54:35.659 --> 00:54:37.325 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are the
first line of defense.

00:54:37.325 --> 00:54:39.033 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Right, and
everything else, then,

00:54:39.033 --> 00:54:40.381 align:middle line:90%
would be alternative medicine.

00:54:40.381 --> 00:54:41.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And is
that now how it is?

00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:46.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: It's a little better
because there are some states,

00:54:46.350 --> 00:54:48.130 align:middle line:84%
there are some
areas where there's

00:54:48.130 --> 00:54:50.340 align:middle line:90%
a little bit more freedom.

00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:52.990 align:middle line:84%
But that's only if you
don't have too much success,

00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:56.350 align:middle line:84%
because you see, the
more success you have,

00:54:56.350 --> 00:54:59.990 align:middle line:84%
you become a threat
to somebody's income.

00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:04.140 align:middle line:84%
And the income is-- we want
you to keep taking a pill.

00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:06.760 align:middle line:84%
Because with all of
the pharmaceuticals

00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:11.170 align:middle line:84%
that we talk about, what
really rectifies the problem?

00:55:11.170 --> 00:55:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Did it rectify cancer,
arthritis, diabetes?

00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:18.380 align:middle line:84%
Or is it just helping you
tolerate, to live with pain?

00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And so these techniques
we're talking about

00:55:22.290 --> 00:55:28.090 align:middle line:84%
went right to the source
to stop it, to end it.

00:55:28.090 --> 00:55:30.210 align:middle line:84%
But our medicine
today isn't like that.

00:55:30.210 --> 00:55:33.640 align:middle line:84%
The doctors can
lose their license.

00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:36.850 align:middle line:84%
Brzezinski didn't lose his
license-- Dr. Brzesinski

00:55:36.850 --> 00:55:39.190 align:middle line:90%
antineoplastins in Houston.

00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:41.565 align:middle line:84%
But they have to spend money
beating off the authorities.

00:55:41.565 --> 00:55:43.523 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Constantly
fighting the legal system.

00:55:43.523 --> 00:55:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Every month, right.

00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:45.406 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:55:45.406 --> 00:55:47.326 align:middle line:84%
And any income they
have really goes

00:55:47.326 --> 00:55:48.450 align:middle line:90%
to their own legal defense.

00:55:48.450 --> 00:55:48.880 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: That's correct.

00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:50.463 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
energy's drained off

00:55:50.463 --> 00:55:52.970 align:middle line:84%
when these incredible,
especially cancer, cures

00:55:52.970 --> 00:55:54.170 align:middle line:84%
are right there and
available for all of us.

00:55:54.170 --> 00:55:56.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And I don't know if
we have a minute left, but--

00:55:56.140 --> 00:55:57.515 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: About
one minute, yeah.

00:55:57.515 --> 00:56:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: I spoke about Dr.
Nordenstrom, in Sweden.

00:56:00.750 --> 00:56:02.130 align:middle line:90%
We had him.

00:56:02.130 --> 00:56:06.300 align:middle line:84%
I was with this man for
two weeks in Los Angeles.

00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:08.810 align:middle line:84%
He was telling me-- he's
the discoverer of needle

00:56:08.810 --> 00:56:12.670 align:middle line:84%
biopsy, top radiologist,
but when he came out

00:56:12.670 --> 00:56:16.020 align:middle line:84%
with his cure or
his technique, they

00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:20.560 align:middle line:84%
called him an alternative
medical practitioner.

00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:24.270 align:middle line:84%
So when you hear the word
"alternative," your audience,

00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:27.110 align:middle line:84%
don't think that
means no credentials.

00:56:27.110 --> 00:56:28.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And I interviewed about three
months ago Patrick Flanagan.

00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:37.630 align:middle line:84%
Patrick Flanagan has an
unusually full understanding

00:56:37.630 --> 00:56:40.660 align:middle line:84%
of energy, for a lot of
factors and going deep

00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:43.910 align:middle line:84%
into his past life
as Nikola Tesla.

00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:46.292 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him about
some of his technologies

00:56:46.292 --> 00:56:47.000 align:middle line:90%
he's worked with.

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, how
do you keep healthy?

00:56:48.750 --> 00:56:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And he said he takes an
electrical bath every day.

00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:53.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, he can, first of
all, create the device

00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:55.610 align:middle line:90%
and calibrate it properly.

00:56:55.610 --> 00:57:00.560 align:middle line:84%
So he sits within the
radiation of this electricity

00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:02.930 align:middle line:84%
in this electricity
bath every day.

00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:04.380 align:middle line:90%
And he said it kills everything.

00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:05.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to
worry about disease.

00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:08.860 align:middle line:10%
>>ROSS: And it's going to be
shown, in the next segment we

00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:12.870 align:middle line:10%
do when we talk about some
of these particulars, how

00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:17.290 align:middle line:10%
accurate-- and in the '20s,
they already had come up

00:57:17.290 --> 00:57:20.910 align:middle line:10%
with frequencies and this bath.

00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:21.870 align:middle line:90%
That's perfect.

00:57:21.870 --> 00:57:22.545 align:middle line:90%
I like it.

00:57:22.545 --> 00:57:23.545 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is perfect.

00:57:23.545 --> 00:57:26.670 align:middle line:84%
So with that, Steven is
going to be joining us again

00:57:26.670 --> 00:57:29.795 align:middle line:84%
for another conversation we have
alluded to already about what

00:57:29.795 --> 00:57:32.450 align:middle line:84%
has happened to all these
magnificent technologies,

00:57:32.450 --> 00:57:34.380 align:middle line:84%
along with others that
were killing the most

00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:37.640 align:middle line:84%
vicious diseases without
any harmful side effects.

00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:40.590 align:middle line:84%
This is a story that naturally
makes a lot of people angry.

00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:43.680 align:middle line:84%
But it also offers a glimpse as
to what's still available to us

00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:46.200 align:middle line:84%
now, even if we do have
to dig a bit to find it.

00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:50.330 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.

00:57:50.330 --> 00:57:59.830 align:middle line:90%
