00:00:18.928 --> 00:00:20.720 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: As
we continue our quest

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.360 align:middle line:10%
to question everything, our
guest today, Aaron Abke,

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.630 align:middle line:10%
has had to dig deep
into his questioning

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.220 align:middle line:10%
of his indoctrination
and beliefs

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.430 align:middle line:10%
as a preacher and
evangelical preacher's child.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.020 align:middle line:84%
He became a pastor
at the age of 23,

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.020 align:middle line:84%
out of a true desire to
know the truth, to know God.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.970 align:middle line:90%
But then everything changed.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.050 align:middle line:90%
Aaron, welcome.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.130 align:middle line:90%
It's so good to see you.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>>AARON ABKE: So good to
see you as well, Regina.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.990 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.115 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and I'm
glad we had a little chance

00:00:45.115 --> 00:00:46.723 align:middle line:84%
to catch up behind
the scenes, too,

00:00:46.723 --> 00:00:48.390 align:middle line:84%
and get to know each
other a little bit.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And so, as we get into
Christianity and subjects

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.910 align:middle line:84%
around Christianity that are not
more esoteric and gnostic based,

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.780 align:middle line:84%
OK, a lot of us ran
away from the church

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.720 align:middle line:84%
and went into what's
called New Age, which

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.019 align:middle line:90%
isn't really new anymore.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.110 align:middle line:84%
It's just a variety
of ways of being

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.850 align:middle line:84%
spiritual without attending
a specific church.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:09.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Yeah.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So first
of all, your comments

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.850 align:middle line:84%
and your responses to all that
before we even get into it.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.330 align:middle line:10%
>>ABKE: Well, I've always
had this passionate bent

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.290 align:middle line:10%
towards saving Christianity
from fundamentalism, saving it

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.220 align:middle line:10%
from patriarchal structures that
have captured it, in my opinion.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.600 align:middle line:84%
Almost nothing represents
the true teachings of Jesus

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.270 align:middle line:84%
or the Jesus movement that began
in the first century Palestine.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.190 align:middle line:10%
And so I began diving into
the scholarship and studies

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.600 align:middle line:10%
of first-century Jewish
Christianity to unpack how do we

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.270 align:middle line:10%
get as close to the
source of the living

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.930 align:middle line:10%
historical Jesus, the great
master Yeshua, the Nazarene.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.300 align:middle line:84%
What is the closest source
to learn about this man?

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.750 align:middle line:90%
And what did he really teach?

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, it has to be his Jewish
followers in the first century

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.950 align:middle line:84%
before it became a
gentile religion, all

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.060 align:middle line:84%
of Jesus's followers,
and Jesus himself,

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.360 align:middle line:84%
were devout Hebrew,
Aramaic speaking Jews,

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.430 align:middle line:84%
not gentile pagan
Greeks that spoke Greek.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.000 align:middle line:90%
And so we have a cultural--

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.500 align:middle line:84%
scholars call it "the
parting of the ways."

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.910 align:middle line:84%
Sometime around
100 AD, after Paul

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.320 align:middle line:84%
had done his gentile
ministry career,

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.520 align:middle line:84%
the gentile Christian world
began to burgeon and explode

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.710 align:middle line:84%
while the temple
was destroyed in 70

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.502 align:middle line:84%
AD the Jewish Christians are
scattered across the diaspora.

00:02:25.502 --> 00:02:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And now the Christian religion
has been completely divorced

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:28.770 align:middle line:90%
from of its--

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:29.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Completely co-opted.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:30.832 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Or origins, yeah.

00:02:30.832 --> 00:02:34.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're going to
get into your wonderful research

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.720 align:middle line:84%
on the Book of
the Hebrews, which

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.230 align:middle line:84%
is what you're talking about,
some really ancient texts that

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.260 align:middle line:90%
survived.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.390 align:middle line:84%
So first, let's get into
your background a bit.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And as a son of a preacher,
and then becoming one yourself,

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.400 align:middle line:84%
your days in church,
which were very

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.530 align:middle line:84%
different than what
you experienced once

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.920 align:middle line:90%
you became a preacher.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Oh yeah.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.053 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about your childhood

00:02:56.053 --> 00:02:58.340 align:middle line:84%
as a preacher's son and then
the choice to become one.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.260 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Yeah, yeah.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, my passion today
is to do everything

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.030 align:middle line:84%
I can to either
reform Christianity,

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.420 align:middle line:84%
back to the teachings of Jesus
that they have, in my opinion,

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.140 align:middle line:84%
completely abandoned for
the teachings of Paul,

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.530 align:middle line:84%
because I grew up as a, like you
said, third-generation pastor's

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.700 align:middle line:90%
son in Evangelical Christianity.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.530 align:middle line:84%
And I was just a super
devout Christian.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.060 align:middle line:90%
I love Jesus with all my heart.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.220 align:middle line:84%
I was not like a fake
Christian in any way.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.740 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I thought
everybody else

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.030 align:middle line:84%
was kind of a milquetoast
Christian compared to me.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.190 align:middle line:90%
I was all in.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: And I went to
Oral Roberts University

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.650 align:middle line:84%
to get my bachelor's degree,
a double bachelor's in music

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.740 align:middle line:84%
and theology, to begin my
ministry career as a worship

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.650 align:middle line:84%
pastor, because I grew up,
playing worship music in church

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:39.890 align:middle line:90%
and leading worship.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to
eventually follow

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.390 align:middle line:84%
in my dad and
grandfather's footsteps

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.990 align:middle line:90%
and be a senior pastor one day.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.200 align:middle line:84%
So I was going to start
as a worship minister

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.440 align:middle line:90%
and go from there.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And my dad's church, our church
was very spirit-filled, not

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.420 align:middle line:90%
fundamentalist, not legalistic.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.220 align:middle line:90%
We were doing--

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You said, no hell.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.990 align:middle line:90%
There was no hell.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: Yeah, we never
taught about hell.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.830 align:middle line:84%
I think we secretly believed
it and all the same stuff,

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.020 align:middle line:84%
but we never wanted
to talk about it.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It wasn't the focus.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:03.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Not at all.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And so I had the
luxury of avoiding

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.530 align:middle line:84%
grappling with those
dogmatic beliefs

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.580 align:middle line:84%
until I got my first
full-time pastoral job at 23.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.205 align:middle line:84%
And the story is, I was sitting
in the front row of the church,

00:04:15.205 --> 00:04:16.269 align:middle line:90%
my very first Sunday.

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:16.899 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wait a moment.

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:17.410 align:middle line:90%
Before you even got that.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Yeah.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.195 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
the interview process.

00:04:19.195 --> 00:04:20.029 align:middle line:90%
Here, they see--

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.987 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:04:20.987 --> 00:04:22.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --this
gorgeous young person

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.560 align:middle line:90%
that knows the Bible coming in.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.602 align:middle line:90%
Their churches are dying.

00:04:25.602 --> 00:04:26.435 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: All of them.

00:04:26.435 --> 00:04:28.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All over the
world, everywhere I go.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.650 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter what
the denomination is.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:31.970 align:middle line:90%
Few old people left.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And this was no different
in your community, right?

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.080 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted--
like, yes, we want him.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: Yeah, well, I knew
church attendance was shrinking

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.537 align:middle line:90%
and dwindling, even back then.

00:04:43.537 --> 00:04:45.620 align:middle line:84%
Everybody was aware of it
and would talk about it.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.230 align:middle line:84%
But it's because the
end times are coming

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.188 align:middle line:84%
and everything's going
to hell in a handbasket.

00:04:49.188 --> 00:04:50.510 align:middle line:90%
That's why church is shrinking.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And there's a study
that churchtrack.com

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.640 align:middle line:84%
did that showed that 1.2
million Americans per year

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.910 align:middle line:90%
stop going to church.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.540 align:middle line:84%
I think it's something like
10% decline every 12 years.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:03.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: That's huge.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And so every church I
interviewed at, there was five,

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.415 align:middle line:84%
all of them had the same exact
reason for wanting to hire me.

00:05:10.415 --> 00:05:12.290 align:middle line:84%
They said, look, our
church is getting older.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:13.670 align:middle line:90%
There's no young people here.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.327 align:middle line:84%
We need to get some
young blood in so

00:05:15.327 --> 00:05:16.910 align:middle line:84%
that we can attract
more young people,

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.535 align:middle line:84%
or our congregation
is going to die out

00:05:18.535 --> 00:05:19.760 align:middle line:90%
in 10 years or something.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And I started to realize,
wow, every single church

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm interviewing at
has this problem.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And so when I finally took my
first time position at a church,

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.040 align:middle line:84%
I started to realize why
nobody goes to church anymore,

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.510 align:middle line:90%
nobody my age, at least.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.720 align:middle line:84%
So I was sitting
in the front row.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And this woman goes on stage
to give an offering testimony.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And there's this man standing
behind her, kind of stoically.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, please be a
security guard or something.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:44.410 align:middle line:90%
Please--

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why would she
need one this Sunday?

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: Yeah, I've never
seen this before in church.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.147 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen a man
standing behind a woman.

00:05:50.147 --> 00:05:52.187 align:middle line:84%
And in my mind, I know
the Bible pretty well.

00:05:52.187 --> 00:05:54.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking about all
the verses from Paul,

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.470 align:middle line:90%
and I think First Timothy.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.480 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sitting there
in the front row,

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.310 align:middle line:84%
hoping I'm not seeing
what I'm seeing.

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.022 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, she
goes down from the stage,

00:06:02.022 --> 00:06:03.980 align:middle line:84%
and they sit next to each
other and hold hands.

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking
over going, dang it,

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm at a super
fundamentalist church

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.970 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't realize
was this legalistic.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to be
at a church that believes

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.330 align:middle line:90%
women are inferior to men.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:16.490 align:middle line:90%
Are you kidding me?

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And I had just gotten
married as well.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.050 align:middle line:90%
I was 23.

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.570 align:middle line:90%
My wife, at the time, was 20.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And we got home, and
she's upset and angry.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.600 align:middle line:90%
Can you believe they did that?

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.920 align:middle line:84%
Can you believe they
believed that stuff here?

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, I
know, sweetheart,

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.372 align:middle line:90%
we're going to figure this out.

00:06:28.372 --> 00:06:30.172 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were
really blowing back

00:06:30.172 --> 00:06:31.130 align:middle line:90%
against fundamentalism.

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:31.970 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Oh, yeah.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.473 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not
against Christianity.

00:06:33.473 --> 00:06:34.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Well, yeah, I mean--

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But still,
it took you down.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:36.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: It did.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.727 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to save Christianity.

00:06:38.727 --> 00:06:40.310 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to save my
religion because I

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:41.310 align:middle line:90%
was a devout Christian.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.660 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't even have known who
Aaron Abke is without being

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:45.870 align:middle line:90%
a Christian back then.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And the idea of
leaving Christianity

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.830 align:middle line:90%
was horrifyingly scary to me.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.800 align:middle line:84%
Every single person I
know, family and friends,

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.340 align:middle line:90%
are all devout Christians.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.710 align:middle line:84%
What am I going to do
if I leave Christianity,

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:56.940 align:middle line:90%
start my life over?

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And that took me many years
to grapple with that fear of,

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.500 align:middle line:84%
like, yes, I am going
to blow up my life,

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.858 align:middle line:84%
everyone's going to heresy hunt
me, probably even my own family.

00:07:04.858 --> 00:07:06.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You'd lose everybody.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.450 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Yes.

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All social
contexts for your life.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.210 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: And that's
what happened.

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:10.793 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now you
leave the church.

00:07:10.793 --> 00:07:12.925 align:middle line:84%
And now you go pure
materials, right?

00:07:12.925 --> 00:07:14.007 align:middle line:90%
You decide to go into--

00:07:14.007 --> 00:07:16.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what you're doing
with your beliefs at that time.

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:16.790 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Neither did I.

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:19.457 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you decide to go a
completely different direction.

00:07:19.457 --> 00:07:22.260 align:middle line:84%
You decide to really get into
working out, feeling your body.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And because you
look like you do,

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.940 align:middle line:84%
you actually became a model
for the fitness industry.

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:27.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Yeah.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk about that a
little bit and what that led to.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: Yeah, it led to
where I am today, for sure.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.720 align:middle line:84%
All the spiritual awakening
that I went through

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.200 align:middle line:84%
after leaving Christianity
was just monumental

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.845 align:middle line:90%
for me becoming who I am today.

00:07:41.845 --> 00:07:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And it started with leaving
Christianity and having

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.940 align:middle line:84%
this identity crisis,
where I have no idea who

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.750 align:middle line:90%
I am without Christianity.

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And the only other
thing I had still

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.325 align:middle line:84%
part of my ego at that point
was working out and exercise.

00:07:53.325 --> 00:07:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And I had always
been huge into that.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.480 align:middle line:84%
So I just went full
bore into that,

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.320 align:middle line:84%
became a full-time
personal trainer.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.480 align:middle line:84%
I was a CrossFit
competitor for five years.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And then I became a fitness
model in San Francisco.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And then I became a
professional bodybuilder

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.350 align:middle line:90%
and was into all that world.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And I had a significant
spiritual awakening at 27,

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.210 align:middle line:90%
while I was working at Google.

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:14.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:18.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: I was working there for
four years as a personal trainer

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.610 align:middle line:84%
and the head of the
CrossFit organization there,

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:23.130 align:middle line:84%
and had an awakening
during my lunch

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:26.710 align:middle line:90%
break at 27 or 28 years old.

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And it completely blew the
doors off of everything

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.413 align:middle line:84%
I thought I knew
about God and reality.

00:08:32.413 --> 00:08:34.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What was it,
what was the awakening?

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.960 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: Well, essentially I
was listening to Eckhart Tolle,

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:40.179 align:middle line:84%
and I was really depressed,
like, severely depressed,

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:42.280 align:middle line:84%
battling with suicidal
thoughts every day.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.960 align:middle line:90%
My identity had been torn apart.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.060 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea who I am.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you lost
your spiritual bearings,

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.950 align:middle line:90%
your sense of real self.

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:50.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: Yes, and
everybody's screaming at me

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:52.260 align:middle line:84%
that I'm a hypocrite
and a new-age heretic.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:53.080 align:middle line:90%
I have no friends.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm living alone in the
Bay area, super depressed.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And so Eckhart's teachings were
like my anchor at that point.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And just listening
to a lecture one day,

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.640 align:middle line:84%
like I would always
do at lunch, something

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.390 align:middle line:84%
he was saying just
kind of opened--

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:06.240 align:middle line:84%
it was like a curtain
was pulled back.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And I was just permitted
into another realm.

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And it was just the
oneness of the universe.

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And I realized,
oh, God is oneness.

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.117 align:middle line:90%
And that's what Jesus said.

00:09:14.117 --> 00:09:16.450 align:middle line:84%
If you don't love the least
of these, you don't love me.

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:19.360 align:middle line:84%
In John 17, God, I pray that
they would all be one in us,

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.640 align:middle line:90%
as you and I are one.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.080 align:middle line:90%
God is oneness.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what catapulted
my passion for Eastern teachings

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:29.490 align:middle line:84%
and mysticism, and eventually
coming full circle back

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:32.440 align:middle line:84%
to the teachings of Jesus,
and realizing, oh, wow,

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.050 align:middle line:84%
this was an extremely
enlightened man,

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:39.270 align:middle line:84%
a true spiritual master, a
very rare avatar-level soul

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:42.460 align:middle line:84%
that came to this planet to
show us the perfect way to God.

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
realized Jesus already

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.110 align:middle line:84%
showed us the perfect way to
God through his teachings.

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:48.110 align:middle line:90%
We don't need a church.

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:48.770 align:middle line:90%
We don't need Paul.

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:49.970 align:middle line:90%
We don't need anything else.

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:52.580 align:middle line:84%
Jesus taught us a
complete Gospel.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm, and
interestingly, for the times

00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.370 align:middle line:84%
and for the day, the other
great masters and avatars

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:03.800 align:middle line:84%
came with probably
as potent a message.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.340 align:middle line:84%
There's thought that
they're motivated

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:10.630 align:middle line:84%
by one very great being that
comes to Earth, and probably

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:14.110 align:middle line:84%
other places, at times
where true knowledge needs

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:16.700 align:middle line:84%
to be seeded and hearts
need to be opened again.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.570 align:middle line:84%
But for you, after going
back and circling back around

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:22.690 align:middle line:84%
to some of the others
that preceded Jesus,

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:26.740 align:middle line:84%
you found that the most
recent avatar historically

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.730 align:middle line:84%
is the message that really
resonates with you best.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:30.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Oh, yes.

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, we
actually have proof

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:34.840 align:middle line:84%
that the early Jewish
Christians, the Ebionim,

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.670 align:middle line:84%
was their name in the first
century, followers of Jesus,

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:42.520 align:middle line:84%
they believed that the Christ
is an eternal archetype that

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.240 align:middle line:84%
incarnates many times
throughout history.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't first in
Jesus, but Jesus was just

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.290 align:middle line:90%
another incarnation of it.

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:47.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:50.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: And we know that because
of the Catholic Church fathers

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:53.870 align:middle line:84%
accusing the Ebionites,
Ebionim, of that belief.

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Epiphanius in the
Panarion accuses them

00:10:56.140 --> 00:11:00.370 align:middle line:84%
of believing that the Christ
reincarnates throughout time,

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:02.090 align:middle line:84%
is one of their
heretical beliefs.

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:03.640 align:middle line:84%
But it's like, hey,
Epiphanius, these

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.453 align:middle line:84%
are the actual
original followers,

00:11:05.453 --> 00:11:07.120 align:middle line:84%
the Jewish Christian
followers of Jesus.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Those were
the Essenes, right?

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:08.810 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Yes.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:09.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK.

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And he was one of the
Essenes, so Nazarene, yeah.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Yes, Nazarene.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so now
we're going to get

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:19.420 align:middle line:84%
into what you found in
Book of the Hebrews,

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:23.480 align:middle line:84%
but also the whole notion,
which when I was growing up,

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.950 align:middle line:90%
God and Jesus are the same.

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:26.060 align:middle line:90%
This is the same entity.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:26.270 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Right.

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:27.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: One and the same.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: And you have to
believe it or you go to hell.

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:29.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or you go to hell.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:31.130 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, that was very clear.

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And what you just said is,
in the early understandings

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:37.780 align:middle line:84%
of his people and the
group that he was part of,

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:38.890 align:middle line:90%
they didn't believe that.

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:41.450 align:middle line:84%
They knew that these
avatars come when needed.

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.282 align:middle line:84%
These brilliant beings
come when needed.

00:11:43.282 --> 00:11:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: They call them
the Tzadik, is the name.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:48.690 align:middle line:84%
It means the "just one" or
"the righteous ones" in the--

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:51.060 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the Talmudic--
or it might be the Midrash,

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:52.860 align:middle line:84%
but it's Jewish
rabbinical tradition.

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:56.660 align:middle line:84%
They have a belief that
there are at least 36 Tzadik

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:58.760 align:middle line:84%
on planet Earth at
any given time, which

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:03.020 align:middle line:84%
are like the holy sages
or avatars that keep

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.010 align:middle line:90%
the planet safe, essentially.

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus was a
Tzadik in their eyes.

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:09.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
thank you for that.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.510 align:middle line:84%
Let's go into what
you discovered, where

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:13.470 align:middle line:90%
the conflicts were, then the--

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.780 align:middle line:84%
because you'll be able to
take this on for a while.

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:19.440 align:middle line:84%
Then the story of Paul
and where it all split,

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.010 align:middle line:84%
and what Jesus had to
say about the Holy Triune

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:24.140 align:middle line:84%
to begin with, because
this whole thing

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:25.890 align:middle line:84%
axed women out
from the beginning.

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: Yep, Mary
Magdalene, all of it.

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:30.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's not what
he did-- he was misquoted.

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:30.990 align:middle line:90%
So let's--

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:31.500 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Oh, yes.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:32.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Go ahead
and take it away.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: Yeah, and feel free
to interrupt at any point.

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:34.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, sure.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:36.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: But I think your
audience is going to love this,

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:39.120 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to get into
the true origins of the Essenes,

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:42.140 align:middle line:84%
who was this enigmatic
Jewish sect that

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:46.670 align:middle line:84%
broke off of orthodoxy around
400 to 300 BCE, probably?

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:48.480 align:middle line:90%
And why did they break off?

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.050 align:middle line:84%
It's been the passion of my
life to study this subject

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:52.200 align:middle line:90%
for many years now.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And when I was a little
boy reading the Bible,

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:58.005 align:middle line:84%
I would get very
confused about the fact

00:12:58.005 --> 00:12:59.630 align:middle line:84%
that reading the Old
Testament, there's

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:03.470 align:middle line:84%
clearly two different atonement
doctrines being taught.

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:06.380 align:middle line:84%
In some passages, like
Leviticus, and more

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:09.650 align:middle line:84%
in the Pentateuch, it's like,
hey, you got to kill an animal,

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:11.680 align:middle line:84%
offer an animal on an
altar, spew its blood.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Seems rather random.

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: Yeah, God wants
bloodshed to forgive you.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, this
is a pagan practice

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:21.320 align:middle line:84%
that historians and scholars
are clear about the origins of.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.320 align:middle line:84%
In ancient, ancient times,
primitive people began--

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.360 align:middle line:84%
as they began believing in the
pantheon of gods and deities,

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.830 align:middle line:84%
they wanted to derive ways
of bringing one of these gods

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:32.780 align:middle line:84%
down to their tribe
and culture, and making

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.030 align:middle line:84%
that god be their
master and give them

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:38.360 align:middle line:84%
favor and fertility and
agriculture and war and all

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.180 align:middle line:90%
these things.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And so they tried
to make these gods

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.560 align:middle line:84%
a pet or something, where they'd
build a temple for the god

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.902 align:middle line:84%
to live inside of,
offer the god sacrifices

00:13:48.902 --> 00:13:51.110 align:middle line:84%
on an altar to feed the
gods, so it would be pleased.

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:53.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because these were
very valuable things to them.

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:53.730 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Yes.

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:56.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: An animal sacrifice
meant giving up something.

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:58.940 align:middle line:84%
It was truly-- it was
the people's sacrifice,

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:00.450 align:middle line:90%
to say nothing of the animal.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:01.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Exactly.

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:01.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: And Jesus says
in the New Testament,

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:05.640 align:middle line:90%
he quotes Hosea 6:6 twice.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:08.100 align:middle line:84%
In one of them, he says, go
and learn what this means.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.800 align:middle line:90%
I desire mercy, not sacrifice.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.335 align:middle line:84%
And if you knew
what this means, you

00:14:12.335 --> 00:14:15.310 align:middle line:84%
would not have condemned the
innocent, meaning the animals,

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:16.110 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:16.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: Who else could be
innocent in an animal sacrifice

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:20.035 align:middle line:90%
other than the animal?

00:14:20.035 --> 00:14:22.773 align:middle line:84%
It's not the sinner
offering the sacrifice.

00:14:22.773 --> 00:14:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's not the priest
that kills the animal.

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:28.850 align:middle line:84%
So Jesus loved animals and
saw this practice of sacrifice

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:30.660 align:middle line:90%
as abominable and detestable.

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And Eusebius goes into great
length about this as well.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:36.180 align:middle line:84%
So Jesus emerged from this
sect we're talking about.

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And so this sect
of Judaism began

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:43.000 align:middle line:84%
prophesying against sacrifices,
especially through prophets

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.210 align:middle line:84%
like Isaiah and Jeremiah,
who I consider to be

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:48.610 align:middle line:90%
like proto-Essene prophets.

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:51.350 align:middle line:84%
They were raging against
the sacrificial system.

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And in Jeremiah 8
verse 8, he says,

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:57.670 align:middle line:84%
"How can you say we are
wise, for the law of the Lord

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:58.550 align:middle line:90%
is with us.

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:01.960 align:middle line:84%
When, behold, the lying pen
of the scribes has turned it

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.490 align:middle line:90%
into a lie."

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And so he goes on in
chapter 7, as well,

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.770 align:middle line:84%
saying, "God never
commanded us animal

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:11.360 align:middle line:84%
sacrifices when we came
out of Egypt with Moses.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:15.110 align:middle line:84%
But here is what I commanded
you, O Israel, hear my voice,

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:18.080 align:middle line:84%
obey my voice, and be my
people, and I will be your God."

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.770 align:middle line:84%
So again, it's the 1
Samuel 15 of obedience

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:22.370 align:middle line:90%
is better than sacrifice.

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'd be reading the
Bible as a little boy

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:26.800 align:middle line:84%
and be reading all these
passages of the prophets, just

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.820 align:middle line:90%
railing against sacrifices.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:31.555 align:middle line:84%
I turn my nose away from
your abominable sacrifices,

00:15:31.555 --> 00:15:34.180 align:middle line:84%
I want nothing to do with them,
but give me righteousness, give

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:37.313 align:middle line:84%
me humility, give me a pure
heart, is what God says.

00:15:37.313 --> 00:15:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And yet, then in Leviticus,
it's like, hey, kill an animal

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:41.300 align:middle line:90%
if you want to be forgiven.

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:44.290 align:middle line:84%
But in elsewhere, God says,
I forgive anyone who repents.

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:47.170 align:middle line:84%
As long as you repent with a
truly humble and broken heart,

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:49.420 align:middle line:84%
you turn your heart to me,
I forgive you of your sins.

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:51.460 align:middle line:84%
So then why do we have
to butcher animals is

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:52.760 align:middle line:90%
what the prophets were saying.

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:55.250 align:middle line:84%
Obedience is better
than sacrifice.

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:57.940 align:middle line:84%
So at a certain point, this
temple sacrifice system

00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:59.750 align:middle line:90%
had become such a behemoth.

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:01.535 align:middle line:84%
We talked about this
last night, right?

00:16:01.535 --> 00:16:02.665 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:02.665 --> 00:16:05.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: The temple was
like big pharma, big food,

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:08.830 align:middle line:84%
and the central bank all
in one, because today,

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:11.500 align:middle line:84%
what we have is this
collusion going on

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:15.310 align:middle line:84%
between big food and big pharma,
where big food poisons the food

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:18.790 align:middle line:84%
supply to make all of us super
sick so that big pharma can

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:19.833 align:middle line:90%
offer us drugs.

00:16:19.833 --> 00:16:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And they're
exchanging the profits

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:22.340 align:middle line:90%
and they're in bed together.

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:23.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All in
the name of profit.

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:24.957 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: All in the
name of profit.

00:16:24.957 --> 00:16:28.840 align:middle line:10%
So this is identically what
happened to the Old Testament

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.610 align:middle line:10%
throughout Jewish history,
which is not taught in church,

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:32.848 align:middle line:10%
not taught in Christianity.

00:16:32.848 --> 00:16:34.390 align:middle line:84%
But when you read
and study the Bible

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:35.860 align:middle line:84%
from a scholarly
perspective, you

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:39.880 align:middle line:84%
can see this, that there was
a huge dissension over animal

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:40.680 align:middle line:90%
sacrifices.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.460 align:middle line:84%
This would have been the
hottest issue in ancient Judaism

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:44.820 align:middle line:90%
for hundreds of years.

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And some scholars even
speculate that more Jews

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:50.420 align:middle line:84%
would have been against the
temple at certain points

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.228 align:middle line:90%
than were for the temple.

00:16:52.228 --> 00:16:54.020 align:middle line:84%
But they couldn't take
it down because it's

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:56.120 align:middle line:84%
run by the priestly class
who have all the power.

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.453 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, power and money.

00:16:57.453 --> 00:17:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: So what was happening is
the scribes were acting like Big

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:04.280 align:middle line:84%
Food, Big Ag, that poisons the
food by poisoning the Torah with

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:07.349 align:middle line:84%
hundreds and hundreds
of man-made laws,

00:17:07.349 --> 00:17:10.560 align:middle line:84%
which we see in Leviticus,
so that everyone's a sinner,

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:13.940 align:middle line:84%
nobody can possibly remember
600-plus liturgical laws.

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:14.940 align:middle line:90%
I mean, give me a break.

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And a lot of
these, you have to do daily.

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: Yes, so they're
monetizing sin, right,

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:23.510 align:middle line:84%
so that now they have
to go to the priests

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:25.680 align:middle line:84%
to offer sacrifices
and pay a lot.

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.520 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot of money to buy a
goat or a bull or something.

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly, yeah.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: So the priestly class
is making hand over fist,

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.210 align:middle line:84%
sharing the profits
with the scribes.

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:34.210 align:middle line:90%
They're in bed together.

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:35.970 align:middle line:90%
And they're profiting from sin.

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:38.830 align:middle line:84%
So of course, you can understand
why Jesus cleansed the temple

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:41.170 align:middle line:84%
and thought it was all
this wicked abomination

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:43.430 align:middle line:84%
and a corruption of
the Temple of God.

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:47.050 align:middle line:84%
Jesus says, it is written
in Isaiah 11, I believe,

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:50.000 align:middle line:84%
"My house should be a house
of prayer for all nations,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.360 align:middle line:84%
but you have turned it
into a den of robbers."

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.600 align:middle line:90%
And that's Jeremiah.

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And if you go to the
Hebrew, the "den of robbers"

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:58.780 align:middle line:84%
quote in Jeremiah
that he quotes from,

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:02.150 align:middle line:84%
the Hebrew word is "parites,"
which means a violent one,

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:05.710 align:middle line:84%
a murderer, or it could even
mean a violent robber is

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:06.890 align:middle line:90%
the third definition.

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:09.860 align:middle line:84%
So they've changed it to the
third definition of robber,

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:12.460 align:middle line:84%
when it really should say,
you've turned my father's house

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:14.890 align:middle line:90%
into a den of murderers.

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:16.570 align:middle line:90%
It's a heavy rebuke from Jesus.

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:18.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes, it is.

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:22.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: So the Essenes was
this sect of Judaism that

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.830 align:middle line:90%
started opposing the temple.

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And at a certain point, they
said, we can't do this anymore.

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:29.360 align:middle line:84%
We have to break off and
form our own sect of Judaism.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And so they
sequestered themselves

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:34.210 align:middle line:84%
in the burning
wasteland of Qumran

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:36.470 align:middle line:84%
to practice their own
version of Judaism

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:38.240 align:middle line:90%
without temple sacrifices.

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And the ritual that they came
up with as an alternative

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:47.130 align:middle line:84%
to sacrifice was called
baptism, atonement baptism.

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And this is different from what
the Pharisees and Sadducees

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.410 align:middle line:84%
would have practiced with
the mikvah and purification.

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:54.570 align:middle line:84%
They would just practice
ritual purification.

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:56.480 align:middle line:84%
But for a Pharisee
or a Sadducee,

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.610 align:middle line:84%
that didn't get your
sins forgiven by God.

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:01.500 align:middle line:84%
For the Essenes and the
Dead Sea scroll group,

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.470 align:middle line:90%
baptism was the atonement act.

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:05.430 align:middle line:84%
You repent, and then
you get baptized

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:06.780 align:middle line:90%
in the waters of cleansing.

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:08.430 align:middle line:90%
They were big into natural law.

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:10.700 align:middle line:84%
The waters of cleansing,
the feminine power of water,

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:12.770 align:middle line:84%
pulls the sin, the
negative energy from you

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:13.890 align:middle line:90%
and cleanses you.

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:16.670 align:middle line:84%
And so they were very tapped
into the elements and the ways

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:18.720 align:middle line:84%
we can use natural
law for healing.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And so, I wish we had
more time to unpack

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:22.800 align:middle line:90%
all the amazing evidence.

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:26.250 align:middle line:84%
But suffice to say that Jesus,
undoubtedly, in my opinion,

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:28.860 align:middle line:84%
emerged from this
sect of Judaism.

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So going back to
one thing you didn't touch on,

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.760 align:middle line:84%
that I was talking
about a second ago,

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.170 align:middle line:90%
the notion of the Triune.

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:36.070 align:middle line:90%
It was the mother--

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:37.613 align:middle line:84%
it was the father
and the mother.

00:19:37.613 --> 00:19:38.530 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:39.947 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: And so we
had this debate,

00:19:39.947 --> 00:19:44.460 align:middle line:84%
and I had had a strategy
set up to establish

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:48.140 align:middle line:84%
the Hebrew Gospel was the first
ever recorded account of Jesus.

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:49.990 align:middle line:84%
It was not the Greek
Gospels we have.

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:53.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you say it was
tablets with only 45 passages,

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:53.950 align:middle line:90%
all told?

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:56.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: No, it was a
full Gospel account.

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:59.320 align:middle line:84%
But we only have 48 quotes
surviving from it today.

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:01.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: 48 quotes,
then, OK, all right.

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:03.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: And they are are quotes
from the mouth of the church

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:05.170 align:middle line:90%
fathers that are using them.

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:06.815 align:middle line:84%
So for the first
couple hundred years,

00:20:06.815 --> 00:20:08.190 align:middle line:84%
it's really
interesting to study,

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:10.200 align:middle line:84%
the church fathers
quote the Hebrew Gospel

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:13.650 align:middle line:84%
as a primary source
text, as an authority,

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:15.390 align:middle line:84%
as their referencing
their commentaries

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:16.330 align:middle line:90%
on the Greek Gospels.

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:17.860 align:middle line:84%
They're saying, well, the
Hebrews have it like this,

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:19.390 align:middle line:90%
and they list out the quote.

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And there's a scholar named
Johann Albrecht Bengel from

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:24.670 align:middle line:84%
the 17th century,
German scholar,

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:28.950 align:middle line:84%
who coined the basic scholarly
approach to textual criticism

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:31.800 align:middle line:84%
that we still use today of
identifying which one of these

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:35.320 align:middle line:84%
texts, if you have two ancient
scrolls or manuscripts,

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.620 align:middle line:84%
which one of these manuscripts
is the original one

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:38.980 align:middle line:90%
or the earlier one.

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And Johann said, simple,
in every single case,

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:45.960 align:middle line:84%
the more difficult reading
should always be preferred,

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:46.960 align:middle line:90%
which is obvious.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.332 align:middle line:90%
Scribes, when they copy text--

00:20:48.332 --> 00:20:49.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Back to the source.

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:50.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: They don't
copy them to make

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:52.200 align:middle line:90%
them more difficult to read.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.253 align:middle line:90%
They harmonize things.

00:20:53.253 --> 00:20:55.420 align:middle line:84%
If there's bad theology,
they clean up the theology.

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.295 align:middle line:84%
If there's spelling
errors, they clean it up.

00:20:57.295 --> 00:20:59.880 align:middle line:84%
They make it easier to
read, not harder to read.

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And so the thing that's very
striking about the Hebrew

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:05.500 align:middle line:84%
Gospel, or Hebrew Gospel of
Matthew, it's also called,

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.560 align:middle line:84%
is that it's very
ancient sounding

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:11.320 align:middle line:84%
and it's much more difficult to
read than the Greek Gospels are.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:15.280 align:middle line:84%
For example, in Matthew 19:16,
when Jesus is asked, "Rabbi,

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.440 align:middle line:84%
what must I do to
inherit eternal life."

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And he says, "keep
the Commandments,

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:21.550 align:middle line:84%
love the Lord your God, love
your neighbor as yourself."

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:24.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the Hebrew
Gospel it says, "Teacher,

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.480 align:middle line:90%
what must I do to live?"

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus says, "Man, do
the law and prophets."

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.007 align:middle line:90%
That's the exact quote.

00:21:30.007 --> 00:21:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow, yeah.

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: So we have obviously
an older tradition.

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And of course, none
of Jesus's followers

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:39.630 align:middle line:84%
would have been sophisticated
Greek-speaking scribes

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:41.070 align:middle line:90%
or literate in Greek.

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:42.370 align:middle line:90%
They were Jewish peasants.

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:44.980 align:middle line:84%
They were living a hand-to-mouth
existence in Palestine.

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:47.140 align:middle line:84%
They would have only
spoken Hebrew and Aramaic.

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And very few of them would
have even been literate

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:50.650 align:middle line:90%
in Hebrew or Aramaic.

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:53.580 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Acts 4:13 says
they were illiterate.

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:57.070 align:middle line:84%
So Jesus's disciples didn't
write those Greek Gospels.

00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And the Greek
Gospels in the Bible

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.785 align:middle line:84%
are in the third person,
not the first person.

00:22:00.785 --> 00:22:02.202 align:middle line:84%
But the Hebrew
Gospel of Matthew--

00:22:02.202 --> 00:22:03.327 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Was first person.

00:22:03.327 --> 00:22:04.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Was first person tense.

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And we have over 12
early church fathers,

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.810 align:middle line:90%
beginning with Papias in 80 AD--

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:11.380 align:middle line:90%
that's in the first century.

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:15.180 align:middle line:84%
Papias said the disciple
Matthew was the first person

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:17.220 align:middle line:84%
to write down the
oracles of the Lord,

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:20.770 align:middle line:84%
in the Hebrew dialect for the
sake of the Jewish people,

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:22.020 align:middle line:90%
the Jewish believers.

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And so we have 12
other church fathers

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.370 align:middle line:84%
who say the first Gospel
account ever written

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:28.300 align:middle line:84%
was by the disciple
Matthew himself.

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:30.243 align:middle line:84%
Matthew was a tax
collector, as we know.

00:22:30.243 --> 00:22:32.410 align:middle line:84%
So he would have had to
have been literate in Hebrew

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:34.460 align:middle line:84%
to be a tax collector,
to keep the records.

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:36.590 align:middle line:84%
So it makes sense and
it all checks out.

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And the Hebrew
Gospel of Matthew,

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:41.800 align:middle line:84%
just the 48 quotes we have,
paints a strikingly different

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:44.300 align:middle line:84%
Jesus than the Greek
Gospels we have.

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.320 align:middle line:84%
One of the most notable ones is
that Jesus calls the Holy Spirit

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.620 align:middle line:90%
"my mother."

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:51.620 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the quote, it's
a kind of bizarre quote.

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:54.010 align:middle line:84%
But to me, it's
like, if you really

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:56.500 align:middle line:84%
imagine time traveling
back to the first century

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:59.570 align:middle line:84%
to meet the great master
Yeshua of the Nazarene,

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:01.480 align:middle line:84%
and to listen to
him talk and speak,

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.210 align:middle line:84%
this very mystical
Jewish man who

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:06.367 align:middle line:84%
was teaching the oracles
of God, he probably

00:23:06.367 --> 00:23:08.450 align:middle line:84%
would have said a lot of
stuff that you'd go, wow,

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:10.680 align:middle line:90%
that was bizarre sounding.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.340 align:middle line:90%
He's very tapped in.

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:15.710 align:middle line:84%
So Jesus says, "My
mother, the Holy Spirit,

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:18.370 align:middle line:84%
took me by one of my hairs and
flew me up to the great Mountain

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:19.870 align:middle line:90%
Tabor."

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And you're like,
whoa, that's weird.

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:24.100 align:middle line:84%
He says, the Holy Spirit, his
mother took him by the hair

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:25.350 align:middle line:90%
and flew him up to a Mountain?

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:27.767 align:middle line:84%
But it's like, he was probably
having mystical experiences

00:23:27.767 --> 00:23:28.620 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:30.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, yeah.

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And also, I mean, I'm sure
he was quite capable of doing

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:34.230 align:middle line:90%
that on his own.

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:36.650 align:middle line:84%
But I was interviewing
William Henry recently,

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:40.910 align:middle line:84%
talking about the Essenes
and the traditional use

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:43.820 align:middle line:84%
in the spiritual
cultures of entheogens

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:47.450 align:middle line:84%
to help open up the heart, open
up the inner eye, and so forth.

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And so many were having these
connected mystical experiences

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:53.310 align:middle line:90%
that were ecstatic.

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And so that wasn't unusual,
apparently, among the Essenes,

00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:57.810 align:middle line:90%
it turns out.

00:23:57.810 --> 00:23:58.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Yeah, it's true.

00:23:58.590 --> 00:23:59.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:00.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: There's some
archaeological evidence

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:00.750 align:middle line:90%
for that.

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:01.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, there is.

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:02.910 align:middle line:90%
So that's interesting.

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:03.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Yeah.

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:04.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:05.552 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for sharing that bit.

00:24:05.552 --> 00:24:08.810 align:middle line:84%
So now let's get into something
that you talk about yourself.

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:12.080 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at books
of the Bible that--

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.080 align:middle line:90%
I've forgotten how many.

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.020 align:middle line:84%
I had to read it, of course,
and do Catechism and all that.

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:15.130 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: 66.

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:15.185 align:middle line:90%


00:24:15.185 --> 00:24:15.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 66 books.

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: In the Protestant
Bible, at least.

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:17.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:20.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's interesting,
because today, you

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:24.630 align:middle line:84%
have people that are able to
travel, expand the mind, go out,

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:27.620 align:middle line:84%
and they're able to tap back
into the times of Jesus,

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:28.490 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And generally speaking, the
people that write about this,

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:35.180 align:middle line:84%
it is more or less an
ecstatic experience.

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:37.420 align:middle line:84%
They're going back into
that, and more or less

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:41.770 align:middle line:84%
validating exactly what you're
saying the passages from Matthew

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:45.610 align:middle line:84%
probably represented, but
the whole notion of the fact

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:47.900 align:middle line:84%
that the Bible is
a channeled work.

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:50.150 align:middle line:84%
They say they're
divine writings.

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:51.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: Christians
believe that too.

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:53.240 align:middle line:84%
They believe the Bible
is channeled by God.

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I'm saying.

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:54.820 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Yeah.

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:56.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now
in your own, what

00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:00.680 align:middle line:84%
you've come to embrace also,
is that when we speak of God,

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:05.050 align:middle line:84%
we're speaking about the great
creative force of which we're

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:06.320 align:middle line:90%
all a spark, right?

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Yeah.

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:10.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that may be where
some of the Eastern teachings

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:13.360 align:middle line:84%
started coming in and
seeding themselves

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.170 align:middle line:84%
in you alongside your
Christian beliefs,

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:17.330 align:middle line:90%
that we are all a spark of that.

00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the things
we talked about last night

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:23.150 align:middle line:84%
is that oftentimes it
says, follow God's will.

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And I said, but
hold on a minute.

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:29.880 align:middle line:84%
We are all sovereign divine
beings in our own right.

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're
following God's will,

00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:35.495 align:middle line:84%
it's as though to say, you have
a patriarch basically saying,

00:25:35.495 --> 00:25:37.525 align:middle line:84%
you, you're supposed to
do this, this and this.

00:25:37.525 --> 00:25:39.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: God's will
is what I say it is.

00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:40.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:42.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, and that's not the correct
perception, in my opinion.

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Yeah.

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The higher
self and the soul

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:47.040 align:middle line:90%
are connected to the all.

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And it comes in with the vision
for your incarnation of what

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:53.580 align:middle line:84%
it wants to express
through the physical,

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:56.090 align:middle line:84%
your unique contributions
to life on Earth.

00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:59.570 align:middle line:84%
So every time I hear God's
will, I cringe because I think,

00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:03.530 align:middle line:84%
no, it's the will of the
soul connected to the all.

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:05.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: Right, and that's
what it should mean.

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:09.740 align:middle line:84%
At its highest definition,
that's absolutely what it means.

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:12.090 align:middle line:84%
Love-- I study and teach
a course in miracles.

00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:14.040 align:middle line:84%
It's been the pivotal
book of my life,

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.630 align:middle line:90%
probably, other than the Bible.

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:19.620 align:middle line:84%
And the course says, there is
not two wills in the universe.

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:20.900 align:middle line:90%
There's just God's will.

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:23.360 align:middle line:84%
But God's will is manifesting
through each one of us,

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.740 align:middle line:84%
as Aaron, as Regina,
as whoever you are.

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:27.660 align:middle line:84%
You are a manifestation
of God's will

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:30.120 align:middle line:84%
already, just by the
fact that you exist.

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:33.960 align:middle line:84%
And so your deepest soul
desires are God's desires.

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:36.043 align:middle line:90%
So it's one will, not two.

00:26:36.043 --> 00:26:37.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You just
hit on the word

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:38.940 align:middle line:90%
I was just going to bring up.

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:43.270 align:middle line:84%
It is really more appropriate
to say God's desire.

00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:44.070 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Yeah.

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we
always use will.

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:46.528 align:middle line:90%
Will is very masculine.

00:26:46.528 --> 00:26:47.362 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Controlling.

00:26:47.362 --> 00:26:49.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's very
controlling and very focused.

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:51.770 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't really
work well for people who

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:53.580 align:middle line:90%
are awakening in these times.

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.260 align:middle line:90%
But God's desire, that works.

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:57.510 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Yeah, it feels better.

00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:59.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everything
in the universe

00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:01.050 align:middle line:90%
exists because of desire.

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:03.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: Yes, and this is
another thing that, again,

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:07.310 align:middle line:84%
Christianity has abandoned from
Jesus's teachings is that Jesus

00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:08.150 align:middle line:90%
made--

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:11.540 align:middle line:84%
and as a spiritual teacher, I
teach how to transcend ego full

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:14.280 align:middle line:84%
time in 4D University and
on my YouTube channel.

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:16.230 align:middle line:90%
It's one of my life's passions.

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus said, if you
want to be my disciple,

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:23.610 align:middle line:84%
first deny yourself,
take up your cross,

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:25.450 align:middle line:90%
and then you can follow me.

00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:28.740 align:middle line:84%
So firstly, what self
must Jesus be talking

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:30.030 align:middle line:90%
about we're supposed to deny?

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:31.688 align:middle line:90%
The true self or the false self?

00:27:31.688 --> 00:27:32.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The lower mind.

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:33.880 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Obviously, yeah.

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:35.770 align:middle line:84%
He wouldn't ask you to
deny your true self.

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:36.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:39.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: And then, if Jesus
asked all of his followers

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:42.250 align:middle line:84%
to deny their ego, to
overcome their ego,

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:44.100 align:middle line:84%
to follow him, literally
crucify your ego

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:46.560 align:middle line:84%
every day is what
he's saying, it

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:49.320 align:middle line:84%
stands to reason Jesus probably
didn't have an ego either.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.820 align:middle line:84%
He wouldn't have
asked his disciples

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:52.835 align:middle line:90%
to do something he hadn't done.

00:27:52.835 --> 00:27:57.010 align:middle line:84%
So Jesus was never speaking
from an ego position.

00:27:57.010 --> 00:27:58.750 align:middle line:84%
He was always speaking
as the Christ,

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:01.200 align:middle line:84%
the I am, and I am the
way, I am the truth.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.040 align:middle line:84%
He's speaking, the
I am is the way.

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now we get
into basic vocabulary,

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.850 align:middle line:84%
depending on whatever sect
of information you follow.

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:12.743 align:middle line:84%
And I followed the Hermetics
texts for many years

00:28:12.743 --> 00:28:14.160 align:middle line:84%
because I found
it just a really--

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.118 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Love Hermetica.

00:28:15.118 --> 00:28:17.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's just
a good, grounded education

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:19.270 align:middle line:84%
in the background
of all religions.

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:20.070 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Yes.

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:22.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it skews
toward Christianity or Christ

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:23.890 align:middle line:90%
consciousness, I should say.

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
I love about Hermetics

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:29.850 align:middle line:84%
is they really break
down the aspects of mind.

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:32.400 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, when we're
talking about breaking down

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.210 align:middle line:90%
ego, the ego--

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:35.940 align:middle line:84%
the ego is
essentially everything

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:38.490 align:middle line:84%
that's ever collected within
your incarnations that

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:39.570 align:middle line:90%
creates you to be you.

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:44.170 align:middle line:84%
That is your personal stamp
of identity is the true ego.

00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:46.380 align:middle line:84%
But the ego they seem
to be speaking of

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:50.190 align:middle line:84%
is where the subconscious
has imprinted upon the lower

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:55.290 align:middle line:84%
mind all of the fears and
traumas and top-down dictates

00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:57.720 align:middle line:84%
from lifetime after
lifetime to bring you

00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:00.090 align:middle line:84%
into a position of either
blowing back, having

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:04.450 align:middle line:84%
to prove yourself, every
kind of dysfunction.

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:07.450 align:middle line:84%
But we can't blame
the subconscious.

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:08.495 align:middle line:90%
It's there for purpose.

00:29:08.495 --> 00:29:09.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Oh, yeah.

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:11.518 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It reminds you, when
you see that kind of spider,

00:29:11.518 --> 00:29:13.320 align:middle line:90%
run, because you died before.

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:15.130 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's really for.

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And the lower mind is to
organize things and say, yeah,

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:20.240 align:middle line:84%
I need to get to this
interview on time.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:21.040 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Yeah.

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The higher mind
paired with the soul, that's

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:25.160 align:middle line:90%
the holy grail for all of us.

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And so really, it sounds
like he was speaking about,

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:30.400 align:middle line:84%
don't go with this
old programming

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.540 align:middle line:84%
where you have to prove
yourself against the world,

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:34.300 align:middle line:90%
against me, against everything.

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.580 align:middle line:84%
That appears to be
what ego has become.

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: Yes, and you
said the right word,

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.360 align:middle line:90%
which is "imprinted."

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:42.790 align:middle line:84%
I use the word "identified,"
but that's the imprinting

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:46.900 align:middle line:84%
on the subconscious is, to me,
the ego is the mental activity

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:47.870 align:middle line:90%
of identifying.

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:48.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:49.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: I am this, I am that.

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:50.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:51.958 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: And so, as
you were saying,

00:29:51.958 --> 00:29:54.280 align:middle line:84%
we collect memories,
experiences, all kinds of stuff

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.120 align:middle line:90%
as we age and go through life.

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:58.160 align:middle line:84%
But none of that's what
we fundamentally are,

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.680 align:middle line:90%
just a temporary experience.

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:01.207 align:middle line:84%
So the ego is the
part of our mind

00:30:01.207 --> 00:30:03.290 align:middle line:84%
that always identifies
with those things and says,

00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:05.660 align:middle line:84%
I am that thing that happened
to me, I am that role,

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:07.450 align:middle line:90%
that name, that job, whatever.

00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And so it's just the
identifying that needs to stop.

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:10.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: None of the other things
are problematic after that.

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:13.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Perfect.

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:16.990 align:middle line:84%
I see you as a sane
voice for people

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:22.570 align:middle line:84%
who want to be able to hold
on to the aspects of Christ

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:27.190 align:middle line:84%
consciousness that they
identify with, while eschewing

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:28.520 align:middle line:90%
the fundamentalism.

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:32.170 align:middle line:84%
I see you as kind of a clear
voice for those people.

00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:33.440 align:middle line:90%
Give me comments on that.

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: I really do ache to
see the feminine brought back

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:41.030 align:middle line:84%
into not just Christianity,
but the world in general.

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:43.180 align:middle line:84%
You can't have a complete
spiritual modality

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:44.360 align:middle line:90%
without the feminine.

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I think that
Hebrew Gospel of Matthew quote,

00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:50.410 align:middle line:84%
of Jesus saying, calling
the Holy Spirit "my mother"

00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:53.150 align:middle line:84%
shows us what the original
Trinity should have been.

00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:54.680 align:middle line:90%
And it makes more sense.

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:58.550 align:middle line:84%
Father, mother, son, that's
how natural law works.

00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:00.730 align:middle line:84%
You don't have father,
another masculine entity

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:01.840 align:middle line:84%
called the Holy
Spirit, and then a son.

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:02.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And then their son.

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: Man, man, man,
that's the Trinity.

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.567 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I always questioned
that when I was a kid.

00:31:06.567 --> 00:31:07.670 align:middle line:90%
I questioned everything.

00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:13.150 align:middle line:84%
So how you, as taking up the
true spirit of the teachings

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:16.060 align:middle line:84%
that you follow in
your generation, how do

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:20.720 align:middle line:84%
you take this forward to say,
can we intelligently create

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:25.680 align:middle line:84%
the way of choice, intelligent,
loving choice, as we awaken?

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:28.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: Yeah, well, that's what
I'm so passionate about, Regina.

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:33.290 align:middle line:84%
I feel that any religion
that is not essentially

00:31:33.290 --> 00:31:37.550 align:middle line:84%
mystical at its core always
becomes a political ideology

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:39.570 align:middle line:90%
or a mindless fundamentalism.

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Mysticism has to be
the core of religion.

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And mysticism is the
inner union with God,

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:48.170 align:middle line:84%
not the outer attempts to
follow practices and rituals

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:49.380 align:middle line:90%
to please God.

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:51.690 align:middle line:84%
It means knowing
God within yourself.

00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
Jesus said to do.

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:56.370 align:middle line:84%
"Love the Lord your God with
all your heart, soul, mind,

00:31:56.370 --> 00:31:57.170 align:middle line:90%
and strength."

00:31:57.170 --> 00:31:59.570 align:middle line:84%
That sounds like a pretty
internal thing to me.

00:31:59.570 --> 00:32:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And love your
neighbor as yourself.

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:02.905 align:middle line:84%
And if you do this,
you've done it all.

00:32:02.905 --> 00:32:05.460 align:middle line:90%
That's true religion from Jesus.

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And so what I think the world
needs, especially Christianity,

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:10.760 align:middle line:84%
but I think the whole
world needs Jesus's Gospel,

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:13.730 align:middle line:84%
is, hey, let's
actually try following

00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:16.040 align:middle line:84%
Jesus's teachings
for once, because you

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:17.370 align:middle line:90%
know what Jesus said?

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:20.593 align:middle line:84%
Christianity will tell you, hey,
if you got sins, no problem,

00:32:20.593 --> 00:32:21.510 align:middle line:90%
we've got your answer.

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:24.052 align:middle line:84%
Confess Jesus is Lord, believe
in his death and resurrection,

00:32:24.052 --> 00:32:25.170 align:middle line:90%
your sins are forgiven.

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:26.970 align:middle line:90%
Uh, not so fast.

00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:28.370 align:middle line:90%
Jesus never said that.

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:30.090 align:middle line:90%
Jesus was very clear.

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:31.620 align:middle line:90%
Judge and you'll be judged.

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:33.300 align:middle line:90%
Condemn and you'll be condemned.

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.545 align:middle line:84%
Forgive and you
will be forgiven.

00:32:35.545 --> 00:32:36.920 align:middle line:84%
For the same
measure you give out

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.390 align:middle line:84%
will be the measure
you get back.

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
just called karma.

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:40.290 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: It's karma.

00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:41.970 align:middle line:84%
It's the law of
giving and receiving.

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:44.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We need to
help America stand up

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:48.620 align:middle line:84%
into the true virtue of being
sovereign souls with goodness

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:50.400 align:middle line:84%
inside us, wanting to
create good things.

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:51.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Yes.

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.033 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's it.

00:32:52.033 --> 00:32:55.190 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: And we do that by
following Jesus's teachings.

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:56.760 align:middle line:10%
He already laid the
blueprint for us.

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:59.990 align:middle line:10%
He said, forgive all
your brothers and sisters

00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:00.990 align:middle line:10%
their trespasses.

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:02.640 align:middle line:84%
If anyone has
anything against you,

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:05.210 align:middle line:84%
or if you have anything
against anyone, forgive them

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:06.420 align:middle line:90%
and you'll be forgiven.

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:08.540 align:middle line:84%
So forgiveness was
the teaching of Jesus.

00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And how can we heal, how can
we come together, how can

00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:14.220 align:middle line:84%
we mend the divide if we
don't practice forgiveness?

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:17.680 align:middle line:84%
I have not ever seen-- in
my entire life in church,

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:20.340 align:middle line:84%
I have never seen a pastor
get up and preach forgiveness

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:23.215 align:middle line:84%
as Jesus's Gospel, or just
say forgiveness is something

00:33:23.215 --> 00:33:24.340 align:middle line:90%
we should all strive to do.

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:25.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Gosh, no.

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:27.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ABKE: All the focus is put on
Paul's theology of confession

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:31.000 align:middle line:84%
and belief, and I call it "easy
believism" and "cheap grace."

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.560 align:middle line:90%
And that's not Jesus's Gospel.

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:33.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:35.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
well, I know you have

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:37.270 align:middle line:90%
a great future ahead of you.

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And I know you already
have a good following.

00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:41.860 align:middle line:84%
But I have a feeling you're
going to have more traction.

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And as we try to find our
spiritual bearings as humanity,

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:49.410 align:middle line:84%
I know you'll be one of the
voices speaking through the lens

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:51.550 align:middle line:90%
of the Christ energy.

00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:53.670 align:middle line:90%
And I applaud you for that.

00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:54.670 align:middle line:90%
>>ABKE: Well, thank you.

00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:56.140 align:middle line:90%
I received that, Regina.

00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:57.040 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:59.620 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I hope you found
this conversation stimulating.

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:00.420 align:middle line:10%
I certainly have.
