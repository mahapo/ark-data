Her job was to bring
water to King Tutankhamun.

And he started sharing
information about his life

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.665 align:middle line:90%
that I had never heard before.

What people don't
really understand

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.480 align:middle line:84%
is they were trying to
preserve the genetic lineage

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.540 align:middle line:84%
because they were
survivors from Atlantis.

>>REGINA: A subject
of perpetual intrigue

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.780 align:middle line:10%
is one of the key dynastic
periods in Egypt, specifically

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.160 align:middle line:10%
the 18th Dynasty.

This is where King Tutankhamun,
Akhenaten, and Nefertiti

appear.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.430 align:middle line:84%
The reason for the
intrigue is that the bodies

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.990 align:middle line:84%
of Nefertiti and Akhenaten
have never been found.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.830 align:middle line:84%

and also literally.

And one of them is this
whole Egyptian thing,

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.790 align:middle line:84%
as has been the case
for anyone who's

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.470 align:middle line:84%

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.760 align:middle line:90%
then another and another.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And the same kind of set of
beings or even the same beings

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.550 align:middle line:84%
start appearing through these

So you started getting clients,
for a variety of reasons, that

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.970 align:middle line:84%
were remembering Egypt,
not knowing that you

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.545 align:middle line:90%
were planning a trip to Egypt.

before I was planning my trip

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.390 align:middle line:10%
to Egypt in May, and
all these clients

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.389 align:middle line:10%
started coming in and having
sessions and remembering

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:13.320 align:middle line:10%
that time period around
King Tutankhamun's lifetime.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And what's so fascinating
about the job that I do

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.530 align:middle line:84%
is I feel like it's
like this radio,

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.490 align:middle line:84%
almost, where different
entities are able to communicate

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.410 align:middle line:84%
through the client to me as
well as the client's higher

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.210 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.365 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:28.365 --> 00:02:31.260 align:middle line:10%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: But one of
the most fascinating sessions

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.210 align:middle line:10%
that I had right
before Egypt was

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.480 align:middle line:10%
this woman who said she had
just gotten back from Egypt,

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.760 align:middle line:10%
and she didn't
understand why, when

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.910 align:middle line:10%
she went to the
Valley of Kings, why

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.210 align:middle line:10%
she felt like she just couldn't
go into the Valley of Kings.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.130 align:middle line:84%
She had this
overwhelming feeling,

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.770 align:middle line:84%
and it was so embarrassing,
she had to sit on the bus.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.380 align:middle line:84%
So it was one of the
reasons why she came to me.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And in her session,
her higher self

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.590 align:middle line:84%
said that she had a past
lifetime during the time where

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.400 align:middle line:84%
some of the kings that were
buried there actually had lived

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.280 align:middle line:84%
and that they recognized
her soul essence.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what a lot
of people don't really realize

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.190 align:middle line:84%
is when you go into
these sacred places

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.730 align:middle line:84%
that the places, the
beings are still there

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.870 align:middle line:84%
and they can recognize
your soul essence.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.200 align:middle line:84%
They can recognize who you
were in a past lifetime.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And this client had
remembered a past lifetime

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.990 align:middle line:90%
as a water bearer.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.830 align:middle line:84%
And her job was to bring
water to King Tutankhamun.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.430 align:middle line:84%
That was all she did during
her lifetime as a man,

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.690 align:middle line:90%
actually, in that lifetime.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And the highlight of
that life was actually

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:40.140 align:middle line:84%
to see King Tutankhamun
for the very first time.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.150 align:middle line:84%
That was the highlight
of that life.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
was when she went

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.890 align:middle line:84%
to the Valley of the
Kings, they recognized her

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.620 align:middle line:90%
as a water bearer.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:49.980 align:middle line:90%
It's just so fascinating.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.740 align:middle line:84%
So then all of a sudden,
what started happening

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.310 align:middle line:84%
is King Tutankhamun started
coming through the radio,

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.860 align:middle line:84%
coming through my client's,
deep under hypnosis,

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.400 align:middle line:84%
sharing fascinating
information about his lifetime.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, this is so
interesting because it didn't

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.090 align:middle line:84%
matter who I was
using as a client,

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.310 align:middle line:84%
he would come through
different people.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And he started sharing
information about his life

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.880 align:middle line:84%
that I had never heard before
because all of this stuff

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.019 align:middle line:90%
is so new to me.

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:19.819 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:21.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're a
veritable virgin when

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.240 align:middle line:90%
it comes to these histories.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.925 align:middle line:84%
You're doing the work that
Dolores Cannon established.

00:04:26.925 --> 00:04:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing
happened with her clients.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.225 align:middle line:90%
And you're a protege of hers.

00:04:30.225 --> 00:04:31.225 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Right.

00:04:31.225 --> 00:04:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so with her in
the day, clients would come--

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.870 align:middle line:84%
the same set of beings would
come through and pick up

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.920 align:middle line:84%
the story where they
had left off before,

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.890 align:middle line:84%
which was sometimes
surprising to a client who

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.660 align:middle line:90%
had come in for weight loss.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.650 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
same thing that's

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.740 align:middle line:90%
happening with you now, right?

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:47.040 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Right.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or now, I mean
now, you've been in the media

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.440 align:middle line:90%
for a while.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.482 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Mm-hmm.

00:04:50.482 --> 00:04:53.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So are the clients
coming because they're

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.670 align:middle line:84%
more intrigued with juicy past
lives they have inklings of,

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.925 align:middle line:84%
or are they still coming for
ordinary reasons as well?

00:04:58.925 --> 00:05:00.425 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME:
Most of my clients

00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:03.480 align:middle line:84%
come to see me because
they have a health issue.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.490 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time,
they want to find out

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.190 align:middle line:84%
what's going on with
them, and they can.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's so easy for a
person, once they can find out

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.300 align:middle line:84%
what's really going on, because
they're focused so deeply,

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.280 align:middle line:84%
and they can really find out
what the purpose of this issue

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.080 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.750 align:middle line:84%
Then it can be released
and healed so easily.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.047 align:middle line:84%
And that's why these
sessions, not just with me

00:05:25.047 --> 00:05:26.380 align:middle line:90%
but with any other practitioner.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, do they
know about your other side,

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.930 align:middle line:84%
the side that the
media knows about where

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.500 align:middle line:84%
these juicy, intriguing
historical stories

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.300 align:middle line:90%
are coming through.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.810 align:middle line:84%
Do most of them
know about that now?

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Most of
them do know about that now.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME:
But they're always

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.860 align:middle line:84%
so surprised and shocked
to have something like King

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.510 align:middle line:90%
Tutankhamun come through them.

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know
that the other person

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:49.335 align:middle line:90%
had this happen to them too.

00:05:49.335 --> 00:05:50.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:56.370 align:middle line:84%
So clearly, King Tut would
like to clarify some things

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.320 align:middle line:84%
and set things straight
for the record.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I want
to say about this--

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.572 align:middle line:84%
I'm super familiar
with regression work

00:06:02.572 --> 00:06:04.530 align:middle line:84%
and used to have a little
hypnotherapy clinic--

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.260 align:middle line:84%
is-- and I did a lot of past
life regression on people like

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.270 align:middle line:84%
you do but different method
but same kind of things would

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.070 align:middle line:90%
happen--

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.140 align:middle line:84%
is that when we're doing this,
the entities that come through

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.940 align:middle line:90%
are one thing.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.898 align:middle line:84%
The people that are coming
through are another.

00:06:16.898 --> 00:06:19.650 align:middle line:84%
So you're getting these
different perspectives

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.890 align:middle line:84%
unique through that
individual, right?

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And that entity is
telling their perspective.

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:26.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Right.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they didn't
know everything in the day.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.025 align:middle line:90%
They knew what they knew.

00:06:29.025 --> 00:06:29.670 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Right.

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:31.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so I'm
just setting the stage.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.870 align:middle line:84%
So when we hear this, because
some of it may seem familiar,

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:34.733 align:middle line:90%
some may not.

00:06:34.733 --> 00:06:36.150 align:middle line:84%
But they only knew
what they knew.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:37.245 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know everything.

00:06:37.245 --> 00:06:38.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Right.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.265 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:38.265 --> 00:06:39.348 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Exactly.

00:06:39.348 --> 00:06:42.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about
why King Tut's coming through,

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.500 align:middle line:90%
what he was sharing.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Right.

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so glad that you
said that because there

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:47.760 align:middle line:90%
is a difference.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.860 align:middle line:84%
If it's the client's
higher self, then

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.670 align:middle line:84%
you're speaking more with, like,
source that knows everything.

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:56.310 align:middle line:84%
But when an entity
comes through, that's--

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.050 align:middle line:84%
what you said was
exactly correct.

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.993 align:middle line:84%
They know what's going
on during their day.

00:06:59.993 --> 00:07:01.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And even
a person that's

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:02.700 align:middle line:84%
bringing through
their own past lives

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.260 align:middle line:84%
are bringing
through, oftentimes,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.510 align:middle line:84%
the memories and
personality of that time

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.130 align:middle line:84%
where they have
limited knowledge too.

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:09.450 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Of course.

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:12.090 align:middle line:84%
So he said one of the
biggest misconceptions

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:15.810 align:middle line:84%
was that he, Akhenaten
was his father.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.220 align:middle line:90%
And he said, that's not true.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.960 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to set
the record straight

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.980 align:middle line:84%
that Akhenaten was actually
his very much older brother,

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.470 align:middle line:90%
but he was raised by Akhenaten.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:29.365 align:middle line:84%
And his actual father
was King Amenhotep III.

00:07:29.365 --> 00:07:30.165 align:middle line:90%
Correct.

00:07:30.165 --> 00:07:31.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Akhenaten's father.

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:31.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.560 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Right.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And his father had married
his daughter, actually.

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:38.160 align:middle line:84%
Because what people don't
really understand is they

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.790 align:middle line:84%
were trying to preserve the
genetic lineage because they

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:44.310 align:middle line:90%
were survivors from Atlantis.

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And they were trying to
preserve this special bloodline,

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:50.730 align:middle line:84%
and that was why
they kept inbreeding.

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And he also said that Nefertiti
was actually his stepmother,

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.700 align:middle line:84%
and that her body
will never be found.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.300 align:middle line:84%
He said that after she
was buried in a tomb,

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:04.390 align:middle line:84%
it was dug up because they
wanted to just remove and get

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:05.190 align:middle line:90%
rid of any record.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:06.565 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet,
she's probably

00:08:06.565 --> 00:08:08.700 align:middle line:84%
the most-- she and Tut
are most iconic figures

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.670 align:middle line:84%
in Egyptian history
that come through today.

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:15.420 align:middle line:84%
Because what needs to happen
is the knowledge of what

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:17.340 align:middle line:84%
was really going on
rather than how they

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:18.667 align:middle line:90%
tried to rewrite the history.

00:08:18.667 --> 00:08:20.250 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME:
What was interesting

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:23.040 align:middle line:84%
because King
Tutankhamen kept saying

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:27.400 align:middle line:84%
that his brother Akhenaten was
visited by extraterrestrials.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And they had shared
with him that there was

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:32.070 align:middle line:90%
only one source, only one god.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And Akhenaten went about
trying to change this,

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:38.830 align:middle line:84%
because Akhenaten still
had a lot of that bloodline

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:39.630 align:middle line:90%
within him.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:41.800 align:middle line:84%
He could really
read certain things.

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:42.600 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They were Adepts.

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:48.090 align:middle line:84%
His father, Amenhotep III, who
Tut said is his real father,

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:50.520 align:middle line:84%
was an Adept, and that
was passed on to his son.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.560 align:middle line:90%
His real name was Amenhotep IV.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And he became Akhenaten
because his dedication

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.203 align:middle line:90%
was to this one-source son.

00:08:59.203 --> 00:09:00.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Wow.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:00.360 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.568 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's right.

00:09:01.568 --> 00:09:04.390 align:middle line:84%
So continue with what he
says about his own body.

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:06.133 align:middle line:84%
So he says Nefertiti
was a traitor

00:09:06.133 --> 00:09:07.800 align:middle line:84%
because she went
against the priesthood,

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.390 align:middle line:84%
and she was never
going to be found.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:10.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME:
She was never going--

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:10.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And she's
never been found.

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: But he said
she loved Akhenaten very much,

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:16.380 align:middle line:84%
and she wanted to continue
what he had started.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And he said, she didn't really
like him that much, though.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.640 align:middle line:84%
She was-- but it was
the way that she tried

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.080 align:middle line:90%
to be as a leader, though.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.230 align:middle line:84%
She felt like she should be
feared a little bit in order

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:33.370 align:middle line:84%
to rule during that time
or in order to have power,

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:34.390 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:36.390 align:middle line:84%
But it was really
interesting just

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:38.460 align:middle line:90%
learning about his lifetime.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And he said he was easily
manipulated, though,

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.570 align:middle line:90%
because he was young.

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And there was such an
effort to bring things

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.375 align:middle line:84%
back to the way Egypt
was before Akhenaten.

00:09:48.375 --> 00:09:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that was really
difficult. So many enemies

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.750 align:middle line:84%
had been made by
Akhenaten and Nefertiti.

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:56.940 align:middle line:90%
The priesthood despised them.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Because people
just didn't really understand

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:01.980 align:middle line:90%
how not to fear death.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.290 align:middle line:84%
And he said they were
just so concerned,

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:07.350 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't know
any better, really.

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:08.730 align:middle line:90%
But that was why.

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:10.475 align:middle line:84%
That was why they
did what they did.

00:10:10.475 --> 00:10:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so as he went
on, he explained his own needs

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:19.350 align:middle line:84%
and frustrations because he
was a kind of a weak child,

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:22.470 align:middle line:84%
which they say a lot of
inbreeding is not ideal

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:24.810 align:middle line:90%
for the strength of a being--

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:25.920 align:middle line:90%
the physical lineage.

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.040 align:middle line:84%
So he was not known to be
a physically strong person.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And he was try-- and from a
very young age, he and his mate

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.220 align:middle line:84%
were trying to have
children, and it

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:36.360 align:middle line:90%
wasn't working out, right?

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Well, he
said he married his sister,

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:41.130 align:middle line:90%
and none of the babies survived.

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And it was really
hard on her, actually,

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.760 align:middle line:84%
and she became very
depressed because of it.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:49.410 align:middle line:84%
But he decided to kind of
think about other things

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:53.280 align:middle line:84%
by going into
battle and hunting.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Because he even though he
was a sort of weak child,

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.780 align:middle line:84%
he wanted to do what
everybody else was doing.

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:03.890 align:middle line:84%
But he did have different issues
because of all the inbreeding.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:05.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm curious.

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.680 align:middle line:84%
Through any of
these sessions, did

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.440 align:middle line:84%
they ever talk about the
unique features of the family

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.885 align:middle line:90%
and the elongated skulls.

00:11:10.885 --> 00:11:12.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: They did.

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:13.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about that for a moment.

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:15.757 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: So they
did say that they actually

00:11:15.757 --> 00:11:19.490 align:middle line:84%
did physically look different
with their elongated skulls,

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:22.640 align:middle line:84%
especially Akhenaten had
a very elongated skull,

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.180 align:middle line:84%
and he had a very
pronounced jaw, apparently.

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:28.040 align:middle line:90%
And because of this, he had--

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:31.880 align:middle line:84%
it was almost like he had
access to different information.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And so they knew that
these people that

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:39.290 align:middle line:84%
had this different physicality
actually had this access,

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:41.610 align:middle line:90%
and it was so sought after.

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:43.880 align:middle line:84%
But over the years, what's
really interesting, he

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:47.120 align:middle line:84%
was saying, that even
in our time, well,

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:54.500 align:middle line:84%
it went from back in ancient
Egypt to the witches.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:58.650 align:middle line:84%
They had the same kind
of symbolic pointy hats

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:01.950 align:middle line:84%
then because they wanted
to get rid of all of this.

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:04.290 align:middle line:84%
It eventually went
into the hat that

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:07.530 align:middle line:84%
was labeled the dunce
hat, just to make

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:10.507 align:middle line:84%
everyone think of elongated
skulls and these time periods.

00:12:10.507 --> 00:12:11.715 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's interesting.

00:12:11.715 --> 00:12:13.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Yeah, I
thought it was interesting.

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:15.273 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
some believe that,

00:12:15.273 --> 00:12:18.060 align:middle line:84%
of course, that these were
hybrid beings because many

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:19.935 align:middle line:84%
of the beings on Atlantis
were hybrid beings.

00:12:19.935 --> 00:12:21.102 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: They were.

00:12:21.102 --> 00:12:22.810 align:middle line:90%
He said they were hybrid beings.

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:24.900 align:middle line:84%
They were beings
that-- humans that

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.120 align:middle line:84%
were seeded from
extraterrestrials,

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.430 align:middle line:84%
that had been genetically
modified, I mean.

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:32.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're all
basically modified.

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:33.645 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But
we're all modified.

00:12:33.645 --> 00:12:35.562 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME:
Especially right now, right?

00:12:35.562 --> 00:12:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're all hybrids
of one kind or another.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:41.100 align:middle line:84%
So when he finally died,
some of the information

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.650 align:middle line:84%
that came through is he
was not happy with what

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:44.550 align:middle line:90%
happened to his body.

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:45.967 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME:
Well, he said he

00:12:45.967 --> 00:12:48.810 align:middle line:84%
died when he was away
from home, and he didn't

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:50.040 align:middle line:90%
like the way he was treated.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.980 align:middle line:84%
He said he felt like he wasn't
treated like a pharaoh should

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.800 align:middle line:84%
have been treated,
because according to him,

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:59.220 align:middle line:84%
he said his arms weren't crossed
over his chest right away.

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And they moved him into three
different coffins or three

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:06.360 align:middle line:84%
different places, and he just
didn't like the treatment.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.780 align:middle line:84%
He said he just felt like
disrespected during his life

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.310 align:middle line:90%
and disrespected after.

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:14.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it was
unfortunate that he came out,

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:17.040 align:middle line:84%
and it was his
job to make amends

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:21.855 align:middle line:84%
with the people who had been
offended by his predecessors.

00:13:21.855 --> 00:13:22.950 align:middle line:90%
That was a tough one.

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:25.117 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: But one
of the biggest reasons why

00:13:25.117 --> 00:13:28.710 align:middle line:84%
he came through, I think,
before I went to Egypt, was he

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:31.810 align:middle line:84%
wanted to share certain
information about Egypt.

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:35.190 align:middle line:84%
So he started telling
me about the temples,

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:38.640 align:middle line:90%
and it was so fascinating to me.

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:43.830 align:middle line:84%
He said temples were built
just as like a failsafe in case

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:48.210 align:middle line:84%
the civilizations
coming next would

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:50.010 align:middle line:90%
forget certain information.

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:52.080 align:middle line:84%
Because information
would be kept

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.630 align:middle line:84%
hidden within
temples, and anyone

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:57.840 align:middle line:84%
could access it because
temples are portals.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And you can go into a
temple and be downloaded

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:04.140 align:middle line:84%
with this information if
you can quiet your mind

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.910 align:middle line:90%
and ask for this access.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:08.730 align:middle line:84%
He also said that, and I thought
this is really interesting,

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:11.010 align:middle line:84%
that temples have
a consciousness,

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:15.120 align:middle line:84%
and that they're kind of,
like, they call people

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.800 align:middle line:84%
to them when they want to
download information to them.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:21.690 align:middle line:84%
So it's not as if you go
to a temple for no reason.

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:24.180 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, you go
into these sacred temples

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.220 align:middle line:84%
because the temple
is calling you.

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And another thing I
thought was so interesting

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:32.970 align:middle line:84%
is that he said there are cats
always at these sacred temples,

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.910 align:middle line:84%
and that's because the
temples call the cats.

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And while I was working
with other clients,

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:40.980 align:middle line:84%
I learned from other
clients that cats actually

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.750 align:middle line:90%
can manipulate energy.

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:44.340 align:middle line:90%
They're energy manipulators.

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:47.670 align:middle line:84%
So they can manipulate the
energy of a house or a building

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:51.610 align:middle line:84%
or a place, someplace like that,
and they're masters at that.

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the reasons
why temples call these cats.

00:14:55.710 --> 00:15:00.450 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there's also a lot
of symbology with ancient Egypt

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:03.870 align:middle line:84%
and cats and even the
cat people of Atlantis.

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:06.450 align:middle line:84%
But he also said
that if you wanted

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:11.190 align:middle line:84%
to access this information, that
the way that people would do it

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:13.080 align:middle line:84%
is before entering
a temple, they

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.030 align:middle line:90%
would ask for permission first.

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And then once they were in,
they would quiet their mind.

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:21.090 align:middle line:84%
Because all this
information is--

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:22.650 align:middle line:90%
it goes through the mind.

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:24.870 align:middle line:84%
That's how you access
this information.

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's by clearing your mind,
asking for the information,

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:32.190 align:middle line:84%
and trusting what comes
up that you can actually

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:34.230 align:middle line:90%
access this information.

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:36.510 align:middle line:84%
You can also, if you're
in these temples,

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:40.020 align:middle line:84%
communicate with your
home planet of origin.

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:42.570 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
these extraterrestrial

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:46.920 align:middle line:84%
claim to have built some
of these temples and even

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:48.450 align:middle line:90%
some of the pyramids.

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:50.552 align:middle line:84%
Although, Toth, who has
been coming through--

00:15:50.552 --> 00:15:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, we're going to
have fun with him in a minute.

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:53.810 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:57.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: --claimed to
have built the Great Pyramid.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.690 align:middle line:90%
And this other really--

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:01.100 align:middle line:90%
it's so fascinating.

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:04.055 align:middle line:84%
So Toth has been coming
through recently.

00:16:04.055 --> 00:16:05.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A number of people or?

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:06.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME:
A number of people.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.880 align:middle line:90%
Oh, gosh, a number of people.

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's
talk about what he's

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:10.860 align:middle line:90%
saying, what he's telling us.

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: So first,
I told you a while ago

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:16.430 align:middle line:84%
that people kept seeing
this being named 3

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:18.170 align:middle line:84%
and didn't know
who this being was.

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:19.298 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, thrice.

00:16:19.298 --> 00:16:20.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME:
And especially when

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.540 align:middle line:84%
I was working with
any Egypt material,

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:27.920 align:middle line:84%
it's like he had to come in
and share his information even

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.740 align:middle line:84%
though none of my clients
knew who this being was.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.050 align:middle line:84%
But recently, he's
been talking a lot,

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:36.230 align:middle line:84%
coming through different people
who don't know one another.

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And he claimed he built
the Great Pyramid.

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:41.330 align:middle line:84%
But what's really
fascinating to me

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:45.410 align:middle line:84%
is he said there's another
sphinx that has his image.

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And the most important sphinx
that people don't know about

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:52.790 align:middle line:84%
is in North America
at the Four Corners.

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And there's an actual
sphinx-like cover.

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:57.240 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't know
that it's there.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:00.930 align:middle line:84%
No one will tell me where
exactly it's located.

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:03.960 align:middle line:84%
But that has a ship
located under it.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:08.069 align:middle line:84%
And it has all different kinds
of artifacts like in somewhere

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:09.600 align:middle line:90%
in the Four Corners area.

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.849 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, can
I read you something,

00:17:11.849 --> 00:17:14.920 align:middle line:84%
because you and I talked
a little bit about this,

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:20.849 align:middle line:84%
about what's under the Sphinx
because some of your clients

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:22.319 align:middle line:84%
have started
talking about what's

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:24.060 align:middle line:90%
under the Sphinx in Egypt.

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think everybody
is aware now,

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:28.900 align:middle line:90%
something's underneath there.

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:31.840 align:middle line:84%
So I just after we
talked, I thought,

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.945 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to text Billy
Carson, Toth, by the way,

00:17:34.945 --> 00:17:36.570 align:middle line:84%
which I wasn't thinking
of at the time.

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:39.190 align:middle line:84%
But I'll just see
what's in there.

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:41.500 align:middle line:84%
We'll see what he thinks
is going on there.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And he texted back, and
this is what he sent.

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:46.980 align:middle line:84%
This is from the
Emerald Tablets.

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:48.465 align:middle line:90%
I'll just read it.

00:17:48.465 --> 00:17:52.530 align:middle line:84%
"Then gathered I, the sons of
Atlantis, into the spaceship.

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:54.720 align:middle line:84%
I brought all of
my records, brought

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.450 align:middle line:84%
the records of sunken
Atlantis, gathered

00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:01.920 align:middle line:84%
I all of my powers, instruments,
and many mighty magic

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:02.910 align:middle line:90%
technologies."

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:04.200 align:middle line:90%
Technologies there.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.960 align:middle line:84%
"Deep beneath the rocks,
I buried my spaceship,

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.945 align:middle line:84%
waiting the time when
man might be free.

00:18:09.945 --> 00:18:13.890 align:middle line:84%
Over the spaceship, erected a
marker in the form of a lion--"

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:16.680 align:middle line:90%
Sphinx, "--yet like unto man.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:20.610 align:middle line:84%
There 'neath the image
rests my spaceship, forth

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:23.565 align:middle line:84%
to be brought when
need shall arise.

00:18:23.565 --> 00:18:25.740 align:middle line:84%
Know ye, oh, man, that
far in the future,

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:29.830 align:middle line:84%
invaders shall come from
out of the deep space.

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:32.715 align:middle line:90%
Then awake ye who have wisdom.

00:18:32.715 --> 00:18:35.620 align:middle line:84%
Bring forth my ship
and conquer with ease."

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:37.770 align:middle line:84%
So something about
the technology.

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:40.320 align:middle line:84%
"Deep beneath the
image lies my secret.

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.440 align:middle line:84%
Search and find in
the pyramid I built."

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:46.153 align:middle line:84%
He wrote this in the Emerald
Tablets 3,600 years ago.

00:18:46.153 --> 00:18:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Yes, that's
the Sphinx in North America.

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:49.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: North America?

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:50.632 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Mm-hmm.

00:18:50.632 --> 00:18:52.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK,
interesting, and so not

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:56.260 align:middle line:84%
the Sphinx that they're
looking to find underneath.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're not looking
for this underneath.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:18:59.650 align:middle line:84%
They're looking for
it, but they don't know

00:18:59.650 --> 00:18:59.880 align:middle line:90%
what they're going to find.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.838 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: That
just gave me the chills.

00:19:01.838 --> 00:19:03.810 align:middle line:84%
But what you just read
makes so much sense,

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:06.960 align:middle line:84%
because they're waiting
for humanity to be free,

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.800 align:middle line:84%
which this is-- we're about
to go into the Golden Age,

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:14.430 align:middle line:84%
where humanity overthrows
the oppressors, basically,

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:17.550 align:middle line:84%
just like the last
Golden Age of Atlantis.

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's happening, you
know, slowly but surely where

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:24.145 align:middle line:90%
we become free once again.

00:19:24.145 --> 00:19:24.945 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:24.945 --> 00:19:27.330 align:middle line:10%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: And
when we're able to evolve

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:30.510 align:middle line:10%
our consciousness to that
point, then we can have access,

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:32.100 align:middle line:10%
but they will not allow us.

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:35.850 align:middle line:84%
Like, there's no way anybody
can access that Sphinx

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:38.640 align:middle line:84%
or go down there and tamper
with that information

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:43.110 align:middle line:84%
until the time is ready,
until humanity is really free.

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't want it
to get into the wrong hands,

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:47.190 align:middle line:90%
so it's hidden in plain sight.

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:50.490 align:middle line:84%
When my clients look
deep under the Sphinx,

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:53.500 align:middle line:84%
they've seen that there
was this technology.

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And there was this
looking glass almost

00:19:56.340 --> 00:20:00.510 align:middle line:84%
like it looks like a
black kind of like stone.

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting,
because it's similar to--

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:06.360 align:middle line:84%
it must be extraterrestrial
technology.

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:09.210 align:middle line:84%
But this looking glass,
you can look into it

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:11.970 align:middle line:84%
and see the history,
all of our history.

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:15.420 align:middle line:84%
And you can see many different
things in this looking glass.

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, people are
trying to recreate the looking

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:19.530 align:middle line:90%
glass, but you can't.

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:22.110 align:middle line:84%
You can't recreate this
type of looking glass.

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:24.000 align:middle line:84%
But what's really
fascinating, when

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.490 align:middle line:84%
you can read what's
in the looking glass,

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:29.370 align:middle line:84%
are the history of the
battles because that's

00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:31.470 align:middle line:90%
what's in this technology.

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And it shows the
history of the battles

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.550 align:middle line:90%
between light versus dark.

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:38.070 align:middle line:84%
But the history, if you
really look into it,

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:40.350 align:middle line:90%
is that the light always wins.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:42.180 align:middle line:90%
Thus, it's really just a secret.

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:46.140 align:middle line:84%
But no matter what anybody
takes from the Sphinx of Egypt,

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:49.305 align:middle line:84%
they can't destroy the light
codes that are still there.

00:20:49.305 --> 00:20:52.980 align:middle line:84%
Anybody that goes to Egypt,
can access these light codes

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:55.260 align:middle line:84%
that emanate about
a foot and a half

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:58.200 align:middle line:84%
off the ground of any
of these sacred places.

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And they come through,
also, the hieroglyphs.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And if you use your own
mind, and you tap into it,

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:08.190 align:middle line:84%
and I don't want to get
in trouble for saying this

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:12.510 align:middle line:84%
if, you could place your
hands on these sacred places,

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:15.030 align:middle line:84%
then you can read
this information,

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:17.110 align:middle line:90%
and it comes through your mind.

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:20.520 align:middle line:84%
So no matter what anybody does,
take any of this information

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:25.350 align:middle line:84%
or take some of the stuff
that was under the Sphinx,

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:27.660 align:middle line:84%
they can't get rid
of these light codes.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, and it
was left for us now--

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:30.952 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME:
It was left for us.

00:21:30.952 --> 00:21:33.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and into our near
future as we're awakening,

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.218 align:middle line:84%
becoming curious, and
able to start decoding.

00:21:35.218 --> 00:21:36.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: How exciting.

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:37.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: But it's
through each person's mind

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:40.700 align:middle line:90%
that you get this information.

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.240 align:middle line:84%
So people are
thinking that it will

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.240 align:middle line:84%
come outside of themselves,
but it's not the case

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:47.590 align:middle line:90%
with anything in Egypt.

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:51.000 align:middle line:84%
It's all learning how to
connect to this information

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.260 align:middle line:90%
through your mind.

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the reasons why

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:57.640 align:middle line:84%
they used to drink these
teas like the Blue Lotus tea

00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:01.630 align:middle line:84%
or take that monatomic
gold powder, which

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:04.930 align:middle line:84%
a lot of my clients have
seen underneath the Sphinx.

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:07.930 align:middle line:84%
It used to be in
this, like, gold urn.

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:09.430 align:middle line:90%
There was this white powder.

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And we-- my client and I didn't
know what it was exactly.

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And they said it was
this monatomic gold

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.560 align:middle line:90%
that they would use.

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:22.600 align:middle line:84%
It's all like that in
these sacred places.

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.430 align:middle line:84%
It's accessing it
through yourself,

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:26.485 align:middle line:90%
which is so fascinating.

00:22:26.485 --> 00:22:28.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The whole
notion that it's

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:32.170 align:middle line:84%
our mind that needs to
brighten awaken and begin

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:33.850 align:middle line:90%
moving into this information.

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:35.356 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Right.

00:22:35.356 --> 00:22:38.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have one
more tiny anecdote.

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.600 align:middle line:84%
I have been exposed
to information

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.090 align:middle line:84%
about a piece in the
British Museum that

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:47.410 align:middle line:84%
was to be one of the remnants
of the statues on Easter Island.

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:50.230 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
prominent ones that's there.

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And in this paper
I read it said,

00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:56.710 align:middle line:84%
if you can, by
chance, touch it, it

00:22:56.710 --> 00:23:00.285 align:middle line:84%
will download to you
the history of the time.

00:23:00.285 --> 00:23:03.910 align:middle line:84%
So I was there kind of
you know, sneaking around.

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:05.950 align:middle line:84%
Waited till the guard
turned his back,

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:09.250 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't take long
when you get a download.

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:10.690 align:middle line:90%
I put my hand on the stone.

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:12.370 align:middle line:90%
It said do not touch, of course.

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:13.750 align:middle line:90%
So I touched this stone.

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Boom, all this
information blasted in.

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:18.370 align:middle line:90%
The guard started yelling at me.

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:21.440 align:middle line:84%
But I'm saying, I will
attest to the fact,

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:23.800 align:middle line:84%
if you can touch
these, it's true.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing, touching
some of the Egyptian plates,

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.760 align:middle line:84%
hieroglyphics, and
pictographs if we can just

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:32.140 align:middle line:90%
get in the position to do it.

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:32.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Right.

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:33.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But you know what?

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:35.470 align:middle line:84%
You can put-- you can
project your mind into it

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:38.360 align:middle line:84%
in the museum, project
yourself into it,

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.960 align:middle line:84%
and it will also allow you
to receive the information.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:41.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Oh, of course.

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:42.820 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to touch it.

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:44.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You don't have
to physically touch it.

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:44.560 align:middle line:90%
It was fun.

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Our DNA
is reawakening, though.

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, just
going and stepping

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:54.565 align:middle line:84%
on into these ancient places can
just start activating your DNA.

00:23:54.565 --> 00:23:55.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.898 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: In so many
people, so many of my clients,

00:23:57.898 --> 00:23:59.540 align:middle line:84%
their higher selves
have been saying,

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:02.240 align:middle line:84%
oh, it's time their DNA
is starting to wake up.

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:06.830 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, these people
have, within their DNA,

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:08.390 align:middle line:90%
certain information.

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:12.170 align:middle line:84%
That once it's activated, this
information starts coming out.

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:13.550 align:middle line:90%
And just like--

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is going
to be so wonderful--

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.180 align:middle line:90%
this explosion of information.

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And here, you're right
at the epicenter of it.

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And the only reason I
brought that other one up,

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:24.320 align:middle line:84%
Easter Island, is because
that's a remnant of Lemuria.

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.870 align:middle line:84%
And so that information
is-- and you

00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:30.680 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of work with Jen
Sullivan and others on Lemuria.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.330 align:middle line:90%
So just to put this in there.

00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:37.010 align:middle line:84%
So of the people I
interview, the creator

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:43.880 align:middle line:84%
of Human Design, Ra, Richard
Rudd and the Gene Keys, also,

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Lee Harris' channelings
from the Z's,

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:51.110 align:middle line:90%
they're all saying 2025 to 2027.

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:53.390 align:middle line:84%
They're all within
a year of this time

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:57.860 align:middle line:84%
is when the new human really
starts arriving and waking up.

00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:59.530 align:middle line:90%
We become a new species.

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:00.780 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Yeah, we do.

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:01.581 align:middle line:90%
We become a--

00:25:01.581 --> 00:25:02.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So have you heard?

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:05.525 align:middle line:84%
Tell me what you've heard along
that line through these people.

00:25:05.525 --> 00:25:07.192 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME:
I've just been hearing

00:25:07.192 --> 00:25:10.640 align:middle line:84%
that each person is different,
though, that their DNA starts

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:13.740 align:middle line:84%
waking up or being activated
when they're ready.

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:15.480 align:middle line:90%
But that would make total sense.

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.630 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's happening now.

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:18.860 align:middle line:90%
It's starting to happen.

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:21.530 align:middle line:90%
And even nature is waking up.

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:23.450 align:middle line:90%
Like these ancient trees.

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:27.560 align:middle line:84%
Going into what I've
been working on recently

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:31.190 align:middle line:84%
has a lot to do with
this, is, and it

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:34.280 align:middle line:84%
has a connection to Egypt
and everything else,

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:38.940 align:middle line:84%
was this woman,
actually, contacted me.

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:40.820 align:middle line:84%
So this is my most
recent subject.

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:44.660 align:middle line:84%
This is like hot off the press,
like recent, most recent.

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:48.560 align:middle line:84%
She contacted me
because she had--

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:52.580 align:middle line:84%
she worked at a corporation,
just a regular person,

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:56.180 align:middle line:84%
not into any metaphysical
things whatsoever.

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:59.360 align:middle line:84%
But for some reason,
on her computer

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:02.870 align:middle line:84%
popped up a little video
of you and I talking,

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:06.350 align:middle line:84%
and she didn't understand why
somebody from her corporation

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:08.960 align:middle line:84%
was on this video,
thinking that she knew me.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:13.280 align:middle line:84%
She thought she knew me and that
I worked with her, basically.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:17.120 align:middle line:84%
So she looked at this and looked
at this little short clip.

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And she thought, what
are they talking about?

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:22.160 align:middle line:84%
Because she thought she
had a part to play in this

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.940 align:middle line:90%
and was just very confused.

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And she realized we were
talking about Atlantis.

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And then she realized
this had nothing

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:31.490 align:middle line:84%
to do with her
corporation, whatsoever.

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:34.033 align:middle line:84%
I'm just trying not to give
her identity away, that's all.

00:26:34.033 --> 00:26:35.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
doing a good job.

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:37.100 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea who
you're speaking of.

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:38.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Well, good.

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:39.620 align:middle line:90%
But her name is Christy.

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:41.000 align:middle line:90%
That's all I can say about her.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.990 align:middle line:84%
So this woman named Christy
watched this little short clip

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:47.150 align:middle line:84%
and just was so
fascinated because she

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:49.670 align:middle line:84%
heard us talking
about this woman named

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:51.155 align:middle line:90%
Christy, who my client--

00:26:51.155 --> 00:26:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --you and I talked
about in our last interview.

00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:54.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Right.

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And coming through
my client Jen.

00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:00.580 align:middle line:84%
Christy, this woman named
Christy, was her past life.

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I talked about how
Jen had this brain condition.

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:08.080 align:middle line:84%
So this woman Christy, who
was watching this short clip,

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.760 align:middle line:84%
was just so fascinated
because it's

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:13.480 align:middle line:84%
same brain condition she has,
and not very many people have

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:14.980 align:middle line:90%
pseudotumor cerebri.

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:17.290 align:middle line:84%
So she thought
that's interesting.

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:20.360 align:middle line:84%
Her name is Christy, and she
has the same brain condition.

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.172 align:middle line:84%
So she downloaded
the Gaia interview.

00:27:22.172 --> 00:27:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think that
was our first interview.

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:25.000 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: It was.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:25.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK.

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:27.322 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME:
And she watched it,

00:27:27.322 --> 00:27:29.200 align:middle line:84%
and then she just
couldn't even believe it,

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.920 align:middle line:84%
because we were talking
about things about Atlantis

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.690 align:middle line:90%
that she had had dreams about.

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And she thought these were
just strange, you know, dreams.

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:40.840 align:middle line:84%
She never put two and two
together, like maybe she--

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.710 align:middle line:90%
maybe this was an actual place.

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:45.220 align:middle line:84%
She didn't really
know that or believe

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:47.120 align:middle line:90%
that Atlantis was a real place.

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:49.630 align:middle line:84%
So after listening
to this interview,

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:53.160 align:middle line:84%
she thought, oh, my gosh, I need
to contact this person Sarah

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:55.620 align:middle line:84%
and have a session
because I just can't even

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:57.270 align:middle line:90%
believe these coincidences.

00:27:57.270 --> 00:27:58.440 align:middle line:90%
My name is Christy.

00:27:58.440 --> 00:27:59.850 align:middle line:90%
I have the same brain condition.

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And I remember things,
you know, everything

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:03.090 align:middle line:90%
they were talking about.

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:05.760 align:middle line:84%
So she saw I didn't have
a session available,

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.680 align:middle line:90%
but I had a workshop coming up.

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.300 align:middle line:90%
And she thought, I don't know.

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:10.580 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I'll do this workshop.

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:11.380 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:12.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure about it.

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:14.430 align:middle line:90%
So she decided to go garden.

00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And she was digging
around pulling out weeds,

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:18.870 align:middle line:84%
and she found some
money in her garden.

00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:19.800 align:middle line:90%
This is true.

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.210 align:middle line:90%
It sounds so crazy.

00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:23.625 align:middle line:84%
And it was the exact
price of my workshop.

00:28:23.625 --> 00:28:24.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're kidding.

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: No.

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:26.280 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.260 align:middle line:90%
So then she books the workshop.

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:30.240 align:middle line:84%
But right before she
comes to the workshop,

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:33.280 align:middle line:84%
she's not feeling very well
because of her brain condition.

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:35.610 align:middle line:84%
So she asked me,
hey, can you fit me

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:38.550 align:middle line:84%
in the day before the workshop
because I'm not feeling--

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:39.870 align:middle line:90%
not doing very well.

00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm sorry,
I'm all booked up.

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And then right after I told
her that, my client canceled.

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:49.392 align:middle line:84%
So I said, yeah,
you can come then.

00:28:49.392 --> 00:28:51.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Truth is
stranger than fiction.

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:51.730 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:53.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: So she
comes in for a session.

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:55.675 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
this you know,

00:28:55.675 --> 00:28:58.660 align:middle line:84%
she's remembering this
lifetime in the 1300s,

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:00.700 align:middle line:84%
and this personality
is coming through.

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Because like I said,
I feel like what

00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:05.350 align:middle line:84%
I do is almost
like a radio, where

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:08.410 align:middle line:84%
these beings or
these personalities

00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:10.960 align:middle line:84%
from hundreds of
years ago come through

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.830 align:middle line:90%
to share an important message.

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:15.520 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, this
personality came through

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:18.640 align:middle line:84%
and said her name is Alice,
and she lived in the 1300s.

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And she starts describing
her life in so much detail

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:24.850 align:middle line:84%
and even down to what
the tapestry looked like,

00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:27.490 align:middle line:84%
her coat of arms,
which were dragons,

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:29.950 align:middle line:84%
because there were
actually dragons

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:33.500 align:middle line:84%
during this certain time, but
they were more like horses.

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:36.490 align:middle line:84%
They were like the same
size of horses back,

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:39.220 align:middle line:84%
we're talking like hundreds
and hundreds of years

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:41.440 align:middle line:90%
before her, before Alice lived.

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And she was describing her life,
and she lived in this castle.

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:48.290 align:middle line:90%
And she had to get married.

00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:49.810 align:middle line:84%
It was an arranged
marriage, but she

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:52.180 align:middle line:84%
got married at
such an early age,

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:54.580 align:middle line:90%
and I guess she was about 12.

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And she was married
off and married

00:29:57.010 --> 00:30:01.030 align:middle line:90%
the nephew of King Edward I.

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:03.820 align:middle line:84%
So then after her life--
she was murdered--

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:05.800 align:middle line:84%
I asked her higher
self, why did you

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:10.600 align:middle line:84%
show her this lifetime
of all lifetimes,

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.910 align:middle line:84%
and what is important
to understand about it?

00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And the higher self started
saying that this information is

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:20.770 align:middle line:84%
so important for humanity
to understand because it

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:22.810 align:middle line:90%
has a connection to Avalon.

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And the information about
Avalon and the magic of Avalon

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:30.190 align:middle line:84%
needs to be brought
back to humanity now.

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:32.290 align:middle line:84%
Because we're tapping
back into that,

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:34.780 align:middle line:84%
and we're starting
to become aware

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:38.650 align:middle line:84%
that what we thought
our reality was made of

00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:42.610 align:middle line:84%
isn't really what reality
is and that humans

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:45.580 align:middle line:84%
are going to start tapping
into these ancient ways

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:47.560 align:middle line:90%
and they need to understand how.

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:52.340 align:middle line:84%
So that is why this person
Alice started coming through.

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:53.140 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so that
was a thread in her day.

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:55.690 align:middle line:90%
She had this?

00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:56.755 align:middle line:90%
She possessed this knowledge?

00:30:56.755 --> 00:30:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: She
possessed that knowledge.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.650 align:middle line:90%
She had that in her bloodline.

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:01.630 align:middle line:84%
Her mother was
Welsh, and she was--

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:03.518 align:middle line:84%
her mother was
more of a direct--

00:31:03.518 --> 00:31:04.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --a Druidic line too.

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:05.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Yes.

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:06.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:08.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME:
And so I started

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:09.940 align:middle line:90%
to work again with Christy.

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And her higher self
kept saying, you know,

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:16.070 align:middle line:84%
you need to uncover
this information.

00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And so it was coming
through with the personality

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:20.380 align:middle line:90%
that called herself Alice.

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:23.170 align:middle line:84%
So I felt like,
well, Alice, if she

00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:27.580 align:middle line:84%
was part of this noble family,
it must be a real person.

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:28.420 align:middle line:90%
It must be.

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:28.960 align:middle line:90%
Let me see--

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:29.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You'll find a record.

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:31.897 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: --maybe
I can find a record.

00:31:31.897 --> 00:31:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough,
I found a record.

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:38.830 align:middle line:84%
Her name, the person I've been
talking to, is Alice de Lacy.

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:41.290 align:middle line:90%
She was a Countess in Lincoln.

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And she actually was
living in the 1300s.

00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:46.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
information for her history

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:47.655 align:middle line:90%
lined up with the clients?

00:31:47.655 --> 00:31:49.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME:
All matched up.

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:49.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:51.895 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: One thing
didn't line up, though.

00:31:51.895 --> 00:31:55.180 align:middle line:90%
Alice told me she was murdered.

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:58.960 align:middle line:84%
She was stabbed, and
that's not in her history.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:01.720 align:middle line:84%
Alice also told me that
she had a daughter.

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:03.805 align:middle line:90%
That's not in her history.

00:32:03.805 --> 00:32:07.510 align:middle line:84%
But what's been hidden is
all the sacred information

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:08.530 align:middle line:90%
about Avalon.

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:10.990 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I'm
working on right now,

00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:14.050 align:middle line:84%
and no one really
knows this except you.

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:16.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you for
sharing that with us.

00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:18.560 align:middle line:84%
It's triggering a
couple of things here.

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:20.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of
all, if they wanted

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:24.290 align:middle line:84%
to erase that aspect of her as
a female lineage of knowledge,

00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:27.370 align:middle line:84%
her daughter may have possessed
some of that same information

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:28.610 align:middle line:90%
or knowledge too.

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:31.600 align:middle line:84%
So that could be why her
daughter wasn't recorded.

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:32.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm just looking.

00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:37.600 align:middle line:84%
But also in the 1300s is when
there were some great mystics

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:41.710 align:middle line:84%
that showed up and historically
are known such as Paracelsus,

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:44.740 align:middle line:84%
who was a great, great healer,
alchemist, and understood

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:46.160 align:middle line:90%
the nature of reality and life.

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:49.090 align:middle line:84%
He's one of the great
minds that ever incarnated.

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:50.580 align:middle line:90%
He actually exists now.

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:53.340 align:middle line:84%
He's reincarnated now, not
going to blow his cover.

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:55.980 align:middle line:84%
But that's at the
same time she was

00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:59.130 align:middle line:84%
being downloaded
with this information

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:01.210 align:middle line:90%
about the nature of reality.

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:04.060 align:middle line:84%
So there was an opening
there that must have then led

00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:04.860 align:middle line:90%
to the Renaissance.

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, everything
was killed and scientific

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:08.310 align:middle line:90%
materialism.

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:09.930 align:middle line:84%
Here we're back
talking about it now

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:11.778 align:middle line:84%
some centuries, some
centuries later.

00:33:11.778 --> 00:33:13.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Oh,
it's all coming back.

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:15.195 align:middle line:84%
People have these
memories, and they're

00:33:15.195 --> 00:33:17.160 align:middle line:84%
waking up and starting
to remember it,

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:20.650 align:middle line:84%
and they don't really know what
to do with this information.

00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the reasons
why it's so important for us

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:28.200 align:middle line:84%
to know about what
were the ancient ways?

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:30.135 align:middle line:90%
How do you use nature?

00:33:30.135 --> 00:33:33.000 align:middle line:84%
It's basically all
about nature and living

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.345 align:middle line:90%
in harmony with nature.

00:33:34.345 --> 00:33:35.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: And if we
can get that knowledge back,

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:41.100 align:middle line:84%
then we will know how to
use it as we move forward

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:44.190 align:middle line:84%
in this Golden Age
where we finally

00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:45.465 align:middle line:90%
overthrow our oppressors.

00:33:45.465 --> 00:33:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And the Druids brought
that information forward as

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:52.210 align:middle line:84%
did some of the other
power players of Atlantis

00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:56.185 align:middle line:84%
that did make it through and
certainly they've reincarnated.

00:33:56.185 --> 00:33:58.300 align:middle line:84%
But just as another
point of validation,

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:00.940 align:middle line:84%
in that one scene in
Dolores Cannon's book

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:01.937 align:middle line:90%
where she regressed me.

00:34:01.937 --> 00:34:02.770 align:middle line:90%
She changed my name.

00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:03.880 align:middle line:90%
What was my name?

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:04.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Oh.

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:04.585 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Veronica?

00:34:04.585 --> 00:34:05.665 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME:
No, it was Rita.

00:34:05.665 --> 00:34:06.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Rita, yeah.

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:09.439 align:middle line:84%
She changed my name to Rita in
the second of the "Convoluted

00:34:09.439 --> 00:34:10.239 align:middle line:90%
Universe" books.

00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:12.219 align:middle line:90%
But that was my regression.

00:34:12.219 --> 00:34:16.360 align:middle line:84%
The part that's not in
there is I had a young--

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:19.000 align:middle line:84%
living in the temple of
that day, and we were there.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.860 align:middle line:90%
We stayed till the very end.

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:24.250 align:middle line:84%
It was very, very difficult
to go through that.

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:28.719 align:middle line:84%
The younger ones in the
temple, and one of the ones

00:34:28.719 --> 00:34:31.000 align:middle line:84%
that I trained in
was in charge of,

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:37.659 align:middle line:84%
was sent to Avalon to retain and
reseed the Atlantean knowledge

00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:39.460 align:middle line:90%
after we were dead and gone.

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:42.409 align:middle line:84%
So it was known in advance
this was going to happen.

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:46.929 align:middle line:84%
So there was time to seed
these priests and priestesses

00:34:46.929 --> 00:34:49.210 align:middle line:84%
who became known as
the Druids later.

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:51.639 align:middle line:84%
And then I don't know what--
if there was an official name

00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:53.080 align:middle line:90%
for a female version.

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And they became
instrumental to the kings,

00:34:56.530 --> 00:34:59.860 align:middle line:84%
for example, who used to have
their own Druid as their seer

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:00.880 align:middle line:90%
and advisor.

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.800 align:middle line:84%
So they were very
heralded and also

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:05.650 align:middle line:84%
very feared because they had
knowledge and they could see.

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:07.450 align:middle line:84%
So what she was
tapping into, I'm

00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:10.660 align:middle line:84%
just saying from my point
of view in that regression,

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:15.970 align:middle line:84%
we did send them over into
Britannia, Avalon, this area

00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:18.890 align:middle line:84%
you speak of, to receive
that knowledge as Atlantis

00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:19.690 align:middle line:90%
was going down.

00:35:19.690 --> 00:35:21.565 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Wow,
that's so fascinating.

00:35:21.565 --> 00:35:23.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what's nice talking.

00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:27.310 align:middle line:84%
Because everyone's creating
a mosaic of our history,

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:30.850 align:middle line:84%
and that's something I've wanted
to see happen for years, where

00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:32.950 align:middle line:84%
the archeologists
that we know of,

00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:37.960 align:middle line:84%
those who are going into deeper
archeology that questions

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:40.120 align:middle line:90%
the official storylines.

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:43.840 align:middle line:84%
We need those researchers
to bring back hard evidence.

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:46.810 align:middle line:84%
But we also need
people with far memory

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:49.330 align:middle line:84%
to bring back this
knowledge as well.

00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And the respect between
the two, I think,

00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:53.962 align:middle line:84%
is where our
discovery of history

00:35:53.962 --> 00:35:56.295 align:middle line:84%
is going to go in the future,
and you're a part of that.

00:35:56.295 --> 00:35:57.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME:
Thanks so much.

00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:59.270 align:middle line:84%
It's really fun to
be a part of it.

00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:01.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's so
fascinating to me.

00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And, you know,
what's also really

00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:07.870 align:middle line:84%
fascinating is the connection
between Egypt and Avalon.

00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:10.120 align:middle line:84%
It all goes back
to, like you said,

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:13.630 align:middle line:84%
the survivors of Atlantis
and this information

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:15.850 align:middle line:90%
being stored in these places.

00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:17.770 align:middle line:84%
It was so fascinating
to understand

00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:19.540 align:middle line:90%
that Avalon had these myths.

00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:22.900 align:middle line:84%
That's what Alice kept saying
that Avalon had these myths.

00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And basically, it was like
this vibrational energy

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:29.470 align:middle line:84%
that would surround and
protect that sacred place.

00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's so interesting
how Avalon also

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:35.900 align:middle line:84%
was an actual word
in their language.

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:38.020 align:middle line:84%
So as I was talking
to Alice, she

00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:42.850 align:middle line:84%
said that there was like,
almost like these beings that

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:44.690 align:middle line:90%
were awakened--

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:47.770 align:middle line:84%
this is her legend or
legend-- maybe it's real.

00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:52.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure-- these beings that
were awakened from the stars.

00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And it took her a while to kind
of pronounce the name to me.

00:36:56.350 --> 00:36:59.770 align:middle line:84%
She said it was in
this Druidic language.

00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And the beings that
kind of founded Avalon

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:07.420 align:middle line:84%
after the escapees
from Atlantis,

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:11.270 align:middle line:84%
they called themselves, and
this was the pronunciation,

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:12.070 align:middle line:90%
she said--

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:13.870 align:middle line:90%
Twylateg.

00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:15.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
that means anything.

00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:19.360 align:middle line:84%
But she said these beings
call themselves the Twylateg.

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And it was this really
ancient English language.

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:26.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'll have to go back
into some hermetic documents

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:29.977 align:middle line:84%
that go into depth on
the Druids right down

00:37:29.977 --> 00:37:31.810 align:middle line:84%
to the language you're
talking about itself.

00:37:31.810 --> 00:37:33.227 align:middle line:84%
It's a little
difficult. They were

00:37:33.227 --> 00:37:35.110 align:middle line:84%
based-- every part
of the alphabet,

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:39.170 align:middle line:84%
each number or letter was
based on a tree, for example,

00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:40.730 align:middle line:90%
so it has embedded meaning.

00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And so trying to figure out
how to pronounce or even write

00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:45.430 align:middle line:84%
these would be
difficult. But I'll

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:48.040 align:middle line:84%
go back and see if I can find
anything that sounds like that.

00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:49.665 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME:
Well, she kept saying

00:37:49.665 --> 00:37:52.240 align:middle line:84%
there were these sacred,
sacred trees that were actually

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:53.980 align:middle line:90%
very, very conscious.

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And when she would go out
and even into her woods,

00:37:57.490 --> 00:38:00.490 align:middle line:84%
she knew how to get the
information from these trees.

00:38:00.490 --> 00:38:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And that part of the
information or part

00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:05.770 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient ways
that are coming back

00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:07.865 align:middle line:84%
are how to use the
energy from the trees.

00:38:07.865 --> 00:38:08.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:10.282 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME:
Because as we start

00:38:10.282 --> 00:38:14.230 align:middle line:84%
to develop our subtle energies,
as we start to understand

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:19.840 align:middle line:84%
that we can use our own
bodies as antennas, then

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:25.300 align:middle line:84%
we can tap into the energy
of the trees and plants

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:29.260 align:middle line:84%
and be healed by them, allow
ourselves to be healed.

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:33.460 align:middle line:84%
But also, Alice was telling
me, so I am like Alice,

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Alice was telling
me that they had

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:38.920 align:middle line:90%
the red crystals from Atlantis.

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And what they would do
was they would sew them

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.960 align:middle line:90%
into the old tapestries.

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:47.300 align:middle line:84%
So her mother, when she was
describing her mother's room,

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:48.100 align:middle line:90%
it was so funny.

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:51.290 align:middle line:84%
She was like, my
mother's bed is so big.

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:54.500 align:middle line:84%
It's like as big as what you
guys would call a double bed.

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:55.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, wow.

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:56.100 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:56.930 align:middle line:90%
It sounds so big.

00:38:56.930 --> 00:39:02.270 align:middle line:84%
But they sewed these really
powerful ancient crystals

00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:04.790 align:middle line:84%
from Atlantis into
the tapestries.

00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:06.207 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder if
you can find them?

00:39:06.207 --> 00:39:07.707 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That would
be interesting,

00:39:07.707 --> 00:39:08.820 align:middle line:90%
and that's in Wales?

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:09.980 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: In Wales.

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:10.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In Wales.

00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:10.745 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Yes.

00:39:10.745 --> 00:39:11.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And for anyone that wants to
know about the red crystals,

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:18.890 align:middle line:84%
I recommend you go back and
look at my first interview

00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:20.780 align:middle line:84%
with Sarah where we
get into Jen's work

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:22.500 align:middle line:90%
when she was alive at that time.

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And she was exposed
to these red--

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:25.760 align:middle line:90%
protecting these red crystals.

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.860 align:middle line:84%
So we'll take it all
back to the beginning

00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:29.270 align:middle line:90%
of our first conversation.

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:31.590 align:middle line:84%
Just a final thought
because believe it or not,

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:32.390 align:middle line:90%
that was so fun.

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:33.190 align:middle line:90%
What a romp.

00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:34.080 align:middle line:90%
We're out of time.

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:36.073 align:middle line:84%
Any final thoughts
before we go, Sarah?

00:39:36.073 --> 00:39:38.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: I just
want to say that the higher

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.830 align:middle line:84%
consciousness is
always telling me

00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:42.470 align:middle line:84%
that one of the most important
things you can really do

00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:43.550 align:middle line:90%
is work on yourself.

00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:47.180 align:middle line:84%
Because the higher consciousness
says that most people, when

00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:49.430 align:middle line:84%
they leave their
life, they have little

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:53.610 align:middle line:84%
left to show for their lifetime
except for experiences.

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:56.450 align:middle line:10%
But if you become
a spiritual master,

00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:59.120 align:middle line:10%
if you really
master yourself, it

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:02.790 align:middle line:10%
leaves an imprint on the
consciousness that's permanent.

00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:05.060 align:middle line:10%
And so that one of the
most important things

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:09.200 align:middle line:10%
you can do for all of humanity
is to master yourself,

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:12.020 align:middle line:10%
because anyone can
tap into that imprint,

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:14.060 align:middle line:10%
and it will always
keep giving back.

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:15.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hear, hear.

00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:16.965 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

I can't wait till
our next conversation

00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:21.230 align:middle line:84%
because you're always
coming across new things.

00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And we start finding, because
I've done so much research

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:27.230 align:middle line:84%
and in my lifetime,
I can always help

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:29.420 align:middle line:84%
by drawing in something
that validates what

00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:30.720 align:middle line:90%
this other person has seen.

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And so it makes kind of a fun
conversation, kind of cross

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:33.930 align:middle line:90%
talk there.

00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:35.630 align:middle line:90%

books, her courses, her trips,
