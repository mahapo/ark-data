>>REGINA MEREDITH:
The Harmonic Egg

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.228 align:middle line:10%
could not have been
brought forward

00:00:22.228 --> 00:00:24.910 align:middle line:10%
by anyone more appropriate
than Gail Lynn.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.520 align:middle line:84%
Having worked for more than a
decade with another light box

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.070 align:middle line:84%
technology while
observing what works,

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.409 align:middle line:84%
her new technology
represents everything she's

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:33.610 align:middle line:90%
learned through the years.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.530 align:middle line:10%
There is a word for
the wise, however.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.840 align:middle line:84%
We should not be using
these technologies--

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.150 align:middle line:84%
vibrational and energy
healing systems--

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.460 align:middle line:84%
indiscriminately,
and we will explain

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.040 align:middle line:84%
that in the second half
of the conversation.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.005 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Gail.

00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:46.805 align:middle line:90%
>>GAIL LYNN: Hi.

00:00:46.805 --> 00:00:47.470 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:48.387 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is fun.

00:00:48.387 --> 00:00:51.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have to say, I'm
personally excited about this

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.230 align:middle line:84%
because, as it turns
out, years ago when

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.610 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed the
person you were

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.850 align:middle line:84%
the protege of with the
other light box technology,

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.090 align:middle line:84%
a woman in my little hometown
watched that interview

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.540 align:middle line:84%
and got this message
pouring through her.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.990 align:middle line:90%
I need to do this one day.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.600 align:middle line:90%
I am going to open a center.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.410 align:middle line:90%
Our town has 2,000 people in it.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.335 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, the day has arrived.

00:01:15.335 --> 00:01:16.960 align:middle line:84%
She has one of those
because she opened

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.510 align:middle line:84%
her center a little
while ago, and now she

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.700 align:middle line:90%
has the Harmonic Egg too.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.850 align:middle line:84%
So I feel so lucky that
I can go in and bathe

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.945 align:middle line:84%
in these frequencies
whenever I want.

00:01:26.945 --> 00:01:28.320 align:middle line:84%
It's five minutes
from my house--

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.410 align:middle line:90%
well, seven, technically.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:30.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.020 align:middle line:90%
So this is great.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.160 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, how many are there
right now out and about?

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because this
is still pretty new--

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:35.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: 11 centers now.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 11.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.690 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:37.030 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.947 align:middle line:10%
So people, if they're
interested after hearing

00:01:38.947 --> 00:01:41.470 align:middle line:10%
this segment probably find
one in the general region.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Right.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.430 align:middle line:90%
They're all in the US.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hometown.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.110 align:middle line:90%
I am lucky.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.190 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, I wanted to
have you introduce yourself

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.920 align:middle line:84%
to this audience by speaking
of how you originally

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.550 align:middle line:84%
became what is now compulsively
obsessed with light and sound

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.860 align:middle line:90%
healing technologies.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Absolutely.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.470 align:middle line:10%
So I'm an engineer from Detroit.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.949 align:middle line:10%
And so I grew up in the
automotive industry,

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:13.480 align:middle line:10%
blue collar family, kind of
the good old boys' network.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I worked in
automotive in the '80s.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And so it was 20%
women and mostly men.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.910 align:middle line:84%
And I just knew it
wasn't life-changing.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.620 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't going to
change the world,

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.870 align:middle line:90%
and I had an itch to get out.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And I met a gentleman in Texas
and moved to Texas in 1997-ish.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.355 align:middle line:84%
And it was life changing
because he was a shaman,

00:02:37.355 --> 00:02:39.730 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't even know what
that meant at the time coming

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:40.930 align:middle line:90%
from Detroit.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.350 align:middle line:10%
So I moved out to Texas, got
into the telecom industry,

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.480 align:middle line:10%
and grew an international
telecom consulting firm.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.400 align:middle line:90%
Married, divorced.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.460 align:middle line:84%
We were better business partners
than we were life partners

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.260 align:middle line:90%
and then got into Hollywood.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's taken me all
these different courses

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.640 align:middle line:90%
to get to where I am today.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.400 align:middle line:10%
So I get out into
Hollywood where

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.970 align:middle line:10%
I met a gentleman who
happened to be Elvis Presley's

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.590 align:middle line:10%
stepbrother.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.500 align:middle line:10%
And he and I made
a movie together

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.770 align:middle line:10%
in Hollywood called
"Protecting the King."

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.330 align:middle line:10%
And so I learned
stuff in automotive,

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.240 align:middle line:10%
I learned stuff in telecom, and
I learned stuff in Hollywood,

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.190 align:middle line:10%
but all that took me into
a very high stress place.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And at age 37, the
doctor said, you're

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.330 align:middle line:84%
on the verge of an
instant heart attack.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.700 align:middle line:84%
You have the heart
of an 80-year-old.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I guess I
got to make some life changes

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.990 align:middle line:90%
because I want to be around.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.230 align:middle line:90%
I want to live.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And so I met a gentleman
that owned a light box

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.500 align:middle line:90%
technology in Arizona.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.450 align:middle line:90%
Flew out to Arizona.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.555 align:middle line:84%
And in a weekend, the severe
cardiovascular stress was gone.

00:03:50.555 --> 00:03:52.180 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: What do
you mean it was gone?

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.670 align:middle line:84%
You mean you didn't feel
it, or it was verifiably--

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: It verifiable
with heart rate

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.137 align:middle line:84%
variability that I was in
severe cardiovascular stress.

00:03:59.137 --> 00:04:01.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you were
very tested after all this?

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.428 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: I was tested after
on heart rate variability.

00:04:03.428 --> 00:04:04.780 align:middle line:90%
It was completely normal.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.907 align:middle line:84%
So the nervous system has two
sides-- the parasympathetic

00:04:07.907 --> 00:04:08.740 align:middle line:90%
and the sympathetic.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you were
like stuck with the pedal

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.380 align:middle line:90%
to the metal in sympathetic.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Yeah.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.329 align:middle line:84%
Fight or flight probably
almost close to freeze.

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.899 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now, this has to
be implicated in a lot of heart

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:22.040 align:middle line:84%
disease is severe
stress like that--

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Absolutely.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where people
can't nudge themselves out

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.960 align:middle line:84%
of the sympathetic side
of the autonomic system,

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.760 align:middle line:90%
nervous system.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Right.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.390 align:middle line:90%
It's really hard.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.980 align:middle line:84%
Especially when
people feel like they

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.015 align:middle line:90%
were born in fight or flight.

00:04:35.015 --> 00:04:36.640 align:middle line:84%
So I remember the
first time I realized

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.590 align:middle line:84%
that I had a parasympathetic
nervous system.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.770 align:middle line:84%
I was speeding down 36
over here in Boulder.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.950 align:middle line:84%
I saw a cop, and I felt
this warm sensation come up

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.530 align:middle line:90%
all the way into my neck.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.950 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, what is that?

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And then I didn't get
pulled over, thank god,

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.960 align:middle line:90%
and it went back down.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.240 align:middle line:10%
And it was probably
after about 20 sessions

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.560 align:middle line:10%
in the light and sound chamber.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, wow, I have a
parasympathetic nervous system,

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.300 align:middle line:84%
and I just went into
fight or flight.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: And I had
always just lived there.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.850 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:07.650 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.120 align:middle line:84%
I have a healing
practitioner I go to,

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.820 align:middle line:84%
who just does a
sophisticated level

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.090 align:middle line:84%
of kinesiology
combined chiropractic.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And when I get stuck
in sympathetic,

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.950 align:middle line:90%
it will not go back.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.268 align:middle line:10%
I can't get it bounced back
out, unless I do something

00:05:27.268 --> 00:05:29.560 align:middle line:10%
like light or sound therapy,
which most of the time I'm

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.550 align:middle line:10%
not thinking to do.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Yeah.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There isn't
anything around really to do.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: Well, on the other
thing is, deep breathing.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.430 align:middle line:84%
If we do that deep
breathing, it always

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.190 align:middle line:84%
will help to reset the
autonomic nervous system, which

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.630 align:middle line:90%
is the flight fight or flight.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.250 align:middle line:90%
And then rest and digest.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Breathing
very shallowly.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Especially women--

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:44.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Most of the time.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Yeah.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, how did you
even find out about this?

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.870 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty esoteric.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:50.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Right.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.980 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.050 align:middle line:10%
So I was at a
conference in LA, and it

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.980 align:middle line:10%
was for C-level executives only,
so I was a chief operations

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.700 align:middle line:10%
officer for the production
company in Hollywood.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And so I got invited
to the event.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And I remember seeing
the gentleman on stage,

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.310 align:middle line:84%
and he was talking
about all these cases

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:14.620 align:middle line:84%
that were to me amazing, and how
could sound and light do that?

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And as an engineer, I
thought, there's no way.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.970 align:middle line:84%
My brain couldn't figure out
how that could possibly work.

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.340 align:middle line:84%
You lie inside of a sound
and light chamber and all

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.330 align:middle line:90%
that stuff happens?

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:27.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:32.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: Now, knowing what I know
now, it's pretty commonsense.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.070 align:middle line:84%
So I bullied my way up
to the front of the stage

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:37.870 align:middle line:84%
after his talk, and
I said, oh my gosh,

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.210 align:middle line:84%
I've had 23 years of
migraine headaches.

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.460 align:middle line:90%
Can this help?

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And he said, the body
doesn't know disease by name.

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.710 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, yes or no, dude.

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.360 align:middle line:90%
What is the answer, right?

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.180 align:middle line:84%
Now knowing what I know,
you can't make claims.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.010 align:middle line:90%
You can't say yes or no.

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.860 align:middle line:84%
Or, you don't want to say
no, but when it's a yes,

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.380 align:middle line:84%
but you can't make claims
because of the FDA.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The FDA.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:01.980 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: So I thought,
what a stupid answer.

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:07.220 align:middle line:84%
So I left there kind
of disappointed.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And it was probably six
years later that I actually

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:11.450 align:middle line:90%
went to Arizona.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:11.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, really?

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Yeah.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:13.880 align:middle line:90%
It was still in my head.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.537 align:middle line:84%
And every time, it
kept popping up.

00:07:15.537 --> 00:07:16.370 align:middle line:90%
Go to the light box.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:17.300 align:middle line:90%
Go to the light box.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.467 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, that's crazy.

00:07:18.467 --> 00:07:19.950 align:middle line:90%
It can't do anything.

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:21.690 align:middle line:90%
And then I finally went.

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:22.592 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And?

00:07:22.592 --> 00:07:23.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: It was amazing.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:24.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
said after a weekend--

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:26.307 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: After a
weekend, I was out

00:07:26.307 --> 00:07:28.070 align:middle line:84%
of the severe
cardiovascular stress--

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.950 align:middle line:84%
verifiable with heart
rate variability.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.300 align:middle line:90%
I didn't notice anything else.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.133 align:middle line:10%
And I actually came
home and told my friends

00:07:34.133 --> 00:07:38.040 align:middle line:10%
it didn't do anything because
it just didn't make sense to me.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And so I wrote up a funny little
explanation to all my friends,

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.910 align:middle line:84%
which I have on my
website of how I

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.910 align:middle line:90%
describe this crazy light box.

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized
two months later, I

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.450 align:middle line:84%
didn't have asthma anymore,
and I was born with asthma.

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:55.550 align:middle line:90%
So I'm riding my bike up a hill.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:59.677 align:middle line:84%
I get it to the top of the hill
and I said, where's my asthma?

00:07:59.677 --> 00:08:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, it couldn't
be that silly light box

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.440 align:middle line:90%
because that didn't do anything.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.357 align:middle line:90%
And then I went to the doctor.

00:08:06.357 --> 00:08:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And I was wearing my
glasses, and I thought,

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:10.400 align:middle line:84%
I need a higher prescription
because I've been

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.605 align:middle line:90%
wearing glasses since I was 19.

00:08:12.605 --> 00:08:13.980 align:middle line:84%
I went to the
doctor and he said,

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.920 align:middle line:90%
why are you wearing glasses?

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.830 align:middle line:84%
I said, because I've been
wearing them since I was 19.

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:20.660 align:middle line:90%
He said, your vision's 20/20.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:22.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, I thought the
blurriness meant

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.230 align:middle line:84%
I needed a stronger
prescription, which I really

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:25.550 align:middle line:90%
didn't need them.

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And that he had the audacity
to tell me, well, you know,

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.620 align:middle line:84%
as we get older, our
eyesight gets worse.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And I said, have you
been in the same room

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:37.159 align:middle line:84%
with me, because my
eyesight's better.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:39.679 align:middle line:84%
And so I left there
just kind of chuckling

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:41.560 align:middle line:90%
and threw the glasses away.

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, couldn't
be that silly light box.

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.810 align:middle line:84%
By this time, how many
sessions had you done?

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: I had only done three--

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:50.070 align:middle line:90%
four sessions in three days.

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:50.870 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All these things
happened after that?

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:52.820 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.403 align:middle line:84%
Then I heard you say
a little bit ago,

00:08:54.403 --> 00:08:56.340 align:middle line:84%
then you ended up
doing like 20 sessions.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:56.600 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.450 align:middle line:84%
So, obviously you escalated your
engagement with the technology.

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:00.320 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: So it was
about a year later,

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:04.860 align:middle line:84%
and a little knocking on my head
was saying, go to the light box

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:05.660 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.280 align:middle line:90%
Go to the light box again.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.320 align:middle line:90%
And I just felt stuck.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And every time I felt
stuck thereafter,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.940 align:middle line:84%
I would go to the
light box and feel

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.400 align:middle line:84%
like that everything
was moving again,

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.900 align:middle line:90%
things were flowing again.

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.550 align:middle line:84%
So a year later, I
went back and I did

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:21.530 align:middle line:90%
another weekend of sessions.

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And then another year
later, I went back

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:26.030 align:middle line:84%
and I said, well, crap, I
really need to just do this.

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:28.730 align:middle line:84%
My migraines had
gotten less intense.

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.920 align:middle line:84%
They had got less--
they were less often,

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.420 align:middle line:84%
and then they were
almost nothing.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:39.770 align:middle line:84%
They were 15-hour migraines,
throwing up, coming out

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:40.970 align:middle line:90%
both ends.

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:42.350 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't talk.

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:45.350 align:middle line:84%
I would look at a word and
couldn't even make it out.

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:48.300 align:middle line:84%
I would look at "the" and
it wouldn't look like "the."

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.070 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't text,
I couldn't talk.

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:51.720 align:middle line:90%
It was horrible.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.560 align:middle line:84%
So it was such a godsend that
these migraines are gone.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And the last part
of the migraines,

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:59.660 align:middle line:84%
after the 20th session,
was just optical.

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:03.050 align:middle line:84%
So I would lose my vision,
but wouldn't get any pain.

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:03.850 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:05.017 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Are they gone now?

00:10:05.017 --> 00:10:07.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: I haven't had one
for probably eight years.

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:08.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Excellent.

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:14.615 align:middle line:84%
So, this story continues because
you decided if it can do this--

00:10:14.615 --> 00:10:15.740 align:middle line:90%
and we're going to get in--

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.230 align:middle line:84%
I have to say, now this is
the woo-woo part of our--

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:19.420 align:middle line:90%
you're not the woo-woo.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm the woo-woo part
of this conversation.

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:25.340 align:middle line:84%
So many years ago, I used to
undergo past life regressions

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.130 align:middle line:84%
fairly frequently,
because the guy was

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:31.490 align:middle line:84%
trying to find out about the
past and about himself mostly.

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And so I was just one of
the two or three people

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:36.710 align:middle line:84%
he used to get
glimpses into the past.

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And when our
information correlated,

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.160 align:middle line:90%
we knew we really had a hit.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.327 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times it
correlated to the other people

00:10:42.327 --> 00:10:44.750 align:middle line:84%
and my information
from the ancient past.

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:50.000 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things for
me is in this lifetime,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.280 align:middle line:84%
I became obsessed with
color therapy in my mid-30s,

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.190 align:middle line:84%
to the point that's all
I wanted to read about.

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:02.400 align:middle line:84%
I bought lights and color gels,
and I was teaching classes

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.570 align:middle line:90%
on color therapy.

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And I would do group
experiments with color therapy,

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:09.900 align:middle line:84%
like have everyone
blindfold themselves,

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:11.580 align:middle line:84%
and I'd turn lights
on and say, start

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:13.560 align:middle line:84%
talking about how
you feel and see

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.860 align:middle line:84%
if they were
reflecting the effect

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.930 align:middle line:84%
of that particular
frequency band of color.

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, just even
speaking to-- like I spoke

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:25.890 align:middle line:90%
to a rotary group of old men.

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Everyone-- I couldn't say
enough about color therapy.

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And as I was being regressed
around the same period of time,

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.810 align:middle line:84%
I saw that in other lifetimes,
I had been a color healer.

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And I saw the ways in
which we used color

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:42.630 align:middle line:84%
in very ancient Atlantian
times, which was really

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:45.510 align:middle line:84%
just very organic and
stunning and beautiful,

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:47.100 align:middle line:90%
but we were healers as well.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.900 align:middle line:84%
So we were working
with our own energies

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.970 align:middle line:84%
through these
beautiful-- in one case,

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:56.310 align:middle line:84%
we'd lay naturally-dyed, bright
variety of colors silk cloths

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:58.860 align:middle line:84%
over a person's body and
then have the sun shine

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:01.300 align:middle line:84%
through the silk
into their body.

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And so that was
the way it was used

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:04.950 align:middle line:90%
in that particular lifetime.

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:08.950 align:middle line:84%
So I have a very strong
affinity with what you're doing,

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:10.710 align:middle line:84%
which is why I'm
so excited about it

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:14.190 align:middle line:84%
being in my little town in the
Sierra foothills of California.

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:15.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm so excited.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.527 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: I know we're getting
off a little bit track,

00:12:17.527 --> 00:12:20.790 align:middle line:84%
but Norm Shealy did a past
life regression for me.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:23.748 align:middle line:10%
And I remember the shamans came
into my center and they said,

00:12:23.748 --> 00:12:25.790 align:middle line:10%
Gail, you're going to
create your own technology.

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:27.240 align:middle line:90%
I said, no I'm not.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.930 align:middle line:84%
I'll just run a center with this
light box, and it'll be fine.

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And they said, no, you need to
get this past life regression,

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:38.250 align:middle line:84%
past life reading and find out
why this is coming through.

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:40.410 align:middle line:90%
Why you're so excited about it.

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:42.120 align:middle line:84%
So I called Norm
Shealy and I said,

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:46.200 align:middle line:84%
who's the best past life
regressor that I can go to

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.310 align:middle line:90%
in the area?

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:49.080 align:middle line:84%
He mentioned a
guy in California,

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:51.220 align:middle line:90%
but he said he was second best.

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:52.020 align:middle line:90%
I said, that's OK.

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.650 align:middle line:90%
I'll take second best.

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And I just said, I
have to know who I am--

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:58.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why you're obsessed.

00:12:58.530 --> 00:12:59.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Why is this--

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to know that
I was a dancer in China.

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:03.600 align:middle line:90%
I don't need to know all that.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.460 align:middle line:90%
I need to know why I'm here.

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.680 align:middle line:84%
So we sat down together,
and it was so funny.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.550 align:middle line:10%
He was so frustrated with
me because I kept saying,

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:11.940 align:middle line:10%
am I making this up?

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:13.070 align:middle line:90%
Am I making this up?

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:13.870 align:middle line:90%
And he said--

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:15.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what everyone says.

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:16.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: I think he
wanted to say, shut up.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:17.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.170 align:middle line:84%
That's what everyone
says that when they

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:20.520 align:middle line:90%
do their first regressions.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: It was crazy.

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:25.110 align:middle line:84%
So he actually identified
a life in Egypt

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:28.450 align:middle line:84%
where I had my own
sound and light--

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:30.990 align:middle line:90%
probably mostly a sound chamber.

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like it
was just sunlight

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:37.050 align:middle line:84%
that came across in wood
illuminates into a hole

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:38.790 align:middle line:90%
somewhere into the chamber.

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:40.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what we
did in the other times.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:43.095 align:middle line:84%
There was a large aperture
in the top of the ceiling

00:13:43.095 --> 00:13:44.588 align:middle line:90%
of the healing chambers.

00:13:44.588 --> 00:13:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And when the light
was really intense

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:47.505 align:middle line:84%
at that part of
the day, it would

00:13:47.505 --> 00:13:49.610 align:middle line:84%
shine through the aperture
down to the platform

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:50.410 align:middle line:90%
they were lying on.

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:52.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Crazy.

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:55.040 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know where the
images were coming from,

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.748 align:middle line:84%
but it felt like noon
was the right time.

00:13:56.748 --> 00:13:57.707 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:13:57.707 --> 00:13:58.710 align:middle line:90%
That's when it was done.

00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:59.793 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: And I had no idea.

00:13:59.793 --> 00:14:03.900 align:middle line:84%
So then he said, well, the
person that was your mentor

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.330 align:middle line:84%
was your son in
another lifetime.

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:08.320 align:middle line:90%
And I started bawling.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.660 align:middle line:90%
And he said, finally.

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:12.723 align:middle line:90%
We have some emotion for you.

00:14:12.723 --> 00:14:13.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:14.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: And then I left.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.030 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, it was great.

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:16.905 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're here
because you're back.

00:14:16.905 --> 00:14:18.720 align:middle line:84%
This is back to the
future, literally back

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.850 align:middle line:90%
to the future, this technology.

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:23.220 align:middle line:90%
And also the beings that--

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.920 align:middle line:84%
intuitive beings that
I'm associated with

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.520 align:middle line:84%
and have been forever and
consciously for the last 30

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:30.400 align:middle line:90%
years here.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.190 align:middle line:84%
One thing I remember
them telling to me,

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:35.610 align:middle line:84%
those years ago, I said, what
does the future of healing

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:39.120 align:middle line:84%
look like on this planet
within my lifetime?

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And they said within your
lifetime is going to be

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:45.570 align:middle line:84%
the resurgence of-- and at
a very sophisticated level--

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:50.138 align:middle line:84%
of sound healing again
is going to come back.

00:14:50.138 --> 00:14:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And this was when I was involved
with color at the time too--

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:53.480 align:middle line:90%
color and light.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And they said, this is going
to be accepted as a healing

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.160 align:middle line:90%
modality within my lifetime.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:14:59.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Yeah.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:00.810 align:middle line:90%
And it's here.

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:01.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: People want this.

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:03.930 align:middle line:10%
People are calling
me all the time,

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:06.210 align:middle line:10%
asking where they can find this.

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like when I was
bringing this through-- cause

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:10.130 align:middle line:84%
it does not feel
like my technology.

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:12.920 align:middle line:10%
It feels like something
I'm bringing through.

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.660 align:middle line:84%
And I was watching a video
from a medical doctor talking

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:20.547 align:middle line:84%
about how he decided to purchase
a Harmonic Egg in California.

00:15:20.547 --> 00:15:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, wow,
that looks really cool.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.435 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's mine.

00:15:24.435 --> 00:15:27.240 align:middle line:90%
It's this really weird energy.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.830 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, OK,
it has to be this.

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:29.630 align:middle line:90%
It has to be that.

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:31.040 align:middle line:90%
It has to have sacred geometry.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.570 align:middle line:84%
It has to be wood
for the acoustics.

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:34.980 align:middle line:90%
It has to be enclosed.

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:38.190 align:middle line:84%
It has to have a certain
type of light system.

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:40.980 align:middle line:84%
It has to have
musicians that have

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:44.490 align:middle line:84%
a high vibration and a
high consciousness that's

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:46.770 align:middle line:90%
coming through their music.

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And my manufacturers asked
me one time, they said, well,

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.143 align:middle line:84%
can't we just do
this, this, and this?

00:15:51.143 --> 00:15:52.240 align:middle line:90%
I said no.

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.620 align:middle line:90%
And they said, why not?

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:54.820 align:middle line:90%
I said, I don't know.

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:56.350 align:middle line:90%
We just can't.

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And now things
have been revealed.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.760 align:middle line:90%
Susie Miller came to the center.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:02.650 align:middle line:90%
We have her in our archives.

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:03.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Absolutely.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:03.960 align:middle line:90%
She's amazing.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She deals
with autistic children.

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:06.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Yes.

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And so she said that
the autistic collective

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.550 align:middle line:84%
consciousness had informed her
that there would be a pod that

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:13.940 align:middle line:90%
would come to the planet.

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:14.857 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:16:14.857 --> 00:16:20.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: And the pod
would be for the autistic

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:23.680 align:middle line:84%
to lower their consciousness,
us to kind of raise

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.680 align:middle line:84%
our consciousness, and
meet in the middle.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.130 align:middle line:90%
And we Facetimed.

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:30.640 align:middle line:84%
It was a really
strange introduction

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.220 align:middle line:90%
from a lady named Sandy.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.568 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, why is she
hooking me up with this lady?

00:16:35.568 --> 00:16:36.610 align:middle line:90%
I don't know who this is.

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:38.937 align:middle line:84%
And then by the end of the
call, we were both crying.

00:16:38.937 --> 00:16:41.020 align:middle line:84%
Within three days, she was
standing in front of me

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:43.180 align:middle line:90%
in my center from California.

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:44.710 align:middle line:90%
Flew to Denver.

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:47.170 align:middle line:90%
And she said, this is the pod.

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:49.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And, have you dealt
with autism in the pod much?

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.170 align:middle line:90%
And what does it do?

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:57.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: So I find that they
need to trust the practitioner.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:59.440 align:middle line:90%
It's very important.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.170 align:middle line:84%
I spend a lot of time with
them and talking to them

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:06.099 align:middle line:84%
or somewhat communicating
with them with my energy

00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:10.480 align:middle line:84%
and getting their trust before
I would put them into the pod.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.430 align:middle line:84%
But they seem to
gravitate towards it.

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:15.530 align:middle line:84%
One little boy ran
into the room--

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:17.698 align:middle line:84%
he was just so fast
at four years old,

00:17:17.698 --> 00:17:18.740 align:middle line:90%
we didn't even catch him.

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.160 align:middle line:84%
He opened the door and ran into
the room to go into the session

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.230 align:middle line:90%
and someone was in there.

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:24.162 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:17:24.162 --> 00:17:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: I'm like,
no, no, no, no, no.

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:29.200 align:middle line:84%
But the mom said he
had more social skills,

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.530 align:middle line:90%
he had more eye contact.

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed at the
end of three sessions,

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:38.230 align:middle line:84%
he looked up at me
like to pick him up.

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And I looked down, thinking
this is not normal.

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:42.440 align:middle line:84%
He shouldn't want
me to pick him up.

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And so I picked him up,
and then immediately wanted

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:46.180 align:middle line:90%
to be put down.

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:47.590 align:middle line:90%
But it was huge.

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:49.030 align:middle line:90%
Just huge.

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:50.890 align:middle line:90%
And Susie was telling me that--

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:53.140 align:middle line:84%
she said, do you have
a turquoise color?

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:54.730 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes.

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And she said, do you have
an amber color in the egg?

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:58.580 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes.

00:17:58.580 --> 00:17:59.380 align:middle line:90%
And she said, yeah.

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:01.330 align:middle line:90%
This is the pod.

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:02.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:03.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: I was just--

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:05.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and it's
such an interesting web

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:08.950 align:middle line:84%
through the years because,
Sandy, who introduced you,

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:11.800 align:middle line:84%
is a friend of mine, who
I've known for years.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And she and I, she also
has our own podcast

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:15.380 align:middle line:90%
and works with OM Times.

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:15.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Right.

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:16.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And so Sandy and I have
become personal friends

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:20.110 align:middle line:90%
over the years.

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:22.900 align:middle line:84%
But we share information
with each other

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:25.600 align:middle line:84%
when we each encounter
interesting new people

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.860 align:middle line:90%
in our fields.

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:30.400 align:middle line:84%
And so the web is growing
to an ridiculous extent

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:34.510 align:middle line:84%
of how many people know Sandy
or me or you or whomever now.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:38.020 align:middle line:84%
So this is all done
through a kind of network

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:39.860 align:middle line:90%
or a community of consciousness.

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:41.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Right.

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:41.950 align:middle line:90%
It is crazy.

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:45.190 align:middle line:84%
So I'll see my phone light
up and it's Susie Miller,

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:47.910 align:middle line:84%
Lee Harris has
been to the center.

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:50.020 align:middle line:90%
And he absolutely loved it.

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.900 align:middle line:84%
When he came out of the egg,
I said, well, how was it?

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:56.290 align:middle line:84%
And he was just winking
at me, putting a thumbs up

00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:57.970 align:middle line:90%
but couldn't talk.

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And he said, there will
be words, but not now.

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:01.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:02.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: So cute.

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:03.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:07.348 align:middle line:84%
So I also wanted to
share something too,

00:19:07.348 --> 00:19:09.640 align:middle line:84%
but I want to do it after we
take a look at some video.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.598 align:middle line:84%
Because we've talked
about it, but it's really,

00:19:11.598 --> 00:19:14.200 align:middle line:84%
I think, helpful if someone can
see what we're talking about,

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.710 align:middle line:90%
what it looks like and all that.

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:17.830 align:middle line:84%
So let's go to some video
where some people had

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:21.070 align:middle line:84%
been through the experience
and talked about it afterward

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:23.020 align:middle line:84%
this is about three
minutes long or so.

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:25.958 align:middle line:90%
So let's take a look.

00:19:25.958 --> 00:19:27.750 align:middle line:10%
>>LYNN: People come
from all over the world

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:31.120 align:middle line:10%
to experience this technology
when they don't have any hope

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.870 align:middle line:10%
and they want to have faith
that their body can heal itself

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:34.980 align:middle line:10%
naturally.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.800 align:middle line:84%
The Harmonic Egg uses
frequencies, vibrations,

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.050 align:middle line:84%
sound waves, and light
waves to bring the body

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:41.710 align:middle line:90%
into homeostasis.

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:47.310 align:middle line:84%
>> I was diagnosed with
endometrial cancer in 2016,

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:52.140 align:middle line:84%
and I went through surgery,
chemo, and radiation therapy.

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:55.910 align:middle line:84%
At the end of that, my
body was very traumatized,

00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:58.920 align:middle line:84%
and I was looking for
alternative methods

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:03.480 align:middle line:84%
to start my healing process,
and I found Gail Lynn.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:04.920 align:middle line:90%
Here I am a year later.

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:09.270 align:middle line:90%
I feel very comfortable, healed.

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:12.000 align:middle line:84%
I've got a renewed
sense of life,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.490 align:middle line:84%
which was hard as going
through the cancer process.

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:20.172 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very happy
that I came here.

00:20:20.172 --> 00:20:22.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: Many of the clients
come here because they're

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.090 align:middle line:90%
energetically depleted.

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:26.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a huge problem in the
world today with all the stress

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:29.130 align:middle line:84%
and everything that
we're taxed with.

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And so I love it when people
can come here and leave here

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:38.230 align:middle line:84%
with more energy and a clearer
aura and a clearer mind.

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I suffered from two neck
fractures in under a year,

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:42.590 align:middle line:90%
and it was really hard.

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:46.055 align:middle line:84%
I was in chronic pain
for almost three years.

00:20:46.055 --> 00:20:48.055 align:middle line:84%
And I had a ton of health
issues because of that

00:20:48.055 --> 00:20:50.380 align:middle line:84%
because I was in
constant fight or flight.

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:53.350 align:middle line:84%
After my first session, I did
the anti-inflammation one.

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:57.700 align:middle line:84%
My spine was more erect than
it had been in three years.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:59.780 align:middle line:90%
It was absolutely incredible.

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:02.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: This device helps people
to awaken to their own healing

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:04.330 align:middle line:90%
potential.

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:07.690 align:middle line:84%
One of the most common things
I see is chronic fatigue.

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>> I found myself in a situation
where I had been depleted

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:14.110 align:middle line:84%
by my life, by family
situations I could not solve.

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:17.620 align:middle line:84%
I found myself completely
fatigued all of the time

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:20.038 align:middle line:84%
and not feeling
particularly hopeful

00:21:20.038 --> 00:21:21.830 align:middle line:84%
that I would be able
to solve that problem.

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:25.150 align:middle line:84%
So I tried acupuncture,
chiropractic, massage,

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:27.430 align:middle line:90%
essential oils, many things.

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And each of them helped a
little bit for a little while,

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:33.010 align:middle line:84%
but none of them provided
me a real solution.

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:34.420 align:middle line:90%
And so I went questing.

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:36.220 align:middle line:90%
I found the Harmonic Egg.

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:39.020 align:middle line:84%
I knew immediately it
would be helpful to me.

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And after I had my first
session, what I noticed

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:45.220 align:middle line:84%
was a deep and
sustained calm that I

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:47.900 align:middle line:84%
don't know that I had ever
felt in my entire life.

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:52.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm experiencing improvements
in my mind, my mood.

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:55.570 align:middle line:84%
My energy level
is very high now.

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:57.140 align:middle line:90%
I am back to normal.

00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:01.300 align:middle line:84%
I would definitely say this
is a technology for healing

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:02.595 align:middle line:90%
your mind, body, and spirit.

00:22:02.595 --> 00:22:05.420 align:middle line:90%


00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:06.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well.

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:08.690 align:middle line:90%
Well then.

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:10.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it is a
beautiful experience.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.470 align:middle line:84%
But, so we're listening,
we're chatting,

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:14.270 align:middle line:84%
we're doing anecdotal
stuff, but this just

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:16.400 align:middle line:84%
came a couple of
days ago, and let

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.260 align:middle line:90%
me swipe this, the cell phone.

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:19.920 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:20.720 align:middle line:90%
This came in.

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.387 align:middle line:84%
Zeus found it-- my
husband Zeus found it

00:22:22.387 --> 00:22:25.010 align:middle line:84%
when he was looking at
some other material,

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:25.820 align:middle line:90%
and this popped up.

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:28.370 align:middle line:84%
It says, scientists
clear Alzheimer's plaque

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:31.610 align:middle line:84%
from mice using only
light and sound.

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:34.100 align:middle line:84%
So here it says, clumps
of harmful proteins

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.200 align:middle line:84%
that interfere with
brain functions have

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.090 align:middle line:84%
been partially
cleared in mice using

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:40.550 align:middle line:90%
nothing but light and sound.

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:44.210 align:middle line:84%
Research led by MIT has found
strobe lights and a low-pitch

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:49.070 align:middle line:84%
buzz can be used to create
brainwaves lost in the disease,

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:52.700 align:middle line:84%
which in turn remove plaque
and improve cognitive function

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:57.230 align:middle line:84%
in mice engineered to display
Alzheimer's-like behavior.

00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:59.750 align:middle line:84%
When I read this, I
have a very dear friend

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:03.740 align:middle line:84%
who has this, who has a tau
protein build-up in her brain,

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:05.270 align:middle line:90%
and her life is slipping away.

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:08.150 align:middle line:84%
She was like superwoman
two years ago.

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:10.790 align:middle line:90%
It's moving so fast.

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:12.920 align:middle line:84%
It's destroying all her
functions and becoming

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.810 align:middle line:90%
Parkinson's-like symptoms.

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And now she can barely talk,
she can barely use her hands,

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:19.790 align:middle line:90%
she can barely read.

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:21.770 align:middle line:84%
Her life is slipping
away because of this.

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And I immediately-- I haven't
called her yet to tell her

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.270 align:middle line:84%
about this study
to see about this,

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:30.620 align:middle line:84%
because this is a new
area, and MIT isn't a--

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:33.050 align:middle line:84%
it's not a new age
facility, that's for sure.

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:39.570 align:middle line:84%
So, what is it about light and
sound specifically that work

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:40.370 align:middle line:90%
in this way?

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:42.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's so
many frequency--

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:43.310 align:middle line:90%
there are Rife machines.

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:46.340 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
frequency-based technologies,

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.920 align:middle line:84%
all of which offer some
hope and that are good.

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:52.250 align:middle line:84%
But what is about light
and sound in particular?

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:55.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: So I believe that
we're sound and light beings

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:57.230 align:middle line:90%
by nature.

00:23:57.230 --> 00:24:00.050 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I feel like why
not heal with sound and light.

00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:00.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:01.820 align:middle line:90%
We're all frequencies.

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:03.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: We're all frequencies.

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:03.920 align:middle line:90%
We're all energy.

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.860 align:middle line:10%
And we're putting
these frequencies

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:10.480 align:middle line:10%
into our energetic body,
and it's really just--

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:14.270 align:middle line:10%
I have found that piano
music in the Harmonic Egg

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:17.570 align:middle line:10%
is working to help
with the nervous system

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:22.370 align:middle line:10%
and resetting the autonomic
nervous system with piano.

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like with
drumming, there's

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:28.790 align:middle line:84%
such a vibration, a vibrational
massage for the body

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:34.310 align:middle line:84%
that it can break up maybe
clogged arteries, maybe

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:35.730 align:middle line:90%
that calcification.

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And I've had people use
their pendulum and tell me

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:42.740 align:middle line:84%
that the pineal gland was less
calcified after sessions, just

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:44.177 align:middle line:90%
with the vibrations.

00:24:44.177 --> 00:24:45.260 align:middle line:90%
You really are getting a--

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:45.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Makes sense.

00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:46.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Tissue massage.

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:47.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: And so then I
believe that the cells--

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:53.690 align:middle line:84%
our cells, when they're healthy,
when the body's in balance,

00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:55.430 align:middle line:90%
it can heal naturally.

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:57.060 align:middle line:90%
Our bodies know what to do.

00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:58.500 align:middle line:90%
But a lot of times, they can't.

00:24:58.500 --> 00:24:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They get
out of stuck patterns.

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:00.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Right.

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:01.340 align:middle line:90%
Get out of sync.

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:03.260 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:06.230 align:middle line:84%
You already brought up piano
and the nervous system.

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to toss
a few things at you

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:13.250 align:middle line:84%
in terms of common
conditions and maybe give us

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:15.350 align:middle line:84%
a little cheat sheet on
what kind of instruments

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:17.210 align:middle line:90%
work well for that in general.

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:20.360 align:middle line:84%
Because there's also that
wonderful clinical study

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.185 align:middle line:84%
on women, breast
cancer, and violins.

00:25:22.185 --> 00:25:23.060 align:middle line:90%
So let's start there.

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:23.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Right.

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:27.610 align:middle line:84%
There was a woman that had come
into my center with cancer.

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:30.410 align:middle line:84%
It was right after she had
root canals on her stomach

00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:33.860 align:middle line:90%
and ovarian teeth meridians.

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:36.110 align:middle line:84%
So each of the teeth
have meridian lines

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:37.490 align:middle line:90%
that they run on.

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And she said, Gail, you have
to educate your clients.

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:42.320 align:middle line:10%
You have to tell them
that this is dangerous

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:45.140 align:middle line:10%
and these root canals has
resulted in me getting

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:47.360 align:middle line:10%
ovarian and stomach cancer.

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.800 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, well,
that's quite interesting,

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.920 align:middle line:10%
but I didn't know if
I really believed it.

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And she had some tumors that
had been created in her body.

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And we worked on her for
probably maybe eight sessions,

00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:06.980 align:middle line:84%
and the tumors were still there,
but she was feeling great.

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And so the next
time she came in,

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.500 align:middle line:84%
I thought, why don't I
just put her on some music

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:14.720 align:middle line:90%
that I've never used before.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:17.280 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden, the
tumors were shrinking.

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And so I went back and
I listened to the music,

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:22.610 align:middle line:84%
and I realized violin
was in that music.

00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, that's
odd because it wasn't

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:26.930 align:middle line:90%
in any of the other music.

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And now we're seeing some
change in the tumors.

00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:31.880 align:middle line:90%
So I'm a researcher.

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:36.060 align:middle line:84%
I went and googled
"violin, healing music,"

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:37.477 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of stuff comes up.

00:26:37.477 --> 00:26:38.810 align:middle line:90%
But I happen to see an article--

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:41.750 align:middle line:84%
women were listening to
40 hours of violin music

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:43.880 align:middle line:90%
and that tumors were shrinking.

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:45.530 align:middle line:90%
So what's that about?

00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:46.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:47.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: I was fascinated.

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:48.110 align:middle line:90%
So that--

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:49.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is fascinating.

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: That launched my journey
of the last probably nine

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:56.780 align:middle line:84%
years now, and the Harmonic Egg
training manual and everything.

00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:57.950 align:middle line:90%
She launched the journey.

00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:01.257 align:middle line:84%
I'm eternally grateful
to her for that one day

00:27:01.257 --> 00:27:02.590 align:middle line:90%
that she walked into the center.

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's wonderful.

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, for any
of our other viewers

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.640 align:middle line:84%
who are interested in that topic
about the effect of dental work

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:12.940 align:middle line:84%
and root canals and their
association with the energy

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:15.100 align:middle line:84%
meridians in the body,
I did an interview

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:17.830 align:middle line:84%
with a woman named
Allison Adams,

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:20.990 align:middle line:84%
and it's either in the CMN
or Healing Matrix archive

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:21.790 align:middle line:90%
here on Gaia.

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:23.800 align:middle line:84%
I just want to
let you know that.

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:26.360 align:middle line:84%
So you can go down that rabbit
hole a little further too.

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:27.160 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:28.030 align:middle line:90%
So here we go.

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Parkinson's disease, which
again, that is similar.

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:35.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, part of that has to
do with the protein build-up

00:27:35.050 --> 00:27:36.680 align:middle line:90%
in the brain and other things.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Absolutely.

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And so drumming seems to work
really well with Parkinson's.

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:41.770 align:middle line:90%
So drumming music.

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:45.970 align:middle line:10%
I feel like a lot of the
Parkinson's is heavy metals.

00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:50.510 align:middle line:10%
So we found that heavy
metals Parkinson's disease.

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's neurological,
so I had a gentleman

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:57.910 align:middle line:84%
come in one time with a
cobalt and chromium hip.

00:27:57.910 --> 00:28:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And I sent him to
his doctor because I

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:01.880 align:middle line:90%
work with a ton of doctors.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.390 align:middle line:84%
I sent him to his doctor to
get to have a metal test.

00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:08.110 align:middle line:84%
The heavy metal test came
back not really that bad.

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:11.560 align:middle line:84%
But after every session, he
would smell like heavy metals.

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:14.140 align:middle line:84%
The whole room would
smell like heavy metals.

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:15.870 align:middle line:90%
I knew he had heavy metals.

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:18.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, come to find out--
this heavy metal task tested

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:20.950 align:middle line:84%
for about 20
different heavy metals

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:22.315 align:middle line:90%
but not cobalt or chromium.

00:28:22.315 --> 00:28:23.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, there you go.

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: So we went down this
rabbit hole for a while.

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:26.380 align:middle line:90%
We came back to it.

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:29.890 align:middle line:84%
He was very high in
cobalt. And we looked up

00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:32.560 align:middle line:84%
cobalt symptoms--
high cobalt symptoms

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:35.185 align:middle line:84%
and it was all neurological,
all Parkinson's symptoms.

00:28:35.185 --> 00:28:36.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:37.760 align:middle line:90%
So drumming.

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:38.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Drumming.

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
happened with him?

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:42.555 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: So he is
actually stable now.

00:28:42.555 --> 00:28:43.930 align:middle line:84%
When he doesn't
come for a while,

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:46.480 align:middle line:84%
he gets worse because that
cobalt chromium hip is still

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.700 align:middle line:84%
in his body, off-gassing
all the time.

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:51.430 align:middle line:84%
So he has to really
make a concerted effort

00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:53.170 align:middle line:84%
to stay detoxed from
the heavy metals.

00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:55.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.210 align:middle line:90%
Also, PTSD, right?

00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:59.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: So, water sounds.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.990 align:middle line:84%
Water sounds are so
amazing for PTSD.

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:04.330 align:middle line:84%
And we call it "PTS"
because it's not a disorder.

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:04.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:05.610 align:middle line:90%
PTSD.

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:08.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: It's post-traumatic
stress that we can get rid of.

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And so my sister was just
in town working on her PTS

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:13.540 align:middle line:84%
from having worked
at Homeland Security

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:16.580 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of harassment there.

00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And at the night that she
had her first session, a lot

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:22.918 align:middle line:84%
you have nightmares
about the job.

00:29:22.918 --> 00:29:24.460 align:middle line:84%
And I said, this is
going to come up.

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:27.610 align:middle line:84%
It's going to release it out of
your cell memory and come up.

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:29.680 align:middle line:90%
So I used water sounds with her.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And I have another talk that
I did to the fire department.

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And one of the firefighters
came up to me afterwards

00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:38.680 align:middle line:84%
and he said, that
is so interesting

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:42.250 align:middle line:84%
to hear that water
sounds help PTSD

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:47.090 align:middle line:84%
because my father was in
World War II, I think he said.

00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And he said, after I got a
fountain put in my backyard,

00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:53.240 align:middle line:84%
he was over often, and he just
loved to sit by the fountain.

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:54.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:54.910 align:middle line:90%
So there it was.

00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:57.100 align:middle line:84%
He knew naturally
what was good for him.

00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:00.340 align:middle line:90%
And what about depression?

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:03.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: I like to use harp
music in the Egg for depression.

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And there's certain
specific light colors

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:08.410 align:middle line:90%
also for depression.

00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:11.500 align:middle line:84%
And so I really like for
depression to use harp music.

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:14.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What colors do
you use for depression?

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: Well, you don't
want to use blues.

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:16.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: Because it will
make you more depressed.

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:19.967 align:middle line:84%
So oranges and yellows and
bright colors and greens.

00:30:19.967 --> 00:30:20.767 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:20.767 --> 00:30:22.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And like fuchsia pink.

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:22.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Yeah.

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:23.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And all.

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:23.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:24.640 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:28.480 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed Steven Ross
a few times, between my site

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:29.650 align:middle line:90%
and between Gaia.

00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:31.210 align:middle line:90%
And I just I adore his work.

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:34.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, he has one of the
original dinshaw machines,

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:36.760 align:middle line:90%
original color healing.

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:39.180 align:middle line:90%
And he understands it like us.

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:41.680 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when I was obsessed
with color reading those books,

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:43.070 align:middle line:90%
he was at the same time.

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:45.550 align:middle line:84%
We were on the same
hunt for the same books

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:47.290 align:middle line:84%
and the same
interviews with people

00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:49.390 align:middle line:90%
30 some years ago on color.

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And he has a system for
a low-tech version, where

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:59.890 align:middle line:84%
you can use just a light, like
a theater light on a tripod

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:01.313 align:middle line:90%
and put the gels in.

00:31:01.313 --> 00:31:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And you can do a little color
therapy on yourself at home.

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:04.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Yes.

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that takes care
of the color part for someone

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:07.723 align:middle line:90%
who can't get to a center.

00:31:07.723 --> 00:31:11.860 align:middle line:84%
You can still kind of play
a little harp for yourself

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:15.010 align:middle line:84%
and lie under a fuchsia
light or something

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:17.300 align:middle line:84%
to bring your spirits
up and that works, too.

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:20.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: You can get those lamps
that you can bend the arm.

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:21.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you can.

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:23.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: Just lie under it
and listen to some music.

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:24.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.650 align:middle line:84%
So that's important to
know that we don't--

00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:29.620 align:middle line:84%
if someone can't make it to
one of the centers, no problem.

00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:31.780 align:middle line:84%
Just start rigging up
what you can on your own.

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:34.240 align:middle line:84%
Don't not take
advantage of sound

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:35.740 align:middle line:84%
and light just
because you can't get

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:36.950 align:middle line:90%
to some high-end technology.

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:37.750 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:39.310 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to cancer.

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:40.590 align:middle line:90%
We just talked about it.

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:41.390 align:middle line:90%
We know for one--

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:41.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: So can I just--

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:42.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Violin.

00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:44.500 align:middle line:10%
>>LYNN: Can I say that Steve
came to the Sedona center

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:47.258 align:middle line:10%
when I was training,
the Sedona center.

00:31:47.258 --> 00:31:49.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I just talked
to him a couple days ago.

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:50.530 align:middle line:90%
We hadn't talked about that.

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:51.010 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:51.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: He did.

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:52.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: And he doesn't
really have any illnesses.

00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:54.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:55.500 align:middle line:90%
He's very healthy.

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:57.968 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: He just walked in
the room and was like, wow.

00:31:57.968 --> 00:31:59.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Did he love it?

00:31:59.010 --> 00:31:59.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Oh, yeah.

00:31:59.400 --> 00:31:59.800 align:middle line:90%
It was great.

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:01.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I'm sure he did.

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:03.280 align:middle line:84%
We're doing some
events together too,

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:09.050 align:middle line:84%
just talking about the history
of sound and color healing

00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:10.190 align:middle line:90%
in particular.

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:13.370 align:middle line:84%
Because it's time-- I
think, like you and like he,

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:17.630 align:middle line:84%
it's time to bring these very
organic, natural, non-invasive,

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:21.350 align:middle line:84%
beautiful technologies back to
start combating chronic disease

00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:22.605 align:middle line:90%
because medicine is failing.

00:32:22.605 --> 00:32:23.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Right, right.

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:24.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Period.

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:24.520 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:25.548 align:middle line:90%
Autoimmune problems.

00:32:25.548 --> 00:32:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: So, do you want
to go back to the cancer?

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:28.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:28.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:30.708 align:middle line:84%
Is there something besides the
violins you find that works?

00:32:30.708 --> 00:32:32.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: So, piano.

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:35.360 align:middle line:84%
Because I actually
thought that cancer--

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.830 align:middle line:84%
for a long time I thought
cancer was a viral load.

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:40.850 align:middle line:90%
So the cancer cells eat--

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:41.750 align:middle line:90%
they eat each other.

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:44.570 align:middle line:84%
They eat and then they
defecate and then they

00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:46.700 align:middle line:84%
eat that, and then
eventually, I thought maybe

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:48.920 align:middle line:84%
that was what was
turning to cancer.

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:51.890 align:middle line:84%
I had a doctor come in from
San Antonio, and she said,

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:54.652 align:middle line:84%
Gail, really, you're
not going deep enough.

00:32:54.652 --> 00:32:55.860 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what do you mean?

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And she said, if you go deeper,
why didn't the body fight off

00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:00.485 align:middle line:90%
that cancer?

00:33:00.485 --> 00:33:01.610 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, I don't know.

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:03.110 align:middle line:90%
She said, at the root--

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:07.670 align:middle line:84%
28 years she's been
working with cancer people.

00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:11.420 align:middle line:84%
She said, it's heavy
metals at the root.

00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
thinking about it.

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, Candida binds
to heavy metals, and so

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:19.160 align:middle line:90%
a fungus in the body.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And the body can't
get rid of the fungus

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:23.450 align:middle line:84%
because it has heavy metals,
so they're binding together.

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:25.950 align:middle line:84%
It's almost-- it has to
be a two-fold process.

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:26.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yikes.

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:29.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: So I do
antiviral protocols,

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:31.520 align:middle line:84%
and there are
frequencies for making

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:33.300 align:middle line:90%
viruses very uncomfortable.

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:37.960 align:middle line:84%
So we'll treat chronic
Lyme with the frequencies.

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And because you're inside of
a whole body healing system,

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:45.530 align:middle line:84%
the Lyme doesn't have
anywhere to move.

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:48.200 align:middle line:84%
Microcurrent-- people have used
microcurrent on their wrist

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:49.010 align:middle line:90%
because their wrist hurts.

00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:50.052 align:middle line:90%
It moves to the shoulder.

00:33:50.052 --> 00:33:52.700 align:middle line:84%
You put it on their shoulder,
it moves to the knees.

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:55.080 align:middle line:84%
So when we put them
in the Harmonic Egg,

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:57.380 align:middle line:84%
it's working on all
the body's systems

00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:59.540 align:middle line:90%
inside of a resonant chamber.

00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:02.960 align:middle line:84%
The Lyme gets very upset,
and people will sometimes

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:07.010 align:middle line:84%
have more symptoms because the
Lyme is fighting for its life.

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:07.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:12.469 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: So we'll do heavy
metals and antiviral protocols

00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:13.370 align:middle line:90%
for cancer.

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:15.949 align:middle line:90%
And we don't put that out there.

00:34:15.949 --> 00:34:17.270 align:middle line:90%
I don't market.

00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:18.830 align:middle line:90%
I don't make any claims.

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:21.679 align:middle line:84%
I just help the people and
educate the people as they

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:23.900 align:middle line:90%
come in and they find us.

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:25.610 align:middle line:90%
So it's really interesting.

00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:28.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What were your
triggering in my thought is

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:30.290 align:middle line:90%
this--

00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:35.330 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Klinghardt talks about
the effects of heavy metals

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:39.260 align:middle line:84%
on the body and on
the autoimmune system.

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:41.960 align:middle line:84%
He said that his American--
he's from Germany--

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:45.050 align:middle line:84%
that his American
clients have something

00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:50.929 align:middle line:84%
like 100 times the level
of aluminum in their bodies

00:34:50.929 --> 00:34:52.940 align:middle line:90%
that his clients in Europe have.

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And I started
thinking about that.

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:58.500 align:middle line:84%
Because, again, if you start
looking to other topics,

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:00.830 align:middle line:84%
such as chem trails,
which I recently

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:03.800 align:middle line:84%
did a story that expanded it
out when we learned that they

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:09.320 align:middle line:84%
changed the commercial jet
fuel composition so that it has

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:14.030 align:middle line:84%
essentially the same ingredients
as what chem trails have,

00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:15.780 align:middle line:90%
the military version.

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And we've got
hundreds of thousands

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.940 align:middle line:84%
of flights
criss-crossing our skies.

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And so that fallout from the
aluminum and all the fuel--

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.840 align:middle line:84%
not just chem trails,
contrails, what

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:29.330 align:middle line:84%
are called contrails
from normal aircraft

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:31.030 align:middle line:90%
contain all the same stuff.

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And the primary
constituent that is

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:36.470 align:middle line:84%
found being found in
toxic levels in our bodies

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:38.108 align:middle line:90%
is aluminum.

00:35:38.108 --> 00:35:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And you've got strontium,
barium, and other things too.

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:44.360 align:middle line:84%
But aluminum is devastating
to the nervous system,

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:45.780 align:middle line:90%
to the brain.

00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:46.580 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:47.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Yeah.

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And then when we get
stressed out and angry,

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:52.100 align:middle line:84%
those metals heat
up in our brain,

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:55.520 align:middle line:84%
and then they start killing
off the brain cells.

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:56.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:56.660 --> 00:36:01.070 align:middle line:84%
So really, it's turning out
that heavy metal toxicity

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:04.880 align:middle line:84%
is one of your
culprits that's linking

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:06.870 align:middle line:84%
a lot of these chronic
diseases together.

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:07.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Right.

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:09.295 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so I
just brought that up

00:36:09.295 --> 00:36:12.200 align:middle line:84%
because we're all exposed
to so much of it now.

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.800 align:middle line:90%
So it's in the crops.

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:14.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Yeah.

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:16.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can
eat organically,

00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:18.740 align:middle line:84%
but I bet you, if
you were to have

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:21.440 align:middle line:84%
labs done on a lot of
even organic crops grown,

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:24.802 align:middle line:84%
if they're grown under the
open skies not in a hothouse,

00:36:24.802 --> 00:36:26.510 align:middle line:84%
they're going to have
some kind of metals

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:28.010 align:middle line:84%
build up in them
because of what's being

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:29.420 align:middle line:90%
dumped from the sky every day.

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:31.295 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: Well, someone
brought to my attention

00:36:31.295 --> 00:36:33.260 align:middle line:84%
then all the lights
in Las Vegas have

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:35.480 align:middle line:84%
created to have a
heavy metal mercury

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:41.250 align:middle line:84%
toxicity in a very large
radius for the people.

00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And it makes sense, but
I didn't think about it.

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:44.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:44.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:46.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, I just want to
bring that up because I

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:48.045 align:middle line:90%
think this is really important.

00:36:48.045 --> 00:36:48.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Right, right.

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:52.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's drumming
to break up the heavy metals.

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:55.945 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: And so I created some
pieces of music with a musician

00:36:55.945 --> 00:36:58.070 align:middle line:84%
because I wanted to have
some intellectual property

00:36:58.070 --> 00:36:59.870 align:middle line:90%
for the Harmonic Egg.

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:02.000 align:middle line:90%
And I asked these musicians--

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.790 align:middle line:84%
I said, I really feel like
disease be narrowed down

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:06.230 align:middle line:90%
to five things--

00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:09.950 align:middle line:84%
heavy metals,
stress, fatty liver,

00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:14.430 align:middle line:84%
an autoimmune or immunity
issue, and inflammation.

00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:17.000 align:middle line:84%
So we created pieces
for each of those

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.690 align:middle line:84%
with the instruments
and color intentions.

00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And we worked with a
Chinese medicine doctor

00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:29.300 align:middle line:84%
to tell us which-- like the
guitar is a wood element.

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:30.740 align:middle line:90%
Didgeridoo is an earth element.

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And we have medical
notes for it.

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:32.930 align:middle line:90%
It was a really fun project.

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:34.513 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So is that
just part of like

00:37:34.513 --> 00:37:37.100 align:middle line:84%
an autoimmune suite of
music, or what would it

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:38.985 align:middle line:90%
be under each condition?

00:37:38.985 --> 00:37:40.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: Each
different condition.

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:40.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:42.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: So there's six tracks,
and the last one we did

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:44.450 align:middle line:84%
was kid sanctuary,
because it came through

00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:46.670 align:middle line:90%
for working with autism.

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:47.880 align:middle line:90%
And then dogs.

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:48.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:51.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: Because dogs have
such as sensitive little soul

00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:55.220 align:middle line:84%
that you don't want to play
drumming and piano and flute

00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:57.150 align:middle line:84%
and trumpet and
everything for them.

00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:59.840 align:middle line:84%
So this one is just flute
and water and birds.

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:00.700 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:02.117 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh,
that's so beautiful.

00:38:02.117 --> 00:38:03.702 align:middle line:90%
I want to try that one.

00:38:03.702 --> 00:38:06.410 align:middle line:90%
Now, heart conditions.

00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:07.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Yeah.

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:09.340 align:middle line:84%
So heart conditions
are interesting.

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:12.230 align:middle line:84%
It depends-- they
could be emotional.

00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:16.890 align:middle line:84%
So my boyfriend had-- and who
knows how the story goes--

00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:20.630 align:middle line:84%
but he had a heart attack after
he lost his wife about 13 years

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:22.740 align:middle line:90%
ago, the love of his life.

00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And they said 40%
of his heart died.

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And so, he's been
doing sessions.

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:29.650 align:middle line:84%
We've been together
about five years,

00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:30.942 align:middle line:90%
and he has been doing sessions.

00:38:30.942 --> 00:38:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And he had a pacemaker
put in, and he had

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:35.540 align:middle line:90%
to have the battery replaced.

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:39.090 align:middle line:84%
So one of my medical doctors,
who's a really good client,

00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:40.850 align:middle line:84%
he said, get me
his cardiac output

00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:42.950 align:middle line:84%
and his ejection
fraction number and I'll

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:45.960 align:middle line:84%
tell you how much of
his heart is still dead.

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:47.210 align:middle line:90%
And so I gave him the numbers.

00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:48.350 align:middle line:90%
He looked at them.

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:50.510 align:middle line:84%
He looked at me, he looked
at them, and he said,

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:51.680 align:middle line:90%
these are his numbers?

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:52.820 align:middle line:90%
I said, yes.

00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:55.820 align:middle line:84%
He said, this is a perfectly
normal-functioning heart.

00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:58.135 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing dead.

00:38:58.135 --> 00:39:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And so we really tried to
get the records released.

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:04.220 align:middle line:84%
We had a stack of paperwork that
we never found the old numbers.

00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:05.450 align:middle line:90%
So who knows?

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:07.520 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's
really interesting

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:10.565 align:middle line:84%
that it appears that possibly
it could have regenerated--

00:39:10.565 --> 00:39:11.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Grown new tissue.

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:12.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:14.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: We know our
organs can regenerate.

00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:16.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And which
instruments work for heart?

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:17.830 align:middle line:90%
For our home users?

00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:19.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: I would
say piano is great.

00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:20.210 align:middle line:90%
Harp is great.

00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:21.550 align:middle line:90%
Think about the heart strings.

00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:25.310 align:middle line:90%
Guitar, cello, violin.

00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:26.600 align:middle line:90%
The heart strings.

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:27.890 align:middle line:90%
And then green light.

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And I love green light, and I
love pink light for the heart.

00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:34.790 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems that the
back of our chakra system

00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:38.360 align:middle line:84%
has different colors than the
front of our chakra system.

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:40.463 align:middle line:84%
So Cindy Dale has a
lot of work on that.

00:39:40.463 --> 00:39:42.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I just interviewed
her not long ago.

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:42.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Really?

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:42.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:43.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: She's great.

00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:45.725 align:middle line:84%
And so pink for the
back of the heart,

00:39:45.725 --> 00:39:46.850 align:middle line:90%
chakra green for the front.

00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:47.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For the front.

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:48.993 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: So I use a lot of piano.

00:39:48.993 --> 00:39:51.680 align:middle line:84%
But if you think about it,
the autonomic nervous system

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.472 align:middle line:84%
is connected to all
the organs in our body.

00:39:53.472 --> 00:39:54.272 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:54.272 --> 00:39:56.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: So piano will
work for the organs.

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:56.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:58.130 align:middle line:90%
absolutely.

00:39:58.130 --> 00:40:00.447 align:middle line:90%
What about addictions?

00:40:00.447 --> 00:40:02.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: So addictions
are interesting.

00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:02.997 align:middle line:90%
You know Ani Williams--

00:40:02.997 --> 00:40:03.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I do.

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:04.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: And Ani Williams is--

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:05.758 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Such a small world.

00:40:05.758 --> 00:40:06.675 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: I know, right?

00:40:06.675 --> 00:40:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know her from
Sedona for almost 20 years.

00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:09.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Right?

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And so I took her class
on voice analysis.

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And very often, addictions
can be heavy metals.

00:40:16.850 --> 00:40:18.140 align:middle line:90%
So drumming.

00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:21.740 align:middle line:84%
But it can be missing
a tone in your voice.

00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:24.410 align:middle line:84%
So she teaches people
how to listen to a voice,

00:40:24.410 --> 00:40:27.480 align:middle line:84%
like Sherry Edwards, who
has a gift of doing it.

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.943 align:middle line:84%
I do it with a digital
tuner and a microphone.

00:40:29.943 --> 00:40:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And I can see what
tones you're missing.

00:40:31.610 --> 00:40:33.735 align:middle line:84%
And I'm often finding that
with addictions, they're

00:40:33.735 --> 00:40:36.560 align:middle line:84%
missing the tone of
G or the tone of B.

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And you can replenish those
tones with Ani's music

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:44.410 align:middle line:84%
or toning music and bring
that back into balance.

00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:45.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Color?

00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:46.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Color.

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:48.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think that may be
all over the map because of so

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:49.723 align:middle line:90%
many different addictions.

00:40:49.723 --> 00:40:50.523 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:50.523 --> 00:40:52.760 align:middle line:84%
What about weight issues,
which almost always

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:57.730 align:middle line:84%
has some kind of subliminal,
subconscious, emotional issues?

00:40:57.730 --> 00:41:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: With weight
issues, I find drumming.

00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:04.340 align:middle line:84%
You have to penetrate the
density of all these organs,

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:07.550 align:middle line:84%
drumming or low
vibrational instruments--

00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:12.590 align:middle line:84%
a tuba or a bassoon or a
deep bass would be a great--

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:14.778 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you have
any Indian-like tabla?

00:41:14.778 --> 00:41:16.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Like a Native American?

00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:16.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:18.150 align:middle line:90%
Really deep drums.

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Yeah.

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:19.035 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I love those.

00:41:19.035 --> 00:41:19.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Absolutely.

00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:20.180 align:middle line:90%
Rhythmic drumming too.

00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:20.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Love it.

00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:21.487 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:21.487 --> 00:41:23.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: But, what
I've found is, there

00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:25.580 align:middle line:84%
is a correlation to
people who are not

00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:28.420 align:middle line:84%
able to lose weight
and a fatty liver.

00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:29.475 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:41:29.475 --> 00:41:31.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: So we're
actually seeing people

00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:35.720 align:middle line:84%
with cirrhosis of the liver
who never had a drink.

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:36.860 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of an epidemic.

00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:38.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:41.930 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed Dr.
Donese Worden and she's

00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:45.770 align:middle line:84%
working with that and also
homeopathics and sound.

00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And they're having great
success because it's

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:51.890 align:middle line:84%
people who are not
necessarily overweight,

00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:54.320 align:middle line:84%
who don't drink even
that are finding they're

00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:56.120 align:middle line:90%
having cirrhosis of the liver.

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: And is that in
our environment maybe?

00:41:58.100 --> 00:41:59.058 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I don't know.

00:41:59.058 --> 00:42:00.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Something's going on.

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:02.420 align:middle line:84%
But then the Keto
diet-- and I don't

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:03.768 align:middle line:90%
want to criticize any diet.

00:42:03.768 --> 00:42:04.810 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe in diets.

00:42:04.810 --> 00:42:06.010 align:middle line:90%
I believe in lifestyles.

00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:08.800 align:middle line:84%
I like the Mediterranean
diet, but the Keto diet,

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:12.430 align:middle line:84%
when people are eating
all the animal proteins,

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:13.540 align:middle line:90%
I think they're all fats.

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:15.010 align:middle line:90%
So we've created a fatty--

00:42:15.010 --> 00:42:18.700 align:middle line:84%
even avocados are, even as
good of a fat as they are

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:20.530 align:middle line:84%
can still contribute
to the fatty liver

00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:22.840 align:middle line:90%
if your liver is fatty.

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:24.970 align:middle line:84%
So I've actually help
people with flute music

00:42:24.970 --> 00:42:27.947 align:middle line:84%
to work on the liver and
drumming music for weight loss.

00:42:27.947 --> 00:42:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And we actually have
a sound selection

00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:32.030 align:middle line:84%
with drumming and flute and
Native American-- it's so nice.

00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:32.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:33.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:34.660 align:middle line:90%
That's so cool.

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:35.460 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:38.590 align:middle line:84%
So that kind of gets us
through the primer for anyone

00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:41.320 align:middle line:84%
who wants to do a little home
application of color and sound

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:42.120 align:middle line:90%
therapy.

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:44.200 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate
your doing that for us.

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:45.245 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Any time.

00:42:45.245 --> 00:42:47.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I wanted to talk
about the subject of music

00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:49.990 align:middle line:84%
in general, because I
like looking sometimes

00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:53.920 align:middle line:90%
at the meta position on it.

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And Zeus and I talk about this
a lot, about eras of music

00:42:58.510 --> 00:43:01.170 align:middle line:84%
that we're just on a
soul level drawn to

00:43:01.170 --> 00:43:05.590 align:middle line:84%
and what the effects are on
us emotionally or mentally

00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:06.640 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And we're living in a time where
there is no overtone, shall

00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:15.500 align:middle line:90%
we say, in the Western world.

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:16.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Right.

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There isn't
anything consistent.

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:20.900 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of whatever goes.

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:21.700 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't matter.

00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:23.910 align:middle line:84%
It's whatever goes in
every area of life and it

00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:28.000 align:middle line:84%
doesn't-- fashion, music,
culture, all of it.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:28.930 align:middle line:90%
Entertainment.

00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:30.790 align:middle line:84%
So we're in an anything
goes time right now,

00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:32.707 align:middle line:84%
but I want to take the
time leading up to it--

00:43:32.707 --> 00:43:35.470 align:middle line:84%
even starting with
the '20s and '30s.

00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:37.810 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the effects of music

00:43:37.810 --> 00:43:39.190 align:middle line:90%
on culture in that day.

00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And we're speaking
specifically about the West,

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:45.470 align:middle line:84%
because Eastern tones
are very, very different

00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:47.080 align:middle line:84%
and have their own
effects, sometimes

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:49.603 align:middle line:84%
in a higher, more
sophisticated level even.

00:43:49.603 --> 00:43:51.520 align:middle line:84%
But in the West, we're
not familiar with them,

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:52.870 align:middle line:84%
so we're going
with Western music.

00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:53.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Right.

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think the Western music
corrupted the Eastern people

00:43:58.890 --> 00:44:02.200 align:middle line:84%
in probably the 1600s, from
what I've been reading.

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Because way back when, the
Eastern people, the emperors

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:08.770 align:middle line:84%
would go out into the towns
and listen to the tones.

00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And if they weren't the
cosmic vibrations or tones,

00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:15.940 align:middle line:84%
they would send
musicians in to retone.

00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:19.240 align:middle line:84%
And I have been reading that
once the Western musicians went

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:23.298 align:middle line:90%
over to the East, it trashed--

00:44:23.298 --> 00:44:25.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It had a more
sophisticated scale

00:44:25.090 --> 00:44:25.900 align:middle line:90%
than what we had.

00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:26.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Exactly.

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:27.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:29.473 align:middle line:84%
So let's just start
back 100 years ago.

00:44:29.473 --> 00:44:30.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Right, right, right.

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:33.430 align:middle line:84%
So I say that '20s and
'30s and '40s music--

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:35.260 align:middle line:90%
this is just my opinion--

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:39.380 align:middle line:84%
it seemed to have its
own special genre.

00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:43.900 align:middle line:10%
Then it was '50s and '60s, and
that's where I resonate with.

00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And then '70s seemed to
have its own special piece.

00:44:48.850 --> 00:44:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And then '80s, it
seems like that's

00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:55.120 align:middle line:84%
when we started to
get more vulgar,

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:59.200 align:middle line:84%
and I don't want to say in
less loving, less peace.

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And it feels like that
has maybe molded society.

00:45:03.850 --> 00:45:05.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To be more careless.

00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:06.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Yeah.

00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:09.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you see it also--

00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:10.960 align:middle line:84%
my sister and I were
talking this morning,

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:15.610 align:middle line:84%
kind of joking about the
shows that we were raised on--

00:45:15.610 --> 00:45:19.540 align:middle line:84%
things like "Father Knows
Best" and "Leave It to Beaver"

00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:24.550 align:middle line:84%
and "The Andy Griffith Show,"
where you had the strong,

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:27.490 align:middle line:84%
patriarchal male, and there was
always a good lesson between he

00:45:27.490 --> 00:45:29.380 align:middle line:84%
and his son-- never
the daughter--

00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:32.200 align:middle line:84%
just he and his son, whether
it's Opie or whomever.

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:34.990 align:middle line:84%
There's a good life lesson and
some good ethics and morals

00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:37.780 align:middle line:84%
to be taken away from
each week's program.

00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And the wife would serve
cookies with her pearls on.

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:48.040 align:middle line:84%
Or if it was "I
Love Lucy," she was

00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:51.260 align:middle line:84%
the nutty one who Ricky Ricardo
would always have to save.

00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:52.060 align:middle line:90%
Oh, Ricky.

00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:52.935 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Right, right.

00:45:52.935 --> 00:45:59.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so my
generation came from that

00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:00.920 align:middle line:90%
as our influence.

00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:03.070 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, it
came from an influence

00:46:03.070 --> 00:46:05.710 align:middle line:90%
of really sweet love songs.

00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:06.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Right, right.

00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:08.523 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The worst
thing was a broken

00:46:08.523 --> 00:46:12.430 align:middle line:84%
heart or maybe someone died
and you miss them so terribly.

00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:13.990 align:middle line:90%
And so it was all about--

00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:17.560 align:middle line:84%
really, it was almost all about
love, the '50s and '60s music,

00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:19.530 align:middle line:84%
til started going
a little more--

00:46:19.530 --> 00:46:21.520 align:middle line:84%
once the Rolling Stones
and such came along

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:24.610 align:middle line:84%
and drugs were introduced and
Jim Morrison and all that,

00:46:24.610 --> 00:46:25.960 align:middle line:90%
going other directions.

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:29.170 align:middle line:84%
But then after that, it
seems like a lot of the music

00:46:29.170 --> 00:46:33.440 align:middle line:84%
started developing more minor
keys rather than majors.

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the music of
the '50s and '60s, even

00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:38.890 align:middle line:84%
the '20s and '30s was
based on major keys--

00:46:38.890 --> 00:46:42.030 align:middle line:90%
big band era and so forth.

00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:43.720 align:middle line:84%
And then it's
always interesting,

00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:46.510 align:middle line:84%
like life to float
between majors and minors.

00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:51.160 align:middle line:84%
But when you're getting kind of
really contrasty, disharmonic,

00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:56.740 align:middle line:84%
lots of minor keys, that's
doing something to our brains.

00:46:56.740 --> 00:47:02.540 align:middle line:84%
It's doing something to our
hearts, our emotional behavior.

00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I think it's very
important what you expose

00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:08.200 align:middle line:90%
yourself to in terms of music.

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:09.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Yeah.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, Mick Jagger,
I just read a piece

00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:15.090 align:middle line:84%
where he said that they
know as musicians what

00:47:15.090 --> 00:47:17.620 align:middle line:90%
tones to play to cause a riot.

00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:18.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:19.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: And they don't care.

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:20.470 align:middle line:90%
They said they do it on purpose.

00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:21.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:24.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: And apparently, there
were some deaths at a riot--

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:26.550 align:middle line:84%
one of their concerts-- and
they got called into court

00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:27.350 align:middle line:90%
and didn't show up.

00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:30.180 align:middle line:90%


00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:32.637 align:middle line:84%
It was a situation
where he would

00:47:32.637 --> 00:47:35.220 align:middle line:84%
have been able to identify the
murderers of some of the people

00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:36.610 align:middle line:90%
who died.

00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:37.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:41.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: And then some kids
were putting soft eggs--

00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:44.160 align:middle line:84%
so I don't know if they
were raw or soft boiled--

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:45.200 align:middle line:90%
on the stages.

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And by the middle of the
concert, they were hard boiled.

00:47:48.450 --> 00:47:50.040 align:middle line:84%
What is that doing
to our brains?

00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:51.780 align:middle line:84%
What would that be
doing to our organs,

00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:52.990 align:middle line:90%
just like you're saying.

00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:53.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:56.270 align:middle line:84%
We're using frequencies
irresponsibly.

00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And that leads us to this
part of the conversation,

00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:03.750 align:middle line:84%
the takeaway part here, of using
frequency irresponsibly-- even

00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:05.682 align:middle line:90%
beautiful frequencies.

00:48:05.682 --> 00:48:07.140 align:middle line:84%
Now a lot of people
watching this--

00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:08.130 align:middle line:90%
I've done it in the past.

00:48:08.130 --> 00:48:09.588 align:middle line:84%
You're so excited
about new things,

00:48:09.588 --> 00:48:10.880 align:middle line:90%
you want try everything.

00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And so you'll be doing three
or four different things

00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:13.970 align:middle line:90%
at one time.

00:48:13.970 --> 00:48:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And you say, gosh,
it's not working.

00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:16.470 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:21.780 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about being overly
eager to involve ourselves

00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:25.130 align:middle line:90%
in energy healing in general.

00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:27.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: So over the 10 years
that I've been doing this now,

00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:30.820 align:middle line:84%
I have seen a lot,
and I have done a lot,

00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:32.980 align:middle line:84%
and I have really
messed myself up.

00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:35.340 align:middle line:84%
So one of the
messages that I would

00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:38.160 align:middle line:84%
like to talk to people
about is, too much

00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:41.310 align:middle line:90%
energy work can poison you.

00:48:41.310 --> 00:48:43.142 align:middle line:84%
Too much of a good
thing is never great.

00:48:43.142 --> 00:48:44.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Can be a bad thing.

00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:45.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Right, right.

00:48:45.450 --> 00:48:48.580 align:middle line:84%
So I tell people,
after the Harmonic Egg

00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:54.300 align:middle line:84%
sessions, five to seven days, do
not receive other energy work.

00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:56.670 align:middle line:90%
60% of my clients are healers.

00:48:56.670 --> 00:48:59.630 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, they are
going to be giving.

00:48:59.630 --> 00:49:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And so I say, it's
receiving the energy work.

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And so to have them
receive other energy work,

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:09.420 align:middle line:84%
you're just arm wrestling
with the energies

00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:12.415 align:middle line:84%
that you just utilized
in the Harmonic Egg.

00:49:12.415 --> 00:49:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And if somebody were
to call the center

00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:15.960 align:middle line:84%
and say, I just did
acupuncture yesterday,

00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:18.150 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, ask
your acupuncturist

00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:21.520 align:middle line:84%
how many days to let that
integrate before you do this.

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Because A, you're wasting
your money and B, why would

00:49:24.210 --> 00:49:26.910 align:middle line:84%
you want to just pile on
one thing on top of another.

00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:32.580 align:middle line:84%
So it's an analogy too of
the lower vibrational--

00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:36.480 align:middle line:84%
we went to-- my sister and
I went to a medium on Friday

00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:37.610 align:middle line:90%
night.

00:49:37.610 --> 00:49:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And in her paperwork,
she says, I

00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:44.970 align:middle line:84%
don't eat two hours
before a reading

00:49:44.970 --> 00:49:47.670 align:middle line:84%
because I want to be able
to tap into the spirits

00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:50.220 align:middle line:90%
and not be digesting my food.

00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And she said, the
day of readings,

00:49:52.650 --> 00:49:56.820 align:middle line:84%
she will eat light, not a
lot of low vibrational foods,

00:49:56.820 --> 00:50:00.540 align:middle line:84%
like a heavy cheeseburger
or fettuccine Alfredo.

00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And yet, these
healers have to eat.

00:50:04.690 --> 00:50:07.470 align:middle line:84%
So how do they find that
balance so that they're

00:50:07.470 --> 00:50:14.100 align:middle line:84%
able to work with their clients
and work with the energies

00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:18.130 align:middle line:84%
and keep them on a high
vibration to help the clients?

00:50:18.130 --> 00:50:18.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:18.930 --> 00:50:23.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: So that's the other
thing with Harmonic Egg,

00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.840 align:middle line:84%
you don't want me
working on you.

00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:26.115 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right, right.

00:50:26.115 --> 00:50:27.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: I can't be neutral.

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:28.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean
this is the thing--

00:50:28.830 --> 00:50:30.480 align:middle line:84%
when you have humans
working on you,

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:35.100 align:middle line:84%
we're on one hand part of
what this time in history

00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:39.060 align:middle line:84%
is about is for us to understand
our innate capabilities,

00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:43.320 align:middle line:84%
our innate powerful energies,
our innate powerful minds,

00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:46.740 align:middle line:84%
and reclaim ourselves
so that we can

00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:48.455 align:middle line:90%
have power in our own lives.

00:50:48.455 --> 00:50:49.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Right, right.

00:50:49.330 --> 00:50:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so we
never to set aside

00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:54.360 align:middle line:84%
the human potential
and the human gift

00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:55.567 align:middle line:90%
of healing one another.

00:50:55.567 --> 00:50:56.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: I love that.

00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:59.517 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But, we're all in the
various stages of development,

00:50:59.517 --> 00:51:00.600 align:middle line:90%
and we all have our stuff.

00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:01.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Right.

00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And so I want people to
digest this energy work

00:51:04.890 --> 00:51:07.770 align:middle line:84%
before doing other energy
work because they'll just

00:51:07.770 --> 00:51:10.850 align:middle line:84%
keep piling stuff into
their energy field.

00:51:10.850 --> 00:51:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And unlike, you eat
a hamburger and you

00:51:13.110 --> 00:51:15.780 align:middle line:84%
feel stuffed and
your stomach is full,

00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:18.510 align:middle line:84%
you don't realize when
your energy field is full

00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:20.450 align:middle line:84%
and you're just piling
more stuff onto it.

00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:20.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:22.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: And so the woman
I spoke about earlier

00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:26.460 align:middle line:84%
with the cancer and the
tumors, she was doing great.

00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:29.000 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see her
for about a year.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And when she came back to
me, she walked in the door,

00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:34.320 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't see her face.

00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:37.540 align:middle line:84%
There was a black
haze around her face.

00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:38.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Energetically.

00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:39.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Right.

00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh my gosh, I'm
rubbing my eyes and thought

00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:44.970 align:middle line:84%
maybe it was a migraine coming
on, because I would lose

00:51:44.970 --> 00:51:46.890 align:middle line:90%
my vision, and it wasn't.

00:51:46.890 --> 00:51:51.205 align:middle line:90%
She was almost wasting away.

00:51:51.205 --> 00:51:52.830 align:middle line:84%
So I asked her what
she had been doing,

00:51:52.830 --> 00:51:54.780 align:middle line:84%
and she said, well, I flew
to Germany and I did this

00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:57.155 align:middle line:84%
and I flew to Mexico and I
did this and I went to Oregon.

00:51:57.155 --> 00:51:58.650 align:middle line:90%
I went to Kansas, and I went--

00:51:58.650 --> 00:52:03.650 align:middle line:84%
and she piled so many things
on to try to prevent--

00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:05.710 align:middle line:84%
keep the cancer
from coming back,

00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:09.040 align:middle line:84%
because these people sometimes
get desperate and in fear.

00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And so in that fear,
they do too much.

00:52:12.070 --> 00:52:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And so I feel like she spend
her energy out of control.

00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't know
what to say to her.

00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:21.610 align:middle line:84%
And she, said go ask the
medical intuitive what he sees.

00:52:21.610 --> 00:52:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And I left her in
the room alone.

00:52:25.690 --> 00:52:26.530 align:middle line:90%
I made a call.

00:52:26.530 --> 00:52:28.790 align:middle line:10%
I came back.

00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And what I was told
was that probably she'd

00:52:30.970 --> 00:52:33.470 align:middle line:90%
be gone in about two weeks.

00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And so she said,
what did he say?

00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And I said, he said probably
don't take that trip to Mexico,

00:52:38.370 --> 00:52:40.270 align:middle line:90%
like go see your grandkids.

00:52:40.270 --> 00:52:42.250 align:middle line:84%
Just take a break
from the healing.

00:52:42.250 --> 00:52:43.870 align:middle line:90%
And she said, oh, OK.

00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:46.780 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't tell her why he said.

00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:48.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's really sad.

00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, of course, you
can't tell a person that--

00:52:52.490 --> 00:52:53.990 align:middle line:90%
and I assume she did pass away.

00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: She did.

00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:55.860 align:middle line:90%
In 12 days.

00:52:55.860 --> 00:52:57.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:52:57.700 --> 00:53:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about it,
it would be no different

00:53:01.690 --> 00:53:06.250 align:middle line:84%
than drug contraindications,
where these drugs are working--

00:53:06.250 --> 00:53:08.450 align:middle line:84%
we know it from a
material point of view,

00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:10.930 align:middle line:84%
if you have all these pills
working against each other.

00:53:10.930 --> 00:53:15.280 align:middle line:10%
I think doctor care is
what, the third highest

00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:18.250 align:middle line:10%
cause of patient death
in the United States is

00:53:18.250 --> 00:53:20.420 align:middle line:10%
and that usually the
drugs they're prescribing.

00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:21.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Right.

00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:23.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not always,
but sometimes.

00:53:23.170 --> 00:53:24.650 align:middle line:90%
A good amount of the time.

00:53:24.650 --> 00:53:26.800 align:middle line:84%
So if we're looking at
it in energetic terms,

00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:28.098 align:middle line:90%
it makes total sense.

00:53:28.098 --> 00:53:30.640 align:middle line:84%
Because if we look at the human
body, there's no there there.

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:31.630 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing there.

00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:33.630 align:middle line:90%
We're nothing but frequencies.

00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:37.900 align:middle line:84%
There's literally almost no
material to anything in here

00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:41.320 align:middle line:90%
that we see on an atomic level.

00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:47.920 align:middle line:84%
It's like looking at the
planets rotating around the sun.

00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:49.690 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're made up of.

00:53:49.690 --> 00:53:51.860 align:middle line:90%
It's all space.

00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking
in another interview

00:53:53.470 --> 00:53:55.030 align:middle line:90%
with Billy Carson about this.

00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:56.740 align:middle line:84%
We can program it
however we wish,

00:53:56.740 --> 00:53:58.780 align:middle line:84%
but it really
drives home for me--

00:53:58.780 --> 00:54:01.480 align:middle line:90%
and I really understand this--

00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:04.420 align:middle line:84%
if it's all space, and the
space is nothing but frequency,

00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:06.730 align:middle line:84%
light, and information,
why would you

00:54:06.730 --> 00:54:10.390 align:middle line:84%
not try to assist in
the balancing of it

00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:13.352 align:middle line:84%
with frequency, light,
and sound-- vibration

00:54:13.352 --> 00:54:14.560 align:middle line:90%
that's the most direct thing.

00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:17.110 align:middle line:84%
To take a pill in
material form to be

00:54:17.110 --> 00:54:19.420 align:middle line:84%
able to induce some of
those effects in a very

00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:21.970 align:middle line:84%
inefficient way is the
least efficient way

00:54:21.970 --> 00:54:25.900 align:middle line:84%
to go about balancing out
imbalances in the body--

00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:27.560 align:middle line:90%
chronic disease, for example.

00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:28.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Right.

00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And all of our
bodies are different.

00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:34.000 align:middle line:84%
So how can we say that
five different meds

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.190 align:middle line:90%
are going to act a certain way?

00:54:36.190 --> 00:54:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Every single person
is different.

00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:39.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's the same
thing with energy healing.

00:54:39.610 --> 00:54:40.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Right.

00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:42.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean you can
a masseuse who's having

00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:44.150 align:middle line:90%
a bad day really mess you up.

00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:46.700 align:middle line:10%
Unfortunately, I've had
that happen a couple times.

00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:47.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Me too.

00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:50.123 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
just don't go back.

00:54:50.123 --> 00:54:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's true even
with your technology.

00:54:51.790 --> 00:54:54.820 align:middle line:84%
If you're using this
technology overlaid with--

00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:57.300 align:middle line:84%
maybe someone else is
like on a spectrum of--

00:54:57.300 --> 00:55:01.670 align:middle line:84%
or a full protocol of,
say, Rife box technology.

00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:02.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Right.

00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:05.053 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's running all
that energy in, and then having

00:55:05.053 --> 00:55:06.370 align:middle line:90%
yours coming in sideways.

00:55:06.370 --> 00:55:08.740 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's a very
important point you make.

00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:11.510 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't help to be
junkies for this stuff.

00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:12.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Right.

00:55:12.310 --> 00:55:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And even my technology
could hurt somebody

00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:17.800 align:middle line:84%
if you're playing the
music inside the Egg,

00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:20.297 align:middle line:90%
over, say 90 decibels.

00:55:20.297 --> 00:55:22.630 align:middle line:84%
Then you're going to throw
someone into fight or flight,

00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:24.970 align:middle line:84%
and that's not
the purpose of it.

00:55:24.970 --> 00:55:25.990 align:middle line:90%
It's for relaxation.

00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:29.050 align:middle line:84%
It's for distressing-- it's
not for stressing you out.

00:55:29.050 --> 00:55:31.720 align:middle line:84%
So all the centers are
trained very specifically not

00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:35.800 align:middle line:84%
to use high sounds, even if
the client says, crank me up.

00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:36.980 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And so I really like
when I meet a healer who

00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:44.410 align:middle line:84%
comes into my office and says,
I have to take the day off today

00:55:44.410 --> 00:55:45.775 align:middle line:90%
because my energy is really bad.

00:55:45.775 --> 00:55:46.575 align:middle line:90%
I need a session.

00:55:46.575 --> 00:55:46.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:48.410 align:middle line:84%
I should know when
to be exposed to.

00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:49.210 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:55:49.210 --> 00:55:50.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Thank so much.

00:55:50.290 --> 00:55:51.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:55:51.090 --> 00:55:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: And I honor them,
and I will squeeze them in--

00:55:53.470 --> 00:55:56.112 align:middle line:84%
I'll even stay after
hours to squeeze them in.

00:55:56.112 --> 00:55:58.570 align:middle line:84%
Because it is their livelihood,
and they're amazing people,

00:55:58.570 --> 00:56:00.695 align:middle line:84%
and they all have this
great intention for healing.

00:56:00.695 --> 00:56:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
are just amazing.

00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:03.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:05.797 align:middle line:10%
>>LYNN: And I love their
energy, but I love it

00:56:05.797 --> 00:56:08.020 align:middle line:10%
when they have that
integrity to say,

00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:11.080 align:middle line:10%
I just don't feel good today
and I can't work on somebody.

00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:12.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So really--

00:56:12.130 --> 00:56:16.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in the end, one of the
beauties of having technology

00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:19.570 align:middle line:84%
interface and not to
supplant human interface,

00:56:19.570 --> 00:56:21.760 align:middle line:84%
because I love human--
nothing is like the hands.

00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:22.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: I love my massages.

00:56:22.930 --> 00:56:23.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Me too.

00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:27.710 align:middle line:84%
So and also with human
intuition and so forth.

00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:30.490 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
about using technology

00:56:30.490 --> 00:56:35.260 align:middle line:84%
is that it's clean,
it's repeatable, right,

00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:37.690 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't
have any influence

00:56:37.690 --> 00:56:39.970 align:middle line:90%
beyond just those frequencies.

00:56:39.970 --> 00:56:40.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Right.

00:56:40.890 --> 00:56:42.850 align:middle line:90%
And that's why I chose wood.

00:56:42.850 --> 00:56:44.320 align:middle line:84%
Everything I've
read about wood, it

00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:45.790 align:middle line:84%
doesn't hold energy
or information.

00:56:45.790 --> 00:56:49.003 align:middle line:84%
There are no crystals in there
because I believe that they

00:56:49.003 --> 00:56:50.170 align:middle line:90%
hold information and energy.

00:56:50.170 --> 00:56:50.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh yeah.

00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:50.860 align:middle line:90%
Amplify it.

00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:51.660 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:52.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Right, right.

00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:53.470 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's so consistent
and repeatable device.

00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:59.080 align:middle line:84%
If I get cut off in
traffic or if I my parents

00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:01.535 align:middle line:84%
passed away
back-to-back in 2017,

00:57:01.535 --> 00:57:03.160 align:middle line:84%
you didn't want me
working on you then.

00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:03.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right

00:57:03.610 --> 00:57:05.318 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: Because you
were going to pick up

00:57:05.318 --> 00:57:07.880 align:middle line:84%
all that sadness and all
my grief and all my anger.

00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And so I was still able
to work by putting people

00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:11.760 align:middle line:90%
into the Harmonic Egg.

00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:12.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:13.670 align:middle line:10%
Right.

00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:16.010 align:middle line:90%
Any final thoughts at all?

00:57:16.010 --> 00:57:17.547 align:middle line:84%
I think we've
covered quite a bit,

00:57:17.547 --> 00:57:19.130 align:middle line:84%
and I think it is
important for people

00:57:19.130 --> 00:57:20.962 align:middle line:84%
to be able to have
power over it at home.

00:57:20.962 --> 00:57:22.670 align:middle line:84%
Think about what we're
exposing ourselves

00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:26.760 align:middle line:84%
to in terms of light bulbs,
even those horrible CFLs.

00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:28.850 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully no one has those
left with that mercury

00:57:28.850 --> 00:57:30.050 align:middle line:90%
and that horrible color.

00:57:30.050 --> 00:57:32.960 align:middle line:84%
But even down to our lighting
in our home, the music

00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:35.738 align:middle line:84%
we listen to before we
fall asleep at night.

00:57:35.738 --> 00:57:37.280 align:middle line:84%
These are all really
important things

00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:38.850 align:middle line:90%
to become consciously aware of.

00:57:38.850 --> 00:57:39.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Right.

00:57:39.650 --> 00:57:40.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:57:40.450 --> 00:57:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And so the next step
is people can take it

00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:46.010 align:middle line:84%
further if they wish to
have a kind of a space age

00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:47.960 align:middle line:90%
experience, which I love.

00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:49.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm on board.

00:57:49.070 --> 00:57:51.590 align:middle line:84%
So any final comments
before we sign off?

00:57:51.590 --> 00:57:54.480 align:middle line:10%
>>LYNN: Well, I so appreciate
you having me here today,

00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:57.360 align:middle line:10%
and I'm hoping that we
provided some good information

00:57:57.360 --> 00:57:58.160 align:middle line:10%
for people.

00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:00.960 align:middle line:84%
Because we can also say that
the colors that you wear--

00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:01.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Matter.

00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:04.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN: The food that
you eat all matter.

00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:07.130 align:middle line:84%
So if you're attracted
to a certain color--

00:58:07.130 --> 00:58:09.560 align:middle line:84%
say yellow-- you
could wear yellows

00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:12.530 align:middle line:84%
in your jewelry, your
clothing, eating.

00:58:12.530 --> 00:58:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And then also putting
yourself under that light.

00:58:15.050 --> 00:58:17.150 align:middle line:84%
So if you're attracted
to something,

00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:19.185 align:middle line:84%
it might be that it's
really what you need.

00:58:19.185 --> 00:58:20.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:21.480 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't agree more.

00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:22.280 align:middle line:90%
And bathe in it.

00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:25.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in our
technological society,

00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:27.410 align:middle line:84%
we tend to wear a lot
of neutrals and a lot

00:58:27.410 --> 00:58:28.378 align:middle line:90%
of black and so forth.

00:58:28.378 --> 00:58:30.920 align:middle line:84%
But there are other ways-- even
if we think it's fashionable,

00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:32.010 align:middle line:90%
looks great on us--

00:58:32.010 --> 00:58:34.490 align:middle line:84%
there are other ways to infuse
that color into our lives

00:58:34.490 --> 00:58:36.190 align:middle line:90%
and our environment around us.

00:58:36.190 --> 00:58:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And even in something
as simple as a candle

00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:40.910 align:middle line:84%
or dishware or whatever,
you can get it in there.

00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:42.023 align:middle line:90%
Accessorize, right?

00:58:42.023 --> 00:58:43.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Right, right, right.

00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:44.200 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:46.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Gail, thank you
so much for your time.

00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:47.570 align:middle line:84%
I love what you're
doing, literally.

00:58:47.570 --> 00:58:48.230 align:middle line:90%
I just love it.

00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:48.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Thank you.

00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:50.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I hope
see you again here.

00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:51.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNN: Thank you.

00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:52.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thanks.

00:58:52.130 --> 00:58:54.080 align:middle line:10%
We can see where
our future is headed

00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:56.600 align:middle line:10%
in the realm of healing--
light, frequency, sound,

00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:57.980 align:middle line:10%
and vibrations.

00:58:57.980 --> 00:59:00.590 align:middle line:10%
The effect of sound healing
has been studied far and wide

00:59:00.590 --> 00:59:03.260 align:middle line:10%
already, and I love that
it's non-invasive, aesthetic,

00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:04.430 align:middle line:10%
and beautiful.
