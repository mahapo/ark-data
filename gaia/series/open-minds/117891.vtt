>>REGINA MEREDITH:
When we see someone

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.220 align:middle line:10%
stressed out or traumatized,
the first thing we instinctively

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.110 align:middle line:10%
say is take a deep breath.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.040 align:middle line:84%
But what's actually going on
during these conscious breaths?

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.260 align:middle line:84%
Anders Olsson, along
with the depths and many

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.240 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient
mysteries and religions,

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.170 align:middle line:84%
has made a deep study
of our breathing

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.290 align:middle line:84%
and believes that our breath
is the basis for the quality

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.820 align:middle line:84%
of our life-- from good
health, to good sex,

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.550 align:middle line:90%
and even enlightenment.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.050 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.210 align:middle line:84%
This is-- I was
saying off-camera

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.650 align:middle line:84%
to someone a little
earlier today

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.530 align:middle line:84%
that, if you had
courses that one

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.050 align:middle line:84%
must have to study
in a lifetime,

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.110 align:middle line:84%
this should be whatever
grade 101, breathing.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to,
right off the top,

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.050 align:middle line:84%
how different would our
world be if we all actually

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.485 align:middle line:90%
used our breath?

00:01:11.485 --> 00:01:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERS OLSSON: That's
a very good question.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.040 align:middle line:10%
I think a person with
good breathing habits,

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.550 align:middle line:10%
that's not a person that
ends up in a lot of conflicts

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.700 align:middle line:10%
or even start wars.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Because we are able to go
down by breathing in and good

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.870 align:middle line:84%
fashion, getting
to our inner core.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And I guess there
is where love is.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.220 align:middle line:84%
So I think we would
have a far better world.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And, actually, in the
word, respiration,

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.720 align:middle line:90%
it means reconnection to spirit.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.267 align:middle line:84%
So just there in the word
you have-- it says something.

00:01:49.267 --> 00:01:49.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.580 align:middle line:84%

energy, very clear skin,

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.420 align:middle line:84%

calm, and relaxed.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.090 align:middle line:84%

you always were.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.950 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: No, that's true.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going
to get into this.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.869 align:middle line:84%
And when you're a kid-- it
was fun reading about this--

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:06.160 align:middle line:90%
you were an uptight little guy.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.570 align:middle line:84%
Time, time, time, everything
had to run on time.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And you were fascinated
with time, in particular.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.000 align:middle line:84%
So tell us a little bit
about how you started in life

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.265 align:middle line:90%
and how this journey came to be.

00:02:17.265 --> 00:02:17.890 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yeah.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.810 align:middle line:84%
I've had a racing mind
since I was a kid.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.780 align:middle line:84%
I tend to think that I
was born in turbo mode.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And let's just say,
about the timing,

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.590 align:middle line:84%
I think that just speeded
up my mind even more.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.030 align:middle line:84%
Timing on my way to
school, or a timing

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.660 align:middle line:84%
even when eating breakfast,
or timing when doing

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.760 align:middle line:90%
sit ups or push ups.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.180 align:middle line:84%
There was always things to
compete for and to improve.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And also, along with
this racing mind, using

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.516 align:middle line:90%
goes along fear, anxiety, worry.

00:02:52.516 --> 00:02:53.890 align:middle line:84%
So I could see,
when I look back,

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.530 align:middle line:84%
that when I was stressed
out those came along,

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.300 align:middle line:84%
as well-- more
fear, more worries.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And of course you
want to improve things

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.310 align:middle line:90%
that you are not happy with.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And I've tried many
things in my life

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.260 align:middle line:90%
to feel better, get better.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And I've improved
the way I exercise.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.430 align:middle line:84%
I exercise in a more
low-intense level.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.960 align:middle line:84%
I've improved my breathing
habits and many other things.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.470 align:middle line:84%
But, by far, the most important
thing I've come across

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.039 align:middle line:84%
is to improve my
breathing habits.

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:30.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It makes total sense.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.845 align:middle line:90%
It drives everything.

00:03:31.845 --> 00:03:33.220 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: It
actually does, yeah.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And if we think about it,
if we want to induce stress

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.470 align:middle line:84%
to our body, one of
the most efficient ways

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.840 align:middle line:84%
is to alter our
breathing pattern.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.510 align:middle line:90%
There are three major things.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.680 align:middle line:84%
Like, breathing
fast and shallow.

be more relaxed,
you will probably

we enter into fight-flight.

So, many of us, for example
when we concentrate,

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.540 align:middle line:90%
we tend to hold our breath.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.870 align:middle line:90%

Let's start somewhere, here.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.345 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I mean, there
are so many books out there--

00:04:48.345 --> 00:04:50.470 align:middle line:84%
there are a number of books
out there on breathing.

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:51.690 align:middle line:90%
Why another one?

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.060 align:middle line:84%
What is it you're
bringing to the table?

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.930 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yes.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.320 align:middle line:84%
When I is started, the
literature available--

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.450 align:middle line:84%
either way, I found it, they
were maybe a bit to technical,

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.460 align:middle line:84%
more addressing the medical
community, or maybe a bit

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.280 align:middle line:90%
too spiritual.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.790 align:middle line:84%
I trained in yoga,
myself, and I think

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.430 align:middle line:84%
it's great with yoga,
for example, or qigong,

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.890 align:middle line:84%
or meditation, where you have
a lot of focus on breathing.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.130 align:middle line:84%
But many people, they
find it kind of awkward,

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.900 align:middle line:84%
or they are not
interested, maybe,

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.290 align:middle line:84%
in sitting in a certain position
or making certain sounds.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.910 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to write something,
just to strip out everything

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.190 align:middle line:90%
except the breathing.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:42.230 align:middle line:84%
What actually is good
breathing habits?

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.760 align:middle line:90%
What is poor breathing habits?

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And what are the reasons
for poor breathing habits?

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And how do I take-- how do I
get from poor to good breathing

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:50.480 align:middle line:90%
habits?

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.021 align:middle line:90%

I have been inspired
a lot by Buteyko.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And he was a Russian
medical doctor

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.380 align:middle line:84%
and professor who
made just the simplest

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.130 align:middle line:90%
discovery in the 1950s.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And after his discovery, he
spent the rest of his life--

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.290 align:middle line:84%
50 years-- in helping people
improve their breathing habits.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And at the time when
he made the discovery,

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:29.887 align:middle line:84%
he had really high blood
pressure-- like 220 times 120.

00:06:29.887 --> 00:06:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.580 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: And at the
time, he was only 29.

>>REGINA MEREDITH: Wow, bad.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: And he knew,
with that being a doctor,

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.630 align:middle line:90%
that this is not good for me.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.710 align:middle line:84%
I will probably just
have a couple of years

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.380 align:middle line:90%
left if I don't change that.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And when he came
across a patient

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:48.600 align:middle line:84%
with high blood pressure
and poor breathing habits,

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.030 align:middle line:84%
Buteyko realized when he
left that, oh, wait a second.

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:57.180 align:middle line:84%
This guy, he had really
high blood pressure.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.920 align:middle line:90%
I have high blood pressure.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And he had poor
breathing habits.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.090 align:middle line:90%
How are my breathing habits?

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is,
Buteyko before,

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.070 align:middle line:84%
when training to
become a doctor,

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:11.400 align:middle line:84%
he had studied many
people on their deathbeds.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.140 align:middle line:84%
He had spent hundreds
of hours and actually

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:16.540 align:middle line:90%
monitoring their breathing.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And he saw the worse
they were feeling--

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.800 align:middle line:84%
the closer they were to their
own death, the more impaired

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.540 align:middle line:90%
their breathing were.

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:30.620 align:middle line:84%
So when he saw this guy, who
reminded him of the people

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.870 align:middle line:84%
on their deathbed, he then
realized that his breathing

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:36.630 align:middle line:90%
habits wasn't good either.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:39.010 align:middle line:84%
So when he started
to improve them,

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:41.490 align:middle line:84%
he started to get
rid of his symptoms.

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:45.920 align:middle line:84%
Because he had kidney
pains and headache,

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.910 align:middle line:84%
and, just within
five minutes is what

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:51.100 align:middle line:84%
they say, that he started
to notice the effect,

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:55.550 align:middle line:84%
when he started to breathe
more deeply and slowly.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:08:00.610 align:middle line:84%
So after his discovery, he went
back to breathing normally,

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:02.740 align:middle line:90%
and then his symptoms came back.

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.380 align:middle line:84%
So, being in a hospital
setting, of course,

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.230 align:middle line:84%
he ran around the
hospital the whole night,

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:11.629 align:middle line:84%
waking up patients and
forcing them, more or less.

00:08:11.629 --> 00:08:14.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Making his clinical
study, right there on the spot.

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:15.336 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yeah, right there.

00:08:15.336 --> 00:08:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And they all confirmed
his findings,

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:20.010 align:middle line:84%
that when they started to
improve their breathing,

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:22.890 align:middle line:84%
they slowly started to
improve their health

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:27.180 align:middle line:84%
and got rid of their
symptoms, or reduced them.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So is there,
generally speaking,

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.700 align:middle line:84%
a direct link between blood
pressure and our breathing.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.539 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know there
are lots of factors,

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:38.490 align:middle line:84%
but do they-- if you were
to distill it-- looking

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:41.400 align:middle line:84%
at the other chemicals in
the blood and the arteries

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.725 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, can it be
distilled back to breathing?

00:08:44.725 --> 00:08:46.600 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: As you say,
there are many factors.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:51.230 align:middle line:84%
But if we just think about
where is our heart located.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.430 align:middle line:90%
Just between the lungs, right?

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:55.310 align:middle line:84%
So there is really
a close connection

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:57.740 align:middle line:90%
between the lungs and the heart.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:02.340 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's called
cardiopulmonary divisions

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:03.720 align:middle line:90%
on the hospital.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:08.220 align:middle line:84%
So if we have impaired
breathing, if we breathe fast,

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:12.180 align:middle line:84%
unrhythmic, tense--
then we most likely

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:17.010 align:middle line:84%
will have a fast,
unrhythmic, tense heart.

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:20.410 align:middle line:90%
So it affects our heart a lot.

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
about breathing

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:26.120 align:middle line:84%
is that we upset the
oxygen-carbon dioxide balance

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.130 align:middle line:84%
when we have poor
breathing habits.

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:29.680 align:middle line:84%
We usually breathe
too much, which

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:34.400 align:middle line:84%
means we inhale too much oxygen,
which we don't have a need for,

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.140 align:middle line:84%
and we exhale too
much carbon dioxide.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And carbon dioxide is produced
all the time in our body

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:45.260 align:middle line:84%
during metabolism and
when we produce energy.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And when we have lower levels
of carbon dioxide, which

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.890 align:middle line:84%
many of us have when we have
impaired breathing habits,

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:59.360 align:middle line:84%
then the positive effects
of carbon dioxide gets lost.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.020 align:middle line:84%
Because we may have
heard that the oxygen,

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.330 align:middle line:90%
yeah, that's the good thing.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:07.730 align:middle line:84%
Carbon dioxide, that that's
the bad guy, the waste gas.

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.790 align:middle line:84%
Just get rid of it, out
of it as soon as possible.

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:15.230 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is it's about
balance, as everything.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:19.820 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is that
carbon dioxide has a widening

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.450 align:middle line:90%
effect of the blood vessels.

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And since we have,
actually, blood vessels that

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.559 align:middle line:84%
can take you two and a half
times around the earth--

00:10:27.559 --> 00:10:28.100 align:middle line:90%
60,000 miles.

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:28.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:29.160 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.965 align:middle line:84%
It's shocking when
you think about it.

00:10:30.965 --> 00:10:31.290 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yeah.

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:32.290 align:middle line:90%
Our body is totally amazing.

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:32.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:34.096 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: So think about it.

00:10:34.096 --> 00:10:37.400 align:middle line:84%
If you have, then, lower levels
of carbon dioxide, these blood

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.130 align:middle line:90%
vessels will be tighter.

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:43.350 align:middle line:84%
So the heart has to work harder
to pump the blood around.

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:47.970 align:middle line:84%
So that makes sense, then, that
we have higher blood pressure

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:49.560 align:middle line:84%
if we have poor
breathing habits.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If we're not
breathing properly,

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:54.960 align:middle line:84%
it totally messes with
our body's ability

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.155 align:middle line:90%
to uptake the oxygen, right?

00:10:57.155 --> 00:10:59.030 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: Yeah, because
that's another effect

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:01.080 align:middle line:90%
of carbon dioxide.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:04.510 align:middle line:84%
It's not only that we
need to take in oxygen,

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:08.810 align:middle line:84%
and we have the blood full
of oxygen. That's not usually

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:10.272 align:middle line:90%
the problem.

00:11:10.272 --> 00:11:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Especially when we
over-breathe, we

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:14.900 align:middle line:84%
have more oxygen in
the blood than we need.

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.840 align:middle line:84%
The problem is,
of course, we want

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.160 align:middle line:84%
the oxygen to leave
the blood and enter

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.720 align:middle line:84%
into our liver, or
muscles, or brain.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And for that to happen,
we need carbon dioxide.

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:29.820 align:middle line:84%
Carbon dioxide kicks out
the oxygen of the blood.

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:31.900 align:middle line:90%
So it makes a lot of sense.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:35.420 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not a coincidence
where the oxygen is delivered.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:39.240 align:middle line:84%
So if I work this muscle,
it needs more oxygen

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.120 align:middle line:84%
here than this muscle,
which is at rest.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And when I work this muscle,
the metabolism increases,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.920 align:middle line:84%
and when it does--
the metabolism is

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:54.490 align:middle line:84%
when oxygen and nutrients
is converted to energy,

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:57.870 align:middle line:84%
and, in that process,
when energy is created,

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:00.820 align:middle line:84%
also heat and carbon
dioxide is created.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:04.320 align:middle line:84%
So when this muscle works,
the metabolism increases.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.860 align:middle line:84%
So heat and carbon
dioxide leaves the muscle

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.520 align:middle line:84%
and reaches the
bloodstream, and that's

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:14.600 align:middle line:84%
the signal for the oxygen to
go the opposite direction.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.150 align:middle line:84%
That's the signal
that lowers the pH,

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:22.140 align:middle line:84%
so the hemoglobin, holding
tight to the oxygen,

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:26.790 align:middle line:84%
will change shape, basically,
and release the oxygen

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:29.630 align:middle line:84%
so that this muscle
can continue to work.

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:32.210 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm going
around over-breathing,

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:34.750 align:middle line:84%
if I do like this, for example,
hyperventilating for awhile,

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:38.330 align:middle line:84%
[RAPID BREATHING] and then
trying to work this muscle,

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:39.740 align:middle line:90%
I will have less endurance.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:42.680 align:middle line:84%
Because then I have lowered
my levels of carbon dioxide,

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:46.590 align:middle line:84%
so not enough oxygen will
be kicked out of the blood.

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:50.840 align:middle line:84%
I will just have the blood
filled with the oxygen,

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:54.461 align:middle line:84%
but it will just pass by,
and I will exhale it again.

00:12:54.461 --> 00:12:55.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, so--

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:56.150 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Does that make sense?

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:57.525 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what
does that mean

00:12:57.525 --> 00:13:00.440 align:middle line:84%
for people who do, like,
extreme sports or long distance

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.539 align:middle line:90%
running, and so forth?

00:13:02.539 --> 00:13:04.080 align:middle line:84%
What's going on
there, because you're

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.310 align:middle line:84%
[RAPID BREATHING] Of course,
your body's demanding it, too.

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:08.490 align:middle line:90%
But what happens there?

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:10.799 align:middle line:90%
Is that a good thing?

00:13:10.799 --> 00:13:11.340 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: No.

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:17.960 align:middle line:84%
Usually, if you ask 100 athletes
how they breathe when they run

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.500 align:middle line:84%
or when they
exercise, they usually

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.700 align:middle line:90%
don't have that much of an idea.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:26.490 align:middle line:84%
They just train their
muscles, their tolerance

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:33.105 align:middle line:84%
for lactic acid, and the breath
is usually very overlooked.

00:13:33.105 --> 00:13:35.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what does this
do to their long-term health

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.400 align:middle line:90%
profile?

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:41.620 align:middle line:84%
Is this a good thing to do,
in general, for us, or not?

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: I think
mouth breathing, which

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:46.410 align:middle line:84%
most athletes do, is
detrimental to our health.

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:50.230 align:middle line:84%
So we should try to
keep that at a minimum.

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And many people that exercise--
not the long-distance runners--

00:13:54.780 --> 00:14:00.710 align:middle line:84%
they tend to exercise in
a low-intense fashion,

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:05.030 align:middle line:84%
and then they believe more in
a low-intense, slow fashion.

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:08.479 align:middle line:84%
They could easily--
probably-- close their mouth

00:14:08.479 --> 00:14:09.770 align:middle line:90%
and breathe through their nose.

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:10.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is this a guideline?

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:12.500 align:middle line:84%
If you're doing something
to the point where

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.124 align:middle line:84%
you have to breathe
through your mouth,

00:14:14.124 --> 00:14:16.234 align:middle line:90%
it's probably detrimental?

00:14:16.234 --> 00:14:17.900 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: For me,
it's a guideline, yes.

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:18.525 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:18.525 --> 00:14:20.820 align:middle line:84%
Or can you do it in short
bursts, and it's OK?

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:23.430 align:middle line:90%
Or just not a good idea?

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:26.290 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: I've actually
been trying on myself.

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:28.840 align:middle line:84%
I've been able to do
high-intense exercise, as well,

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.980 align:middle line:84%
in intervals, with
only nasal breathing.

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:34.750 align:middle line:84%
So most people
that exercise, they

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:37.850 align:middle line:84%
do it in kind of a
high-intense fashion.

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And I see that that
creates breathing habits,

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:44.660 align:middle line:84%
that they are in
the training arena,

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:47.270 align:middle line:84%
they [RAPID BREATHING] breathe
like that, because they

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:48.500 align:middle line:90%
exercise very hard.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And then they get off
the training arena,

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:52.660 align:middle line:84%
and they continue to
breathe like that.

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:55.550 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, if we do
something often enough,

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:57.100 align:middle line:90%
we tend to create new habits.

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:57.891 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:14:57.891 --> 00:15:01.450 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: So actually a lot
of athletes that I meet,

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:04.140 align:middle line:90%
they have poor breathing habits.

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's like they are creating
that with their high intensity

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:09.462 align:middle line:90%
exercise.

00:15:09.462 --> 00:15:11.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, because
a lot of times--

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:15.000 align:middle line:84%
I used to do mid-distance
kind of running a lot.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: OK.

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:17.571 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, short,
mid, whatever-- six,

00:15:17.571 --> 00:15:19.580 align:middle line:84%
seven miles a day,
kind of thing.

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And there was a point
where you settle into it,

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.670 align:middle line:84%
and everything
just feels groovy,

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:25.980 align:middle line:90%
because I wasn't pushing it.

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:29.080 align:middle line:84%
But I noticed a lot, on
long distance runners,

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.920 align:middle line:84%
there's a kind of
pallor about them.

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:34.450 align:middle line:84%
It's not a healthy looking--
it's not shiny, like you are,

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:35.760 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.390 align:middle line:84%
There's something that
seems to be almost eating

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:40.430 align:middle line:90%
the life force in the body.

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And I would think it would have
something to do with breathing.

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:45.310 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yeah.

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing
is-- I mention two things that

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:53.774 align:middle line:84%
are easy to do to induce stress
to our body, we breathe fast

00:15:53.774 --> 00:15:54.690 align:middle line:90%
or we hold our breath.

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:59.270 align:middle line:84%
The third thing is to actually
make our airways narrow.

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:01.802 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how do we
narrow the passageways?

00:16:01.802 --> 00:16:03.010 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: By mouth breathing.

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:05.830 align:middle line:84%
Because we take in air
that is cold, usually.

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:08.370 align:middle line:84%
It's dry, and it's
full of particles.

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:11.680 align:middle line:84%
In a single day, 100 billion
particles we take in.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:16.590 align:middle line:84%
And when we take
them in unfiltered,

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:19.390 align:middle line:90%
it creates irritated airways.

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:22.300 align:middle line:84%
They get inflamed, and
so they get more narrow.

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:24.990 align:middle line:90%
So here we induce stress.

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:27.940 align:middle line:84%
We really put our
body on red alert.

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And stress hormone starts
to be higher in our body,

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:34.980 align:middle line:84%
and we end up more
in fight-flight.

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:39.179 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we do when we
breathe through our mouth.

00:16:39.179 --> 00:16:40.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I would
think, in addition,

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:43.230 align:middle line:84%
you don't have the filtration
process for whatever

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:44.690 align:middle line:90%
else is in the air, as well.

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:46.170 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: No, that's true.

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:51.420 align:middle line:84%
So the nose in
itself-- because here

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:53.240 align:middle line:84%
the air is prepared
for the lungs.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:57.480 align:middle line:84%
The air is warmed,
it's humidified,

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.090 align:middle line:90%
and it's cleansed of bacteria.

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And it also has the ability
to drill the air further down

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:04.880 align:middle line:90%
into our lungs.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.183 align:middle line:84%
So mouth breathing leads
to a shallow breathing.

00:17:07.183 --> 00:17:08.599 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kind of
chest breathing.

00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:09.932 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yeah, chest breathing.

00:17:09.932 --> 00:17:12.310 align:middle line:84%
So if you exercise
a lot, you probably

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:16.060 align:middle line:84%
will end up with the poor
breathing habits outside

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:17.589 align:middle line:90%
of the training arena, as well.

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:18.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:20.970 align:middle line:90%
So you've tested it yourself.

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
reading that you had

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:27.180 align:middle line:84%
done some long-distance--
mid- to long-distance running,

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:30.905 align:middle line:84%
a half marathon-- with
your mouth taped shut.

00:17:30.905 --> 00:17:31.530 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yeah.

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:32.460 align:middle line:90%
I did that.

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:38.216 align:middle line:84%
Once, I did a race just to
sort of get some attention.

00:17:38.216 --> 00:17:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And I had actually-- it
was duct tape, completely

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.437 align:middle line:90%
one way around like this.

00:17:43.437 --> 00:17:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: One piece.

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:45.811 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: So the
first few seconds, I

00:17:45.811 --> 00:17:48.350 align:middle line:84%
feel a bit stressed, but
then I was able to calm down.

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:51.250 align:middle line:90%
But it was worth it.

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:53.060 align:middle line:90%
I got the attention I wanted.

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And I really wanted-- I
noticed the runners passing me

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:00.910 align:middle line:84%
during the race, they
thought I was a bit crazy.

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:04.810 align:middle line:84%
But I really wanted
them to start

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:06.870 align:middle line:84%
thinking about their
own breathing habits

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:08.600 align:middle line:90%
when they do their exercising.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And, actually, since
then, quite a few

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:13.880 align:middle line:84%
have been started to
doing that and started

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.407 align:middle line:84%
to apply nasal
breathing, as well.

00:18:16.407 --> 00:18:17.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it
didn't stress you out

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:20.532 align:middle line:84%
to be running with your mouth
taped shut for that distance.

00:18:20.532 --> 00:18:21.990 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: No,
because I had already

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:23.390 align:middle line:90%
done it for a couple of years.

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:23.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see, yeah.

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:26.170 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: Although, I don't
I don't do it with the taped

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:29.330 align:middle line:90%
mouth when I exercise.

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:31.750 align:middle line:90%
I just did it during the race.

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:32.490 align:middle line:90%
But, so, no.

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:34.550 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't stressed out at all.

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And another thing,
an important thing--

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:37.830 align:middle line:84%
it's also connected
to high blood

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:41.310 align:middle line:84%
pressure-- because when you
exhale through your mouth,

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:46.250 align:middle line:84%
there is a study saying
that we breathe out 42% more

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:47.887 align:middle line:90%
water compared to our nose.

00:18:47.887 --> 00:18:49.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, so we're
dehydrating ourselves

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.050 align:middle line:90%
by breathing through our mouths.

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:51.500 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yes.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:52.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:54.541 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: Thinking about the
blood, it's like, I think,

00:18:54.541 --> 00:18:56.320 align:middle line:90%
93% water.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:59.070 align:middle line:84%
So when we are decreasing the
amount of water in our body,

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:00.930 align:middle line:90%
the blood will be more thicker.

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:03.130 align:middle line:84%
So, again, that could lead
to higher blood pressure.

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, now that's a
really interesting point.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.990 align:middle line:84%
The other thing you
did-- and, again, this

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:10.730 align:middle line:84%
will tie back to
breathing too shallowly

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:12.270 align:middle line:90%
or breathing too much.

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And, as you already stated, if
you're breathing too rapidly

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.340 align:middle line:84%
and up high, like
this, you're-- A,

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:20.290 align:middle line:84%
you're dehydrating your
body, it sounds like.

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:21.165 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yeah, yeah.

00:19:21.165 --> 00:19:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're also narrowing
your natural passageways,

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:26.040 align:middle line:84%
because you're not using
them properly, right?

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:26.360 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yeah, true.

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:27.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What else is
happening when you're breathing

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:28.748 align:middle line:90%
like [RAPID BREATHING]?

00:19:28.748 --> 00:19:29.740 align:middle line:90%


00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:31.380 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: It's
extremely inefficient.

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:35.150 align:middle line:84%
Think about, we're doing this
a thousand times per hour.

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:38.080 align:middle line:84%
That's like 25,000
times in a day.

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.530 align:middle line:84%
So of course we want
it to be efficient.

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And a really good
efficient breathing pattern

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:47.950 align:middle line:84%
only takes a couple of percent
of our total bodily resources.

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:50.170 align:middle line:84%
But if we have impaired
breathing habits,

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:54.520 align:middle line:84%
it could take 5%,
10%, 15%, 20%, 25%.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And since our breath
is always number one--

00:19:57.790 --> 00:19:59.860 align:middle line:84%
if we stop breathing,
we will die--

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:01.150 align:middle line:90%
it's on the top of the list.

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:03.100 align:middle line:90%
It has the highest priority.

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:07.495 align:middle line:84%
So if my breathing habits take--
I mean, the resources to move

00:20:07.495 --> 00:20:11.220 align:middle line:84%
the air in and out-- if it
takes 10% of my body resources,

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:15.400 align:middle line:84%
it means that I have less
energy to think a thought,

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:20.430 align:middle line:84%
fight a bacteria, digest
food, and so forth.

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:22.710 align:middle line:90%
So it's really inefficient.

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:25.440 align:middle line:84%
Because we have what is
called, in medical terms,

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.530 align:middle line:90%
a dead space here.

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:29.810 align:middle line:84%
It's like a snorkel,
if you like.

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:34.920 align:middle line:84%
When we take the air in, it's
first divided-- two branches

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.610 align:middle line:90%
to each lung.

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And then there are
23 more branches.

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:45.260 align:middle line:84%
So the air should
travel 24 stories down

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.380 align:middle line:90%
before there is any real action.

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.250 align:middle line:84%
These alveoli, the
lung sacks, that's

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:52.500 align:middle line:84%
where the action is, where
the oxygen is transferred

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:55.550 align:middle line:84%
to the blood and
the carbon dioxide

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:59.640 align:middle line:84%
is transferred from the blood
so that we can exhale it.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:03.190 align:middle line:84%
So when we have
more narrow airways,

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:05.820 align:middle line:84%
when we move the
air just up here,

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:09.440 align:middle line:84%
we are basically just
moving the air in and out

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.205 align:middle line:84%
on this snorkel--
this dead space.

00:21:11.205 --> 00:21:13.455 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not really
efficiently being delivered.

00:21:13.455 --> 00:21:15.121 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: It's totally
inefficient, yes.

00:21:15.121 --> 00:21:18.100 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we have to
compensate and have to take

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:21.580 align:middle line:90%
more breaths per minute.

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.305 align:middle line:84%
A good, really good
breathing pattern

00:21:23.305 --> 00:21:27.230 align:middle line:84%
is just 10-12
breaths per minute.

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And when I count the number
of breaths from people,

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.630 align:middle line:84%
without them knowing it, I
rarely see someone below 18.

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:38.280 align:middle line:84%
So they're between 18 and
25 breaths per minute.

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:41.240 align:middle line:90%
That's what I find.

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a
severe over-breathing.

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:46.160 align:middle line:84%
Most of us, we are breathing
for two, or three, or even

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.730 align:middle line:90%
four people.

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:49.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow, interesting.

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:51.860 align:middle line:84%
Now does that very
culture to culture,

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:54.800 align:middle line:84%
where you're living
in Western society

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:58.460 align:middle line:84%
where civilization's
operating at a very rapid pace

00:21:58.460 --> 00:21:59.960 align:middle line:84%
and we're drinking
coffee and trying

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:01.300 align:middle line:90%
to make the next meeting.

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.520 align:middle line:84%
Is it worst there,
say, than places

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.840 align:middle line:84%
that maybe have less
of that influence?

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.116 align:middle line:84%
A little more
indigenous, laid back?

00:22:08.116 --> 00:22:09.240 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: I think so, yeah.

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:12.380 align:middle line:84%
Although I haven't really
the scientific studies.

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:15.390 align:middle line:84%
But my experience is
that that is the case.

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And that, for example
if you go out in nature,

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:21.950 align:middle line:84%
you will automatically
breathe slower and probably

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:23.202 align:middle line:90%
through the nose, as well.

00:22:23.202 --> 00:22:24.660 align:middle line:84%
For example, here,
it's spring now.

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And [INHALE] you can
smell the spring, almost.

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:29.900 align:middle line:84%
Compared to in the
city, where there

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:33.014 align:middle line:84%
may be a lot of chemicals,
and you may even--

00:22:33.014 --> 00:22:33.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fumes.

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:34.596 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yeah, fumes.

00:22:34.596 --> 00:22:37.140 align:middle line:84%
You open your mouth because
you don't want to smell it.

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And you may even think, I
don't want that deep down

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:41.300 align:middle line:90%
into my lungs.

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:45.920 align:middle line:84%
So it creates a shallow
breathing in itself, the air.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:50.250 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, I would say
that it's most likely

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:52.480 align:middle line:84%
these stressful
environments that create

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.070 align:middle line:90%
these poor breathing habits.

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:54.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:56.120 align:middle line:84%
OK, what about
the opposite end--

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:59.150 align:middle line:84%
people who seem to be
breathing kind of-- they

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:02.540 align:middle line:84%
may be breathing down into
their belly, but kind of shallow

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:04.910 align:middle line:90%
maybe, or maybe they stop.

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:07.710 align:middle line:84%
Maybe just stop breathing
in certain instances

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:11.310 align:middle line:84%
of either effort or
contemplation or whatnot.

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:13.445 align:middle line:84%
What is the danger in
not breathing enough?

00:23:13.445 --> 00:23:15.935 align:middle line:90%


00:23:15.935 --> 00:23:16.560 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yeah.

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:21.050 align:middle line:84%
I think the thing is
that we notice, no, I'm

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:22.350 align:middle line:90%
not breathing at all.

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:23.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm holding my breath.

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:24.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm a breath-holder.

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:28.800 align:middle line:84%
Or, I'm reading very
fast or very shallow.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:34.930 align:middle line:84%
Or, I'm, as you described,
maybe I'm breathing too little.

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:39.750 align:middle line:84%
But that may be what
we pay attention to,

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:41.860 align:middle line:84%
but that may not
be the whole truth.

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:47.610 align:middle line:84%
We may breathe more when we
are not paying attention to it.

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:50.790 align:middle line:84%
Because it's really
hard to-- for example,

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:55.770 align:middle line:84%
each time I come across someone
taking 25 breaths per minute,

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:57.150 align:middle line:90%
I get so surprised.

00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:59.040 align:middle line:84%
I would never ever
have spotted that.

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And I've been doing
this now since the 2009,

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:05.740 align:middle line:84%
so I'm kind of a
nerd in this way.

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:09.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's really easy
to hide this kind

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:13.210 align:middle line:90%
of low-grade hyperventilation.

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so speaking
of hyperventilation,

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:17.300 align:middle line:84%
that's another
experiment you did.

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:19.470 align:middle line:84%
I think most of us
have experienced,

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:22.210 align:middle line:84%
at one time or another--
usually through something

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:23.750 align:middle line:90%
traumatic or shocking.

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:28.780 align:middle line:84%
But you hyperventilated for
20 minutes at one stretch.

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:31.950 align:middle line:84%
What happens when
we hyperventilate?

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:33.770 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: Yeah, I
tried it a few times,

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:35.770 align:middle line:84%
just out of curiosity
what happens.

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And for one thing, after
hyperventilating for so long,

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:43.000 align:middle line:90%
I could hold my breath for ages.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to
breathe, and that's

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:48.250 align:middle line:84%
because of the oxygen-carbon
dioxide balance.

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And another thing is it
took five minutes, at least,

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:55.460 align:middle line:90%
before my hands started shaking.

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:59.970 align:middle line:84%
I was totally not
ready to do anything.

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:05.920 align:middle line:84%
My brain, my cognitive
ability was not at its peak.

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And, actually, when I did it
once, I did it in the morning.

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:15.000 align:middle line:84%
During the whole day,
I felt like I was not

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.710 align:middle line:90%
of use to do anything.

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:19.730 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say depressed--
it's a strong word.

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:22.950 align:middle line:84%
But likely depressed
and low energy.

00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And I knew intellectually
that-- because I read a study

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:31.570 align:middle line:84%
where they had people
hyperventilating-- they

00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:33.200 align:middle line:90%
would study them for one hour.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And once they lowered the
levels of carbon dioxide,

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.130 align:middle line:90%
that was the aim of the study.

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:42.370 align:middle line:84%
They should reduce them
by 50%, and once they

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:47.050 align:middle line:84%
had achieved that, which was
in, like, 10 minutes or so,

00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:51.680 align:middle line:84%
they were able to keep at that
level without any real efforts.

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:55.060 align:middle line:84%
They just [DEEP BREATH]
took a sigh here and there,

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:56.460 align:middle line:90%
or just a big breath.

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:58.870 align:middle line:84%
So no one could see that
they were hyperventilating.

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:01.120 align:middle line:90%
So it is really interesting.

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:04.200 align:middle line:84%
If you think, if you go through
a stressful period-- just

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:08.570 align:middle line:84%
a few minutes, or it could be
a few weeks, or a few months,

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:10.557 align:middle line:84%
you are then increasing
you breathing,

00:26:10.557 --> 00:26:12.390 align:middle line:84%
you're hyperventilating,
so you are lowering

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:15.775 align:middle line:84%
the CO2, the carbon
dioxide, and you

00:26:15.775 --> 00:26:21.000 align:middle line:84%
are able to keep there at that
level without any real effort.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.390 align:middle line:84%
So I realized that that was what
I did with my hyperventilation.

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:29.419 align:middle line:84%
I really went down
energy-wise and health-wise.

00:26:29.419 --> 00:26:31.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I wrote down
all these different things

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:35.640 align:middle line:84%
that happen when we tend to
over-breathe or hyperventilate.

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:39.681 align:middle line:84%
You don't have oxygen released
into the tissues of the body,

00:26:39.681 --> 00:26:40.180 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:40.810 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yeah, true.

00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:42.643 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That has to
be terrible for things

00:26:42.643 --> 00:26:44.280 align:middle line:90%
like diabetes and all of that.

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And you start having
an energy deficiency.

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:51.080 align:middle line:84%
It's not oxygenating the body,
but it's depleting the body,

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.170 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:52.962 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Exactly.

00:26:52.962 --> 00:26:54.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the
reason why we can only

00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:56.794 align:middle line:84%
survive for a couple of
minutes without breathing--

00:26:56.794 --> 00:27:02.270 align:middle line:84%
our huge dependence on oxygen.
And when we convert nutrients

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:04.700 align:middle line:10%
to energy, we can
do it in two ways--

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:08.310 align:middle line:10%
either without oxygen
or with oxygen.

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:11.900 align:middle line:84%
When we do it without oxygen,
we get very little energy.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And since the
amount of energy we

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:21.100 align:middle line:84%
need every day, it's almost
as much as our body weight--

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:24.080 align:middle line:84%
and that's not stored, it's
created when we need it.

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And if we do it, then,
without oxygen, we

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:30.610 align:middle line:84%
get very little energy compared
to when we do it with oxygen.

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:35.330 align:middle line:84%
We can get up to 19 times
more energy-- one, nine-- out

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:36.921 align:middle line:90%
of the same amount of nutrient.

00:27:36.921 --> 00:27:38.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow, that's amazing.

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:39.570 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: So that's the key.

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:42.210 align:middle line:84%
That's why we are so
dependent upon breathing.

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:46.950 align:middle line:84%
So, of course, if we think
that, oh, I have low energy.

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:48.530 align:middle line:90%
I need a coffee.

00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:50.620 align:middle line:90%
I need sugar.

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:53.710 align:middle line:84%
Next time, maybe we
can go to our breathing

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:58.550 align:middle line:84%
and start to apply slow
breathing, low and slow,

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:02.200 align:middle line:84%
in and out through our nose, and
see if we can gain more energy.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It makes total sense.

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:06.590 align:middle line:84%
It also compromises
the nervous system

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:08.964 align:middle line:84%
and creates nervous
disorders, right?

00:28:08.964 --> 00:28:09.880 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: That's true.

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:11.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the nose-- we have
this lateral connection.

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.720 align:middle line:84%
So there are some
yoga practices,

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:20.055 align:middle line:84%
for example-- alternative
nasal breathing where you.

00:28:20.055 --> 00:28:21.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going
to bring that up.

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:22.290 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And all the ancient traditions
give these protocols

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:29.280 align:middle line:90%
in their teachings.

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:30.080 align:middle line:90%
And it's big.

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:33.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some of them
use breathing alone

00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:35.565 align:middle line:84%
as the primary
source of healing.

00:28:35.565 --> 00:28:36.870 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yeah.

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:39.700 align:middle line:84%
I think it's too
simple for our society.

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:41.400 align:middle line:90%
We want to complicate things.

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.250 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't really fit in.

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:47.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in Sweden, I think we
have 400 different specialties

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:51.385 align:middle line:84%
of doctors, and breathing
goes across all of them.

00:28:51.385 --> 00:28:53.760 align:middle line:84%
So no one is really paying
any attention to the breathing

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:58.060 align:middle line:90%
because it doesn't fit in.

00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:02.596 align:middle line:90%
So you said, um--

00:29:02.596 --> 00:29:03.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh,
nervous disorders--

00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:06.010 align:middle line:84%
it puts a strain on
the teeth, the heart,

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:07.450 align:middle line:90%
and then talk about that.

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:09.160 align:middle line:84%
Because then we're
going to get to how

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:11.240 align:middle line:84%
our face is affected,
and our teeth,

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.654 align:middle line:90%
and our development of our jaw.

00:29:12.654 --> 00:29:13.820 align:middle line:90%
This, to me, is fascinating.

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:17.590 align:middle line:84%
But let's just finish up on
nervous system and the heart--

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:19.320 align:middle line:84%
what it does to
the heart muscle.

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: So the
nervous system--

00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:23.960 align:middle line:84%
the automatic
nervous system, which

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:28.560 align:middle line:84%
takes charge of automatic
functions, like heartbeat,

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:32.350 align:middle line:84%
digestion, and so forth--
it's divided into two parts--

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:37.140 align:middle line:84%
the sympathetic, the gas
pedal, the fight or flight,

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:39.720 align:middle line:84%
and then we have the
parasympathetic, the rest

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:42.490 align:middle line:90%
and digest, recovery.

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And when we inhale
through our left nostril--

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:51.320 align:middle line:84%
I talk about this
lateral connection.

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:54.680 align:middle line:84%
So the left is connected
to this part of the body.

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:57.940 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, if we were
to inhale coal dust, that

00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:01.780 align:middle line:84%
will end up-- if we inhale
it through the left nostril,

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:04.510 align:middle line:84%
it will end up in
the right lung.

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:06.730 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, if we
have problems sleeping,

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:10.040 align:middle line:84%
we are probably more
in sympathetic mode.

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:12.080 align:middle line:84%
So we want to shift
to parasympathetic.

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is sympathetic mode
to activate the nervous system,

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:17.710 align:middle line:84%
breathing through
the right nostril?

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: Well, then
if you-- usually then

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:24.220 align:middle line:84%
we are in our left brain, the
logical, the problem brain.

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:26.180 align:middle line:84%
So we want to shift
to the right brain,

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:29.750 align:middle line:84%
so then we have to breathe
through our left nostril.

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:32.470 align:middle line:84%
We can also do the
alternating nasal breathing

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:33.830 align:middle line:90%
to balance the nervous system.

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:37.460 align:middle line:84%
But if we just want
to get to sleep,

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:41.581 align:middle line:84%
I suggest you try the breathing
in through your left nostril

00:30:41.581 --> 00:30:42.330 align:middle line:90%
for a few minutes.

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:44.913 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I know in ancient
studies, that is what it says.

00:30:44.913 --> 00:30:47.460 align:middle line:84%
To breathe in through the left,
soothes the nervous system

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:47.720 align:middle line:90%
and calms.

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:48.360 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yeah, right.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To breathe
in through the right,

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:51.390 align:middle line:90%
give energy and excites.

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:52.250 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yes.

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:54.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I've
played with this

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:56.580 align:middle line:84%
quite a bit through the
years, and, honestly,

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:58.680 align:middle line:84%
I haven't found anything
better than breathing--

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:01.390 align:middle line:84%
alternate breathing, or
choosing whichever function

00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:04.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to enhance, through
that particular nostril.

00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:06.160 align:middle line:90%
It works like a gem.

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look at
all the drugs we're

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:10.600 align:middle line:90%
taking to compensate for that.

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:12.240 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yeah, yeah.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And another thing with the
breath is that, when we inhale,

00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:18.500 align:middle line:84%
we also go more to
the sympathetic part

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:19.660 align:middle line:90%
of the nervous system.

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:24.970 align:middle line:84%
The pulse goes up, and
it's an active action

00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:29.500 align:middle line:84%
where the diaphragm muscle moves
down, and in the muscles, as

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:31.670 align:middle line:90%
well, in the chest moves.

00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:34.880 align:middle line:84%
So it's an active
thing we are doing.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:38.027 align:middle line:84%
So it's like [GASP]
this reaction that's

00:31:38.027 --> 00:31:39.110 align:middle line:90%
really waking up our body.

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:40.485 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sympathetic,
waking up.

00:31:40.485 --> 00:31:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: Yeah,
waking our body up.

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:46.104 align:middle line:84%
But the exhale, then, is
connected to parasympathetic.

00:31:46.104 --> 00:31:48.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which makes sense--
calming, and soothing,

00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:49.370 align:middle line:90%
and quieting.

00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:53.090 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: Yeah, like,
oh, now, we can relax.

00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:53.756 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [SIGH]

00:31:53.756 --> 00:31:55.339 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: What do
we do? [SIGH] Right?

00:31:55.339 --> 00:31:56.380 align:middle line:90%
We sigh in relief.

00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:59.440 align:middle line:84%
So many of us, we have
these impaired exhalations.

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:01.580 align:middle line:84%
I think that is
where the key is.

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:06.180 align:middle line:84%
If you're about to get
into any kinds of problem,

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:10.320 align:middle line:84%
you may find yourself [GASP]
breathing in more, holding

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:14.510 align:middle line:84%
your breath, and breathing
fast, but forgetting to exhale

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:17.420 align:middle line:90%
or exhaling too fast.

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:20.660 align:middle line:84%
So by just extending
your exhalation,

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:23.530 align:middle line:84%
you can actually calm
down, just as these

00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:26.930 align:middle line:84%
exercises you mentioned,
alternate nasal breathing.

00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:30.850 align:middle line:84%
So I guess most of us, we are
too much in the sympathetic,

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:33.010 align:middle line:84%
and we want to end up more
in the parasympathetic.

00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We need
to exhale more.

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.150 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: We need
to exhale more, yes.

00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:36.820 align:middle line:90%
Longer.

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:38.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Waiting to exhale.

00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:40.710 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's talk about, and
we'll have a couple images

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:44.500 align:middle line:84%
over this, as well, what happens
to our face and our teeth

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:47.320 align:middle line:84%
in our development as,
say, even as young people,

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:50.840 align:middle line:84%
if we start breathing through
the mouth for some reason?

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:52.284 align:middle line:90%
This is really interesting, too.

00:32:52.284 --> 00:32:53.200 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: It is, yeah.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And if you ask a dentist about
it, they usually know about it.

00:32:56.530 --> 00:32:59.450 align:middle line:84%
But there seems to be
a lack of communication

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:03.490 align:middle line:84%
about this information
to parents and children.

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:07.410 align:middle line:84%
So the reason why
retainers work is

00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:10.710 align:middle line:84%
because they can exert a
tiny amount of pressure

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:11.910 align:middle line:90%
over a long time.

00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:14.990 align:middle line:84%
That's why they can be
able to move a tooth.

00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:17.180 align:middle line:84%
But these muscles we
have in our mouth--

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:20.120 align:middle line:84%
our lips, our cheeks,
our tongue-- they are

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.480 align:middle line:90%
far more stronger than that.

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:24.380 align:middle line:84%
So when they are not in
the right place, when

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:27.630 align:middle line:84%
we are using them in the
wrong way, when we swallow,

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:30.680 align:middle line:84%
for example-- which we do
a couple of thousand times

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.240 align:middle line:84%
per day-- that
affects our teeth.

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:35.800 align:middle line:84%
So the main thing
is to get our tongue

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:39.240 align:middle line:84%
to rest in the
roof of our mouth.

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And if you just close
your mouth and swallow,

00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:47.940 align:middle line:84%
you can notice that the
tongue pressure up, upwards,

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:51.170 align:middle line:84%
and it pressures
to this bone, here.

00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:54.870 align:middle line:84%
It's called the maxilla, and it
gives shape to the whole face.

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:57.870 align:middle line:84%
It extends all the
way up to the eyes.

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:02.790 align:middle line:84%
So 2/3 of the eyes rests in
this maxilla, this huge muscle.

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's stimulated, it's growth
is stimulated, with every time

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:10.237 align:middle line:84%
we swallow and when the tongue
rests in the room of the mouth.

00:34:10.237 --> 00:34:12.570 align:middle line:84%
When we are mouth breathers,
the tongue is not up there.

00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:13.260 align:middle line:90%
Because [RAPID BREATHING]

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's slack.

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:15.739 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: We cannot
have it there, right?

00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:17.260 align:middle line:84%
Because then it
would be in the way.

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:21.449 align:middle line:84%
So we will have it either in
the middle of our mouth or down.

00:34:21.449 --> 00:34:23.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it
kind of collapses--

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:24.659 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: It collapses
the development, yeah.

00:34:24.659 --> 00:34:26.242 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --the
structure of our face.

00:34:26.242 --> 00:34:29.070 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: So instead of
the maxilla growing widely

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:34.757 align:middle line:84%
and forward, it will then grow
and be smaller and may create--

00:34:34.757 --> 00:34:35.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: More flat?

00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:37.120 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yeah, flat, exactly.

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:40.030 align:middle line:84%
So create a more
flat, narrow face.

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And you were talking
about the chin, earlier.

00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:47.860 align:middle line:84%
This chin needs a reference-- a
point of reference to develop.

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:50.219 align:middle line:90%
And that's the upper jaw.

00:34:50.219 --> 00:34:52.810 align:middle line:84%
So when we have our
mouth open too much,

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:55.300 align:middle line:84%
it will not have a
point of reference,

00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:57.740 align:middle line:90%
and we may get a receding chin.

00:34:57.740 --> 00:34:59.650 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't know where to grow.

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have this
picture of this one young boy,

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:03.666 align:middle line:84%
who I believe is,
what, 10 years old--

00:35:03.666 --> 00:35:04.290 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yeah.

00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:06.123 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --when the
picture, the first one,

00:35:06.123 --> 00:35:07.400 align:middle line:90%
started on the left, there.

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:08.130 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And then, as the years went
on, he was a mouth breather?

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: He got a
gerbil when he was 14,

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:17.040 align:middle line:90%
so he developed allergy.

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:19.200 align:middle line:84%
Got a blocked nose,
opened his mouth,

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:22.040 align:middle line:84%
and started to breathe
through his mouth

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.670 align:middle line:90%
since four years of age.

00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:28.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so his
jaw started responding

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:30.200 align:middle line:90%
by developing differently.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.600 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: Yeah, you can
see he has a receding chin.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:36.040 align:middle line:84%
You can see the
nose looks bigger.

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:40.650 align:middle line:84%
It's because his face has not
grown forward and in width.

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:45.720 align:middle line:84%
You can see around
his face, that he

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:48.980 align:middle line:84%
has the habit of
having his mouth open.

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:50.590 align:middle line:84%
If we were to see
his teeth, we would

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:54.170 align:middle line:90%
see that they would be crooked.

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And actually, this
maxilla, this large bone

00:35:57.250 --> 00:36:00.180 align:middle line:84%
that gives shape
to the whole face,

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:04.740 align:middle line:84%
it-- the nasal airways
are-- 85% of them

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:06.380 align:middle line:90%
are built up on the maxilla.

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:10.010 align:middle line:84%
So if the maxilla is not
developed fully, of course,

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:12.610 align:middle line:84%
it will be harder for us to
breathe through our nose.

00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:18.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's not only the aesthetic,
it's also the airways.

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:22.430 align:middle line:84%
So this boy will
most likely have

00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:25.390 align:middle line:84%
sleep problems, become a
snorer, and may, at some point,

00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:27.260 align:middle line:90%
even develop sleep apnea.

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Because his airways will
be narrow here and also

00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:35.250 align:middle line:90%
here where the air should pass.

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:37.590 align:middle line:84%
When we lie down, it's
harder for the air to pass.

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:39.300 align:middle line:84%
So if we already,
in the beginning,

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:44.660 align:middle line:84%
have narrow airways, because
our maxilla and our lower jaw

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:46.352 align:middle line:90%
has not developed as it should.

00:36:46.352 --> 00:36:48.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know it's kind
of a chicken-or-egg thing.

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:50.730 align:middle line:84%
But we say, yeah, but these
things are congenital,

00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:53.480 align:middle line:84%
because the mother had a
chain that was receded.

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:57.390 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that the
mother had obstructed

00:36:57.390 --> 00:37:00.340 align:middle line:84%
kind of passageways herself
and maybe inclinations

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:03.596 align:middle line:84%
toward the same
kind of breathing?

00:37:03.596 --> 00:37:04.970 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: I don't
think-- I think

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:07.760 align:middle line:84%
that's an argument put
forward since there

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:09.136 align:middle line:90%
is no other explanation.

00:37:09.136 --> 00:37:09.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.650 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: I don't
agree with that.

00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And one study done in
the early 19th century--

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:23.330 align:middle line:84%
sorry, 20th century-- but
a dentist, Weston Price.

00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:26.660 align:middle line:84%
He visited many native
cultures, and he

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:32.930 align:middle line:84%
could see that the father or
mother or the grandparents,

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:34.370 align:middle line:90%
they had a perfect set of teeth.

00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:35.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, beautiful teeth.

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:36.341 align:middle line:90%
We can see it, yes.

00:37:36.341 --> 00:37:39.750 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: But once
they started to develop

00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:42.360 align:middle line:84%
the more westernized
eating habits, for example,

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:46.300 align:middle line:84%
and stress, which then leads
to impaired breathing habits,

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:49.920 align:middle line:84%
then the children
got poor teeth.

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:50.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:51.880 align:middle line:90%
He has that well documented.

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:53.160 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yes, very well.

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:53.710 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of images--

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:54.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and their
jaws developed differently.

00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:55.700 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yes.

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:58.790 align:middle line:84%
So I don't agree
with that, that it's

00:37:58.790 --> 00:38:00.330 align:middle line:90%
something that's inherited.

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:01.750 align:middle line:90%
I think it's more out of habit.

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:07.870 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of the habits we tend
to-- we take after our parents.

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:08.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:10.230 align:middle line:90%
That's why I brought it up.

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:11.610 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yeah.

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:12.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, so.

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:17.995 align:middle line:84%
Also another thing that
affects it is poor posture.

00:38:17.995 --> 00:38:18.620 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yeah.

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:20.570 align:middle line:90%
That seems to go hand in hand.

00:38:20.570 --> 00:38:25.430 align:middle line:84%
So a dentist I work together
with from Australia,

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:27.620 align:middle line:84%
he sees-- he works
mainly with children--

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:32.210 align:middle line:84%
and if they are mouth breathers,
because we didn't want

00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:35.220 align:middle line:84%
to change slightly the
structure here in our throat,

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:39.300 align:middle line:84%
so we tend to lean forward a
little bit, to make it easier

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:41.660 align:middle line:90%
to breathe through our mouth.

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:44.830 align:middle line:84%
While, if we have nasal
breathing, it's more easy to

00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:47.190 align:middle line:90%
have an upright posture.

00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:53.520 align:middle line:84%
So what he sees is that, when he
teaches the children to breathe

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:56.210 align:middle line:84%
through their nose, close
their mouth more often,

00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:59.190 align:middle line:84%
they will start to automatically
improve their posture,

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:01.400 align:middle line:90%
get a more upright position.

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:05.030 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: And, of course,
if we are sitting there

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:07.440 align:middle line:84%
in front of a computer
with a slumped posture,

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.360 align:middle line:84%
it's very hard for
the diaphragm to work.

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:12.784 align:middle line:84%
We almost always end
up breathing shallowly.

00:39:12.784 --> 00:39:13.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And you see that-- I
played the piano was a kid.

00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:19.430 align:middle line:84%
So I got into the
habit of having kind

00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:21.790 align:middle line:90%
of ramrod straight posture.

00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And I notice at the
computer-- almost too much

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:28.060 align:middle line:84%
so-- if I'm at the computer,
my back is really straight.

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:29.420 align:middle line:90%
I can't do this.

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:30.980 align:middle line:90%
It's not even possible.

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:33.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't seem to be able to
make myself move hunched over.

00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:35.080 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Congratulations.

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:37.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For those piano
lessons early on in life.

00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:39.221 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yeah, yeah.

00:39:39.221 --> 00:39:40.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now let's
talk about-- there

00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:43.220 align:middle line:84%
are several things I want
to get into in a little bit,

00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:47.389 align:middle line:84%
having to do with nasal sprays
and prescription nasal sprays

00:39:47.389 --> 00:39:47.930 align:middle line:90%
and all this.

00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:49.221 align:middle line:90%
We're going to get into asthma.

00:39:49.221 --> 00:39:50.590 align:middle line:90%
We have about 15 minutes left.

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:52.220 align:middle line:84%
So we have some time
to get into these.

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:55.797 align:middle line:84%
But first, let's talk about the
proper breathing techniques.

00:39:55.797 --> 00:39:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And I've written--
I've taken them out

00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:59.470 align:middle line:84%
of your book, the
top five points.

00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:01.732 align:middle line:84%
So we can get a good
tutorial before we

00:40:01.732 --> 00:40:02.940 align:middle line:90%
go into these nuanced things.

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:04.130 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yes.

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:07.430 align:middle line:84%
So what I found
constitutes good breathing

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:10.420 align:middle line:84%
habits is that it's in
and out through your nose,

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:14.220 align:middle line:84%
it's down into your stomach
using your diaphragm,

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:21.716 align:middle line:84%
it's slow, it's
rhythmically, and it's quiet.

00:40:21.716 --> 00:40:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Five very simple,
easy principles.

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And most of us seem to breathe
in the opposite way-- not maybe

00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:31.950 align:middle line:90%
always, but most of the time.

00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:34.540 align:middle line:84%
So my idea is just
to help people

00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:38.350 align:middle line:84%
to realize that the
thousand breaths per hour,

00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:41.100 align:middle line:84%
if I take them in a really
stressed, poor fashion,

00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:42.970 align:middle line:84%
and then I start
to apply these five

00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:44.990 align:middle line:84%
principles of
conscious breathing,

00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:48.910 align:middle line:84%
I can start to reduce the amount
of breaths that are poorly

00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:53.490 align:middle line:84%
and start to increase the
amount of breaths that are good.

00:40:53.490 --> 00:40:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And, I think, if this represents
stress, and this harmony,

00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:59.480 align:middle line:84%
that this goes hand in
hand with our breath.

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:02.140 align:middle line:84%
So when we reduce
poor breathings

00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:03.680 align:middle line:90%
we will also reduce stress.

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And when we then, at the same
time, improve good breathing,

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:10.280 align:middle line:90%
we will increase harmony.

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:13.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you created
some little tools for people.

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:16.990 align:middle line:84%
So this little tool
we have right here

00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:18.504 align:middle line:90%
is called the Relaxator, right?

00:41:18.504 --> 00:41:19.670 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: That's true, yeah.

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and
you just-- by the way,

00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:23.610 align:middle line:84%
does this little
thing go on the top

00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:27.520 align:middle line:84%
or bottom, this little
slit, this little opening?

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:28.990 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: It really
doesn't matter.

00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because I find,
if you do it long enough,

00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:32.770 align:middle line:84%
there's lot of
condensation, and it drips.

00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:33.920 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yes, that's true.

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:35.697 align:middle line:84%
So then you may
want to have it up.

00:41:35.697 --> 00:41:37.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Have it right side up.

00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: But usually,
that's just in the beginning.

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.890 align:middle line:84%
That's usually something
that goes away.

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:49.096 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be a way of seeing
that the body's healing.

00:41:49.096 --> 00:41:50.220 align:middle line:90%
Or, there are a few things.

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:52.066 align:middle line:84%
We may get a bit tense,
because we're not

00:41:52.066 --> 00:41:53.440 align:middle line:84%
used to having
that in our mouth,

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:56.720 align:middle line:84%
so we tense up a little bit,
and we produce more saliva.

00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Another thing is
that parasympathetic

00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:03.030 align:middle line:84%
is called "rest
and digest," so we

00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:06.790 align:middle line:84%
tend to go into more
parasympathetic with using

00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:08.100 align:middle line:90%
the Relaxator.

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And parasympathetic, then,
we may produce more saliva.

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:14.852 align:middle line:84%
Because we may think
it's time to eat.

00:42:14.852 --> 00:42:15.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: That's
the rest and digest.

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That might
be what's going on.

00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:18.130 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yeah.

00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:19.588 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But this
is kind of cool.

00:42:19.588 --> 00:42:21.470 align:middle line:90%
It has-- you kind of dial it.

00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:23.831 align:middle line:84%
Your level of resistance
can be dialed in.

00:42:23.831 --> 00:42:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And then you just put this
little thing in your mouth,

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.663 align:middle line:84%
like you would a
snorkel or something,

00:42:27.663 --> 00:42:29.090 align:middle line:90%
and hangs around your neck.

00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:32.036 align:middle line:84%
And you breathe through--
in through your nose

00:42:32.036 --> 00:42:33.160 align:middle line:90%
and out through your mouth.

00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And what's the
point of breathing--

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:36.900 align:middle line:84%
doing this cyclical
breathing out

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:38.770 align:middle line:90%
through the mouth with this?

00:42:38.770 --> 00:42:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: It's because, the
resistance it gives you,

00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:46.700 align:middle line:84%
the Relaxator, is that it
prolongs the exhalation.

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:48.890 align:middle line:84%
It slows down your
breathing rate.

00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:51.690 align:middle line:90%
It makes it more rhythmically.

00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:55.250 align:middle line:84%
And it increases the
pressure in your lungs,

00:42:55.250 --> 00:43:01.390 align:middle line:84%
which improves the oxygenation
and improves the flow of air.

00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:04.490 align:middle line:84%
So, normally when we
are chest breathers,

00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:12.210 align:middle line:84%
we can look upon it like
water in a pond or in a creek.

00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:14.080 align:middle line:84%
The water in the
creek will probably

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:16.630 align:middle line:84%
be more healthy to
drink than in the pond.

00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:17.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Stagnant, yeah.

00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:18.300 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Stagnant, yes.

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:19.258 align:middle line:90%
So that's what happens.

00:43:19.258 --> 00:43:21.870 align:middle line:84%
The stagnant air that
doesn't circulate,

00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:26.780 align:middle line:84%
we help that with the Relaxator
when we increase the pressure.

00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And we also increase
the pressure

00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:31.140 align:middle line:84%
in this area, where
we have the sinuses.

00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:34.440 align:middle line:84%
So there is also
more air circulation.

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:38.430 align:middle line:84%
So, hopefully, we will
get less sinus congestion.

00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:40.692 align:middle line:90%

[SLOW BREATHING]

00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:49.902 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It definitely
calms everything down.

00:43:49.902 --> 00:43:51.860 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: It calms the
whole system down, yeah.

00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:55.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if a person has
poor breathing habits-- I mean,

00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:57.146 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to
sell products here--

00:43:57.146 --> 00:43:58.770 align:middle line:84%
but if they have poor
breathing habits,

00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:00.080 align:middle line:84%
and I'm trying to
think, how in the world

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:02.000 align:middle line:84%
do I even begin to come
to grips with this?

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.880 align:middle line:84%
Does something as
simple as this actually

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:06.230 align:middle line:90%
start re-patterning them?

00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:08.150 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: I would say so, yes.

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:11.490 align:middle line:84%
Few of us are born with
poor breathing habits.

00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:13.540 align:middle line:90%
Most of these are acquired.

00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:15.310 align:middle line:90%
So we can retrain them.

00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:16.950 align:middle line:90%
So that's the idea with this.

00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And the most common
question I get, though,

00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:22.910 align:middle line:84%
is you tell that
we should inhale,

00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:25.250 align:middle line:90%
in and out through our nose.

00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is in through our
nose and out through the mouth.

00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:30.420 align:middle line:90%
So I just want to address that.

00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:32.612 align:middle line:84%
That's the negative
effect of using it,

00:44:32.612 --> 00:44:34.820 align:middle line:84%
that we are actually breathing
out through our mouth.

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:37.597 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that
the positive effects--

00:44:37.597 --> 00:44:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To re-pattern
the breathing.

00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:40.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:44.690 align:middle line:84%
It feels-- I did it a few
days, like, for 15 minutes,

00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:46.010 align:middle line:90%
like you recommend.

00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:46.720 align:middle line:90%
Feels great.

00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:47.080 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yeah?

00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:48.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it feels great.

00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:49.510 align:middle line:90%
I just felt nice and relaxed.

00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:52.760 align:middle line:84%
A couple times, I noticed,
I'd stop breathing for a bit.

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:55.610 align:middle line:84%
But I had a hard time, because I
don't breathe through my mouth,

00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:57.630 align:middle line:90%
in the daytime, anyway.

00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:58.800 align:middle line:90%
I don't know about night.

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:02.480 align:middle line:84%
But I had a hard
time-- I realized

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:04.712 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't breathing,
because I'm not

00:45:04.712 --> 00:45:06.170 align:middle line:84%
used to breathing
through my mouth,

00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:07.295 align:middle line:90%
exhaling through the mouth.

00:45:07.295 --> 00:45:09.760 align:middle line:84%
So you have to consciously
participate with it,

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:12.020 align:middle line:84%
originally, until you
get into that pattern.

00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:13.020 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yes.

00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:15.014 align:middle line:90%
You are one of the few.

00:45:15.014 --> 00:45:15.930 align:middle line:90%
There's not that many.

00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:16.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:17.950 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: I think.

00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:19.810 align:middle line:84%
That's not, at least,
the feedback I get.

00:45:19.810 --> 00:45:20.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:21.620 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: That's
usually not a problem.

00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:23.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so then that
means it works for most people.

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:25.128 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: It worked for most.

00:45:25.128 --> 00:45:29.420 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, stress, anxiety,
pain, seems to be great.

00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:33.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And, I mean, really,
is there anything oxygen

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:37.750 align:middle line:84%
doesn't affect, in terms of the
healing capacities in the body?

00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:40.270 align:middle line:84%
For, even with cancer,
for example, how much

00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:44.870 align:middle line:84%
can we expedite that healing
journey just by-- well, along

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:47.370 align:middle line:84%
with whatever else you're
doing-- breathing properly?

00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:49.230 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: I tend to
think, like, if we

00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:51.810 align:middle line:84%
have any kind of health
problems or low energy,

00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:54.250 align:middle line:84%
or poor sports
performance, we can

00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:56.380 align:middle line:90%
see that as a vicious cycle.

00:45:56.380 --> 00:46:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And in every one of those
cases, poor breathing habits

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:02.490 align:middle line:90%
is one key ingredient.

00:46:02.490 --> 00:46:05.550 align:middle line:84%
So whatever we are experiencing,
even if it's cancer,

00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:08.300 align:middle line:84%
I think we can benefit from
improving our breathing.

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:11.150 align:middle line:84%
Because it's all about
oxygenating our body,

00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:12.170 align:middle line:90%
when we think about it.

00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:13.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:46:13.650 --> 00:46:15.275 align:middle line:84%
The one nutrient we
can't live without.

00:46:15.275 --> 00:46:16.191 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: No, exactly.

00:46:16.191 --> 00:46:18.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The only nutrient we
can't live without is oxygen.

00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:21.030 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: Yeah, and
again, poor breathing

00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:24.135 align:middle line:84%
will lead to-- we will
die if we stop breathing.

00:46:24.135 --> 00:46:26.270 align:middle line:90%
We need oxygen that desperately.

00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:27.520 align:middle line:90%
But again, it's about balance.

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:30.000 align:middle line:84%
So when we have
too much oxygen, we

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.120 align:middle line:90%
will induce oxidative stress.

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:36.160 align:middle line:84%
Because oxygen is so highly
reactive-- it's just like if we

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:39.660 align:middle line:84%
bite in an apple, and we
put it here for a minute,

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:40.660 align:middle line:90%
it will turn brown.

00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's the oxidative, the
free radicals that are formed.

00:46:44.770 --> 00:46:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And the same going
on in our body.

00:46:46.690 --> 00:46:49.690 align:middle line:84%
So when we breathe for two,
or three, or four people,

00:46:49.690 --> 00:46:52.880 align:middle line:84%
we are bringing in all this
oxygen that we don't need.

00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:57.110 align:middle line:84%
So we increase the risk
for oxidative stress,

00:46:57.110 --> 00:47:00.850 align:middle line:84%
for inflammation, for
free radicals forming.

00:47:00.850 --> 00:47:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And then we talk
about that, of course,

00:47:02.830 --> 00:47:07.220 align:middle line:84%
we want to eat antioxidant-rich
food-- which is great, but even

00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:09.889 align:middle line:84%
greater is, of course, to
stop the free radicals to form

00:47:09.889 --> 00:47:10.680 align:middle line:90%
in the first place.

00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:11.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:12.871 align:middle line:90%
In such a simple way.

00:47:12.871 --> 00:47:13.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:13.370 --> 00:47:16.230 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about sleep apnea.

00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:19.010 align:middle line:84%
Another one of the things you
have-- I have your little tools

00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:20.930 align:middle line:90%
here-- is this tape.

00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:22.935 align:middle line:90%
It's called "Sleep Tape," right?

00:47:22.935 --> 00:47:23.560 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yeah.

00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:25.601 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
basically like what you did,

00:47:25.601 --> 00:47:28.320 align:middle line:84%
duct taped your mouth shut
while you're sleeping at night.

00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about sleep apnea,
what's that doing to us,

00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:35.262 align:middle line:84%
what the risk is, and what
happens when any of us--

00:47:35.262 --> 00:47:37.720 align:middle line:84%
we don't actually know what
we're doing at night when we're

00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:41.205 align:middle line:84%
sleeping-- what happens when we
tape our mouths shut at night.

00:47:41.205 --> 00:47:41.830 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yeah.

00:47:41.830 --> 00:47:43.980 align:middle line:84%
I was inspired by a
study where they blocked

00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:47.520 align:middle line:84%
the nose on the participants,
all healthy participants,

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:49.790 align:middle line:84%
so they could only breathe
through their mouth.

00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And only in the first night,
all of them developed snoring.

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:56.160 align:middle line:84%
One of them developed
sleep apnea.

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:57.869 align:middle line:84%
And all of them said
they had poor sleep.

00:47:57.869 --> 00:47:58.993 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I would think so.

00:47:58.993 --> 00:47:59.980 align:middle line:90%
It sounds horrible.

00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:01.000 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yeah.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.604 align:middle line:84%
And then they should
take a step back.

00:48:02.604 --> 00:48:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That cold,
polluted air, yeah.

00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: And being a little
creative and think, OK.

00:48:07.290 --> 00:48:09.660 align:middle line:84%
So if a blocked nose
creates poor sleep,

00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:12.892 align:middle line:84%
what happens if you
block the mouth?

00:48:12.892 --> 00:48:14.100 align:middle line:90%
Could that create good sleep?

00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:16.010 align:middle line:90%
So that was basically the idea.

00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And since we sleep about
a third of our life,

00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:21.730 align:middle line:84%
it seems wise to have
our breathing work

00:48:21.730 --> 00:48:23.940 align:middle line:90%
for us instead of against us.

00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And open mouth at night,
at rest in general,

00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:31.280 align:middle line:84%
automatically means that
we are hyperventilating--

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:34.160 align:middle line:84%
taking in too much oxygen,
exhaling too much carbon

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:38.000 align:middle line:84%
dioxide, and then giving
rise to oxygen deficiency.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.670 align:middle line:84%
So we don't get the healing
and repair our body needs.

00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:44.920 align:middle line:90%
We may wake up tired.

00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:47.550 align:middle line:90%
We may wake up with a dry mouth.

00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And so forth-- we have
restless sleep, nightmares,

00:48:50.890 --> 00:48:51.710 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of stuff.

00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:55.497 align:middle line:84%
And, at some point, that
may lead to sleep apnea.

00:48:55.497 --> 00:48:57.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And talk
about sleep apnea--

00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:59.380 align:middle line:84%
what it is, what it does,
what the danger of that

00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:03.420 align:middle line:84%
is to the body, and why do more
men seem to have it than women,

00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:06.600 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: For one thing,
it's connected to weight.

00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:09.940 align:middle line:84%
Overweight on the outside
means overweight on the inside.

00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:12.920 align:middle line:84%
So it's harder for
the air to pass.

00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's, again, connected
to breathing in some way.

00:49:15.830 --> 00:49:18.460 align:middle line:84%
I've never come
across a diet program

00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:21.181 align:middle line:84%
where they also include
improve your breathing habits.

00:49:21.181 --> 00:49:23.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: At the end, I
want to talk about that.

00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:24.610 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: OK, I
can just mention--

00:49:24.610 --> 00:49:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, go ahead, do
it now-- digestion, metabolism,

00:49:26.810 --> 00:49:27.800 align:middle line:90%
and weight loss, yeah.

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:28.425 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yeah.

00:49:28.425 --> 00:49:34.340 align:middle line:84%
Because we cannot burn fat
in the absence of oxygen.

00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:36.930 align:middle line:84%
So when we deprive
our body of oxygen,

00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:40.250 align:middle line:84%
we have to go more to
our sugar storage system.

00:49:40.250 --> 00:49:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And we close-- we
shut the door slightly

00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:43.620 align:middle line:90%
to our fat storage system.

00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:48.350 align:middle line:84%
So that may lead to us
putting on weight, which,

00:49:48.350 --> 00:49:51.250 align:middle line:84%
at some point, may be
one of the ingredients

00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:54.270 align:middle line:84%
why we have sleep apnea--
which is basically that we

00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:57.300 align:middle line:90%
hold our breath when we sleep.

00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And in the medical setting,
they consider it as a disease

00:50:02.970 --> 00:50:04.420 align:middle line:90%
when you're asleep.

00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:07.410 align:middle line:84%
I would like to look at it
from a broader perspective.

00:50:07.410 --> 00:50:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's very unlikely that
you have really poor sleep--

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.070 align:middle line:84%
which you have, when
you have sleep apnea.

00:50:16.070 --> 00:50:18.690 align:middle line:84%
Think about it-- holding
your breath and then,

00:50:18.690 --> 00:50:22.904 align:middle line:84%
after a while-- some hold their
breath for 15, 30, 50 seconds--

00:50:22.904 --> 00:50:24.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really, that long?

00:50:24.070 --> 00:50:24.325 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yeah.

00:50:24.325 --> 00:50:24.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:26.740 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: And after that, you
start to [RAPID BREATHING]

00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:27.530 align:middle line:90%
hyperventilate.

00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:29.260 align:middle line:90%
It's like out driving the car--

00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:29.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really bad, yeah.

00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:31.960 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: --one foot on
the brake, one on the gas.

00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:32.230 align:middle line:90%
Horrible.

00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:33.563 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No good for your body.

00:50:33.563 --> 00:50:37.765 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: No, so that's
really stressful for the body.

00:50:37.765 --> 00:50:40.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That could cause
cardiac issues, I would think.

00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:42.473 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: Yeah, because every
time you hold your breath,

00:50:42.473 --> 00:50:45.810 align:middle line:84%
you're starting to get the
adrenaline out, the fight

00:50:45.810 --> 00:50:51.430 align:middle line:84%
or flight, and the whole system
starts to get on red alert.

00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And what I think is
one missing factor

00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:57.760 align:middle line:84%
is to look at the
whole 24 hours.

00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.550 align:middle line:84%
Because it's highly
unlikely that you

00:50:59.550 --> 00:51:02.190 align:middle line:84%
have these poor breathing
habits while you're

00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:05.260 align:middle line:84%
asleep, and then have the
most wonderful breathing

00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:06.610 align:middle line:90%
habits during the day.

00:51:06.610 --> 00:51:10.100 align:middle line:84%
You most likely train your
body to hold your breath

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:11.860 align:middle line:90%
during daytime.

00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:13.740 align:middle line:90%
I call it concentration apnea.

00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:16.760 align:middle line:84%
Or, you could call it text
message apnea, or computer

00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:20.340 align:middle line:84%
apnea, where we hold our
breath during our day.

00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:26.530 align:middle line:84%
With all these tons of
stimulate we are bombarded with,

00:51:26.530 --> 00:51:28.415 align:middle line:84%
it gives rise to
emotions and thoughts,

00:51:28.415 --> 00:51:30.290 align:middle line:84%
and they tend to alter
our breathing pattern,

00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:31.500 align:middle line:90%
including holding our breath.

00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:34.720 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's-- one
way, it's habitual,

00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:38.700 align:middle line:84%
another way is weight,
and a third way is

00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:42.720 align:middle line:84%
the under-development of the
maxilla in the upper airways

00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:43.920 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:47.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if a
person has sleep apnea,

00:51:47.330 --> 00:51:51.120 align:middle line:84%
by simply taking their mouth
shut, can they start breathing?

00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:55.540 align:middle line:84%
Or have the passageways narrowed
so much that they can't even

00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:56.040 align:middle line:90%
do it?

00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:58.019 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what's the answer?

00:51:58.019 --> 00:51:58.935 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Well, it's--

00:51:58.935 --> 00:52:01.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or just basic snoring,
mouth breathing at night.

00:52:01.810 --> 00:52:03.620 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: Yeah, if you snore,
you do it through the mouth,

00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:04.119 align:middle line:90%
usually.

00:52:04.119 --> 00:52:07.780 align:middle line:84%
So by just taping
your mouth, you

00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:09.130 align:middle line:90%
may get rid of your snoring.

00:52:09.130 --> 00:52:09.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:11.540 align:middle line:84%
Oh, boy, there a lot of
women around the planet,

00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:13.610 align:middle line:84%
and men, that would
be happy to hear it

00:52:13.610 --> 00:52:15.219 align:middle line:90%
could be such a simple fix.

00:52:15.219 --> 00:52:16.260 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Tell me-- yeah.

00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:18.340 align:middle line:84%
They say that all the
time in my courses.

00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:20.950 align:middle line:84%
Oh, now I will go home
and tape up my husband.

00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:22.406 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Does it work?

00:52:22.406 --> 00:52:23.280 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yeah, yeah.

00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:25.390 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:28.290 align:middle line:84%
For some, it completely
disappears, the snoring.

00:52:28.290 --> 00:52:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And for some, they
continue to [SNORE]

00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:32.080 align:middle line:84%
snore a little bit
through the nose,

00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:33.454 align:middle line:84%
because that's
possible, as well.

00:52:33.454 --> 00:52:35.680 align:middle line:84%
But usually it goes
down quite a bit.

00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And then, hopefully, they
would take the next steps

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:41.080 align:middle line:84%
and start to improve
their breathing habits

00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:43.600 align:middle line:90%
and get rid of it altogether.

00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:45.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is such a
simple fix for a problem that

00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:47.230 align:middle line:90%
has caused divorces.

00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:49.530 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yes.

00:52:49.530 --> 00:52:50.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:52:50.110 --> 00:52:52.080 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to ask you
about a couple things

00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:55.440 align:middle line:84%
we mentioned earlier, which
was the notion of nasal sprays.

00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:57.550 align:middle line:84%
So we end up with
these blocked passages.

00:52:57.550 --> 00:52:58.660 align:middle line:90%
It could be whatever.

00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:01.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, maybe they've
been narrowed habitually,

00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:03.470 align:middle line:84%
maybe we have an allergy,
maybe we have a cold.

00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:06.980 align:middle line:84%
What happens if we're always
using these nasal sprays?

00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:09.170 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: Well,
it's like, you know,

00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:11.820 align:middle line:84%
if you're always taking
the elevator, or the car,

00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:14.480 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, your
body gets lazy.

00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:17.350 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing, if
we use these things,

00:53:17.350 --> 00:53:18.230 align:middle line:90%
our body gets lazy.

00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And our ability to
solve the problems

00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:23.930 align:middle line:90%
ourself, they decrease.

00:53:23.930 --> 00:53:28.700 align:middle line:84%
So I would advocate to try
and get rid of nasal spray,

00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:32.440 align:middle line:84%
and ask the question, what is
the reason behind my blocked

00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:32.940 align:middle line:90%
nose.

00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:36.640 align:middle line:84%
What is the reason behind
whatever health problem I have.

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:39.900 align:middle line:84%
It's usually not--
I mean, a headache

00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:44.440 align:middle line:84%
is not the lack of painkillers,
it's something else.

00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And one thing, which we talked
about earlier, the imbalance

00:53:48.570 --> 00:53:51.530 align:middle line:84%
that's created between
oxygen and carbon dioxide--

00:53:51.530 --> 00:53:56.630 align:middle line:84%
so when we over-breathe, we tend
then to exhale too much carbon

00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:58.600 align:middle line:84%
dioxide, we lower
it in our body,

00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:03.030 align:middle line:84%
and we can see the blocked nose
or the tight airways-- which

00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:06.120 align:middle line:84%
you can get asthma
undiagnosed-- it's

00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:10.070 align:middle line:84%
a defense mechanism from the
body trying to prevent outflow

00:54:10.070 --> 00:54:11.410 align:middle line:90%
of carbon dioxide.

00:54:11.410 --> 00:54:14.760 align:middle line:84%
Because it only leaves
our body on out breath.

00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:17.680 align:middle line:84%
So what many people
find is that,

00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:21.540 align:middle line:84%
when they start to improve their
breathing, and breathe slower,

00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:25.050 align:middle line:84%
and then maintaining more
carbon dioxide in their body,

00:54:25.050 --> 00:54:26.630 align:middle line:84%
they feel that
[SNIFF, SNIFF] oh,

00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:28.260 align:middle line:90%
my nose starts to get freer.

00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And we have these erectile
tissue here in the nose,

00:54:30.930 --> 00:54:36.134 align:middle line:90%
so they start to become smaller.

00:54:36.134 --> 00:54:37.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:54:37.050 --> 00:54:40.390 align:middle line:84%
OK, now what about
using the neti pot,

00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:44.070 align:middle line:84%
a classic old-fashioned way
of keeping the toxins out.

00:54:44.070 --> 00:54:45.465 align:middle line:90%
How does that factor in?

00:54:45.465 --> 00:54:47.590 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: I think that's
great to cleanse the nose.

00:54:47.590 --> 00:54:51.440 align:middle line:84%
But at some point, the nose
is a self-cleansing device,

00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:52.720 align:middle line:90%
extremely efficient.

00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Because all the particles that
end up here on inhalation,

00:54:56.940 --> 00:55:00.990 align:middle line:84%
they will, when we exhale,
so they will be blown out.

00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:04.340 align:middle line:84%
So, at some point,
I think you will not

00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:08.740 align:middle line:84%
need the neti pot when you
improve your breathing habits.

00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:14.460 align:middle line:84%
But it could be really great
when in the beginning if,

00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:15.460 align:middle line:90%
you have a blocked nose.

00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:19.667 align:middle line:84%
And then, finally,
what about asthma?

00:55:19.667 --> 00:55:20.500 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: So asthma.

00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:23.706 align:middle line:90%


00:55:23.706 --> 00:55:25.530 align:middle line:84%
Asthma is a disease
of the airways

00:55:25.530 --> 00:55:29.990 align:middle line:84%
where, it seems like, we again
have this problem with carbon

00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.920 align:middle line:90%
dioxide.

00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And many that have asthma
fears that they cannot inhale.

00:55:37.070 --> 00:55:38.840 align:middle line:84%
They can only breathe
very shallowly.

00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And usually the key is in the
exhale-- to try and prolong

00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:43.470 align:middle line:90%
the exhalation.

00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Not too [EXHALE]
empty the lungs fully,

00:55:46.790 --> 00:55:49.090 align:middle line:84%
but to empty them slightly
a little bit more.

00:55:49.090 --> 00:55:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And then you will automatically
be able to breathe deeper.

00:55:52.340 --> 00:55:56.570 align:middle line:84%
So you will be able to
calm down and change

00:55:56.570 --> 00:55:58.142 align:middle line:90%
this [RAPID BREATHING].

00:55:58.142 --> 00:55:59.850 align:middle line:84%
Because that is how
the breathing usually

00:55:59.850 --> 00:56:02.040 align:middle line:84%
looks when you are about
to get an asthma attack.

00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:05.830 align:middle line:84%
[RAPID BREATH] It's
very fast, it's shallow,

00:56:05.830 --> 00:56:07.380 align:middle line:90%
in and out through the mouth.

00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:12.900 align:middle line:84%
So by just doing the reverse--
mouth breathing, slow and deep,

00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:14.410 align:middle line:90%
you will be able to calm down.

00:56:14.410 --> 00:56:18.129 align:middle line:84%
And the key is usually just
to prolong your exhalation.

00:56:18.129 --> 00:56:18.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:20.310 align:middle line:84%
When someone's having
an asthma attack,

00:56:20.310 --> 00:56:21.780 align:middle line:84%
if they don't have an
inhaler, or if they

00:56:21.780 --> 00:56:23.740 align:middle line:84%
have to deal with it,
just use your breath.

00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:23.940 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yeah.

00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:24.606 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:56:24.606 --> 00:56:26.750 align:middle line:84%
Use the breath and
slow exhalations.

00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And again, if you're
playing with something

00:56:28.810 --> 00:56:31.710 align:middle line:84%
like the Relaxator or
conscious breathing,

00:56:31.710 --> 00:56:35.710 align:middle line:84%
can that help overcome
asthmatic conditions?

00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:38.630 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: I'm not telling anyone
to throw away their medication

00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:39.597 align:middle line:90%
and just breathing.

00:56:39.597 --> 00:56:41.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, but can
it improve the situation?

00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:42.471 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Oh, yeah.

00:56:42.471 --> 00:56:44.810 align:middle line:84%
It can improve,
and it can-- they

00:56:44.810 --> 00:56:46.530 align:middle line:90%
can get rid of it, as well.

00:56:46.530 --> 00:56:48.470 align:middle line:84%
Just imagine having
this, knowing

00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:51.890 align:middle line:84%
that you have this tool
with you all the time.

00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:55.680 align:middle line:84%
It must be very stressful to
have asthma and [GASPING] I

00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:56.380 align:middle line:90%
cannot breathe.

00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:57.910 align:middle line:90%
Where is my meditation?

00:56:57.910 --> 00:57:03.780 align:middle line:84%
And then, come to realization,
I have my breath with me.

00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's-- I
mean, again, it sounds--

00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:08.850 align:middle line:84%
it's the one little miracle
we're always carrying

00:57:08.850 --> 00:57:11.130 align:middle line:84%
in our pocket and
totally unconscious of.

00:57:11.130 --> 00:57:12.160 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yes, true.

00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:13.368 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Any final thoughts?

00:57:13.368 --> 00:57:15.802 align:middle line:90%
We just have a minute or so.

00:57:15.802 --> 00:57:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSSON: Well, the
thing is, of course--

00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:18.634 align:middle line:90%
the knowledge is one thing.

00:57:18.634 --> 00:57:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And the principles
are really easy.

00:57:21.310 --> 00:57:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And we can see-- we
can see up in it,

00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:27.790 align:middle line:84%
like, a minute to
learn but it could

00:57:27.790 --> 00:57:29.900 align:middle line:90%
take a lifetime to master.

00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:32.340 align:middle line:84%
I still consider myself
a rookie, for example.

00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:36.095 align:middle line:84%
I think there is so much
more to do in improving

00:57:36.095 --> 00:57:38.060 align:middle line:90%
our breath in our daily life.

00:57:38.060 --> 00:57:39.435 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Maybe
one good thing is

00:57:39.435 --> 00:57:41.970 align:middle line:84%
to start the day with just
simple, taking five minutes,

00:57:41.970 --> 00:57:43.226 align:middle line:90%
and just consciously breathe.

00:57:43.226 --> 00:57:43.850 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yeah.

00:57:43.850 --> 00:57:46.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To make ourselves
aware of our breath

00:57:46.330 --> 00:57:46.560 align:middle line:90%
throughout the day.

00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:47.768 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: That's a great way.

00:57:47.768 --> 00:57:49.281 align:middle line:10%
Or closing the day before--

00:57:49.281 --> 00:57:50.530 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Or closing the day--

00:57:50.530 --> 00:57:51.863 align:middle line:10%
>>OLSSON: --before going to bed.

00:57:51.863 --> 00:57:54.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --before we tape
our mouths shut for the night.

00:57:54.330 --> 00:57:55.370 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, so much.

00:57:55.370 --> 00:57:58.530 align:middle line:84%
I just, again-- I find this
primal information-- really

00:57:58.530 --> 00:58:00.759 align:middle line:90%
interesting and necessary.

00:58:00.759 --> 00:58:02.800 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and thanks for all
the little devices, too.

00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:03.520 align:middle line:90%
It was great.

00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:04.779 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Yeah?

00:58:04.779 --> 00:58:05.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thanks, Anders.

00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:06.730 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSSON: Thank you.

00:58:06.730 --> 00:58:08.480 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Again, the
name of Anders's book

00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:10.320 align:middle line:10%
is called "The Power
of Your Breath."

00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:13.040 align:middle line:10%
And you can find this and his
other tools on his website

00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:16.210 align:middle line:10%
at TheRelaxator.com or
ConsciousBreathing.com.

00:58:16.210 --> 00:58:21.280 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
