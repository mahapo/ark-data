00:00:20.095 --> 00:00:22.220 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: I think
it's clear to most of us

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.650 align:middle line:10%
that we have a man crisis on
our hands in the Western world.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.560 align:middle line:10%
In short, roles are
changing quickly,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.140 align:middle line:10%
with more women than men
attending and graduating

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.100 align:middle line:10%
from college.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Women have learned to
adapt and now thrive

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.760 align:middle line:90%
in the competitive workforce.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.380 align:middle line:84%
So what's happened
to all the men?

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.250 align:middle line:90%
What is their role now?

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.310 align:middle line:84%
Zeus Yiamouyiannis is
here with us today to dive

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.190 align:middle line:84%
into the pervasive problem
of lost men and boys

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.970 align:middle line:84%
and how to develop a
new masculinity within.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe it's not
fair to say "lost."

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.614 align:middle line:84%
But I think it is fair
to say "challenged."

00:00:49.614 --> 00:00:50.822 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEUS YIAMOUYIANNIS: Mm-hmm.

00:00:50.822 --> 00:00:51.260 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.302 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I have to
say-- because people will

00:00:53.302 --> 00:00:54.520 align:middle line:90%
say, what was his name again?

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.340 align:middle line:90%
Zeus?

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.257 align:middle line:90%
That's your real name.

00:00:56.257 --> 00:00:57.755 align:middle line:90%
It's not your Sedona name.

00:00:57.755 --> 00:00:57.870 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:58.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Your brother's Apollo.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.768 align:middle line:90%
Your sister's Athena.

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And I know how to
pronounce your name

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.360 align:middle line:90%
because you're my sweetie pie.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.318 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to say
that in full disclosure.

00:01:04.318 --> 00:01:06.577 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:01:06.577 --> 00:01:08.660 align:middle line:10%
You wrote a wonderful book
called "The Spiritually

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:09.470 align:middle line:10%
Confident Man."

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.637 align:middle line:10%
And we've finally been able
to have you on the show.

00:01:11.637 --> 00:01:16.310 align:middle line:10%
And your own journey has been a
reflection of what men at large

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.490 align:middle line:10%
are going through.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.700 align:middle line:84%
You're not able to
work off the old way

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.130 align:middle line:84%
and the patriarchal
model is not able to cave

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.770 align:middle line:90%
into the feminine ways, per se.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it for you started
with your grandpa Yemenis,

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.460 align:middle line:84%
before they change your family
name to Yiamouyiannis, right?

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.690 align:middle line:10%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Well, they
changed it at Ellis Island

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:33.230 align:middle line:10%
to Yemenis.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.010 align:middle line:10%
We changed it back.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.940 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You changed it
back to Yiamouyiannis.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.482 align:middle line:10%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
Yiamouyiannis, yeah.

00:01:36.482 --> 00:01:40.150 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And your grandmother,
who was an amazing woman--

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.660 align:middle line:10%
these are both immigrants.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's just start
with your family's story

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.520 align:middle line:84%
and how that trickled
down to your dad,

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.410 align:middle line:84%
how your dad trickle down
and affected all of you,

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.280 align:middle line:84%
and then what you-- now the
story picks up from there.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.197 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yeah.

00:01:53.197 --> 00:01:55.430 align:middle line:84%
So my grandpa was
kind of a man's man.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.440 align:middle line:84%
One time, I joked with
him about fencing,

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.090 align:middle line:84%
because I was doing
varsity fencing

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.740 align:middle line:90%
in college at Ohio State.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.277 align:middle line:84%
And I joked about
doing a duel with him.

00:02:06.277 --> 00:02:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, we'd
have to fight to the death

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.090 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.009 align:middle line:90%
And he was dead serious.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] Grandpa.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.820 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: I'm
like, Grandpa, whoa.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.160 align:middle line:84%
But I think what
he kind of showed

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.390 align:middle line:84%
was this notion of
this sort of machismo,

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.760 align:middle line:84%
this notion of
masculinity, which is,

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to take anything.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.520 align:middle line:90%
It's hard.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.790 align:middle line:84%
The man is out there to protect,
to be a bit of a warrior,

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.460 align:middle line:84%
and to take things
very seriously.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, he
was an immigrant.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:33.725 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: He
was an immigrant.

00:02:33.725 --> 00:02:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: From Greece.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.930 align:middle line:90%
Lesbos, right?

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:35.720 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yep, mm-hmm.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And he was in the
restaurant industry.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.770 align:middle line:84%
So he was trying to make his
way as an immigrant in America

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:40.270 align:middle line:90%
to begin with.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.510 align:middle line:90%
So he has a lot to prove.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.770 align:middle line:90%
Plus he's Greek.

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.200 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: And he
happened to have an affair with

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.842 align:middle line:90%
my grandma--

00:02:46.842 --> 00:02:48.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Who was married
to another Greek man.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.717 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yeah.

00:02:49.717 --> 00:02:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And he was about 14
years her junior.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And my grandma was
something special.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.900 align:middle line:84%
She would have been
cent-to-million CEO

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.070 align:middle line:84%
if she was born in a
somewhat later time.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.320 align:middle line:90%
She came over with nothing.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.420 align:middle line:84%
She didn't even
know the language.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And by the time she
was in her early 20's,

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.820 align:middle line:84%
from having nothing, she
owned an apartment complex

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.110 align:middle line:90%
and a restaurant.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.822 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
my grandpa met her.

00:03:13.822 --> 00:03:15.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Hooked
up with her, yeah.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.155 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yes.

00:03:16.155 --> 00:03:19.700 align:middle line:84%
So it didn't keep
her from wanting

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.070 align:middle line:90%
that vibrant Greek spirit.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And the two of them
then got together.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.092 align:middle line:84%
But it was always a contention
in their relationship,

00:03:26.092 --> 00:03:27.050 align:middle line:90%
all the way to the end.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.750 align:middle line:84%
My grandma died when
she was about 90,

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.072 align:middle line:84%
my grandpa when
he was in his 80s.

00:03:33.072 --> 00:03:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at
that living style.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But Joan
did battle a lot.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.390 align:middle line:84%
Because she was a strong
woman in the time when

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:39.680 align:middle line:90%
this strong man--

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.790 align:middle line:84%
who was wounded by life also,
and started drinking alcohol

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.228 align:middle line:90%
a bit too to contend with life.

00:03:47.228 --> 00:03:48.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But there
was a great story

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.810 align:middle line:84%
that he told me-- this was
when my grandma had died,

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:51.810 align:middle line:90%
and there was a funeral.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:52.970 align:middle line:90%
We were down there--

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.280 align:middle line:84%
about him serving as a
cook during World War

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.150 align:middle line:84%
II in the army, and how
there were starving families.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.960 align:middle line:90%
This is stateside.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.250 align:middle line:84%
This is back in
the United States.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.540 align:middle line:84%
They had some weird practices
about disposing of food.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And he would save stuff that
would have been thrown out

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.540 align:middle line:90%
for these starving families.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And I really saw that
tender side of him.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And behind the machismo,
behind the threats

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.029 align:middle line:84%
of dueling to the
death, I think it's

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:22.220 align:middle line:84%
things like that got me
thinking about this sort

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.220 align:middle line:84%
of twofold nature of man--
what we're expected to be

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.380 align:middle line:84%
and what we kind of
are underneath that.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.067 align:middle line:84%
And your dad is a
wonderful example.

00:04:31.067 --> 00:04:32.900 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people in our
audience would really

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.220 align:middle line:90%
appreciate who your dad was.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.760 align:middle line:84%
Because he was one of the
very first real warriors

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.188 align:middle line:84%
as a scientist in the
subject of fluoridated water.

00:04:41.188 --> 00:04:42.230 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Exactly.

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And tell us a little
bit about that part of his life

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.430 align:middle line:90%
first so people can understand.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.262 align:middle line:84%
This a very respectable,
intelligent man.

00:04:48.262 --> 00:04:49.220 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.590 align:middle line:90%
No, he was a kind of--

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.130 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say renegade, but
certainly he was definitely

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.630 align:middle line:90%
pushing the boundaries.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.310 align:middle line:84%
But he was very well
grounded in science.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And he did
epidemiological studies,

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.500 align:middle line:84%
which are these basic
statistical studies, about

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.700 align:middle line:90%
cancer rates and fluoride.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And he found, along
with Dr. Dean Burke,

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.370 align:middle line:84%
a very strong
connection between it,

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.290 align:middle line:84%
that flouride is causing
many, many deaths per year.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's more chronic,
so it's harder to detect.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.420 align:middle line:84%
But it can pick it
up in the statistics.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.363 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and he was hired
by which company to do this?

00:05:21.363 --> 00:05:23.530 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Chemical
Abstracts is where he was.

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's when we
moved to central Ohio,

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.430 align:middle line:90%
where I grew up on a farm.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.090 align:middle line:84%
But again, he was going
against the establishment.

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.200 align:middle line:84%
So they weren't real
happy about that.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And then he began to
form his own organization

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.895 align:middle line:84%
and basically to
become his own company.

00:05:37.895 --> 00:05:39.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, they
were not expecting

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.160 align:middle line:84%
him to come out on the side
of, this stuff causes cancer,

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:42.960 align:middle line:90%
statistically.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:43.166 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:05:43.166 --> 00:05:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And because he was
a biochemist, he

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.360 align:middle line:84%
understood the biochemical
properties of it.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.710 align:middle line:90%
So he was very well-grounded.

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And he started the Safe Water
Foundation and the National

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.642 align:middle line:90%
Health Action Committee.

00:05:51.642 --> 00:05:52.600 align:middle line:90%
And we grew up in that.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.140 align:middle line:84%
We grew up on an organic farm
with that kind of activism

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.982 align:middle line:84%
and that kind of
anti-establishment--

00:05:58.982 --> 00:06:00.190 align:middle line:90%
and it wasn't conspiratorial.

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.490 align:middle line:90%
It was--

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fact.

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.528 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
--based in hard science.

00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And it was based in basically
moral courage, social courage

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.708 align:middle line:84%
to fight for what
you believe is right,

00:06:07.708 --> 00:06:09.250 align:middle line:84%
to fight for people's
health, to help

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.330 align:middle line:90%
make people aware about things.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
he was a warrior.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And he was out there
selling books out

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.972 align:middle line:84%
of the trunk of his car,
but, like, 35,000 of them.

00:06:18.972 --> 00:06:19.930 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, he was
really successful in his time.

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.790 align:middle line:10%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yeah, his book
"Flouride, the Aging Factor"

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.050 align:middle line:10%
sold 35,000 copies before
the internet of that book.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.400 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.390 align:middle line:10%
I mean, that's amazing.

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yeah.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Was he self-published?

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:30.670 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: He was.

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:31.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.360 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, that just
shows what passion can do.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.750 align:middle line:84%
And so he's out
there doing that.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.680 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, he
was the only offspring

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.140 align:middle line:84%
from your grandparents who had
this contentious relationship.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.230 align:middle line:84%
So on one hand, he
was totally spoiled,

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.300 align:middle line:84%
and the other came down
like a hammer on him.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.310 align:middle line:84%
So as a man, he's getting
a lot of mixed signals

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.590 align:middle line:84%
that he passed on
to your family.

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:52.390 align:middle line:90%
He's gone now.

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:55.840 align:middle line:84%
But he passed on to your
family this incredible conflict

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.410 align:middle line:84%
and confusion, for the men
and the women, the boys

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:01.160 align:middle line:90%
and the girls.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk a
little bit about that.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.640 align:middle line:84%
He was a highly conflicted
individual on certain levels--

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.750 align:middle line:84%
a health nut, teaching us about
this and then drinking Coke--

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.610 align:middle line:90%
or whatever his beverage was--

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:13.540 align:middle line:90%
nonstop.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:13.910 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:14.830 align:middle line:90%
He drank soft drinks.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.640 align:middle line:84%
But he did get rid
of that after a time.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:16.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.240 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: But he
forbade us to drink them.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.563 align:middle line:90%
But he was drinking them.

00:07:20.563 --> 00:07:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And you see those kind
of contradictions a lot

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.528 align:middle line:84%
in masculinity today,
the desire to continue

00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:27.070 align:middle line:84%
with some of the
entitlement and some

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:30.845 align:middle line:84%
of the basis for self-worth that
was given over from the past,

00:07:30.845 --> 00:07:32.470 align:middle line:84%
a lot of it not based
on something that

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:37.420 align:middle line:84%
was equal or fair or merited,
but a desire in some sense

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.940 align:middle line:84%
to break out of the prison
that same kind of privilege

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:41.210 align:middle line:90%
and entitlement provides.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:42.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:43.690 align:middle line:90%
And so he passes this on to you.

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:45.910 align:middle line:84%
Because now, your dad's
in competition with you,

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:47.350 align:middle line:90%
as the eldest son in the family.

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And you're the one that he
comes down on like a hammer.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:52.920 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
And so to me, it

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:58.240 align:middle line:84%
was always about finding
a way to see another not

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.840 align:middle line:84%
just person to person, like me
versus my dad in competition.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.102 align:middle line:84%
I was always searching for
a way to say, hey, wait,

00:08:04.102 --> 00:08:05.560 align:middle line:84%
there's a way to
look at this where

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.875 align:middle line:84%
we can be cooperative
or collaborate on this.

00:08:07.875 --> 00:08:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And that would
come out sometimes

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:10.520 align:middle line:84%
when we were doing
wood together.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.187 align:middle line:84%
I'd say, Dad, don't
put the wedge there.

00:08:12.187 --> 00:08:13.527 align:middle line:90%
That's not going to work.

00:08:13.527 --> 00:08:15.360 align:middle line:84%
It's going to just get
buried in that piece,

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.870 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to get stuck,
because it's going right

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:17.812 align:middle line:90%
toward a knot.

00:08:17.812 --> 00:08:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And he would try
to prove me wrong,

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:21.530 align:middle line:84%
and then end up
proving me right.

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:24.530 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't trying to
use it as a competition.

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:27.160 align:middle line:84%
I think that was partly what
this book is based upon.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.890 align:middle line:84%
How is it that men
can be co-creative,

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:33.580 align:middle line:84%
not only with each other,
but also with women?

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And that is, I
mean, how can I take

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:40.360 align:middle line:84%
his talent, his way of looking
at it, work together with mine,

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.789 align:middle line:84%
and come up with
something, a third way that

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:46.150 align:middle line:84%
is, in some sense, taking
the best of both worlds,

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:49.000 align:middle line:84%
and that doesn't deny
my masculinity, that

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.350 align:middle line:84%
doesn't deny my talent
or my perspective,

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:54.220 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time,
it broadens that,

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.215 align:middle line:84%
deepens that by
engaging another person.

00:08:57.215 --> 00:08:59.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because men tend to
be more loners and distinct

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:02.680 align:middle line:84%
in what they choose as their
mark in life and their path.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And they don't tend to turn
to others too much when

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:06.390 align:middle line:90%
there are issues and so forth.

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:08.480 align:middle line:84%
They're taking more
of an alone path.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And now, I think,
historically, globally, we're

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.540 align:middle line:84%
growing into a time of
collaboration and community.

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.120 align:middle line:90%
And that old way--

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.703 align:middle line:84%
the old warrior
way-- isn't working.

00:09:19.703 --> 00:09:21.620 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Not the
solitary warrior way.

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:22.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The solitary, yeah.

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:24.343 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: We have to
transform the "warrior-ness"

00:09:24.343 --> 00:09:26.800 align:middle line:84%
into one of interdependence
and collaboration.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:27.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's the rub.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.690 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: And we don't
have a lot of background

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:29.750 align:middle line:90%
on that as men.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:31.360 align:middle line:84%
Women tend to have
a little bit more,

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.810 align:middle line:84%
because relationships are
more fundamental to women's

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:36.190 align:middle line:90%
identity.

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:39.070 align:middle line:84%
Relationships in
war and destruction

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:42.730 align:middle line:84%
have been fundamental
to men in sports--

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:44.110 align:middle line:90%
my team against your team.

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:47.290 align:middle line:84%
But the notion of working on
a creative project, especially

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:50.620 align:middle line:84%
one that includes
women, is not something

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.140 align:middle line:84%
that we have been
well-prepared to do.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I can say
from a lifetime of experience

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:59.570 align:middle line:84%
in the media, you can be
sitting there as a woman--

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:02.230 align:middle line:84%
as the only woman in the room--
giving a perfectly viable

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:05.290 align:middle line:84%
solution or option
or creative input,

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:07.000 align:middle line:90%
and you're not listened to.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:07.810 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
That's exactly right.

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:09.852 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you how many
times I've experimented

00:10:09.852 --> 00:10:11.800 align:middle line:84%
and also even pointed
out that I just

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.560 align:middle line:84%
raised the exact same
point, almost word for word,

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.570 align:middle line:84%
that a woman in our
little conference

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:19.770 align:middle line:84%
or whatever had raised,
and it wasn't taken up.

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:21.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But if you said
it, they would hear you.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.650 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever point it
out to the other men

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:25.050 align:middle line:84%
and say, do you know
she just said this?

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:26.592 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
Yeah, I would do it.

00:10:26.592 --> 00:10:29.430 align:middle line:84%
And this happens in enlightened
environments, like academia.

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:34.380 align:middle line:84%
It's unconscious, it's
entrained, and it's confining,

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:35.700 align:middle line:90%
not just for women.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:40.890 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the obvious
insult and the obvious making

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.860 align:middle line:84%
invisible, that woman
in that situation.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:49.695 align:middle line:84%
But in a man, it does something
also that's not helpful.

00:10:49.695 --> 00:10:51.570 align:middle line:84%
He's basically borrowing
someone else's ideas

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:53.600 align:middle line:90%
and pretending it's his.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.940 align:middle line:84%
It erodes his ability to
think of his own ideas

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:58.817 align:middle line:84%
instead of just owning
other people's ideas.

00:10:58.817 --> 00:11:00.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's demeaning
to every party involved--

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:01.215 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Exactly.

00:11:01.215 --> 00:11:02.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --in that
it's ubiquitous.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:03.592 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Exactly.

00:11:03.592 --> 00:11:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And this is another thing that
I try to discuss in the book.

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And that is so-called
advantages of men, or benefits,

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:12.520 align:middle line:84%
at the expense of another
person always seem

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.660 align:middle line:84%
to have greater damages
than the supposed benefits.

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:19.260 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the
feminist analysis

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:23.160 align:middle line:84%
will say men benefit from
having higher pay than a woman,

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.140 align:middle line:84%
or benefit from,
like the example you

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:28.618 align:middle line:84%
used, being listened to when the
woman's not being listened to.

00:11:28.618 --> 00:11:30.660 align:middle line:84%
But what are the damages
for something like that?

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:31.800 align:middle line:90%
Those are rarely explored.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.320 align:middle line:84%
They're not being
exploited by women, by men,

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.420 align:middle line:84%
or by feminists, because
they're concentrating

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:37.530 align:middle line:90%
on a different focus.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.210 align:middle line:84%
But here are some
of the problems.

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:42.120 align:middle line:84%
You're not coming up
with your own ideas.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:46.560 align:middle line:90%
You are finding pressure.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.720 align:middle line:84%
You're starting to get
this kind of stress

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.115 align:middle line:84%
or anxiety around whether or
not you're worth something.

00:11:51.115 --> 00:11:53.490 align:middle line:84%
Because you're not actually
being the one producing them.

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:55.440 align:middle line:84%
You're kind of being the one
to shuttle them around and own

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.400 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And the more and
more you go down

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:00.450 align:middle line:84%
that path, the more
and more the facade

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:03.160 align:middle line:84%
varies from your
actual capabilities.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:03.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:04.918 align:middle line:90%
Now that's interesting.

00:12:04.918 --> 00:12:07.560 align:middle line:84%
Because it brings
to mind something

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.690 align:middle line:84%
that I've shared with
you before privately.

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And that is, I was talking to
a mutual friend of ours called

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.760 align:middle line:84%
Howard years ago,
and I was saying,

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:18.710 align:middle line:84%
god, I just don't know if I can
bring this project to fruition.

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:20.460 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of like,
oh, I hope I'm worthy.

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:21.690 align:middle line:90%
I hope it's good enough.

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And he said, let me
tell you something.

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And he had told me about a
study of Fortune 500 executives.

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.540 align:middle line:90%
And it talked about their--

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.660 align:middle line:84%
they were anonymous--
personality traits,

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:36.070 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what
made them successful

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:37.560 align:middle line:90%
and what was your greatest fear.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And the greatest
fear was that they

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.642 align:middle line:84%
were afraid of being discovered
for the frauds that they were.

00:12:42.642 --> 00:12:44.100 align:middle line:84%
Because they were
actually standing

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.233 align:middle line:84%
on so many other
people's shoulders.

00:12:46.233 --> 00:12:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And these are the people on
the front of all the magazines

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:50.852 align:middle line:84%
that we tend to herald
in this world, you know?

00:12:50.852 --> 00:12:51.810 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
that's problematic.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping, with this more
interdependent way that we're

00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:00.930 align:middle line:84%
going forward, that we're
going to be able to understand

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:05.220 align:middle line:84%
that it's not your
position or your status,

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.290 align:middle line:84%
whether you're man or
woman in the situation.

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:10.560 align:middle line:84%
It's more about what
you as a spirit,

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:14.130 align:middle line:84%
as a human being with
certain talents and passions,

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:15.840 align:middle line:90%
bring to the table.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And that can include
that warrior passion.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:21.390 align:middle line:84%
That can include this
animal man passion.

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:24.300 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be
politically correct.

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:28.053 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be overly
constructed or overly produced.

00:13:28.053 --> 00:13:28.970 align:middle line:90%
And we'll go through--

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:29.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We'll talk about that.

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.320 align:middle line:90%
But it has to be authentic.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:31.650 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: It
has to be authentic.

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:33.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have to show
up as authentically you.

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:35.070 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
Yeah, and you don't

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:37.930 align:middle line:84%
have to make excuses for
being a man in today's world,

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:39.190 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe.

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:41.610 align:middle line:84%
But there are going
to be other ways

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:44.850 align:middle line:84%
to express it, more
powerful ways to express it,

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:46.567 align:middle line:90%
than enjoying another person--

00:13:46.567 --> 00:13:47.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Including women.

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:48.240 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
--including women--

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:52.230 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: --that allow
you to feel it, to share it,

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.480 align:middle line:84%
and to build something stronger
together with other people.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's, again,
where men have not

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:01.500 align:middle line:84%
been taught very
well how to work it.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:05.070 align:middle line:84%
They've been taught about
objects, about tasks.

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And I still think
there's room for that

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:08.435 align:middle line:84%
when you're doing
work around the house

00:14:08.435 --> 00:14:09.792 align:middle line:90%
or you've got a project going.

00:14:09.792 --> 00:14:11.250 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes
to relationships,

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:12.900 align:middle line:84%
and when it comes to
projects together,

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.200 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't work very well.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.075 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It doesn't.

00:14:15.075 --> 00:14:17.250 align:middle line:84%
So we have to bust a
couple of old paradigms,

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:18.452 align:middle line:90%
really, to break through.

00:14:18.452 --> 00:14:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is
thousands-of-years-old

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.180 align:middle line:90%
patriarchy.

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:22.722 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
evidence when we look

00:14:22.722 --> 00:14:24.690 align:middle line:84%
into ancient, ancient
history and lore

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:27.273 align:middle line:84%
that there have been times and
places throughout history where

00:14:27.273 --> 00:14:30.960 align:middle line:84%
women have been strong and have
been in power and powerful,

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.760 align:middle line:84%
but not the last few thousand
years around this planet.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And so we have these
passed on-- whatever

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.170 align:middle line:84%
you want to call
them-- inherited--

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:42.450 align:middle line:84%
cellular genetic memories
of our roles in the world,

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:44.730 align:middle line:84%
or you can say directly
passed through from past life

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:45.530 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:46.860 align:middle line:90%
But they're pretty set.

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.680 align:middle line:90%
And they're deeply subconscious.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.060 align:middle line:84%
So we've got the
patriarchal paradigm.

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the
Industrial Age paradigm,

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:59.040 align:middle line:84%
which really, I think,
just denigrated humanity.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.940 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, before
we go into those,

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.950 align:middle line:84%
we need to just discuss
the title of your book.

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:07.290 align:middle line:84%
Because then I want to get
into these two factors.

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:09.435 align:middle line:10%
It's called "The
Spiritually Confident Man."

00:15:09.435 --> 00:15:11.310 align:middle line:10%
Now, some people might
look and say, oh, it's

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:13.590 align:middle line:10%
a religious book about men?

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:15.678 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean by
spiritual confidence?

00:15:15.678 --> 00:15:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Well, the first
thing is that spirit itself,

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:21.980 align:middle line:84%
in the way that I understand
it, is basically a high degree

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:24.140 align:middle line:90%
of conscious energy--

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:28.250 align:middle line:84%
an energy with a high
degree of consciousness.

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:29.870 align:middle line:90%
It's not simply just faith.

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:32.240 align:middle line:90%
It's not religiously based.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.470 align:middle line:84%
It's really the spark of
life that goes through us.

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And to the degree that we
have spiritual confidence,

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:42.980 align:middle line:84%
it's that this energy is
allowed to work in our lives

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.830 align:middle line:84%
and come to the forefront
rather than simply be

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:49.680 align:middle line:84%
a luxury or something we
hide in the background.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.130 align:middle line:84%
So that's about stepping
forward and letting

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:54.540 align:middle line:84%
this passion and the
spirit come forward.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
have, as spirit

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:59.810 align:middle line:84%
does, a desire to connect
with others, a desire

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:02.852 align:middle line:84%
to be vulnerable, to be
open, to be expressive--

00:16:02.852 --> 00:16:04.310 align:middle line:84%
a lot of things
that are oftentimes

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:05.930 align:middle line:90%
associated with femininity.

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:08.330 align:middle line:84%
But there are ways in
which men can do this too.

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:11.020 align:middle line:84%
So the spirituality
is this energy.

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:12.020 align:middle line:90%
It's not about religion.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:16.120 align:middle line:84%
And confidence is the ability
to bring it into the forefront

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:19.010 align:middle line:84%
and combine it with your
passions and talents,

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:21.713 align:middle line:84%
and be able to have
that as a means

00:16:21.713 --> 00:16:23.630 align:middle line:84%
to connect with somebody
else and their spirit

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:24.440 align:middle line:90%
and their energy.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.260 align:middle line:90%
And finally, the man part--

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:30.020 align:middle line:84%
the man part is that there are
distinct ways in which men--

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:33.140 align:middle line:84%
the polarity of masculinity,
the polarity of manhood--

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:35.810 align:middle line:90%
can do that and can contribute.

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:37.730 align:middle line:84%
So the spiritually
confident man is the one

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:41.510 align:middle line:84%
who recognizes that
spiritual energy,

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:43.670 align:middle line:84%
brings it forth,
and then understands

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:46.640 align:middle line:84%
that it is an expression
of me as a man, and not

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.710 align:middle line:84%
simply just getting
rid of my manhood

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:50.390 align:middle line:90%
in order to be spiritual.

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:53.395 align:middle line:84%
So those are the ways
that I would lay it out.

00:16:53.395 --> 00:16:54.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
it's interesting.

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:56.145 align:middle line:84%
Because the whole
notion of being

00:16:56.145 --> 00:16:57.950 align:middle line:84%
a man is so complex
to begin with.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:59.510 align:middle line:90%
It is for women too.

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:01.535 align:middle line:84%
When you start going
further and further into it

00:17:01.535 --> 00:17:03.360 align:middle line:84%
and you listen to women
talking about men-- oh,

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.160 align:middle line:90%
they're just boys.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.420 align:middle line:90%
Ah, he's never going to learn.

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:07.369 align:middle line:84%
You know, there are kind
of demeaning comments

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:08.630 align:middle line:90%
about men behind the scenes.

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:11.305 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's just how it is
when you get women together.

00:17:11.305 --> 00:17:12.680 align:middle line:84%
You know, he's
like a little kid.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.847 align:middle line:90%
He's never going to grow up.

00:17:13.847 --> 00:17:15.230 align:middle line:90%
I just had to accept it.

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And then you think in
terms of the great writers,

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:22.880 align:middle line:84%
and poets, and
lyricists, and musicians.

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.130 align:middle line:84%
Granted, part of it was,
women weren't really allowed

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:27.530 align:middle line:90%
into that arena.

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:31.730 align:middle line:84%
But right down to troubadours,
this really deep kind

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:35.780 align:middle line:84%
of yearning and such, these
were the works of men.

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Now that is
extraordinarily vulnerable,

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:40.357 align:middle line:84%
just to lay that
array of feelings out.

00:17:40.357 --> 00:17:41.940 align:middle line:84%
We say men never
share their feelings.

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:45.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, look at some of the
classic poems and plays

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:45.950 align:middle line:90%
and love songs.

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:47.615 align:middle line:90%
These were written by men.

00:17:47.615 --> 00:17:49.250 align:middle line:84%
So there is this
really deep side

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:52.850 align:middle line:84%
that wants to express
itself, but the average man

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:55.910 align:middle line:84%
doesn't feel can express
itself without losing face

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:56.858 align:middle line:90%
on some level.

00:17:56.858 --> 00:17:58.400 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
That's largely true.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.670 align:middle line:90%
I think that's changing.

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:05.870 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned lost or
struggling men and boys.

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:08.120 align:middle line:84%
It's like what's happened
early with chatrooms

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.380 align:middle line:90%
or early internet.

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.780 align:middle line:84%
We're kind of floundering
around, trying

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:15.380 align:middle line:84%
to find our legs, kind
of not looking terribly

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:17.080 align:middle line:90%
intelligent or competent.

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:17.880 align:middle line:90%
And that's OK.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.410 align:middle line:84%
That's part of
confidence too, is

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:21.770 align:middle line:84%
to let yourself look
a bit like a fool,

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:24.860 align:middle line:84%
but continue to allow that
thing to come forward,

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:27.980 align:middle line:84%
that passion to come
forward, confidence

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:32.090 align:middle line:84%
to be able to be a fool, but
not to let yourself just stick

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:33.950 align:middle line:84%
with that right, to
go through that part

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:41.000 align:middle line:84%
where it may look like you're
not as competent or as manly

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.930 align:middle line:90%
or having it all together.

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And I really admire
men who can do that.

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And you look at entrepreneurs
and you look at some others.

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:50.420 align:middle line:84%
Those areas, you're
allowed to do it as a man,

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:51.868 align:middle line:90%
to fail spectacularly.

00:18:51.868 --> 00:18:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah, go
bankrupt three times

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:54.380 align:middle line:90%
and recreate yourself.

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yeah, it's
almost like a badge of honor.

00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:57.920 align:middle line:90%
But you look at other areas--

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.470 align:middle line:84%
artistic creation,
relationship with women,

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:01.880 align:middle line:90%
relationship with other men--

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.650 align:middle line:90%
those are much less developed.

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And we need to have more
development in that way.

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's overlay
industrialization over that,

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:15.290 align:middle line:84%
and all the inherent kind of
issues that are already there.

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:16.640 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, we had patriarchy
for several thousand years.

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.720 align:middle line:84%
I have a whole chapter
of this on my book.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.762 align:middle line:84%
We kind of outline how
that happened religiously,

00:19:22.762 --> 00:19:24.540 align:middle line:90%
socially, politically.

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:27.570 align:middle line:84%
And then we hit the
Industrial Age on top of that.

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:29.960 align:middle line:10%
So we had the dominance
of men over women

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:33.140 align:middle line:10%
in terms of decision making
and in terms of owning property

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:34.320 align:middle line:10%
and so forth.

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And then we got into an
area in the mid-1800s

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:41.580 align:middle line:84%
in which technology
was starting to emerge.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.240 align:middle line:84%
And the world was
seen as a machine.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And men were being
taught to be machines.

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:48.710 align:middle line:84%
So you'd look at
them, how they were

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:51.638 align:middle line:84%
going to work in
cubicles or factories--

00:19:51.638 --> 00:19:52.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Assembly lines.

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: --and
literally becoming a cog

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:56.840 align:middle line:90%
on an assembly line.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And there was being a separation
of labor and segmentation.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.770 align:middle line:84%
A woman's place was now
totally in the home.

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:07.190 align:middle line:84%
Men's place was totally
in the public workspace.

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And then there was social things
that would gather around that

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.380 align:middle line:90%
too with the segmentation.

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:16.010 align:middle line:84%
So not only were men
and women segmented,

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:18.500 align:middle line:84%
but there was a dehumanizing
work that was being brought

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:21.990 align:middle line:84%
into the situation, in which,
instead of being spiritual,

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:25.233 align:middle line:84%
which has connection,
"organic-ness," expressiveness,

00:20:25.233 --> 00:20:26.150 align:middle line:90%
choice, authenticity--

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:26.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Creativity.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.940 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: --creativity,
you are literally

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:31.313 align:middle line:90%
becoming almost an object.

00:20:31.313 --> 00:20:32.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Part of a machine.

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.272 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Part
of a machine in order

00:20:34.272 --> 00:20:37.730 align:middle line:84%
to produce products to make
very few people, usually, very

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:41.120 align:middle line:84%
wealthy, and the rest of
the people not so much so.

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, a lot of elderly
are falling through the cracks,

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.230 align:middle line:84%
children were falling
through the cracks,

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:47.390 align:middle line:84%
women were falling through
the cracks in this.

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And there wasn't an opportunity
to really express that spirit

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.000 align:middle line:90%
or be confident in that spirit.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, because
of the oppressive of that,

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.950 align:middle line:84%
men would bring
their problems home,

00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:00.260 align:middle line:84%
creating problems at
home between women

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:01.750 align:middle line:90%
and their children as well.

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:03.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And including
domestic violence--

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:04.175 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
Domestic violence.

00:21:04.175 --> 00:21:06.225 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and even
more subjugation.

00:21:06.225 --> 00:21:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And the flip side of this,
throughout the patriarchal age

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:15.050 align:middle line:84%
and through the
Industrial Ages, with men

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:16.730 align:middle line:84%
that were being
suppressed, really,

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:19.940 align:middle line:84%
by the zeitgeist that
had been created by

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:21.590 align:middle line:90%
whomever to begin with--

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:24.650 align:middle line:90%
we can go way back on that one--

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:30.560 align:middle line:84%
it left women really with only
one reliable means of getting

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.120 align:middle line:90%
what they wanted out of life.

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.645 align:middle line:84%
And that was, by and
large, manipulation.

00:21:34.645 --> 00:21:36.770 align:middle line:84%
If you couldn't overtly
come out and say, hey, this

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:38.780 align:middle line:84%
is what I want and this
is how I want to do it,

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:40.447 align:middle line:84%
because no one's going
to listen to you,

00:21:40.447 --> 00:21:42.560 align:middle line:84%
you manipulate your
way through it.

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And then it created this huge
and denigrating situation

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:48.508 align:middle line:90%
of competition between women.

00:21:48.508 --> 00:21:49.550 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Exactly.

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:53.217 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because if your source
of survival as a man, and you

00:21:53.217 --> 00:21:54.800 align:middle line:84%
don't have any other
way in the world,

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:58.220 align:middle line:84%
unless you happen to have a
wealthy relative or something,

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:00.410 align:middle line:84%
you really had no
choice, if you wanted

00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:04.160 align:middle line:84%
to have any kind of life, but to
manipulate for what you wanted.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And these tendencies are still
very strong in men and women

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:09.980 align:middle line:90%
all over the world today.

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:10.280 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: It is.

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And people think
of them as natural.

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:12.560 align:middle line:90%
They're not.

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:13.643 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, they're not.

00:22:13.643 --> 00:22:16.040 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: They're
heavily accentuated and adaptive

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:21.290 align:middle line:84%
and made hyper-concentrated
in the industrial era.

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:26.780 align:middle line:84%
We think that these things
happen such a long time.

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:28.910 align:middle line:84%
I believe when I was
in graduate school,

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:31.930 align:middle line:84%
they said that even abortion
within the Catholic church

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:33.930 align:middle line:84%
came in the middle of the
Industrial Revolution.

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:34.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.110 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
About 1850, 1860,

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:38.120 align:middle line:84%
it became more of
an official policy.

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:40.100 align:middle line:84%
People think that
that's been forever.

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:42.600 align:middle line:90%
But again, you needed people.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:43.400 align:middle line:90%
You needed people.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To fill the machinery.

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.017 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: To fill the
machinery, to keep breathing,

00:22:47.017 --> 00:22:50.353 align:middle line:84%
or to get people into churches
or get people into factories.

00:22:50.353 --> 00:22:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And what I like
about your point--

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:53.187 align:middle line:84%
and I think it's
really important,

00:22:53.187 --> 00:22:55.358 align:middle line:84%
and it hadn't quite
struck me until now--

00:22:55.358 --> 00:22:57.650 align:middle line:84%
is that so many of the ways
in which women have adapted

00:22:57.650 --> 00:22:59.990 align:middle line:84%
to that and created
in their own identity

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:02.470 align:middle line:84%
certain personality
characteristics or habits

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:03.995 align:middle line:90%
are an adaption to the way men--

00:23:03.995 --> 00:23:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:06.828 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: --have
accepted certain things

00:23:06.828 --> 00:23:09.150 align:middle line:84%
and forced women into a
compensatory situation.

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:11.500 align:middle line:84%
Then they begin to
become kept competitive.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And before you know it, we
talk about battle of the sexes.

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:15.680 align:middle line:84%
Because they've been
forced be competitive

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:17.540 align:middle line:84%
with each other, and, to a
certain degree, with men.

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.850 align:middle line:84%
Men have been forced to be
competitive with each other.

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And then they use Darwin
to say all this is natural.

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:23.610 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:25.850 align:middle line:84%
It's all a product of
this industrial mentality

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:28.290 align:middle line:84%
that we're beginning
to break out of now.

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:29.090 align:middle line:90%
Thank heavens.

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:31.310 align:middle line:84%
But we don't really
have very good ways

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:32.690 align:middle line:90%
of working through those habits.

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:34.690 align:middle line:84%
That's part of the reason
why I wrote this book.

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:36.410 align:middle line:84%
I want to help
provide some tools

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:37.682 align:middle line:90%
to look past these habits.

00:23:37.682 --> 00:23:39.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In fact,
you go so far as

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.795 align:middle line:84%
to say that the Industrial
Age were the real Dark Ages.

00:23:41.795 --> 00:23:42.920 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: They were.

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.087 align:middle line:84%
I call them the second Dark
Ages, because of the way

00:23:45.087 --> 00:23:48.410 align:middle line:84%
they dehumanized men,
women, and children.

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:53.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, child labor
was insanely available

00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:54.380 align:middle line:90%
all across the country.

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And the first laws were not
passed until the early 1900s.

00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:59.390 align:middle line:90%
It was ridiculous.

00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're just now
emerging from the modern Dark

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:04.940 align:middle line:84%
Ages-- the Industrial Age to the
Information Age to the whatever

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:05.870 align:middle line:90%
age--

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:10.130 align:middle line:84%
hopefully Co-Creative Age
if these kinds of theories

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:13.760 align:middle line:84%
start making it into
the mass psyche.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.220 align:middle line:84%
So for the time being, I
want to go into the book

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:19.850 align:middle line:84%
itself and talk about one
of the chapters you have

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:21.665 align:middle line:90%
which has typology in it.

00:24:21.665 --> 00:24:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And the people that have
read the book always

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:28.983 align:middle line:84%
love that particular chapter,
because, if you're a woman,

00:24:28.983 --> 00:24:30.650 align:middle line:84%
you can see the men
in your life there--

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:34.460 align:middle line:84%
your father, your brother,
your son, your friend, cousin.

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:38.500 align:middle line:84%
You can see the men fall
into one of these topologies.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that you're
trying to diminish or put

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:44.090 align:middle line:90%
people in a box per se.

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:47.950 align:middle line:84%
It's just to show the
levels of the way men

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:50.510 align:middle line:84%
are trying to contend
with breaking out

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:51.690 align:middle line:90%
from the patriarchy.

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:52.490 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:53.630 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: And
to express themselves.

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
express themselves.

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: And
it all founds itself

00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:59.270 align:middle line:84%
on the alternative to the
Industrial Revolution,

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:02.480 align:middle line:84%
what I call divine
genius, or unique genius.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And these different types of
manhood that I talk about in--

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:07.460 align:middle line:90%
I believe it's chapter two--

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:11.030 align:middle line:84%
nine different forms of man,
three different types of men--

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:15.740 align:middle line:84%
really accept this basic
principle of divine genius

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:16.630 align:middle line:90%
into the heart.

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And that is, every man,
every woman, every child,

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:21.720 align:middle line:84%
every human being, perhaps
every entity of any sort

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:25.380 align:middle line:84%
has a "nowhere else in
the universe" unique

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:29.970 align:middle line:84%
something they're contributing--
unique energy, unique spirit.

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:32.730 align:middle line:84%
That I'm offering
now because I really

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:36.928 align:middle line:84%
want that to be the
place that you can go to.

00:25:36.928 --> 00:25:38.970 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you don't
have to prove yourself.

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:40.620 align:middle line:90%
It's already there.

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And these different
forms of manhood

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.820 align:middle line:84%
are ways to explore
and express that.

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And you've been a number
of these types yourself.

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:47.490 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yes, yes.

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:49.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're still
evolving through all of them.

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:50.165 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yes.

00:25:50.165 --> 00:25:53.760 align:middle line:10%
So now, from a negative,
I've got to prove myself,

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:56.182 align:middle line:10%
or I've got to keep people
from seeing my weaknesses,

00:25:56.182 --> 00:25:57.640 align:middle line:10%
to a positive,
where you're saying,

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.790 align:middle line:10%
listen, I'll do
anything to passionately

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:02.250 align:middle line:10%
express this divine genius
and to find out what it is,

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:03.735 align:middle line:10%
including making
mistakes, trying

00:26:03.735 --> 00:26:04.860 align:middle line:10%
different forms of manhood.

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:05.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Being a fool.

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:06.965 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
Being a bit of a fool.

00:26:06.965 --> 00:26:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And you know, at the same time,
maybe you are a big macho man,

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:13.520 align:middle line:84%
and maybe you did step on
somebody's toes, you know?

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.335 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't preclude
you from apologizing.

00:26:15.335 --> 00:26:16.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
and still trying

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:18.220 align:middle line:90%
to express this divine genius.

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:19.020 align:middle line:90%
But here we are.

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:21.990 align:middle line:84%
Let's just kind of
set up the times.

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:24.480 align:middle line:84%
The Industrial Age
is essentially,

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.900 align:middle line:84%
at least in the Western
world, winding down now.

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Yet it's broken the spirit
of the generations right

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:31.470 align:middle line:90%
through our generation.

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:33.300 align:middle line:90%
It has broken those spirits.

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.460 align:middle line:84%
Millennials and
younger are now free,

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:37.480 align:middle line:84%
because those jobs
aren't there anymore.

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.900 align:middle line:84%
At least in the Western world,
they're not there anymore.

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:42.120 align:middle line:84%
So now we have to
recreate ourselves

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:43.478 align:middle line:90%
as something new, fresh.

00:26:43.478 --> 00:26:44.520 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Exactly.

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:48.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so at the
same time this is happening,

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:51.360 align:middle line:84%
we're now seeing the
installation of autocratic

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.160 align:middle line:90%
leaders--

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.690 align:middle line:90%
all these strong men leaders--

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:55.770 align:middle line:90%
across the world--

00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:58.140 align:middle line:84%
South America, Europe,
even America-- a lot

00:26:58.140 --> 00:26:59.430 align:middle line:90%
would argue, even in America.

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:01.590 align:middle line:84%
Whether you like Trump
or you don't like Trump,

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:03.820 align:middle line:84%
he's more of an
autocratic type of leader.

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:06.060 align:middle line:84%
So this is happening
everywhere though.

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:08.310 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
what's up with that?

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:10.620 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
go into this kind of man

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:14.480 align:middle line:84%
that you have a particular
label for, so to speak,

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.442 align:middle line:90%
or a definition.

00:27:15.442 --> 00:27:16.400 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:19.420 align:middle line:84%
You see it in Brazil,
Italy, Turkey.

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:20.220 align:middle line:90%
You name it.

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:23.430 align:middle line:84%
It's all over the
world, even India--

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:26.040 align:middle line:84%
traditional, sort
of patriarchal men

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:28.080 align:middle line:84%
stepping forward and
saying, wait a minute,

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.390 align:middle line:90%
this world has run amok.

00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:33.930 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, it has to do with
women and minority groups

00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:36.718 align:middle line:90%
and so forth gaining power.

00:27:36.718 --> 00:27:38.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You need to give
your power back to us.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:39.802 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Exactly.

00:27:39.802 --> 00:27:42.690 align:middle line:84%
Basically, it's like, we
need to put our stamp on it.

00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's accentuated by
the desperation created

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:49.620 align:middle line:84%
and the anxiety and the kind
of dispersed sort of sense

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:51.667 align:middle line:84%
of identity created
by all these changes.

00:27:51.667 --> 00:27:52.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's true.

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Because across the
world, the one thing

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:58.080 align:middle line:84%
that's stepping up into creating
kind of fundamentalism of sorts

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:01.160 align:middle line:84%
is fear of others
that are emerging.

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.210 align:middle line:84%
This world, this
economic structure,

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:05.190 align:middle line:84%
the power structure
of the Western world

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:09.120 align:middle line:84%
has been run basically by white
men for a really long time.

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.220 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's in everyone's genes.

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:13.470 align:middle line:84%
You just expect, yeah,
a rich, white guy's

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:14.730 align:middle line:90%
going to run the show.

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:15.850 align:middle line:90%
That's changed.

00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:17.260 align:middle line:90%
It's not white guys anymore.

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:19.980 align:middle line:84%
It's all different
colors of guys and women,

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:23.700 align:middle line:84%
who are now totally competent
and now have staged with them.

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:26.003 align:middle line:84%
And this scares a lot
of people, because they

00:28:26.003 --> 00:28:27.420 align:middle line:84%
don't know what
that world's going

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:30.060 align:middle line:84%
to look like where they're not
entitled and preferred anymore.

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:30.300 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And you see it in a lot of
these so-called strongmen.

00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:34.440 align:middle line:84%
I like to call them weak
men, because they are.

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:37.710 align:middle line:84%
You see a facade of
bluster, of narcissism.

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And then you look behind that
to their actual capabilities,

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:42.690 align:middle line:84%
and it only proves
what I had said earlier

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:45.260 align:middle line:84%
in our interview, which
is, the more and more

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:47.760 align:middle line:84%
you follow that more patriarchal
line, the more and more you

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.980 align:middle line:84%
build up an external
facade that's

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:52.570 align:middle line:84%
more and more distant from
your internal capability.

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:53.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: And
so then you really

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:56.533 align:middle line:84%
have to start blasting
people and using your power

00:28:56.533 --> 00:28:58.320 align:middle line:84%
and position when
people call you out.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, like
the Fortune 500 CEOs

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:02.848 align:middle line:84%
that were afraid of being
found out to be frauds.

00:29:02.848 --> 00:29:03.890 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Exactly.

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:04.690 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:08.790 align:middle line:84%
So see what damage
that causes to a man.

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:11.320 align:middle line:84%
It will arrest his
development and his growth.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.140 align:middle line:84%
Because he is struggling
to compensate.

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And he is struggling to project
an image at odds with reality.

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:21.330 align:middle line:84%
Why not begin to get into
the reality, especially

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:25.290 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual reality, of
a man, make that vibrant,

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:27.100 align:middle line:90%
and turn that all around?

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And let's want to be
a fool, experiment,

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:32.490 align:middle line:84%
to engage with women,
to engage with children,

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:34.020 align:middle line:84%
to engage with
other ethnicities,

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:37.230 align:middle line:84%
to see what I'm about, what
this divine genius can do,

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:38.760 align:middle line:90%
how it can interact with others.

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:41.460 align:middle line:84%
That sense of
curiosity and passion

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:43.972 align:middle line:84%
then overtake this notion of
image making and oppression.

00:29:43.972 --> 00:29:45.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, so let's
go ahead and label it.

00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:48.877 align:middle line:84%
So we were talking about
the toxic animal man.

00:29:48.877 --> 00:29:50.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, one thing about the
toxic animal man-- and we

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.050 align:middle line:90%
have lots of examples.

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:53.880 align:middle line:90%
They're in the news everyday--

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:58.085 align:middle line:84%
which are these guys that you
just described, basically.

00:29:58.085 --> 00:29:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Like
Harvey Weinstein.

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:01.085 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
Harvey Weinstein.

00:30:01.085 --> 00:30:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And what you did-- there's
a complementary chapter

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:05.040 align:middle line:84%
in the book for
movie buffs where

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:08.280 align:middle line:84%
you use characters
that are exemplified

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:10.650 align:middle line:84%
in these roles on
the big screen.

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:14.010 align:middle line:10%
And so the movie "Wall
Street," for anyone who

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:16.092 align:middle line:10%
has seen that, and
Michael Douglas, right?

00:30:16.092 --> 00:30:17.050 align:middle line:10%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:18.220 align:middle line:10%
Mr. "Greed Is Good."

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:19.220 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Greed is good!

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:21.650 align:middle line:10%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: If you can
find a crooked way to get it,

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:22.710 align:middle line:10%
it doesn't matter.

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:24.933 align:middle line:84%
It's all about winning,
no matter how you win.

00:30:24.933 --> 00:30:27.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And even worse,
"The Wolf of Wall Street,"

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:29.270 align:middle line:84%
which I could barely
watch, more recently,

00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:32.630 align:middle line:84%
that's that on acid
or cocaine, gone

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:35.540 align:middle line:84%
totally out of control,
where now you just use

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:36.770 align:middle line:90%
and exploit everybody.

00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:38.390 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't even have to be real.

00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:40.180 align:middle line:84%
It's not like a
hard-fought battle.

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:42.020 align:middle line:90%
It's just rigged.

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:45.800 align:middle line:90%
And everything is a false game.

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.810 align:middle line:90%
And you use women.

00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:49.130 align:middle line:90%
You use everybody.

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:49.630 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Exactly.

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:51.005 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about it.

00:30:51.005 --> 00:30:55.520 align:middle line:84%
And women are often really
attracted to these guys, right?

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.440 align:middle line:90%
They have the animal magnetism.

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:58.070 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
Well, first of all,

00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:00.290 align:middle line:84%
when I talk about the animal
man, I do, in my book,

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:01.670 align:middle line:90%
talk about the regressed form.

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:02.810 align:middle line:90%
That's a toxic man.

00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:03.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's a toxic man.

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:04.340 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: The
transitional form,

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:07.340 align:middle line:84%
which is the striving man,
the one who's a real gamesman,

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:09.590 align:middle line:84%
and the responsible man,
which is like the family man.

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:10.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're
going to go through that.

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:13.430 align:middle line:84%
So what is it women see in
this toxic form, which is just

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:14.930 align:middle line:84%
"take the world
the way you want it

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:16.340 align:middle line:90%
and everyone is your servant?"

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times,
it can have a lot

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:19.532 align:middle line:90%
of narcissism attached to it.

00:31:19.532 --> 00:31:20.990 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
I think it is just

00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:23.630 align:middle line:90%
pure desire and force of will.

00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:24.895 align:middle line:90%
That's attractive.

00:31:24.895 --> 00:31:26.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, when
you see that, when

00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:28.970 align:middle line:84%
you participate in that pure
desire and force of will,

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:31.100 align:middle line:84%
it seems to command
your attention

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:34.040 align:middle line:90%
and make things clear for you.

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.328 align:middle line:84%
That person is going to
make all the decision.

00:31:36.328 --> 00:31:38.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because they
feel safe and solid.

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:38.810 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yeah.

00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:40.730 align:middle line:84%
That person is going to
be exciting, alluring,

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:43.622 align:middle line:84%
even if they're being
inappropriate sometimes.

00:31:43.622 --> 00:31:44.705 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're seeing it.

00:31:44.705 --> 00:31:46.040 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing it
play out everyday.

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:48.110 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Because
there is a desire there.

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:49.760 align:middle line:90%
There is a force there.

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.350 align:middle line:90%
And that's still respected.

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And there's something
alluring about it.

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:59.305 align:middle line:84%
And we don't oftentimes take
the time to reflect about that.

00:31:59.305 --> 00:32:01.430 align:middle line:84%
But then, oftentimes, we
see the alternative, which

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:03.320 align:middle line:90%
is sort of the wet noodle guy.

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:05.773 align:middle line:84%
And we're like, he's not
doing anything for me.

00:32:05.773 --> 00:32:07.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He can
be my girlfriend.

00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:08.400 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Exactly.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're
going to get to him.

00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:13.340 align:middle line:84%
So we kind of got the idea
of, there is an allure.

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:14.630 align:middle line:90%
There is an attractiveness.

00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:17.150 align:middle line:84%
There is a kind of animal
magnetism toward these guys

00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:19.530 align:middle line:84%
that know what they want
and they just go and get it.

00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, they'll be in
positions of power, leadership,

00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:24.530 align:middle line:84%
command, and so forth,
and can work their way

00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:26.350 align:middle line:84%
into the leadership
of a country just

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:28.800 align:middle line:90%
through that force of will.

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And so we know the
downsides of it.

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:30.980 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: We do.

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:32.897 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We can see how
people are just used,

00:32:32.897 --> 00:32:34.910 align:middle line:84%
and they're just
objects in their world.

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:36.970 align:middle line:84%
So we probably all know
of people like that,

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:38.690 align:middle line:84%
or personally know
people like that.

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And some women fall
for them and get

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:44.150 align:middle line:84%
their hearts crushed, you know,
as one experiment in life.

00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:47.120 align:middle line:84%
Others just like-- ugh--
try to avoid these guys.

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:51.055 align:middle line:84%
But then the next level is,
after some consciousness

00:32:51.055 --> 00:32:52.430 align:middle line:84%
has started seeping
in, you still

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:56.270 align:middle line:84%
have the animal magnetism,
capability, desire to win.

00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:57.530 align:middle line:90%
You call it the striving man.

00:32:57.530 --> 00:32:58.488 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:32:58.488 --> 00:33:00.050 align:middle line:84%
This is a guy going
beyond conquest

00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:02.157 align:middle line:90%
to thinking life is a race.

00:33:02.157 --> 00:33:02.990 align:middle line:90%
Life was a conquest.

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:04.340 align:middle line:90%
Now, life is a race.

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:07.380 align:middle line:84%
So it's a little
bit of an evolution.

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:10.940 align:middle line:84%
But still, people are
still seen not maybe

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:13.970 align:middle line:84%
in terms of just plain
objects to be conquered

00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:16.070 align:middle line:84%
or to be disposed
of, but now seen

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:21.500 align:middle line:84%
as almost sounding
boards, or something

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:26.143 align:middle line:84%
to contend with in order to
get that feeling of thrill,

00:33:26.143 --> 00:33:27.060 align:middle line:90%
the thrill of victory.

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:28.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A win's still a win.

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.534 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yeah, a win.

00:33:28.534 --> 00:33:31.162 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's still oriented
toward winning, more or less.

00:33:31.162 --> 00:33:32.120 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: It is.

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:33.270 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:35.442 align:middle line:84%
And you see those
all the time-- people

00:33:35.442 --> 00:33:37.650 align:middle line:84%
that are climbing the ladder
and climbing the ladder.

00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:39.710 align:middle line:84%
But you also see the
downside of that too.

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:43.810 align:middle line:84%
Especially as this kind of man--
or even women sometimes can

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:44.720 align:middle line:90%
exhibit this--

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.428 align:middle line:84%
get on later in life,
they're like, well,

00:33:46.428 --> 00:33:48.050 align:middle line:90%
what's this all for?

00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:50.060 align:middle line:84%
I've been winning for
the sake of winning,

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:52.055 align:middle line:84%
and it's not providing
a spiritual contentment.

00:33:52.055 --> 00:33:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's
no heart to it.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.875 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: There's
no real heart to it.

00:33:54.875 --> 00:33:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And so that starts
to fall apart.

00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And then some of those people
do become more responsible.

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:06.560 align:middle line:84%
They start directing that
competitive or conquest energy

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:09.219 align:middle line:90%
toward supporting other people.

00:34:09.219 --> 00:34:10.969 align:middle line:84%
You know, they still
want to be respected,

00:34:10.969 --> 00:34:13.040 align:middle line:84%
and still want to be
put a bit on a pedestal.

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:14.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Still
want to be above.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:14.917 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yeah.

00:34:14.917 --> 00:34:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I call
the responsible man.

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.639 align:middle line:84%
But he's willing to
actually fund that play,

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:22.379 align:middle line:84%
be responsible, be providing,
have some generosity

00:34:22.379 --> 00:34:23.179 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:24.304 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And be protected.

00:34:24.304 --> 00:34:26.570 align:middle line:84%
My dad would be a
responsible man.

00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:30.560 align:middle line:84%
His generation were the nice
men that went to church.

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:32.929 align:middle line:84%
They joined their conservative
political parties.

00:34:32.929 --> 00:34:34.992 align:middle line:84%
And they paid their
taxes and fought

00:34:34.992 --> 00:34:36.409 align:middle line:84%
for what was right
in their world,

00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:38.150 align:middle line:90%
took care of their families.

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:41.330 align:middle line:90%
My dad is a really good man.

00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:42.980 align:middle line:90%
He's a very moral man.

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:45.030 align:middle line:84%
But he might not remember
his grandkids' names.

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:46.530 align:middle line:84%
It's not like he
was too interactive

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:48.770 align:middle line:84%
with the little
people in the family,

00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:51.370 align:middle line:84%
even though he was
a really good man.

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:52.170 align:middle line:90%
He's still alive.

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:53.780 align:middle line:90%
He's still a really good man.

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:57.940 align:middle line:84%
But he, like what we were
talking about earlier,

00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:00.230 align:middle line:84%
and I think a lot of
people of his generation,

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:03.210 align:middle line:84%
as an older white man,
is really struggling.

00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:04.440 align:middle line:90%
And he's open-minded.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.900 align:middle line:90%
We even talk about ETs.

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:08.510 align:middle line:84%
But he's really struggling
with that slippage

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:10.880 align:middle line:84%
of power right, where
he and his Rotarians

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.835 align:middle line:84%
are just used to
running the show.

00:35:12.835 --> 00:35:14.210 align:middle line:84%
And they're not
running the show.

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:16.160 align:middle line:90%
And now it makes him nervous.

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And he makes making
not-so-rational decisions,

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:22.060 align:middle line:84%
because their control
base is slipping away.

00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And women and people
of color are entering,

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:26.050 align:middle line:84%
and he doesn't know
what to make of it.

00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:28.870 align:middle line:90%
It has him frightened.

00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:29.830 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:30.380 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:31.945 align:middle line:84%
If not frightened, at
least disoriented--

00:35:31.945 --> 00:35:32.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And disoriented.

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:34.150 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: --or feeling
that the world is wrong.

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:35.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Something's
wrong in the world.

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:36.568 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:35:36.568 --> 00:35:39.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so that is the
animal man in its most evolved

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:41.530 align:middle line:84%
form, really, which
is a responsible,

00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:44.977 align:middle line:84%
good man who's still expecting
that the world is going to be

00:35:44.977 --> 00:35:46.810 align:middle line:84%
running the platform
they're accustomed to--

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:47.520 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Exactly.

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --which has
patriarchy at the core of it.

00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:50.432 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: It does.

00:35:50.432 --> 00:35:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's the downside
to the animal man,

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:56.440 align:middle line:84%
a lack of reflective
capacity to understand

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:59.020 align:middle line:84%
where that power comes from
and what kind of demands

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:00.530 align:middle line:90%
it makes on other people.

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:01.820 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:04.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so now we're
going to start moving on to men

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:06.130 align:middle line:90%
who are starting to wake up.

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And in your generation,
we know a lot

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:13.780 align:middle line:84%
of people that would fall into
the category of the social man,

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:18.130 align:middle line:84%
which is like, their fathers
have humiliated their mothers.

00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:21.430 align:middle line:84%
They're really tired of the
age-old patriarchal story.

00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:24.730 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to be oppressive
to their wives and families.

00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:27.042 align:middle line:84%
And so let's enter
into the social man.

00:36:27.042 --> 00:36:28.000 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And the first sort of regressed
form of the social man, I

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:32.800 align:middle line:90%
called it the retreating man.

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And the retreating man
has seen the damage

00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:39.910 align:middle line:84%
that the unapologetic
exertion of power--

00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:42.310 align:middle line:84%
and oftentimes false--
and taking credit

00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:44.102 align:middle line:84%
for women's work and
other people's work,

00:36:44.102 --> 00:36:45.560 align:middle line:84%
they don't want to
be part of that.

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:47.770 align:middle line:84%
They don't see that
it's with integrity.

00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:48.890 align:middle line:90%
They don't like it.

00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:50.590 align:middle line:84%
They don't like
the demands of it.

00:36:50.590 --> 00:36:52.210 align:middle line:84%
They don't have
the heart for it.

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:56.920 align:middle line:84%
So they are saying, I am
rejecting that form of manhood.

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And some of the men
end up rejecting

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:01.900 align:middle line:84%
any form of reasonable
expectation of a man--

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:02.890 align:middle line:90%
responsibility.

00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, they could
reject the responsibility

00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:08.003 align:middle line:90%
of the responsible man as well.

00:37:08.003 --> 00:37:09.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
their dads maybe

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:10.760 align:middle line:90%
were too demanding of everyone.

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.010 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right, right.

00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:13.808 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, to
heck with all of it.

00:37:13.808 --> 00:37:15.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
part of the crisis of guys

00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:19.160 align:middle line:84%
in their 40's and 50's now
playing video games all day,

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:19.960 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:20.830 align:middle line:90%
Where's my place?

00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:23.030 align:middle line:84%
I've been replaced
on the assembly line.

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:25.430 align:middle line:90%
A woman has my job or whatever.

00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And they're just
saying, screw it.

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:28.208 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:37:28.208 --> 00:37:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's evidence of
either as a response

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:33.910 align:middle line:84%
to the problems
of the animal man

00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:35.920 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes as a
retreat, because they're

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:38.393 align:middle line:84%
lacking opportunities
that used to be there.

00:37:38.393 --> 00:37:40.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, well,
what am I here for?

00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:43.890 align:middle line:84%
I might as well just have a
good time, do video games,

00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:46.330 align:middle line:90%
have my woman work for me--

00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:49.647 align:middle line:84%
work and raise the kids
and do the housework,

00:37:49.647 --> 00:37:51.730 align:middle line:84%
which is what a lot of
women are experiencing now.

00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:51.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And that again is the
type of social man

00:37:53.830 --> 00:37:56.660 align:middle line:84%
that's just retreating from
responsibility in general right

00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:56.880 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:57.922 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Exactly.

00:37:57.922 --> 00:38:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And you can kind of see a
little bit of why that is.

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:03.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are a lot of
costs and a lot of demands

00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:05.110 align:middle line:90%
that are being placed on men.

00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And so you can see the
desire to take a break.

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:10.180 align:middle line:84%
But to make that a
lifestyle and to make

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:12.790 align:middle line:84%
that sort of your way
of working through life,

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:15.420 align:middle line:84%
if that's really
sad, that's tragic.

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:17.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's no
expression of genius.

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:19.150 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: That divine
genius, which is so important,

00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:21.010 align:middle line:84%
is not being expressed
at all in that situation.

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:21.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:23.470 align:middle line:84%
It's now just looking
for comfort and escape.

00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:24.040 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:25.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so then
we go on to the one

00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:27.072 align:middle line:90%
you call the confused man.

00:38:27.072 --> 00:38:28.030 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:31.783 align:middle line:84%
The confused man is not
willing to stay in that place

00:38:31.783 --> 00:38:32.950 align:middle line:90%
where the retreating man is.

00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:36.340 align:middle line:84%
He wants to advance, but doesn't
know where to advance to.

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:39.220 align:middle line:84%
So oftentimes, a
confused man, you'll

00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:41.845 align:middle line:84%
see him have a
whole slew of doubt.

00:38:41.845 --> 00:38:43.720 align:middle line:84%
That one doesn't work,
that one doesn't work,

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:45.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure about this.

00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:46.985 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Trying a lot
of things on for size,

00:38:46.985 --> 00:38:49.752 align:middle line:84%
trying to find himself
in this world now.

00:38:49.752 --> 00:38:52.210 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: And it's almost
a cliche about men or boys

00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:54.670 align:middle line:90%
trying to find themselves.

00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:56.350 align:middle line:90%
And that's the confused man.

00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:59.530 align:middle line:84%
Because the old ways
don't work anymore.

00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:00.940 align:middle line:90%
And they don't work anyway.

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:03.820 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of the industrial
era and a lot of patriarchy

00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:05.320 align:middle line:90%
is beginning to fall apart.

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And the new ways haven't
quite been formed.

00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:09.130 align:middle line:90%
So here I am.

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:09.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm confused.

00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:11.390 align:middle line:90%
I know it can't be the old way.

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:12.682 align:middle line:90%
The new way hasn't been formed.

00:39:12.682 --> 00:39:14.830 align:middle line:84%
So I'm struggling to
find my relationship

00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:17.470 align:middle line:84%
with my own identity as
a man-- my masculinity.

00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'm playing
playing the field.

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:25.830 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, these men will
have short-term relationships.

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:28.060 align:middle line:84%
They'll go from one
woman to another woman.

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:32.140 align:middle line:84%
They don't know who they are
with relation to a woman,

00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:34.600 align:middle line:84%
or if they're gay,
with another man.

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And they're just
basically experimenting.

00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:39.257 align:middle line:90%
And they just don't really know.

00:39:39.257 --> 00:39:40.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So then
we move on from that

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:43.330 align:middle line:84%
to the next kind of
level of awakening,

00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:45.110 align:middle line:90%
which you call the equal man.

00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And after we talk
about the equal man,

00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:50.290 align:middle line:84%
I want to start working
into the conversation--

00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:51.460 align:middle line:90%
we're having so much fun.

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:52.428 align:middle line:90%
Time is flying.

00:39:52.428 --> 00:39:54.220 align:middle line:84%
I've got to get so much
in before we finish

00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:56.860 align:middle line:84%
the discussion-- the whole thing
about the sexual revolution

00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:59.850 align:middle line:84%
and how that played into
the development of men.

00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And so let's go with
the equal man, which

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:06.440 align:middle line:84%
is the most thoughtful and
reflective evolved form now

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:07.480 align:middle line:90%
of the social man.

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:08.938 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
Of the social man.

00:40:08.938 --> 00:40:11.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, like the animal man,
the social man has his thing.

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:12.880 align:middle line:90%
It's togetherness.

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:14.338 align:middle line:90%
It's connection.

00:40:14.338 --> 00:40:16.880 align:middle line:84%
It's the ability to belong to
something greater than himself.

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:19.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He wants to be part of
a larger community, an effort,

00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:21.380 align:middle line:84%
whether it's Peace
Corps or whatnot.

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:21.740 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yeah.

00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And in my book, I talk
about my friend Dexter,

00:40:23.310 --> 00:40:25.050 align:middle line:84%
who's a good example
of the equal man.

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:28.540 align:middle line:84%
He has a responsible job in
an environmental, very green

00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:29.620 align:middle line:90%
industry.

00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:30.800 align:middle line:90%
He's bought a house.

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:32.290 align:middle line:90%
He lives in Portland.

00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:35.007 align:middle line:90%
His wife also works.

00:40:35.007 --> 00:40:36.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She teaches
kids art, as I recall.

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:37.715 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yes.

00:40:37.715 --> 00:40:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And they go to these kind
of progressive schools.

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And he's a co-contributor
in housework

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:45.080 align:middle line:90%
and all these sorts of things.

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And so there's this notion
of being an equal partner.

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, now,
most women would say,

00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:51.290 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to
go any further.

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:52.510 align:middle line:90%
I'd be totally happy with that.

00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:52.920 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: [LAUGHS]

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:55.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We do not have
to expand beyond that.

00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:56.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm cool.

00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:56.660 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yes.

00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:57.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:57.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it is.

00:40:57.490 --> 00:40:59.073 align:middle line:84%
It's a wonderful
place to have landed.

00:40:59.073 --> 00:41:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of men
that we know now

00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:04.120 align:middle line:84%
are in this category
that is really

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:07.150 align:middle line:84%
quite a bit more
conscious than anything

00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:09.490 align:middle line:84%
that's happened before, at
least in modern history,

00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:10.960 align:middle line:90%
the last 10,000 years or so.

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:11.650 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: That's true.

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:12.400 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:14.692 align:middle line:84%
I do mention in my book,
there's one problem with that,

00:41:14.692 --> 00:41:16.775 align:middle line:90%
for a man in and of himself.

00:41:16.775 --> 00:41:18.400 align:middle line:84%
When he gets to middle
age and the kids

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:21.400 align:middle line:84%
are going off to college
and so forth, now what?

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.590 align:middle line:84%
And that is where
there's a more,

00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:29.350 align:middle line:84%
I guess, affirmative need to
reassert that divine genius

00:41:29.350 --> 00:41:30.640 align:middle line:90%
and this passion.

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:33.131 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I have
another category.

00:41:33.131 --> 00:41:33.931 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:33.931 --> 00:41:35.264 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to go into that.

00:41:35.264 --> 00:41:37.045 align:middle line:90%
I'm just going to insert this.

00:41:37.045 --> 00:41:40.330 align:middle line:84%
So amidst all of this--
we already talked about

00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:42.220 align:middle line:84%
the suppression of
the Industrial Age--

00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:43.780 align:middle line:90%
we have the sexual revolution.

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:47.410 align:middle line:84%
So now women are just freely
having sex, as well as men.

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:50.080 align:middle line:84%
Men, most likely, would have
anyway, given the opportunity,

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:53.020 align:middle line:84%
but our social morays and
religious standards and such

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:56.320 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't allow women
to just have sex freely

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:58.348 align:middle line:84%
until the 1960s,
basically, at large.

00:41:58.348 --> 00:42:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: And
birth control came in.

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:02.182 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And birth control
came in on top of it.

00:42:02.182 --> 00:42:04.420 align:middle line:90%
So now, women can participate.

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And men are starting to
get used to this gig.

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:10.810 align:middle line:84%
This is pretty fun, as
that terrible saying

00:42:10.810 --> 00:42:12.230 align:middle line:90%
that came to be--

00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:13.210 align:middle line:90%
I just hate it.

00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:15.890 align:middle line:84%
Why buy the cow when you
can get the milk for free?

00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:17.280 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's just--

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:19.568 align:middle line:84%
[SHUDDERS] --fingernails
on a chalkboard.

00:42:19.568 --> 00:42:21.360 align:middle line:84%
But that's actually
what started happening.

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And one of my friends,
who lives here

00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:25.810 align:middle line:84%
in Boulder, who is
involved in men's groups

00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:29.362 align:middle line:84%
as well, Andrea
Villa, he's Italian.

00:42:29.362 --> 00:42:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And he was raised
outside of Venice

00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:33.430 align:middle line:90%
in a very patriarchal society.

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:35.870 align:middle line:84%
But it's one that is
a little different.

00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:37.360 align:middle line:90%
It protects the girls.

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:39.403 align:middle line:84%
So you take advantage
of a girl, you

00:42:39.403 --> 00:42:41.320 align:middle line:84%
get beaten up by her
brothers and her cousins.

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:43.270 align:middle line:84%
So they had kind of
built-in birth control

00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:44.422 align:middle line:90%
societally that way.

00:42:44.422 --> 00:42:45.880 align:middle line:84%
But in the rest of
the world, where

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:48.910 align:middle line:84%
you didn't have the dominance
of Catholicism, for example,

00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:51.100 align:middle line:90%
we have open, free sex.

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:54.610 align:middle line:84%
Men started taking on a
less responsible role.

00:42:54.610 --> 00:42:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, women
are now entering the workforce.

00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:59.590 align:middle line:90%
And so it's very confusing.

00:42:59.590 --> 00:43:01.680 align:middle line:84%
That was a very confusing
thing for women.

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:02.680 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: It was.

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:05.325 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because that's not
naturally how they were wired,

00:43:05.325 --> 00:43:06.200 align:middle line:90%
to just sleep around.

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:08.203 align:middle line:84%
But you were kind of
expected to almost.

00:43:08.203 --> 00:43:09.370 align:middle line:90%
Like, what's wrong with you?

00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:10.240 align:middle line:90%
Are you uptight?

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:11.770 align:middle line:84%
Hey, man, your old
lady's uptight--

00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:13.340 align:middle line:84%
you know, your
23-year-old old lady.

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:14.920 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And so you've got this
kind of corruption

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:18.970 align:middle line:84%
that was built into
the system now where

00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:23.120 align:middle line:84%
the men don't have any
responsibility toward the women

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:25.270 align:middle line:84%
to kind of score in
the relationship.

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: You've got
the worst of both worlds.

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:26.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've got the
worst of both worlds.

00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:30.130 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: You've got
the radical entitlement that

00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:31.660 align:middle line:84%
got rid of the
responsibility that

00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:33.460 align:middle line:90%
came with the responsible man.

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And so you've got the
worst of both worlds.

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think that there
can be an opposite of that.

00:43:42.070 --> 00:43:47.860 align:middle line:84%
How could men embrace and even
appreciate woman's initiation

00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:51.130 align:middle line:84%
and offering of
their own sexuality

00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:55.060 align:middle line:84%
and not take advantage of
it, not simply just use it,

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:57.820 align:middle line:84%
but to actually enjoin
their own masculinity

00:43:57.820 --> 00:43:59.140 align:middle line:90%
with that wonderful--

00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And help her find
deeper parts of herself

00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:03.730 align:middle line:84%
without guilt or shame
or anything around it.

00:44:03.730 --> 00:44:05.330 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right,
because that's a big thing.

00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:05.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:07.808 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: I mean, one
the most protective almost old

00:44:07.808 --> 00:44:11.110 align:middle line:84%
school, but new school
as well, is to say,

00:44:11.110 --> 00:44:16.840 align:middle line:84%
you can express your
opinion and something you're

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:19.790 align:middle line:84%
passionate about, and you can
express yourself sexually,

00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:21.550 align:middle line:84%
emotionally,
spiritually around me,

00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:25.720 align:middle line:84%
and that I embrace that, rather
than get intimidated by that

00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:27.352 align:middle line:90%
or run the other direction.

00:44:27.352 --> 00:44:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And I know a lot of your
audience probably is saying,

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:30.790 align:middle line:90%
I've tried doing that.

00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:34.660 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And they run
the other direction!

00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:36.160 align:middle line:90%
Or they are intimidated by that.

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
men need to step up.

00:44:39.130 --> 00:44:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The wild feminine
is quite formidable.

00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:46.750 align:middle line:84%
As long as it was tamed and
kept in a can, it was OK.

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:51.140 align:middle line:84%
Look, I noticed this one time
when my mother, my grandmother,

00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:54.100 align:middle line:84%
and this other widow woman
were all at a table, and me.

00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:56.937 align:middle line:84%
And we were all making a
Greek dish, spanakopita.

00:44:56.937 --> 00:44:58.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if that's
the right way to say,

00:44:58.770 --> 00:45:00.310 align:middle line:90%
but we were making spanakopita.

00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:01.788 align:middle line:90%
And the women were talking.

00:45:01.788 --> 00:45:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And my mom was saying,
if your father died,

00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:04.997 align:middle line:90%
I'd never get married again.

00:45:04.997 --> 00:45:06.580 align:middle line:84%
My grandmother said,
oh, god, that was

00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:08.997 align:middle line:84%
the best thing, when I got
divorced from your grandfather.

00:45:08.997 --> 00:45:10.600 align:middle line:84%
The other woman had
lost her husband.

00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:13.030 align:middle line:84%
All of them were
like, yeah, we want

00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:15.908 align:middle line:84%
to be free of all those
responsibilities in life.

00:45:15.908 --> 00:45:16.950 align:middle line:90%
We want to go on cruises.

00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:19.440 align:middle line:84%
We want to do things
with other women.

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And women set free are
a very energizing group.

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And men are afraid
of that wildness.

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:27.362 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: They're
afraid of that wildness.

00:45:27.362 --> 00:45:28.980 align:middle line:84%
They're afraid of
being left out.

00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:32.580 align:middle line:84%
But in some sense, it's
our own expectations

00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:35.400 align:middle line:84%
that have been built up, and,
to a certain extent, women too.

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:37.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean women still
retain the notion

00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:38.633 align:middle line:84%
that men should be
competent, that men

00:45:38.633 --> 00:45:39.990 align:middle line:90%
should be decision makers.

00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:41.790 align:middle line:84%
They'd like a guy who
can present himself

00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:43.050 align:middle line:90%
well, can provide, protect.

00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:43.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:45.320 align:middle line:90%
Look at the movies.

00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:47.700 align:middle line:84%
We haven't gotten away
from it, even if the woman

00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:51.000 align:middle line:84%
is the kick-butt
hero of the movie,

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.330 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes, she'll have a guy
there who always had her back,

00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:56.257 align:middle line:90%
even now.

00:45:56.257 --> 00:45:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And you still have
the romance themes,

00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:00.630 align:middle line:84%
where women are falling
in love with the prince.

00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And women still cry over
that, and secretly wouldn't

00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:05.430 align:middle line:84%
tell each other that
there's a desire there

00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:09.030 align:middle line:84%
to feel like there's someone
looking out for your interest

00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:10.263 align:middle line:90%
in life and caring for you.

00:46:10.263 --> 00:46:11.180 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Sure.

00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
wrong with that,

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:14.165 align:middle line:90%
especially in this transition.

00:46:14.165 --> 00:46:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And what I say in here is
that we never really lose

00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:17.430 align:middle line:84%
the old things,
just like we still

00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:19.347 align:middle line:84%
have the reptilian brain,
the mammalian brain,

00:46:19.347 --> 00:46:21.760 align:middle line:84%
and the human brain, I
still have animal man in me.

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's a good thing, too,
to have force and desire.

00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:25.800 align:middle line:90%
I have social man in me.

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:27.880 align:middle line:84%
It's a good thing for
me to be able to connect

00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:29.880 align:middle line:84%
and be responsible and
to be equal with others--

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:30.105 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And collaborate.

00:46:30.105 --> 00:46:31.260 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: --and
collaborate with others.

00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:32.635 align:middle line:84%
But then there's
this next level.

00:46:32.635 --> 00:46:34.885 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's where
we get into the spiritually

00:46:34.885 --> 00:46:35.975 align:middle line:90%
confident man, basically.

00:46:35.975 --> 00:46:36.933 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:46:36.933 --> 00:46:39.750 align:middle line:84%
The co-creative man
says, OK, I've got this.

00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:44.640 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And this is where
we're heading now, historically.

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:46.410 align:middle line:84%
Because now, women
are stepping forward.

00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:47.540 align:middle line:90%
Men are stepping forward.

00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:49.290 align:middle line:84%
We've got some of the
habits from the past

00:46:49.290 --> 00:46:50.370 align:middle line:90%
that we're discussing.

00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:52.245 align:middle line:84%
Men are a little
intimidated and running away

00:46:52.245 --> 00:46:53.580 align:middle line:90%
from that feminine energy.

00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:55.710 align:middle line:84%
Why not step into
it and lean into it

00:46:55.710 --> 00:46:58.800 align:middle line:84%
as a man, instead
of saying, OK, I'm

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:01.285 align:middle line:84%
going to be a kind of
honorary woman myself,

00:47:01.285 --> 00:47:02.660 align:middle line:84%
get rid of my
masculinity, or I'm

00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:04.260 align:middle line:90%
going to assert myself over it?

00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:05.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:07.350 align:middle line:84%
Because oftentimes, then
the polarity isn't there.

00:47:07.350 --> 00:47:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, that's
where the sexual attraction

00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:11.130 align:middle line:84%
between the two
start dropping away.

00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:13.440 align:middle line:84%
Because these men become women's
best friends and girlfriends.

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:14.340 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Exactly.

00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:15.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
they're upset,

00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:17.220 align:middle line:84%
because they might
actually really want

00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:19.020 align:middle line:84%
to have a relationship
with that woman.

00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Exactly.

00:47:21.010 --> 00:47:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that's
emerging now that I'm seeing--

00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:26.850 align:middle line:84%
to intensify my uniqueness
and my distinctness,

00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:30.530 align:middle line:84%
including as a man, but
not over and against you,

00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:33.360 align:middle line:84%
but in a co-creative
relationship with you.

00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:35.250 align:middle line:84%
We always think, or
have been taught,

00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:38.520 align:middle line:84%
that if I make myself
more polar to you,

00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:41.630 align:middle line:84%
then it's going to increase
animosity and conflict.

00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:44.070 align:middle line:84%
These energies are
building up on both sides.

00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:46.705 align:middle line:84%
But that's only if you're
going against each other.

00:47:46.705 --> 00:47:49.080 align:middle line:84%
How about if you're actually
building up all this energy,

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:52.560 align:middle line:84%
and it's arking between
you, and it's really

00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:55.770 align:middle line:84%
enlivening the other person,
and bringing them out, saying,

00:47:55.770 --> 00:47:57.780 align:middle line:90%
I want what you have to offer?

00:47:57.780 --> 00:48:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing-- the
other person is saying to me,

00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:02.460 align:middle line:90%
I want what you have to offer.

00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:06.483 align:middle line:84%
And again, it can be a very
kind of adventurous thing.

00:48:06.483 --> 00:48:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Because there can be a
lot of misunderstanding

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:11.350 align:middle line:84%
in that, because there's a lot
of energy involved in that.

00:48:11.350 --> 00:48:14.160 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be
times when you're crying,

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:15.630 align:middle line:90%
times when you're angry.

00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:18.840 align:middle line:84%
But if there's an underlying
commitment at the heart

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:22.230 align:middle line:84%
and spirit, it's
going to persist.

00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to get to
that much smoother place,

00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:27.577 align:middle line:84%
a place where that language and
that energy continue to exist.

00:48:27.577 --> 00:48:29.244 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's just
an unexplored place.

00:48:29.244 --> 00:48:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And people don't have words
or language for it just yet.

00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Because they're not
used to showing up that

00:48:34.110 --> 00:48:36.090 align:middle line:90%
authentically with each other.

00:48:36.090 --> 00:48:36.955 align:middle line:90%
And it's scary.

00:48:36.955 --> 00:48:38.330 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
Of course it is.

00:48:38.330 --> 00:48:40.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
that's really why

00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:42.660 align:middle line:84%
you wrote the book, is to
say, here's where we've been.

00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Here's what we're
passing through.

00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:47.130 align:middle line:84%
I personally have been all these
things at one time or another.

00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:48.540 align:middle line:84%
Most of you have been
all these things.

00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:50.457 align:middle line:84%
And we can kind of see
where we are right now.

00:48:50.457 --> 00:48:51.960 align:middle line:90%
But what is the opportunity?

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:57.220 align:middle line:84%
But we all have to get really
honest with each other,

00:48:57.220 --> 00:48:59.738 align:middle line:84%
and, as you say, to want
the best for each other--

00:48:59.738 --> 00:49:00.780 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Exactly.

00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --instead of trying
to own or dominate each other.

00:49:03.090 --> 00:49:04.020 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
Right, or run away.

00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:05.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or run away.

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:05.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, true.

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:06.870 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: I mean, you see
some on the spiritual circles.

00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:08.745 align:middle line:84%
We're going to just
transcend the situation--

00:49:08.745 --> 00:49:11.210 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] --and get out of it.

00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:12.450 align:middle line:90%
And that's the whole thing.

00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And I say, go ahead,
take the rest.

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:17.410 align:middle line:84%
Go as far out as you want
to the metaphysical realm.

00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:19.290 align:middle line:90%
But bring it back in.

00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And then bring it back
into the relationship.

00:49:22.110 --> 00:49:25.200 align:middle line:90%
So don't just take off.

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:26.153 align:middle line:90%
But gather.

00:49:26.153 --> 00:49:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
and you might even

00:49:27.570 --> 00:49:30.720 align:middle line:84%
say another word there is the
spiritually responsible man,

00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:31.740 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:33.420 align:middle line:84%
Because it's
spiritually confident.

00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:36.720 align:middle line:84%
But it does bring
back to men a new kind

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:38.820 align:middle line:84%
of sense of responsibility,
not with the weight

00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:43.890 align:middle line:84%
of the world on one's shoulders,
but with an absolute commitment

00:49:43.890 --> 00:49:49.930 align:middle line:84%
to bringing the true inner value
and genius of oneself forward,

00:49:49.930 --> 00:49:53.290 align:middle line:84%
and, like you say, offering it,
even if it's a little scary.

00:49:53.290 --> 00:49:54.090 align:middle line:90%
And it is.

00:49:54.090 --> 00:49:55.673 align:middle line:84%
Because some men
have been programmed.

00:49:55.673 --> 00:49:58.110 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh, jeez, I'm a
third generation attorney.

00:49:58.110 --> 00:50:00.280 align:middle line:90%
My family expect it of me.

00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:01.410 align:middle line:90%
I hate the law.

00:50:01.410 --> 00:50:04.050 align:middle line:84%
I have a stomachache
after every trial.

00:50:04.050 --> 00:50:05.760 align:middle line:90%
I just hate it.

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:06.920 align:middle line:90%
I've always loved carving.

00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:08.670 align:middle line:90%
I want to do this woodwork.

00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the rubber
hits the road and people--

00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:13.113 align:middle line:84%
men and women-- both
really struggle.

00:50:13.113 --> 00:50:14.280 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: It is true.

00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They say, I can't
live like that anymore,

00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:17.560 align:middle line:84%
and I have this
genius in me that

00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:19.890 align:middle line:84%
wants to create these
beautiful works of art.

00:50:19.890 --> 00:50:21.490 align:middle line:90%
But how do I feed my family?

00:50:21.490 --> 00:50:22.532 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Exactly.

00:50:22.532 --> 00:50:25.000 align:middle line:84%
And then you've imagined
this in a lot of the talks

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.940 align:middle line:84%
that you've done on
your own website.

00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:30.160 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
quit your day job.

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:33.610 align:middle line:84%
But you don't have to then
simply be restricted to it too.

00:50:33.610 --> 00:50:35.290 align:middle line:84%
You can go ahead
and, alongside that,

00:50:35.290 --> 00:50:39.460 align:middle line:84%
begin to develop these
more creative aspects.

00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And I said "pioneering"
in the title.

00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:43.750 align:middle line:84%
I said "pioneering
a new frontier."

00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:45.460 align:middle line:90%
This is not easy work.

00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:46.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it's not.

00:50:46.810 --> 00:50:49.420 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Because you are
making it up as you go along.

00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:51.220 align:middle line:84%
Because you're making
honest mistakes.

00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Because you are
having your day job,

00:50:54.010 --> 00:50:57.510 align:middle line:84%
and you're dedicated to
family like a good animal man

00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:59.980 align:middle line:90%
and and social man.

00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:01.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And co-creative man.

00:51:01.230 --> 00:51:02.605 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
And you're going

00:51:02.605 --> 00:51:04.540 align:middle line:84%
beyond that as a
co-creative man to say, OK,

00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:06.510 align:middle line:84%
but I have this thing I
really want to develop

00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:08.468 align:middle line:84%
and I'm passionate about,
whether it's carving,

00:51:08.468 --> 00:51:11.240 align:middle line:84%
whether it's acting, whether
it's whatever it happens to be.

00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:13.930 align:middle line:84%
You're going to go ahead and
do that and share that as well.

00:51:13.930 --> 00:51:14.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:51:14.730 --> 00:51:16.600 align:middle line:90%
And OK, so this brings up--

00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:19.420 align:middle line:84%
what's his name-- Matthew
Crawford, I think.

00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:20.410 align:middle line:90%
Matthew Crawford?

00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:21.370 align:middle line:90%
Michael Crawford?

00:51:21.370 --> 00:51:24.610 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, "Shop Class
as Soulcraft,"

00:51:24.610 --> 00:51:27.268 align:middle line:84%
that book that came out
about five or six years ago,

00:51:27.268 --> 00:51:28.810 align:middle line:84%
that was really
important, because it

00:51:28.810 --> 00:51:33.460 align:middle line:84%
was talking about men needing to
have a sense of something that

00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:35.650 align:middle line:84%
has been accomplished
in their life.

00:51:35.650 --> 00:51:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And in his case, what I
loved about the story is,

00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:42.070 align:middle line:84%
he was a heavyweight, mentally,
and philosophically, he

00:51:42.070 --> 00:51:44.620 align:middle line:84%
was part of a think
tank, making good money.

00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And he just felt
like, oh, my god.

00:51:46.210 --> 00:51:47.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm dizzy.

00:51:47.010 --> 00:51:47.980 align:middle line:90%
We go round and round.

00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:49.272 align:middle line:90%
Nothing ever comes out of this.

00:51:49.272 --> 00:51:52.520 align:middle line:84%
You can't see any effect
at the end of the day.

00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And he quit his day job,
loved repairing motorcycles

00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:59.380 align:middle line:84%
and loved motorcycles, and
opened a motorcycle repair shop

00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:00.640 align:middle line:90%
in his little town.

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And now, he's a part of the
backbone of the community.

00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:04.750 align:middle line:90%
The guys bring his bikes in.

00:52:04.750 --> 00:52:05.560 align:middle line:90%
He fixes them.

00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:07.190 align:middle line:90%
They work out things together.

00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of each day,
he feels like he's actually

00:52:09.610 --> 00:52:11.140 align:middle line:90%
done something.

00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And with the masculine
spirit, this need

00:52:14.410 --> 00:52:17.920 align:middle line:84%
to have to produce
something to see

00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:21.040 align:middle line:84%
the effects and fruit of
what one has done in life

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:22.090 align:middle line:90%
is important.

00:52:22.090 --> 00:52:22.480 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: It is.

00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:23.620 align:middle line:90%
And it's heroic too.

00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:23.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:25.300 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: You do not
have to become a billionaire

00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:26.740 align:middle line:90%
or a titan of industry.

00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:28.908 align:middle line:84%
You can do exactly what
that person has done.

00:52:28.908 --> 00:52:29.950 align:middle line:90%
You can be a good father.

00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:30.950 align:middle line:90%
You can be a good coach.

00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:32.370 align:middle line:90%
You can be a good mentor.

00:52:32.370 --> 00:52:36.340 align:middle line:84%
You can go to Big Brothers
and Big Sisters and mentor

00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:38.920 align:middle line:84%
a child that's not
even in your family.

00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:40.960 align:middle line:84%
These are all extraordinarily
heroic things.

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And they really help to
develop that masculinity.

00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:45.130 align:middle line:90%
And they help you--

00:52:45.130 --> 00:52:47.920 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes with the help of the
child, or the help of a woman,

00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:49.510 align:middle line:84%
or the help of a
person you happen

00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:52.150 align:middle line:90%
to meet in this new career--

00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:55.210 align:middle line:84%
begin to develop
your divine genius.

00:52:55.210 --> 00:52:58.660 align:middle line:84%
It's a very experimental
and curious thing.

00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
most undervalued aspects

00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:02.950 align:middle line:84%
of masculinity,
and so necessary,

00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:05.440 align:middle line:84%
is curiosity, the ability
to experiment instead

00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:08.410 align:middle line:84%
of pretending you already
know, pretending you're already

00:53:08.410 --> 00:53:11.500 align:middle line:84%
an expert, always trying to make
it look like what's going on

00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:12.070 align:middle line:90%
and everyone should follow.

00:53:12.070 --> 00:53:13.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't ask
for directions, yeah.

00:53:13.130 --> 00:53:13.780 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right, exactly.

00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:14.822 align:middle line:90%
Don't ask for directions.

00:53:14.822 --> 00:53:16.090 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it happens to be.

00:53:16.090 --> 00:53:18.350 align:middle line:84%
This is, in many ways,
the opposite of that.

00:53:18.350 --> 00:53:20.710 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually much more
affirming to masculinity.

00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:23.865 align:middle line:84%
Because now, where it really
authentically comes from

00:53:23.865 --> 00:53:24.990 align:middle line:90%
is from that divine genius.

00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:26.560 align:middle line:90%
It can now be touched.

00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:29.470 align:middle line:84%
It's very much in the
heart and the hands,

00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:32.902 align:middle line:84%
doing something real
with real people,

00:53:32.902 --> 00:53:34.360 align:middle line:84%
and not just
something in your head

00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:35.200 align:middle line:90%
or not just from video games.

00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With a
real accomplishment

00:53:35.890 --> 00:53:36.820 align:middle line:90%
at the end of it.

00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:37.750 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: With a real
accomplishment at the end.

00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:39.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: An objective.

00:53:39.490 --> 00:53:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Something you've objectively
accomplished at the end.

00:53:42.310 --> 00:53:44.800 align:middle line:84%
Now we only have a
few minutes left.

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:47.920 align:middle line:90%
Time has flown.

00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:50.020 align:middle line:84%
Your degree is in the
philosophy of education.

00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:51.040 align:middle line:90%
You're a PhD.

00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:55.090 align:middle line:84%
And so education is
something you believe in

00:53:55.090 --> 00:53:57.850 align:middle line:90%
and you've educated educators.

00:53:57.850 --> 00:53:59.374 align:middle line:90%
But the system is failing us.

00:53:59.374 --> 00:54:00.332 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: It is.

00:54:00.332 --> 00:54:00.810 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:54:00.810 --> 00:54:02.185 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everyone
shouldn't just

00:54:02.185 --> 00:54:05.440 align:middle line:84%
be shoved off down the
chute to a four-year college

00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:06.250 align:middle line:90%
necessarily.

00:54:06.250 --> 00:54:08.980 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not aligning
with that divine passion.

00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:12.490 align:middle line:84%
So we have a big discussion
as societies around,

00:54:12.490 --> 00:54:14.980 align:middle line:90%
what should education serve now?

00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:17.560 align:middle line:90%
Who makes that decision?

00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Who really should put
themselves in that environment

00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:23.138 align:middle line:84%
and in that kind of debt if
they have to, versus, who

00:54:23.138 --> 00:54:24.430 align:middle line:90%
really doesn't need to do that?

00:54:24.430 --> 00:54:27.430 align:middle line:84%
Who can take off and go into
a mentorship or apprenticeship

00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:28.793 align:middle line:90%
program and whatnot?

00:54:28.793 --> 00:54:29.710 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yeah.

00:54:29.710 --> 00:54:33.767 align:middle line:84%
That's part of what I do with
my clients on my website.

00:54:33.767 --> 00:54:36.350 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you do a great
job with counseling these kids,

00:54:36.350 --> 00:54:36.800 align:middle line:10%
especially.

00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:37.620 align:middle line:10%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yes.

00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:39.662 align:middle line:10%
With college counseling,
professional counseling,

00:54:39.662 --> 00:54:43.630 align:middle line:10%
I'm helping them custom design,
from their divine genius

00:54:43.630 --> 00:54:46.120 align:middle line:10%
and their capacities, a line.

00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:49.990 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it involves college or
an apprenticeship, internships,

00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:54.340 align:middle line:84%
research assistant-ships, going
out in the world and traveling.

00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:57.153 align:middle line:84%
But it helps them
to understand fully

00:54:57.153 --> 00:54:59.320 align:middle line:84%
what it is that they really
bring into to the world.

00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's much more appropriate
for today's world, both men

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:02.800 align:middle line:90%
and women.

00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:04.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
because those old jobs

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.290 align:middle line:90%
aren't waiting for you anyway.

00:55:05.290 --> 00:55:05.590 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: It isn't.

00:55:05.590 --> 00:55:06.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You might
as well be creative.

00:55:06.610 --> 00:55:08.860 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: And instead of
being intimidated by the fact

00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:10.900 align:middle line:84%
that you're a woman, or a man,
or black, or white, or gay,

00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:12.608 align:middle line:84%
or straight, or whether
it happens to be,

00:55:12.608 --> 00:55:14.710 align:middle line:84%
you see these as facets
that are actually

00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:16.700 align:middle line:84%
accentuating and
spicing your ability

00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:18.380 align:middle line:90%
to come forward into the world.

00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Instead of hiding
these things, now they

00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:25.130 align:middle line:84%
become an indispensable part
of developing your moving out

00:55:25.130 --> 00:55:27.392 align:middle line:84%
into the world from this
new spiritual aspect,

00:55:27.392 --> 00:55:28.850 align:middle line:84%
through all these
different prisms,

00:55:28.850 --> 00:55:30.560 align:middle line:90%
through these different spices.

00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:32.863 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I,
with my clients,

00:55:32.863 --> 00:55:34.280 align:middle line:84%
am really helping
them to develop,

00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:36.380 align:middle line:84%
is to accept those
things as strengths

00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:37.670 align:middle line:90%
rather than weaknesses.

00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:40.400 align:middle line:84%
The difference and
distinctness and clarity

00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:43.460 align:middle line:84%
is a way to power that
unique way forward.

00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:45.528 align:middle line:84%
And most typical
education hasn't,

00:55:45.528 --> 00:55:47.570 align:middle line:84%
because it was built on
the industrial era, which

00:55:47.570 --> 00:55:51.080 align:middle line:84%
is about stamping human beings
out in particular competencies.

00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:52.720 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't about
feeding your spirit

00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:54.470 align:middle line:84%
or allowing you to
create with your spirit

00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:56.780 align:middle line:84%
and connect with others
and their spirit.

00:55:56.780 --> 00:55:59.450 align:middle line:90%
So I'm glad you mentioned that.

00:55:59.450 --> 00:56:01.700 align:middle line:84%
That's great for
another conversation,

00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:03.260 align:middle line:90%
like the future of education.

00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:06.350 align:middle line:84%
Because we're going to have to
make a big transition there.

00:56:06.350 --> 00:56:07.945 align:middle line:84%
The old jobs are
not there anymore.

00:56:07.945 --> 00:56:09.320 align:middle line:84%
The really good
ones and the ones

00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:10.987 align:middle line:84%
you're really qualified
for are the ones

00:56:10.987 --> 00:56:13.370 align:middle line:84%
that are based in that divine
genius and your passion

00:56:13.370 --> 00:56:14.360 align:middle line:90%
around that.

00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you mean there's
never been a better time

00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:18.808 align:middle line:90%
to be lost and found.

00:56:18.808 --> 00:56:19.850 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Exactly.

00:56:19.850 --> 00:56:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
now there's a chance.

00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:20.700 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS:
It's not a bad idea

00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:22.530 align:middle line:84%
to be a lost boy
or a man right now.

00:56:22.530 --> 00:56:25.340 align:middle line:84%
Because now you don't
have the self-certainty

00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:28.355 align:middle line:84%
that allowed you to go into
the dehumanizing realm.

00:56:28.355 --> 00:56:29.730 align:middle line:84%
Now you have the
uncertainty that

00:56:29.730 --> 00:56:30.980 align:middle line:84%
allows you to go
into a much more

00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:32.850 align:middle line:84%
human and spiritual and
compassionate realm.

00:56:32.850 --> 00:56:33.725 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:56:33.725 --> 00:56:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And I can say that because
I know you quite well.

00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:39.200 align:middle line:84%
But your divine genius is
in helping people identify

00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:40.610 align:middle line:90%
that divine genius in them.

00:56:40.610 --> 00:56:41.900 align:middle line:90%
And that's your passion.

00:56:41.900 --> 00:56:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really beautiful
for me, watching you

00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:48.680 align:middle line:84%
and how people start lighting
up and understanding,

00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:51.260 align:middle line:84%
oh, my god, I had no idea
that that desire was still

00:56:51.260 --> 00:56:52.310 align:middle line:90%
so strong in me.

00:56:52.310 --> 00:56:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to find
a way to express it.

00:56:54.050 --> 00:56:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And we all need to find a way
to express this in ourselves.

00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:59.420 align:middle line:84%
Our lives feel like
dead wood if we're not

00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:01.520 align:middle line:84%
expressing, in some
way or another,

00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:02.790 align:middle line:90%
that thing in ourselves.

00:57:02.790 --> 00:57:04.110 align:middle line:90%
And we only have a minute left.

00:57:04.110 --> 00:57:06.020 align:middle line:84%
And I want to make
one final statement.

00:57:06.020 --> 00:57:08.420 align:middle line:84%
It's beginning to change
in the Western world.

00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:10.610 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is,
until that moment

00:57:10.610 --> 00:57:12.740 align:middle line:84%
arrives when a woman
gives birth to a child

00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:16.310 align:middle line:84%
and a man sees his baby's
face for the first time,

00:57:16.310 --> 00:57:18.440 align:middle line:84%
there is a subtle
thing that happens,

00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:21.470 align:middle line:84%
because it's ingrained
in us, genetically

00:57:21.470 --> 00:57:26.060 align:middle line:84%
from the past, where there's
that extra excitement at seeing

00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:28.640 align:middle line:84%
a little boy born
into the world that

00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:31.220 align:middle line:84%
happens with a lot of
women subconsciously.

00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:33.847 align:middle line:84%
In other countries, it's
like, yes, thank god.

00:57:33.847 --> 00:57:35.180 align:middle line:90%
We're going to pass the name on.

00:57:35.180 --> 00:57:36.780 align:middle line:90%
Someone to work the fields.

00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:40.490 align:middle line:84%
But we have to begin
seeing our children, boys

00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:43.670 align:middle line:84%
and girls, as all this
same divine little

00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:47.970 align:middle line:84%
spark of genius without
preferring one over the other,

00:57:47.970 --> 00:57:50.312 align:middle line:84%
letting boys get away with
the "boys will be boys,"

00:57:50.312 --> 00:57:51.770 align:middle line:84%
even though they're
developmentally

00:57:51.770 --> 00:57:53.000 align:middle line:90%
a little different.

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:56.030 align:middle line:84%
We can't use that
old trope anymore,

00:57:56.030 --> 00:57:59.210 align:middle line:84%
while the girls are having
the responsibility heaped

00:57:59.210 --> 00:58:00.980 align:middle line:84%
on them from five
and six years old,

00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:03.830 align:middle line:84%
cleaning up after their
brothers and such.

00:58:03.830 --> 00:58:05.150 align:middle line:90%
This has to change.

00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:06.260 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yes.

00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:08.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so if you have
a final comment on that,

00:58:08.060 --> 00:58:08.630 align:middle line:90%
we're out of time.

00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:09.456 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:58:09.456 --> 00:58:10.290 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: OK.

00:58:10.290 --> 00:58:12.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, I just wanted
to say-- and it's

00:58:12.110 --> 00:58:15.300 align:middle line:84%
going to help boys just
as much as it helps girls.

00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:18.050 align:middle line:10%
It's going to help men just
as much as it helps women.

00:58:18.050 --> 00:58:21.050 align:middle line:10%
By not assuming and
using other people,

00:58:21.050 --> 00:58:25.610 align:middle line:10%
by being able to work with them,
you learn to develop a joy.

00:58:25.610 --> 00:58:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And you create a
real equality that

00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:32.083 align:middle line:84%
now has room for your real
masculinity and not some role.

00:58:32.083 --> 00:58:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's not going to be
dependent upon someone else

00:58:34.250 --> 00:58:35.763 align:middle line:90%
serving you in a certain way.

00:58:35.763 --> 00:58:37.680 align:middle line:84%
That's the kind of world
I want to see happen.

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:40.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you're
doing some amazing things

00:58:40.070 --> 00:58:42.700 align:middle line:84%
as a professor right now in
the psychology department,

00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:45.020 align:middle line:84%
and creating this whole new
template for understanding

00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:46.640 align:middle line:90%
emotions and motivation.

00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:49.918 align:middle line:84%
And so that's one way you're
working in the mainstream

00:58:49.918 --> 00:58:51.210 align:middle line:90%
with the mainstream population.

00:58:51.210 --> 00:58:51.260 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Right.

00:58:51.260 --> 00:58:51.850 align:middle line:90%
That's my day job.

00:58:51.850 --> 00:58:52.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's your day job.

00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:54.340 align:middle line:90%
And it's amazing what you did.

00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:56.482 align:middle line:84%
So Zeus, thank you
for joining me here--

00:58:56.482 --> 00:58:58.190 align:middle line:84%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Thank
you for having me.

00:58:58.190 --> 00:58:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --formally
and publicly.

00:58:58.910 --> 00:59:00.785 align:middle line:84%
We have these conversations
at home normally.

00:59:00.785 --> 00:59:01.775 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:59:01.775 --> 00:59:02.270 align:middle line:90%
>>YIAMOUYIANNIS: Yes.

00:59:02.270 --> 00:59:03.440 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Again, the
title of the book

00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:04.970 align:middle line:10%
is "The Spiritually
Confident Man,"

00:59:04.970 --> 00:59:06.800 align:middle line:10%
which you can find
through Amazon

00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:08.210 align:middle line:10%
and other major booksellers.

00:59:08.210 --> 00:59:11.480 align:middle line:10%
Or you can go to AskDrZeus.com
to connect with Zeus

00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:12.560 align:middle line:10%
personally.

00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:14.630 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:16.340 align:middle line:10%
on "Open Minds."
