>>REGINA MEREDITH: Danny
Sheehan is back with us

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.770 align:middle line:10%
again to take a look at what has
happened while we haven't been

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.020 align:middle line:10%
looking, and that's
regarding the North Dakota

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.630 align:middle line:10%
pipeline and the state
of affairs worldwide.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.120 align:middle line:84%
We'll also take a look at
the state of our tattered US

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.850 align:middle line:84%
Constitution and what
we can do, if anything,

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.610 align:middle line:84%
to recover some of
our lost integrity.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.950 align:middle line:84%
Danny, we were just talking
off camera and everyone

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.000 align:middle line:84%
that's seen you before knows
that my brain is exploding

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.790 align:middle line:84%
right now with both
excitement, enthusiasm,

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.190 align:middle line:84%
and also to let this
conversation out

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.610 align:middle line:84%
into the public because
what you were just saying

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.680 align:middle line:90%
before the camera came on--

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.680 align:middle line:84%
we were talking about this mass
state of delusion taking place

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.690 align:middle line:84%
and how it's becoming
acceptable not

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.710 align:middle line:84%
just in the mass
consciousness but even

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.640 align:middle line:90%
in individual consciousness now.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.440 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen
anything like it.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And you say that's because we,
the public, have been targeted

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.355 align:middle line:84%
and it all started with the
national security state.

00:01:22.355 --> 00:01:24.242 align:middle line:84%
This is now-- just,
this conversation

00:01:24.242 --> 00:01:25.450 align:middle line:90%
is going to go where it goes.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.120 align:middle line:90%
Just launch in starting there.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.820 align:middle line:10%
>>DANIEL SHEEHAN: Well, what
we've seen in just the last 120

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.220 align:middle line:10%
days or so is that
there has been

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.160 align:middle line:10%
this extraordinary experience
that our country is going

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.360 align:middle line:10%
through where people
are asserting completely

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.930 align:middle line:10%
alternative realities.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, right from
the inauguration

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.710 align:middle line:84%
of the present
administration, for example,

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.590 align:middle line:84%
them insisting this was the
largest crowd that had ever

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.360 align:middle line:90%
assembled for inauguration.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And then everybody else
comes back in and says,

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.740 align:middle line:84%
wait a second, look
at the videos of this.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.110 align:middle line:84%
It's clear that there's less
than a third as many people

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.845 align:middle line:84%
here who were here for
the last administration.

00:02:03.845 --> 00:02:04.645 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:02:04.645 --> 00:02:07.420 align:middle line:84%
That was like the very first
crack where people saw,

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.149 align:middle line:84%
these things are
passing somehow.

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:09.949 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yeah.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.470 align:middle line:84%
So somehow, this
is being asserted

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.550 align:middle line:84%
in that the administration
is being the most successful

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.070 align:middle line:90%
administration in history.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.700 align:middle line:84%
We're making more advances than
have ever been made before.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And yet, none of the
legislation is getting passed

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.965 align:middle line:90%
and others are criticizing.

00:02:26.965 --> 00:02:29.440 align:middle line:84%
So what's happened then--
and then you get now--

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.200 align:middle line:84%
now you have Fox News, an
entire 24-hour-a-day station,

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.940 align:middle line:90%
putting out one view of reality.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.280 align:middle line:84%
You have MSNBC putting out
this completely contrary view

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.080 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Russia
Today is doing theirs.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.440 align:middle line:84%
The Young Turks
are doing theirs.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.140 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has their
view of reality.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And now you have
access to the internet where

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.190 align:middle line:84%
you have these
streaming video things--

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.300 align:middle line:84%
the Huffington Post
and all the others--

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.440 align:middle line:84%
so people are going
around picking which truth

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.210 align:middle line:90%
they want to just engage in.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And so they keep getting
reinforced and reinforced

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.210 align:middle line:84%
and then they think
everybody else is lying.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.220 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens is they
start personalizing this.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.750 align:middle line:84%
That the people who have a
different view of reality

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.410 align:middle line:84%
than you are bad
people, terrible people.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.686 align:middle line:90%
They're evil people.

00:03:15.686 --> 00:03:18.040 align:middle line:84%
And it starts
becoming personalized.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.710 align:middle line:84%
Now this is very much
what happened back

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.760 align:middle line:90%
in the 1920s in Germany.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.070 align:middle line:84%
That you started getting these
factions starting to rise.

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And what we discovered
was that there

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.450 align:middle line:84%
was an intentional
campaign going on back

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.810 align:middle line:84%
in the 1920s run
by the Third Reich.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.170 align:middle line:84%
That whole national
fascist party

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.760 align:middle line:84%
was putting out
false information

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.430 align:middle line:84%
like this undermining
reality for everybody

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.180 align:middle line:84%
because they wanted
confusion and chaos so

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.950 align:middle line:84%
that they could have a
strong man come forward

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.090 align:middle line:90%
and say, look it.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.320 align:middle line:90%
I know you're all confused.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.200 align:middle line:84%
There's all this alternative
sets of facts around.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.910 align:middle line:90%
You just have to listen to me.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm the only one that
can tell you the truth.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm the one that can solve this.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.295 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, put
your confidence in me.

00:04:02.295 --> 00:04:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And what it did is it led
to total disaster for them.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.607 align:middle line:84%
It's threatening disaster
now for our country

00:04:09.607 --> 00:04:10.940 align:middle line:90%
and people can see it happening.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why do you say the
source is the national security

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.280 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.890 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.348 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Because
what happened is

00:04:16.348 --> 00:04:19.930 align:middle line:84%
that at the end of World
War II, the United States,

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.810 align:middle line:84%
for the first time in history,
passed a National Security

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.680 align:middle line:84%
Act where they created a
Central Intelligence Agency that

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.480 align:middle line:84%
was explicitly authorized to
go around the world disrupting

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.070 align:middle line:90%
other people's elections.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.679 align:middle line:84%
To disrupt other people's
democratic choices

00:04:36.679 --> 00:04:37.720 align:middle line:90%
that they wanted to make.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Whatever economic
system they wanted.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.130 align:middle line:84%
Whatever political
system they wanted.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.840 align:middle line:84%
They said, we're not
going to allow that.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.173 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go in-- and
so that what happened is they

00:04:46.173 --> 00:04:50.080 align:middle line:84%
developed a whole covert
operations directorate inside

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.680 align:middle line:84%
the CIA and they developed this
talent they called a public

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.389 align:middle line:84%
diplomacy capacity,
where they would--

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:56.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It sounds
innocuous enough.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:57.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: It does.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.950 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.160 align:middle line:90%
It's one of those euphemisms.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.910 align:middle line:84%
But what they would
do is they would go in

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.770 align:middle line:84%
and they would
infiltrate the news

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.750 align:middle line:90%
stations in other countries.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.030 align:middle line:84%
They would infiltrate
the newspapers.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.480 align:middle line:84%
They would force-feed them
information that was false.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out
that what happened

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.510 align:middle line:84%
is, when the policies of that
Central Intelligence Agency

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:17.799 align:middle line:90%
started to be challenged--

00:05:17.799 --> 00:05:19.840 align:middle line:84%
when people started getting
upset about what they

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.280 align:middle line:90%
were doing around the world--

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.860 align:middle line:84%
they turned all of those
skills onto the public

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.450 align:middle line:90%
here in the United States.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.350 align:middle line:90%
For example, in 1980--

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.990 align:middle line:84%
well I remember, in 1975,
1976, following the Watergate

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:37.510 align:middle line:84%
burglary, that the
Watergate hearings revealed,

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.110 align:middle line:84%
to their complete surprise,
that the Watergate

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.020 align:middle line:84%
burglary had to do with the
assassination of President

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.670 align:middle line:90%
Kennedy.

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And they were so
shocked, they then

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.150 align:middle line:84%
put together a special
select committee

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.470 align:middle line:84%
to reinvestigate
the assassination.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And the Church Committee
inside the United States Senate

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:55.230 align:middle line:84%
started investigating what
kind of illegal conduct

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.940 align:middle line:90%
the CIA was engaged in.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.300 align:middle line:84%
They began to suspect that there
was an element inside the CIA.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.846 align:middle line:84%
That it created a political
assassination team.

00:06:02.846 --> 00:06:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And there was reason to believe
that may be the team that

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.750 align:middle line:90%
assassinated the president.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.610 align:middle line:84%
So there was this
period for about three

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.280 align:middle line:84%
or four years where the
United States Senate started

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.760 align:middle line:84%
investigating what the
consequences were of having set

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.800 align:middle line:90%
up the National Security Act.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is the
covert operations division

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.700 align:middle line:84%
of the Central Intelligence
Agency started bringing money

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.550 align:middle line:84%
in out of the Nugan
Hand Bank in Australia

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.420 align:middle line:84%
where money had been being put
in as they were shaving profits

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.340 align:middle line:84%
off the heroin trafficking
in Southeast Asia.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Coming out of
Southeast Asia, yeah.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: They put it
in the Nugan Hand Bank.

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.650 align:middle line:84%
They brought that money in and
they targeted Senator Frank

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.020 align:middle line:84%
Church, who was
chairing the committee

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.370 align:middle line:84%
in the Senate investigating
the covert operations.

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And they poured millions
of dollars into his state

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.550 align:middle line:84%
up in Idaho, revealing
that he in fact--

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:49.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To discredit him.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well to show that
he supported the Equal Rights

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:55.590 align:middle line:84%
Amendment and that he supported
some restrictions on guns.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:56.632 align:middle line:90%
And so they defeated him.

00:06:56.632 --> 00:06:57.431 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:57.431 --> 00:06:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: They went
after Dick Clark in Iowa

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.970 align:middle line:84%
because he'd opposed their
covert operations in Africa.

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:04.530 align:middle line:90%
And they eliminated him.

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.800 align:middle line:84%
They went after Birch
Bayh in Indiana.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.060 align:middle line:90%
They got rid of him.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.370 align:middle line:84%
They targeted Alan
Cranston in California.

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:12.861 align:middle line:90%
They targeted George McGovern.

00:07:12.861 --> 00:07:14.610 align:middle line:84%
What they were doing
is they were bringing

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:18.360 align:middle line:84%
home domestically the same
kind of special operations

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.360 align:middle line:84%
that they've been allowed to
engage in all around the world

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.300 align:middle line:84%
allegedly on behalf
of anti-communism.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.900 align:middle line:84%
To get rid of any kind of
socialist or too progressive

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.210 align:middle line:84%
a set of politicians,
they would destroy them.

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:34.400 align:middle line:84%
So what they did is they
turned their guns back on us.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And not only did they
target those senators,

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.835 align:middle line:84%
but they targeted the
president of the United States

00:07:38.835 --> 00:07:40.500 align:middle line:90%
with Jimmy Carter.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And they actually undertook
negotiations with Hezbollah

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.310 align:middle line:84%
to hold our 52 hostages that
had been taken from the American

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:51.185 align:middle line:84%
Embassy in Iran and to hold
them until after the election

00:07:51.185 --> 00:07:53.310 align:middle line:84%
so that they could make
President Jimmy Carter look

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:56.430 align:middle line:84%
impotent so that Ronald
Reagan could then win.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And Ronald Reagan's vice
president, George H.W. Bush,

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.300 align:middle line:84%
had been the director of the
Central Intelligence Agency.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And his
cohort operations people,

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.200 align:middle line:84%
Theodore Shakley, who had been
the head of Covert Operations,

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.930 align:middle line:84%
is the guy that ran that entire
operation against the senators

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:13.950 align:middle line:90%
and the president.

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:18.240 align:middle line:84%
So what happened is
that they succeeded

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.590 align:middle line:84%
in stopping the investigation
of the national security state.

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:25.110 align:middle line:84%
So what they did then is
they turned their guns

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:28.320 align:middle line:84%
on the people who might
oppose them in the future.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.720 align:middle line:84%
And that they set
up an entire regime

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:35.010 align:middle line:84%
so that when Jimmy Carter
had come into power,

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:37.799 align:middle line:84%
they set up this whole
off-the-shelf enterprise

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:40.590 align:middle line:84%
that people heard about during
the Iran-Contra scandal.

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:42.030 align:middle line:84%
They set up this
whole operation,

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:44.880 align:middle line:84%
which was run by Theodore
Shakley, the head of Covert

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.810 align:middle line:90%
Operations for the CIA.

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:48.690 align:middle line:84%
They set up a whole
alternative government,

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:50.420 align:middle line:90%
and they had their own--

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:51.442 align:middle line:90%
they had their own army.

00:08:51.442 --> 00:08:52.650 align:middle line:90%
They had their own air force.

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.720 align:middle line:90%
They had their own navy.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And what they were doing was
pursuing a complete alternative

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.510 align:middle line:84%
set of policies from those that
the American government were

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.400 align:middle line:84%
being told were
the real policies.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.814 align:middle line:84%
So that the people were
living in this illusion.

00:09:04.814 --> 00:09:07.230 align:middle line:84%
They were being told that the
United States government was

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:08.820 align:middle line:90%
in favor of democracy.

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.160 align:middle line:84%
We were going around helping
people around the world

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.320 align:middle line:90%
to sustain democratic regimes.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, in fact,
the real policy

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.070 align:middle line:84%
was the secret
covert operation that

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:19.830 align:middle line:84%
was going on through the
CIA where they were toppling

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:21.210 align:middle line:90%
democratic governments.

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:23.970 align:middle line:84%
They were putting fascist
dictators into power.

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:27.930 align:middle line:84%
They were training people
in torture and disappearing

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:28.830 align:middle line:90%
dissidents.

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:31.590 align:middle line:84%
So there was this
whole kind of period

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:35.580 align:middle line:84%
that went on when there was
this invisible government really

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.354 align:middle line:84%
functioning abroad, and
there was this public--

00:09:38.354 --> 00:09:40.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it
still is functioning.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:40.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yeah, yeah.

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, sure it is,
because they never

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:46.050 align:middle line:84%
did-- they didn't stop them
in the Iran-Contra situation.

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And what the special
prosecutor, Lawrence Walsh,

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.700 align:middle line:84%
said at the conclusion
of his investigation--

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.670 align:middle line:84%
he indicted the first
six of the people that

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:56.465 align:middle line:84%
were involved in this,
people that we had named out

00:09:56.465 --> 00:09:57.980 align:middle line:90%
of the Christic Institute.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.830 align:middle line:84%
We had named them in this
major federal racketeering

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:04.230 align:middle line:84%
lawsuit that we had
filed against them,

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.960 align:middle line:84%
and so he indicted
the first six of them.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.977 align:middle line:84%
And then George H.W. Bush,
the former head of the Central

00:10:10.977 --> 00:10:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence Agency who had now
become president of the United

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:18.117 align:middle line:84%
States, he just pardoned them
all and let them walk away.

00:10:18.117 --> 00:10:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And so the special
prosecutor said, look it,

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:22.729 align:middle line:84%
if you don't stop
these people right now,

00:10:22.729 --> 00:10:25.020 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have to come
to grips with these people

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.640 align:middle line:90%
sooner than you might imagine.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And they won't be operating
now under the cover

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:30.500 align:middle line:90%
of anti-communism.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.370 align:middle line:90%
It will be anti-terrorism.

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:33.170 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Ah, there
you go, it was set up.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: --they're
going to use that umbrella

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.080 align:middle line:90%
to come after you.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.413 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So there was a set-up.

00:10:37.413 --> 00:10:39.950 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now we have
the situation today.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:44.600 align:middle line:84%
We have the prosecution,
the arms of prosecution

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.480 align:middle line:84%
and the points of
prosecution really starting

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:51.020 align:middle line:84%
to multiply in terms of this
whole Russian interference

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.300 align:middle line:90%
with the election.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.210 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I think it's
fair to say there really

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:57.980 align:middle line:90%
are no good guys here.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.870 align:middle line:84%
What you just detailed
is the same thing

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:01.580 align:middle line:90%
we've done to that country.

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:05.120 align:middle line:84%
In fact, a man named
George Gorton, who I know,

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.550 align:middle line:90%
he's an acquaintance--

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:10.130 align:middle line:84%
anybody watching needs
to watch the film called

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:11.640 align:middle line:90%
"Spinning Boris."

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.150 align:middle line:84%
That's his life
story about how they

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:18.250 align:middle line:84%
were able to install Yeltsin
into office in Russia.

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:19.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:22.805 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This political--
what do you call it--

00:11:22.805 --> 00:11:25.970 align:middle line:84%
just beyond a consultant, but
a political consultancy firm

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:28.370 align:middle line:90%
here installed Yeltsin.

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:32.030 align:middle line:84%
So here you have a drunk who
had one photo op where he was

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:33.710 align:middle line:90%
putting a tree in the ground.

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:34.770 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:36.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And the other
one standing on the tank.

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:37.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Standing on a tank.

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:38.523 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: There's two pictures.

00:11:38.523 --> 00:11:39.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They
put him in office,

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:44.030 align:middle line:84%
and his daughter ends up
running the country after that.

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:46.010 align:middle line:90%
Let's just start with that.

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:47.660 align:middle line:84%
What was the
advantage to Yeltsin

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:50.190 align:middle line:84%
being in office from the
American point of view?

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:53.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well, because
what happened is that--

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was that their
first democratically-elected

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:56.440 align:middle line:90%
president?

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yes.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:57.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:58.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Yes, that's
right, that's right.

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they knew
how to manipulate masses,

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:01.790 align:middle line:84%
and the Russians
were naive then.

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:02.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And what had happened is that
Gorbachev, President Gorbachev,

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:13.730 align:middle line:84%
had opened negotiations with the
George H.W. Bush administration

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:17.690 align:middle line:84%
that was in power
from 1988 to 1992.

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And he opened negotiations
and said, look it,

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:22.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm perfectly willing to sign
an authorization releasing

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:26.450 align:middle line:84%
all the republics from the
Soviet Socialist Republics

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:30.280 align:middle line:84%
to be free countries
if you will assure me

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.710 align:middle line:84%
that you will not try to
bring those into NATO to try

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:36.140 align:middle line:90%
to surround us.

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And James Baker III and
George H.W. Bush, Sr.,

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:44.070 align:middle line:84%
they gave them his assurance
they would not do that.

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And so he signed this
authorization allowing all

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.150 align:middle line:90%
those countries to become free.

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is
that when Carter came in,

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:55.400 align:middle line:90%
when Carter was elected--

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.700 align:middle line:84%
or excuse me, when Bill
Clinton was elected after that,

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.440 align:middle line:90%
he honored that agreement.

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:06.140 align:middle line:84%
But when W. Bush came into
office with Dick Cheney,

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:07.910 align:middle line:84%
they immediately
started recruiting

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:11.990 align:middle line:84%
all of those republics
into NATO and started

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:15.740 align:middle line:84%
putting nuclear missiles
surrounding, surrounding

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:19.175 align:middle line:90%
the entire Russian country.

00:13:19.175 --> 00:13:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And the last one in the
chain they were going after

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:22.760 align:middle line:90%
was Crimea.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.500 align:middle line:84%
They were going
after the Ukraine.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
instigated all of that stuff

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:34.000 align:middle line:84%
in the Ukraine, because now
they saw this happening.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.420 align:middle line:90%
They saw them coming after it.

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:39.120 align:middle line:84%
So they had a plebiscite, a
completely open plebiscite.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And the people in Crimea,
98% of them, everybody

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:44.600 align:middle line:84%
recognizes that that
was a reflection

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.790 align:middle line:84%
of their true sentiments,
that they did not

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:50.605 align:middle line:84%
want to leave the
relationship with Russia.

00:13:50.605 --> 00:13:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened
is the administration

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:56.720 align:middle line:84%
started characterizing that
as this massive invasion,

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.650 align:middle line:84%
that they were invading
an independent country.

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And so our entire
population here at home

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:06.560 align:middle line:84%
was being subjected
to a public diplomacy

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.350 align:middle line:84%
campaign, a public diplomacy
campaign that was being--

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you call it
brainwashing but whatever.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.975 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Yeah,
it's propaganda.

00:14:12.975 --> 00:14:14.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's propaganda.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: But they liked
if it was a public, this--

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course.

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:21.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: So that was going
on by the Central Intelligence

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:21.126 align:middle line:90%
Agency.

00:14:21.126 --> 00:14:23.000 align:middle line:84%
They had this whole
public diplomacy campaign

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.730 align:middle line:84%
going on where they were
convincing the American people

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:32.750 align:middle line:84%
that Vladimir Putin was
this terrible, aggressive

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:35.660 align:middle line:84%
imperialist that was trying
to take over the world.

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And here, look, he
took over Crimea,

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.090 align:middle line:84%
and completely ignoring the
fact that the United States had

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:44.040 align:middle line:84%
violated the agreement they had,
were putting missiles in all

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:44.840 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:48.110 align:middle line:84%
So that what you saw was this
incredible propaganda campaign

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:50.000 align:middle line:90%
that was going on.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And so that the
reason that I say

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:57.020 align:middle line:84%
that this is all a product of
the national security state

00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:02.100 align:middle line:84%
is because back in 1947,
at the end of World War II,

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:05.180 align:middle line:84%
the creation of the
Central Intelligence Agency

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:08.740 align:middle line:84%
was a function of the
National Security Act of 1947.

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And in 1947, there was a
secret study that was done.

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:14.690 align:middle line:84%
It was called the
Doolittle Report,

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:18.620 align:middle line:84%
the actual author of which
was is a different guy.

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:21.770 align:middle line:90%


00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:23.480 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line
is what they said

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:28.040 align:middle line:84%
is, oh, look, we have to
establish a secret organization

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:31.010 align:middle line:84%
that is going to be
capable of subverting

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:32.840 align:middle line:84%
any other efforts
around the world

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.360 align:middle line:90%
to put anybody into power.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.467 align:middle line:84%
Even if, in fact,
they democratically

00:15:37.467 --> 00:15:39.300 align:middle line:84%
want to have a different
form of government,

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:40.721 align:middle line:90%
we can't allow that to happen.

00:15:40.721 --> 00:15:43.220 align:middle line:84%
They have to be favorable to
our interests and the interests

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.860 align:middle line:90%
of our corporations.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And so that what we're
going to have to do

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:49.580 align:middle line:84%
is we're going to have to
develop this agency that

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:53.090 align:middle line:84%
is more ruthless and savage
than the conduct that

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:55.160 align:middle line:90%
is undertaken against them.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And he said that
we're going to have

00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:00.704 align:middle line:84%
to suspend the American
concept of fair play,

00:16:00.704 --> 00:16:02.120 align:middle line:84%
and there may come
a point in time

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:05.150 align:middle line:84%
in which we have to notify the
American people about this.

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:09.050 align:middle line:84%
But in any event, we cannot
allow these other governments

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:13.110 align:middle line:84%
to fall under the control of
socialist or ultra-progressive

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:14.030 align:middle line:90%
governments.

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And so that was their mission
right from the very beginning.

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:20.150 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that
people didn't realize

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:22.190 align:middle line:84%
is that that was
being run by people

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:25.510 align:middle line:84%
who were, in fact, recruited
from the Third Reich

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:27.140 align:middle line:90%
at the end of World War II--

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:28.882 align:middle line:84%
Reinhard Gehlen and
that whole operation.

00:16:28.882 --> 00:16:29.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:30.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: The
whole [INAUDIBLE]..

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we
talked about that,

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.180 align:middle line:90%
I think, in our last interview.

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:33.513 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's exactly right.

00:16:33.513 --> 00:16:34.895 align:middle line:90%
It's a fascist mentality.

00:16:34.895 --> 00:16:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And the theory of
the fascism was

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:40.370 align:middle line:84%
that you would establish
a theory of government

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:44.090 align:middle line:84%
pursuant to which the government
would, in fact, subsidize

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:46.370 align:middle line:84%
the corporations to be
doing all kinds of research

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:49.070 align:middle line:84%
and development so they could
develop weapons in a smaller

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:52.520 align:middle line:84%
economy and that there
would be a marriage

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.230 align:middle line:84%
between the corporations
and the government.

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:57.700 align:middle line:90%
That's what fascism actually is.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:59.300 align:middle line:90%
And that's what the theory was.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.325 align:middle line:84%
That was the theory of
economic development.

00:17:01.325 --> 00:17:04.760 align:middle line:84%
It was state capitalism,
not independent capitalism,

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.294 align:middle line:90%
not laissez-faire economics.

00:17:06.294 --> 00:17:08.089 align:middle line:90%
It was state capitalism.

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:11.750 align:middle line:84%
It would be subsidized by
the tax monies of the state.

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
were faced with.

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:18.260 align:middle line:84%
The fascists ended up taking
over the Central Intelligence

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:22.369 align:middle line:84%
Agency and running the
covert operations worldwide.

00:17:22.369 --> 00:17:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And what they used as
a part of their system

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:26.774 align:middle line:84%
was this public
diplomacy problem.

00:17:26.774 --> 00:17:28.190 align:middle line:84%
Because what they
would do is they

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:32.170 align:middle line:84%
would put out a complete fiction
about what reality really was,

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:34.850 align:middle line:84%
and they would have this entire
off-the-shelf enterprise,

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:36.450 align:middle line:84%
covert operations,
going in secret.

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:40.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And what
really has happened here

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:43.370 align:middle line:84%
is our generation, our
generation, the baby boomer

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:46.700 align:middle line:84%
generation, started shining
a light on that, started

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.860 align:middle line:84%
shining a light on that
and saying, look it,

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:49.820 align:middle line:90%
you're being deceived.

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:51.770 align:middle line:90%
People are being deceived.

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:54.830 align:middle line:84%
So what happened is the national
security state said, oh, good,

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:56.860 align:middle line:84%
we can take advantage
of this, too.

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:58.907 align:middle line:84%
We said, look it, you're
all being deceived.

00:17:58.907 --> 00:17:59.990 align:middle line:90%
You're all being deceived.

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:03.180 align:middle line:84%
You can't really tell who's
telling the truth anymore.

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.240 align:middle line:84%
So what happened is
you began to get this

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:08.000 align:middle line:90%
what they call post-modernism.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.820 align:middle line:84%
They promoted an
entire philosophy

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:13.220 align:middle line:84%
that there is no
such thing as truth.

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:15.920 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has their own
relative perspective on truth.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.820 align:middle line:84%
There's no such thing
as truth, really.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And this entire postmodern
worldview began to develop.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And Pope Francis has referred
to this in his global climate

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:27.020 align:middle line:90%
change encyclical.

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.390 align:middle line:84%
Back in 2015, he
said that you need

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:33.020 align:middle line:84%
to understand that there are
these major corporations that

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:36.950 align:middle line:84%
are plundering the planet in
that they're developing all

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:39.320 align:middle line:84%
this oil and natural gas,
and they're poisoning

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:40.820 align:middle line:90%
the entire environment.

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:46.220 align:middle line:84%
And they've developed an entire
philosophy of post-modernism.

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:49.970 align:middle line:84%
Because they generated a
system they called consumerism,

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:52.610 align:middle line:84%
that you can't really
tell what the truth is

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:55.670 align:middle line:84%
on the basis of which
you can value yourself,

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:58.490 align:middle line:84%
value anybody else,
that all you have-- you

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:01.180 align:middle line:84%
can think that you're
worth what you consume.

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:02.900 align:middle line:84%
There's this whole
consumerist mentality.

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:03.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And so that
you are what you have--

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:06.828 align:middle line:90%
big, conspicuous consumption.

00:19:06.828 --> 00:19:09.380 align:middle line:84%
If you've got a big
house, a big car,

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:12.060 align:middle line:84%
you've got kids in
private schools,

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:13.150 align:middle line:90%
then you're sophisticated.

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:13.950 align:middle line:90%
You're an elite.

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:15.200 align:middle line:90%
You're of value.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And he said that this
is all being supported

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:20.750 align:middle line:84%
by a philosophy of
post-modernism, which destroys

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:22.910 align:middle line:84%
any kind of
epistemological system

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:25.910 align:middle line:84%
pursuant to which you can
find out what the truth is.

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:28.220 align:middle line:84%
This has all been
fostered and promoted

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:29.744 align:middle line:90%
by the national security state.

00:19:29.744 --> 00:19:31.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's get to
that now and look at some

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:34.460 align:middle line:84%
overlays directly how
it's being reflected.

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:36.740 align:middle line:84%
But first, a philosophical
talk about this.

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yeah.

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:39.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We have become--

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:43.340 align:middle line:84%
the public at large, I
think, people in general,

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.190 align:middle line:90%
tend to have been easily led.

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:46.940 align:middle line:84%
I think from the
beginning of our history,

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:50.000 align:middle line:84%
people tend to be
somewhat easily led

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.780 align:middle line:84%
because there's a certain
trusting aspect of humanity

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:56.720 align:middle line:84%
in anything that resembles
authority, which has really

00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:00.440 align:middle line:84%
negated any ability to
have nuanced thinking.

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And this, to me, I'm seeing
more and more really important--

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:07.250 align:middle line:84%
the fact that
people are complex,

00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:10.280 align:middle line:84%
that agendas are complex,
human beings are complex.

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:16.340 align:middle line:84%
You can have someone who
has maybe in the public view

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:19.970 align:middle line:84%
done something that
is not good, right?

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:22.247 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, we
already know historically

00:20:22.247 --> 00:20:24.080 align:middle line:84%
some things that they
have done or that they

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.750 align:middle line:84%
have worked on behalf of
that are quite beneficial

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:28.010 align:middle line:90%
to humankind.

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:29.720 align:middle line:84%
Yet the headline's
going to grab what's

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:33.080 align:middle line:84%
been done that's not good
in the eyes of the public,

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:37.480 align:middle line:84%
and we no longer are capable of
seeing the rest of the story.

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm just using that as a
very simplistic example,

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:41.900 align:middle line:84%
but it's happening
across the board.

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:47.230 align:middle line:84%
We can't think in nuanced
ways as a culture anymore.

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:50.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: This is
a problem because--

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.350 align:middle line:90%
Rudolf Steiner--

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:52.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, big fan.

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:58.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: --said that if you
allow the state government

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:01.480 align:middle line:84%
to run the schools,
they will not

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.570 align:middle line:84%
train the students
to think critically,

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:08.260 align:middle line:84%
because they do not want
the government criticized.

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:10.540 align:middle line:90%
And that's what's happened.

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:13.030 align:middle line:84%
Since the end of World
War II and the rise

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:15.880 align:middle line:84%
of this national
security state, that you

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:18.190 align:middle line:84%
have to stand up at the
beginning of the class

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:20.560 align:middle line:84%
and pledge allegiance
to the flag.

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.220 align:middle line:84%
They used to have
prayers in schools

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:25.540 align:middle line:84%
so that they were promoting
Christianity over all the rest

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:27.110 align:middle line:90%
of the different religions.

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:30.790 align:middle line:84%
So Christianity and nationalism
became kind of melded together

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:34.570 align:middle line:84%
as a patriotic thing
to be Christian here

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:35.740 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And if you ask any
questions about it

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:41.026 align:middle line:84%
or challenge it in any
way, you're unpatriotic.

00:21:41.026 --> 00:21:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And so that we began to
generate is a state-run system

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:48.520 align:middle line:84%
of schools that didn't
really question the authority

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.875 align:middle line:84%
and didn't think
in a nuanced way.

00:21:50.875 --> 00:21:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And they were really,
again, basically trying

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:55.840 align:middle line:84%
to train the people
to be part of the cogs

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:58.180 align:middle line:84%
in this corporate machine
so they could get a better

00:21:58.180 --> 00:21:59.545 align:middle line:90%
job working for corporations.

00:21:59.545 --> 00:22:01.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the
question is now,

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:05.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, other than the obvious,
educate your children privately

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:06.219 align:middle line:90%
or however you see fit.

00:22:06.219 --> 00:22:07.343 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Homeschool them.

00:22:07.343 --> 00:22:08.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Homeschool
them, exactly.

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:14.560 align:middle line:84%
Now we have, en masse, a
real problem of very simple

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:15.894 align:middle line:90%
thinkers, in general.

00:22:15.894 --> 00:22:16.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Simplistic.

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:17.685 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Simplistic.

00:22:17.685 --> 00:22:18.940 align:middle line:90%
Not to say simple-minded.

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:19.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not
simple-minded, simplistic.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Right,
simplistic thinking.

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:23.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and what they
will embrace as a viewpoint.

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:24.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We need to look
at, for a moment here,

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.540 align:middle line:84%
at the way out of
that before we go

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:31.774 align:middle line:84%
into this overlay of deception
in our current situation.

00:22:31.774 --> 00:22:33.190 align:middle line:84%
How do we find our
way out of that

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:35.890 align:middle line:84%
and develop discernment
and nuanced thinking again?

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:39.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: I think that one of
the best opportunities that we

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:43.840 align:middle line:84%
have now is a number of the
major private universities

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:48.610 align:middle line:84%
in the country are starting
to put their courses online,

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:51.490 align:middle line:84%
and that people can
actually go online,

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:54.040 align:middle line:84%
if they will take
the time to do it,

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:57.880 align:middle line:84%
and they can actually sit
and participate in the class.

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.974 align:middle line:84%
They can watch the class, the
lecture, being broadcast live.

00:23:00.974 --> 00:23:02.515 align:middle line:84%
They can listen to
the questions that

00:23:02.515 --> 00:23:04.570 align:middle line:84%
are being asked by the
students, et cetera.

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:09.430 align:middle line:84%
People have access now to an
independent private education

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:11.404 align:middle line:84%
if they will take
the time to do this.

00:23:11.404 --> 00:23:12.820 align:middle line:84%
But the problem
is is that they're

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:17.470 align:middle line:84%
being bombarded on television
with sports and soap

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:22.030 align:middle line:84%
operas and game shows and
all these distracting kind

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:25.700 align:middle line:84%
of shiny things to
attract their attention.

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And I think that, for
example, the courses--

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:31.900 align:middle line:84%
I teach a course
every single spring

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:36.060 align:middle line:84%
at the University of California
in Santa Cruz, California.

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And that people can go on our
website, the Romero Institute,

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:44.370 align:middle line:84%
romeroinstitute.org, and they
can just click on Classes.

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And for example, I deliver
20 90-minute lectures

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:52.720 align:middle line:84%
on the assassination
of President Kennedy,

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.300 align:middle line:84%
reviewing all of the
alternative theories,

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.500 align:middle line:84%
laying out all of the
positive and negative aspects

00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:58.120 align:middle line:90%
to each of the theories.

00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To lead people to
come to their conclusion.

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:00.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: So people
can look at this

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:02.630 align:middle line:84%
and decide what it is they
think happened here, OK?

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:03.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:04.888 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: I've
done the same thing

00:24:04.888 --> 00:24:06.920 align:middle line:84%
with a number of other
different issues.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And so that's just one kind
of course that's available.

00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:10.945 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I've heard
that some universities--

00:24:10.945 --> 00:24:13.660 align:middle line:84%
I've read that some universities
are actually now starting

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:16.210 align:middle line:84%
to put classes that
are essentially

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:18.557 align:middle line:84%
the philosophy of truth
back on the menu--

00:24:18.557 --> 00:24:19.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: They are.

00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:20.080 align:middle line:90%
They are.

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:21.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --because
it's been so distorted.

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:23.786 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well, we're
working out at the University

00:24:23.786 --> 00:24:25.864 align:middle line:84%
of California to try to
get critical thinking--

00:24:25.864 --> 00:24:27.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Critical thinking.

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:28.030 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: --entire courses on--

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:28.905 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:24:28.905 --> 00:24:30.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: --critical thinking.

00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:33.850 align:middle line:90%
So I think there's hope here.

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:35.710 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to overstate
the problem here.

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:37.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
the national security

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:41.050 align:middle line:84%
state here in the United
States has gotten itself firmly

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:42.550 align:middle line:90%
in control.

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:46.510 align:middle line:84%
You saw us rise up against it
with the Pentagon Papers case.

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:50.690 align:middle line:84%
You saw us rise up against
it with the Iran-Contra case.

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:54.320 align:middle line:84%
We generated-- the churches and
synagogues around the country

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:57.410 align:middle line:84%
generated the American sanctuary
movement to bring people in

00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:00.400 align:middle line:84%
out of South America that were
being targeted by these regimes

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.770 align:middle line:84%
that the CIA create
down there, and they

00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:05.515 align:middle line:90%
were sharing the information.

00:25:05.515 --> 00:25:07.660 align:middle line:84%
We're within striking
distance of being

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:09.496 align:middle line:90%
able to pull out of this thing.

00:25:09.496 --> 00:25:10.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think so.

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:12.280 align:middle line:84%
Also, you have a couple
of young sons, or--

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yes.

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --youngish,
younger than you, right?

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And in any event, I
see a great amount

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.880 align:middle line:84%
of hope just in that
generation alone, because, A,

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:24.120 align:middle line:90%
they're turning off media.

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.870 align:middle line:84%
But they're going
to their own sources

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:28.910 align:middle line:84%
that they resonate with so that
they're still in that matrix,

00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:36.460 align:middle line:84%
but they tend to not buy
into the larger public story.

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:39.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well, there's two
generations of our children.

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:41.980 align:middle line:84%
The children that
were born earlier

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:44.600 align:middle line:84%
are in the X
Generation, and the ones

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.060 align:middle line:84%
that have been
born more recently

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:47.590 align:middle line:84%
are in the Millennial
Generation.

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, my son's right
on the edge of the Millennials.

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And the Millennials are quite
progressive and quite creative.

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:55.570 align:middle line:90%
In fact, 83%--

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:56.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they're
not buying the stories.

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:57.736 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: No, no, no.

00:25:57.736 --> 00:26:01.910 align:middle line:84%
83% of them voted for Bernie
Sanders in the primaries.

00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:02.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:03.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And they're
saying, look it,

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:05.170 align:middle line:90%
they want progressive solutions.

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:08.464 align:middle line:84%
They can see through a
lot of this propaganda.

00:26:08.464 --> 00:26:10.630 align:middle line:84%
They know that we need to
have a single-payer health

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:14.050 align:middle line:84%
system, like most of the other
civilized major industrial

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:16.045 align:middle line:90%
countries have.

00:26:16.045 --> 00:26:17.200 align:middle line:90%
They're quite progressive.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.200 align:middle line:84%
The X Generation,
however, has been caught

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.630 align:middle line:90%
right in this kind of cynicism.

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:22.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:24.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: That they
don't believe people.

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:25.300 align:middle line:90%
They don't believe anybody.

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And so that they think that
getting ahead financially

00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:30.970 align:middle line:90%
is the only solid plan for them.

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:32.140 align:middle line:90%
And so that they're looking.

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:33.170 align:middle line:90%
They go to Wall Street.

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:35.170 align:middle line:90%
They become bond salesmen.

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:36.550 align:middle line:90%
They do these things.

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:38.570 align:middle line:90%
And we're engaged in a process.

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:41.710 align:middle line:84%
The Baby Boom Generation and
the Millennial Generation,

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:43.780 align:middle line:84%
are basically
involved in a project

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:46.360 align:middle line:84%
of trying to help
the X Generation get

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.705 align:middle line:90%
past this kind of cynical--

00:26:47.705 --> 00:26:48.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:49.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: --lack
of belief in things.

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:51.941 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, an
interesting thing, too, again,

00:26:51.941 --> 00:26:54.670 align:middle line:84%
this lack of nuanced
thinking, a headline

00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:56.380 align:middle line:84%
that came up
recently as a result

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:59.380 align:middle line:84%
of the shooting at the
congressional baseball game,

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:04.150 align:middle line:90%
right, of a Republican.

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:06.580 align:middle line:84%
Bernie Sanders is
now coming under fire

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:09.550 align:middle line:84%
because this man was
a volunteer for him.

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:10.960 align:middle line:90%
So what's the press do?

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.420 align:middle line:84%
They take off and riff
on the fact this guy

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:14.870 align:middle line:90%
volunteered for Bernie Sanders.

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:16.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well, Newt
Gingrich came out with it.

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:17.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: So what you
have is that there's

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:24.160 align:middle line:84%
a kind of choreography
of this kind of coloring

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:26.050 align:middle line:84%
of every story that
comes out to have

00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:30.460 align:middle line:84%
to put it into this dialectical,
confrontational mode.

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And Newt Gingrich came
straight out immediately,

00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:35.170 align:middle line:84%
started saying, look it,
you remember this guy

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:36.620 align:middle line:90%
volunteered for Bernie Sanders.

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:36.930 align:middle line:90%
See what they're--

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like this
was Bernie's fault now.

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:38.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: --yeah, then
you see what they're like.

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the
programming is just--

00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:42.320 align:middle line:90%
it's almost laughable.

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well,
because that one

00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:52.150 align:middle line:84%
of the worldviews that the
nihilists try to descend to,

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:55.570 align:middle line:84%
once they can destroy any basic
belief in any kind of reality

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:57.730 align:middle line:84%
at all, they drop
into this thing

00:27:57.730 --> 00:28:01.500 align:middle line:84%
of what they call the dialectic,
which is the second paradigm

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:02.410 align:middle line:90%
worldview.

00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:06.370 align:middle line:84%
Kant said that it
was true, ultimately,

00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:09.850 align:middle line:84%
that individuals, because we're
conditioned by our genetics,

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:12.430 align:middle line:84%
by our culture that
we're brought up in,

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:15.010 align:middle line:84%
that we have a biased
perspective on reality.

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:16.990 align:middle line:90%
Kant pointed that out.

00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:18.580 align:middle line:84%
But what happened
is they followed up

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:20.340 align:middle line:90%
with that by saying, look--

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:23.350 align:middle line:84%
Nietzsche followed up
with this and Hegel.

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And they were saying,
look, given the fact

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:28.750 align:middle line:84%
that you can't come up with
an absolute insight into what

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:32.350 align:middle line:84%
reality is, what you can do
is you can follow a dialectic.

00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:35.980 align:middle line:84%
You can have one party
set up a thesis as to what

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:37.720 align:middle line:90%
their view of reality is.

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:40.030 align:middle line:84%
Another person can
set up an anti-thesis

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:41.440 align:middle line:90%
that's contrary to that.

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And you could have them have
this kind of confrontation,

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:44.275 align:middle line:90%
this struggle--

00:28:44.275 --> 00:28:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And keep people
trapped between the two.

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:47.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: --this
dialectic, if you want.

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And the ostensible
result of that

00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:53.620 align:middle line:84%
is to burn away the false
aspects of both perspectives

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:55.670 align:middle line:90%
and generate a new synthesis.

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:58.151 align:middle line:84%
But that synthesis immediately
becomes a new thesis.

00:28:58.151 --> 00:28:58.863 align:middle line:90%
It generates an anti-thesis.

00:28:58.863 --> 00:29:01.029 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going to
say, mostly people are just

00:29:01.029 --> 00:29:02.800 align:middle line:90%
hung up between the two.

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:05.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And this is what
is presently dominating

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.860 align:middle line:90%
the thinking in the country.

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:09.760 align:middle line:84%
That's why people-- you get
millions and millions of people

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:15.970 align:middle line:84%
watching the Oakland Golden
State Warriors fighting

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:17.670 align:middle line:90%
the Cleveland Cavaliers--

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:19.390 align:middle line:90%
another military thing.

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:23.115 align:middle line:84%
You have the green team
versus the red team.

00:29:23.115 --> 00:29:23.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Purple or--

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:26.281 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: You have the red
team versus the white team.

00:29:26.281 --> 00:29:29.260 align:middle line:84%
You have the red team versus
the blue team in politics.

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:33.430 align:middle line:84%
This is a dialectic, in which
the underpinning theory of that

00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:35.860 align:middle line:84%
is that you can't tell
what the truth is.

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:38.410 align:middle line:84%
That you've got to have two
completely contradictory people

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:42.370 align:middle line:84%
clashing and that you can't
really tell what the truth is.

00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:44.800 align:middle line:84%
This is a second
paradigm worldview

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:48.310 align:middle line:84%
that the military
industrial state feeds on.

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the minute we
got to the end of the Cold War,

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:53.800 align:middle line:84%
there was this period
where President Gorbachev

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.260 align:middle line:84%
and others-- we all came
together to try to say,

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:58.180 align:middle line:84%
look can't we come
up with something

00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:01.540 align:middle line:84%
to replace this dialectical,
confrontational, competitive

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:02.760 align:middle line:90%
worldview?

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And that the American public
has been force-fed on this

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.030 align:middle line:90%
football, baseball--

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:10.240 align:middle line:84%
hating your next door community,
because you play baseball

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.010 align:middle line:90%
or football against them.

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:15.560 align:middle line:10%
Let's get past this thing and
set up a new paradigm worldview

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:18.940 align:middle line:10%
that is much more unitive,
and cooperative, and mutually

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:20.470 align:middle line:10%
beneficial for everyone.

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:23.800 align:middle line:10%
And we said, but we knew we only
had a short window within which

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:26.980 align:middle line:10%
to do that, because the
national security state thrives

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:28.100 align:middle line:10%
upon the dialectic.

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:30.792 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, maybe we can
look at it as just delayed.

00:30:30.792 --> 00:30:32.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well,
no, it is delayed.

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:33.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's just delayed.

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:34.160 align:middle line:84%
It's not like it's
not going to happen.

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:34.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: No, no.

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:35.300 align:middle line:90%
They're pushing us back.

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And we knew we had
a short period here.

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And what happened, of
course, immediately was 9/11.

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And you had the W. Bush
administration saying,

00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:45.550 align:middle line:84%
you're either with
us or against us.

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:49.270 align:middle line:84%
You're either going to support
us on this war on terrorism.

00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And then they started
coming up with this theory

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:54.310 align:middle line:84%
that there was this
drive for a caliphate,

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:57.790 align:middle line:84%
that the Islamic jihadists were
trying to establish a caliphate

00:30:57.790 --> 00:31:01.210 align:middle line:84%
to impose Sharia law over
everybody in the world.

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:02.140 align:middle line:90%
Complete propaganda--

00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:03.175 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: False
head-- all false--

00:31:03.175 --> 00:31:04.549 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: --complete
propaganda.

00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:06.550 align:middle line:84%
What they're doing
is opposing our

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:09.890 align:middle line:84%
having invaded the oil fields
at the end of the Cold War.

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:10.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:13.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Seized
control of the oil fields

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:15.760 align:middle line:84%
and they've been trying
to get us to leave.

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.431 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
happening here.

00:31:17.431 --> 00:31:18.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Self-defense really.

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:20.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: So what
we're trying to say here

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:23.830 align:middle line:84%
is that we do not
want people to despair

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:26.770 align:middle line:84%
in thinking that either
there is no truth at all

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:28.720 align:middle line:84%
or that the only way
you can get at the truth

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:32.020 align:middle line:84%
is by having this dialectical,
confrontational fight all

00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:35.290 align:middle line:84%
the time that
inevitably leads to war.

00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:37.840 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we have to
come to grips with right now.

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:40.330 align:middle line:84%
But we're in a temporary
period right here where

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:42.790 align:middle line:90%
nihilism has taken over.

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:44.410 align:middle line:90%
No belief in truth at all.

00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:46.730 align:middle line:84%
You have a present
administration

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:48.960 align:middle line:84%
that thinks that
they can say anything

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:52.210 align:middle line:84%
and the problem is is
that if the other people

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:57.190 align:middle line:84%
respond to that by thinking
that they're the problem--

00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:01.060 align:middle line:84%
if you can only get rid of
them, everything will be OK.

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:02.496 align:middle line:90%
That's just more dialectics.

00:32:02.496 --> 00:32:04.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly, because
then there'll be another them.

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:05.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:06.850 align:middle line:84%
That brings up-- let's
just put the spotlight

00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:07.891 align:middle line:90%
on what's happening then.

00:32:07.891 --> 00:32:10.030 align:middle line:90%
This is very complex.

00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:13.570 align:middle line:84%
Looking at it through the
lens of the mass manipulation

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:15.790 align:middle line:84%
as a result of the
national security state,

00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:17.770 align:middle line:84%
and how we're being
manipulated by the media

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:21.910 align:middle line:84%
on the Russian affair,
and what's actually

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:25.090 align:middle line:84%
happening legally and
constitutionally with that,

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:27.370 align:middle line:90%
because this is interesting.

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:29.470 align:middle line:84%
I think there could be
some breakthroughs here.

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:31.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: It's an
extraordinary moment--

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:35.350 align:middle line:84%
it's an extraordinary
moment right now, Regina.

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:38.600 align:middle line:84%
We have another incidence
where you actually,

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:42.490 align:middle line:84%
for one of the very few times,
you actually see real events

00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:44.260 align:middle line:90%
taking place in Congress.

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:47.230 align:middle line:84%
People asking questions
that aren't scripted,

00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:49.960 align:middle line:84%
demanding answers that
aren't pre-canned,

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:52.990 align:middle line:84%
and just going
through this shadow

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:56.090 align:middle line:84%
play of pretending that
they're all disagreeing

00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:57.920 align:middle line:90%
and they all end up agreeing.

00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:59.950 align:middle line:84%
There's a real event
going on right now.

00:32:59.950 --> 00:33:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And what's happened is that
our country has recognized

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:07.450 align:middle line:84%
that the tactics that we
were adopting internationally

00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:09.280 align:middle line:84%
to manipulate other
people's elections

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:12.310 align:middle line:84%
and make sure that
adequately conservative

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:16.840 align:middle line:84%
and capitalist supporting
regimes were put into power--

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:18.520 align:middle line:84%
they're saying oh,
this is terrible,

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:19.780 align:middle line:90%
somebody has done this to us.

00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:20.610 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:21.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:21.940 align:middle line:90%
It's ironic.

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:24.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: That they've
actually propagandized us.

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:27.190 align:middle line:84%
They've actually gotten
to release information

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:28.870 align:middle line:84%
about Hillary Clinton
that is negative.

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, it
depressed her vote,

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:32.950 align:middle line:90%
and therefore, Trump has won.

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:35.980 align:middle line:84%
Trump has a policy of
trying to establish

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:38.140 align:middle line:84%
more constructive
relations with Russia,

00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:40.360 align:middle line:84%
and so therefore, they
manipulated our election

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:42.430 align:middle line:90%
to get him elected.

00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And now people are
horrified by this.

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:47.110 align:middle line:84%
A product of the
fantasy that they

00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:49.147 align:middle line:84%
were fed before that the
United States was not

00:33:49.147 --> 00:33:50.230 align:middle line:90%
engaging in that activity.

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:51.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:53.687 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: So they are
horrified like in "Casablanca,"

00:33:53.687 --> 00:33:56.020 align:middle line:84%
with Rick-- oh no, there's
gambling going on right here.

00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:56.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just like virgins,
we've been violated.

00:33:56.930 --> 00:33:57.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yes, exactly.

00:33:57.930 --> 00:34:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And so but what's
happening right now

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:03.940 align:middle line:84%
is that we have an
opportunity to start

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:07.330 align:middle line:84%
asking fundamental
constitutional questions again.

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And one of the major
constitutional questions

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:12.340 align:middle line:84%
that are in front of us
right now is is there in fact

00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:15.850 align:middle line:84%
an independent
investigatory capacity that

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:19.300 align:middle line:84%
exists in Congress or
in the judicial branch

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:21.969 align:middle line:84%
to be able to examine
the executive branch?

00:34:21.969 --> 00:34:24.940 align:middle line:84%
Or does the executive
branch have total power?

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Can the President of the
United States, for example,

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:33.400 align:middle line:84%
fire any FBI director,
any member of the Justice

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:36.820 align:middle line:84%
Department, who are
attempting to investigate

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:40.150 align:middle line:84%
whether his campaign
worked in collusion

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:44.105 align:middle line:84%
with the Russian government to
try to manipulate our election?

00:34:44.105 --> 00:34:44.905 align:middle line:90%
And the--

00:34:44.905 --> 00:34:47.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, what about
the special prosecutor, even

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:47.850 align:middle line:90%
more so?

00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:49.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Robert Mueller.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.580 align:middle line:84%
Robert Mueller, at the present
time-- it's interesting,

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:53.469 align:middle line:84%
they immediately
started referring to him

00:34:53.469 --> 00:34:56.440 align:middle line:84%
as the special counsel
or special prosecutor.

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:57.696 align:middle line:90%
He ain't that.

00:34:57.696 --> 00:34:58.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What is he?

00:34:58.570 --> 00:34:59.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: No.

00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:02.170 align:middle line:84%
He has been hired by
the Justice Department.

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:05.350 align:middle line:84%
He's been hired by the
acting assistant attorney

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:10.450 align:middle line:84%
general, because Jeff Sessions
has recused himself ostensibly.

00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And so the acting assistant
attorney general simply

00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:18.220 align:middle line:84%
hired an additional
outside counsel

00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:20.920 align:middle line:84%
who is an employee of
the Justice Department

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:23.020 align:middle line:84%
to come in to
conduct a supposedly

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:24.700 align:middle line:90%
independent investigation.

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:27.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, because of the quality of
Robert Mueller, a lot of people

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:29.830 align:middle line:84%
trust him to engage in
an independent review.

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:30.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Do you?

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:31.090 align:middle line:90%
I mean this is--

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:32.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well,
it's interesting.

00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:38.660 align:middle line:84%
I was troubled by the fact
that Comey, in his testimony,

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:42.920 align:middle line:84%
said that he released
his own memoranda--

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:46.580 align:middle line:84%
these contemporary notes on his
meeting with the president--

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:49.490 align:middle line:84%
he released them to the public
for the purpose of getting

00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:51.500 align:middle line:90%
a special prosecutor appointed.

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:54.350 align:middle line:84%
There was a period of
time shortly following

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:58.190 align:middle line:84%
the Watergate scandal
when the Congress had

00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:02.300 align:middle line:84%
passed a special statute, called
the special prosecutor statute.

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:06.770 align:middle line:84%
And this said that if in fact,
the executive department--

00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:09.710 align:middle line:84%
any high level official in
the executive department--

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:13.850 align:middle line:84%
is being investigated and
the Justice Department,

00:36:13.850 --> 00:36:16.670 align:middle line:84%
because it's subject to the
control of the president,

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:19.850 align:middle line:84%
can't be trusted to
investigate them independently,

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:22.890 align:middle line:84%
or the president can fire
anybody that investigates it

00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:23.690 align:middle line:90%
too closely--

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:27.020 align:middle line:84%
any associate of his or
political appointee of his--

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:30.740 align:middle line:84%
that there needs to be a
special statute authorizing

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:33.110 align:middle line:84%
the judicial branch
of the government--

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:37.010 align:middle line:84%
a special panel that is
set up inside the D.C.

00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:38.540 align:middle line:90%
Circuit Court of Appeals--

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:41.780 align:middle line:84%
there's a special panel of
judges for the appointment

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:43.380 align:middle line:90%
of special prosecutors.

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And they can appoint a
genuinely independent person

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:48.282 align:middle line:90%
to investigate.

00:36:48.282 --> 00:36:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that what's
happened with Mueller?

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:50.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: No.

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:51.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is not.

00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:52.473 align:middle line:90%
That has not happened yet.

00:36:52.473 --> 00:36:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Because
everybody insisted

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:57.230 align:middle line:84%
upon putting a sunset
clause on that statute

00:36:57.230 --> 00:37:01.354 align:middle line:84%
and so it dissipated after
10 years and went away.

00:37:01.354 --> 00:37:02.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Can it be revived?

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:03.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: It can.

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And so that if in
fact the president

00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:07.280 align:middle line:84%
tried to fire
Mueller now, which he

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:08.600 align:middle line:84%
has the constitutional
authority to do--

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:09.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He's threatened to.

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.240 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:13.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Well, it's not clear.

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:17.670 align:middle line:84%
Newt Gingrich has said, that
the president is discussing this

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:19.294 align:middle line:90%
and his authority to do this.

00:37:19.294 --> 00:37:20.835 align:middle line:84%
And that set up this
kind of wildfire

00:37:20.835 --> 00:37:23.450 align:middle line:84%
by other people being
worried he might do it.

00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:26.870 align:middle line:84%
If he were to do that, then
Congress could then simply

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:31.240 align:middle line:84%
convene and reenact the
special prosecutor statute,

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:35.600 align:middle line:84%
re-establish a special
select group of the judges

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:38.510 align:middle line:84%
on the Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia,

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:41.030 align:middle line:84%
and have them appoint an
independent prosecutor.

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:43.519 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But wouldn't that
require bipartisanship?

00:37:43.519 --> 00:37:44.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yes, it would.

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And so the question is
really is whether enough

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:50.180 align:middle line:84%
of the Republican
members of Congress

00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:54.570 align:middle line:84%
would be so offended by the
president firing Mueller

00:37:54.570 --> 00:37:56.490 align:middle line:84%
that they would
agree to do this.

00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's the operational
question that's on the floor

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:00.470 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Is if, in fact, the
president were to do that,

00:38:03.010 --> 00:38:05.300 align:middle line:84%
would there be enough
support from the Republicans

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:08.630 align:middle line:84%
in Congress to enact a new
special prosecutor act?

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And if they did,
it's almost certain

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:12.770 align:middle line:84%
that the person who
would be appointed

00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:14.990 align:middle line:90%
would be Robert Mueller again.

00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:16.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:17.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And so that what
they would be doing is saying,

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:19.700 align:middle line:84%
see you can't get
away with doing that,

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:21.710 align:middle line:84%
even though you can get
away with doing that.

00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kind of like
the travel ban thing.

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:23.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can do it,
but it's not going to hold.

00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:26.865 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: The
judicial branch is

00:38:26.865 --> 00:38:29.360 align:middle line:90%
going to rise up and check you.

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's what would
happen I think here,

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:32.584 align:middle line:90%
if he were to do that.

00:38:32.584 --> 00:38:34.250 align:middle line:84%
Now what we hear the
latest thing for us

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:37.580 align:middle line:84%
that we hear is not only
that Robert Mueller is

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:40.070 align:middle line:84%
now for the first
time investigating

00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:43.910 align:middle line:84%
the president himself for
potentially being involved

00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:47.990 align:middle line:84%
in colluding with the
Russians, but specifically

00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:51.740 align:middle line:84%
for obstructing the
investigation by firing

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:52.700 align:middle line:90%
the Head of the FBI--

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:58.190 align:middle line:84%
Comey-- and going to
the Director of National

00:38:58.190 --> 00:39:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence and
going to the others

00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:04.970 align:middle line:84%
to try to get them to
pressure the FBI to stop

00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:06.750 align:middle line:90%
the investigation.

00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:12.320 align:middle line:84%
I think that what we can have
is a potential in the 2018

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:15.770 align:middle line:84%
election and the 2020 election
coming up, to actually

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:19.460 align:middle line:84%
have a genuinely progressive
alternative that says,

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:23.520 align:middle line:84%
look everybody agrees that we
want to get past this thing.

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And so that if there is a
genuine independent party--

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:28.370 align:middle line:84%
not an independent
party that just

00:39:28.370 --> 00:39:30.180 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have any
positions on things

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:32.300 align:middle line:84%
or just I don't like
either one of them--

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:34.910 align:middle line:84%
that's not-- I mean, in
a certain sense that's

00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:35.780 align:middle line:90%
independent.

00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:38.510 align:middle line:84%
But what you really have to do
is develop a set of commitments

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:41.270 align:middle line:84%
to constitutional
principles, a commitment

00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:44.900 align:middle line:84%
to truth and honesty, a
commitment to integrity.

00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:47.990 align:middle line:84%
All the things that
have been pretended

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:50.550 align:middle line:84%
to be operational in
the United States.

00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:53.180 align:middle line:84%
But what we can do is
we can catch them up

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:56.130 align:middle line:84%
on this, because they've
always promised that this is

00:39:56.130 --> 00:39:57.680 align:middle line:90%
what the offer is that we have.

00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And so if we can just
come forward and say,

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:03.980 align:middle line:84%
look we're going to have an
independent party that is

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:07.340 align:middle line:84%
genuinely independent, it is
committed to the bedrock values

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:10.550 align:middle line:84%
of our American Constitution--
not some reactionary reading

00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:13.700 align:middle line:84%
of the Constitution that took a
photograph of the Constitution

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:18.830 align:middle line:84%
in 1789, and said, that's an
original interpretation and you

00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:21.540 align:middle line:84%
can't have women's rights,
because they weren't included

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:23.000 align:middle line:90%
and all of that--

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.510 align:middle line:84%
but a genuinely intentional
and progressive view of this.

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:28.700 align:middle line:84%
An independent
view that is rooted

00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:30.230 align:middle line:90%
in constitutional scholarship.

00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And to begin to elect
a set of legislators

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:36.750 align:middle line:84%
who are independent
from both sides,

00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:42.120 align:middle line:84%
genuinely, and will hold
control inside the legislatures

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:45.540 align:middle line:84%
to begin to start to implement
the true vision of the American

00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:47.075 align:middle line:84%
Constitution in
American history.

00:40:47.075 --> 00:40:47.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hear, hear.

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:48.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's our chance.

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:49.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:50.880 align:middle line:90%
I agree with you wholeheartedly.

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:54.540 align:middle line:84%
But for now, we have to let
investigations, justice,

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:55.910 align:middle line:90%
and such play out honestly.

00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:56.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:40:56.910 --> 00:40:58.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We haven't
done that in a long time.

00:40:58.110 --> 00:40:58.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: No.

00:40:58.590 --> 00:40:58.680 align:middle line:90%
We have not done that.

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It has to
be allowed to proceed.

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:01.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And as
they say, everything

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:02.774 align:middle line:90%
is politicized in Washington DC.

00:41:02.774 --> 00:41:03.898 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, everything.

00:41:03.898 --> 00:41:05.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And so
that the question

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:11.510 align:middle line:84%
is whether Mueller is going
to be able to rise above this.

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:14.670 align:middle line:84%
The reason why both
Republicans, Democrats respect

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:17.490 align:middle line:84%
him is being said, because
he's genuinely honest,

00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:19.900 align:middle line:90%
generally is a man of integrity.

00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:23.680 align:middle line:84%
So if he lives up
to that billing

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:27.950 align:middle line:84%
and goes completely through
with this investigation,

00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:32.390 align:middle line:84%
and reveals the
fact that there has

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:35.560 align:middle line:84%
been this manipulation of the
voting going on for some time,

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:40.160 align:middle line:84%
and that there needs
to be consequences

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.490 align:middle line:84%
for both the Republican
and Democratic Party.

00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:45.920 align:middle line:84%
That people have to stop
having this blind trust

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.415 align:middle line:90%
in one or the other.

00:41:47.415 --> 00:41:48.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:51.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: That they are not
the repositories of truth.

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:54.250 align:middle line:84%
There needs to be an
independent view of this.

00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:56.270 align:middle line:84%
There needs to be an
independent party.

00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:58.700 align:middle line:84%
There needs to be a party that
takes a complete and close

00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:01.870 align:middle line:84%
honest look at global climate
change, what the evidence is,

00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:04.245 align:middle line:84%
so that you're not trapped in
one extreme view or another

00:42:04.245 --> 00:42:05.045 align:middle line:90%
of this.

00:42:05.045 --> 00:42:06.500 align:middle line:84%
Let's get an honest
view of this.

00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:08.810 align:middle line:84%
To get an honest view
of the issue of how

00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:10.940 align:middle line:84%
we are going to be dealing
with the racial problem

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:13.010 align:middle line:84%
in our country,
of the racism that

00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:15.977 align:middle line:84%
is a remnant of our
institution of slavery.

00:42:15.977 --> 00:42:18.560 align:middle line:84%
If we're going to have an honest
look at what the consequences

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:21.940 align:middle line:84%
are of the misogyny
against women

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:23.900 align:middle line:84%
and have a completely
honest view of what

00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:28.190 align:middle line:84%
this is and the
view of our system.

00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:31.910 align:middle line:84%
We've got to get rid
of the corporations.

00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:35.000 align:middle line:84%
The corporations have only
existed since the Robber Baron

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.370 align:middle line:84%
era, where you have
this thing set up

00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:39.470 align:middle line:84%
where the owners
of the companies

00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:42.830 align:middle line:84%
are completely immunized
against any personal liability,

00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:44.150 align:middle line:90%
because they're stockholders.

00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:46.940 align:middle line:84%
The management is completely
immune from liability.

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:48.470 align:middle line:84%
The board of directors
is completely

00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:49.690 align:middle line:90%
immune from liability.

00:42:49.690 --> 00:42:52.640 align:middle line:84%
So that only the corporation and
the assets of the corporation

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:55.190 align:middle line:84%
are all that are potentially
subject to any kind

00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:56.720 align:middle line:90%
of punishment.

00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:00.290 align:middle line:84%
Any sinful structure
like that, just

00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:03.290 align:middle line:84%
as Pope Francis points out
again in his global encyclical

00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:05.120 align:middle line:90%
of June of 2015--

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:07.700 align:middle line:90%
this is a sinful structure.

00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And what it's done
is it's taken control

00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:11.310 align:middle line:90%
of our entire government.

00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's now set up
a fascist government

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:17.390 align:middle line:84%
getting our government to be at
the bidding of the corporations

00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:18.920 align:middle line:84%
and the owners of
the corporations.

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:20.840 align:middle line:84%
We've got to have an
independent party that is

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:23.210 align:middle line:90%
going to stop the corporations.

00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:25.140 align:middle line:90%
They're created by the state.

00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:26.390 align:middle line:90%
They're a government creation.

00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:29.330 align:middle line:84%
Without a license to
perform like this,

00:43:29.330 --> 00:43:31.410 align:middle line:90%
they're going to be liable.

00:43:31.410 --> 00:43:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And we're not against capitalism
or entrepreneurialism.

00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:38.810 align:middle line:84%
If people want to
have a business,

00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:41.000 align:middle line:84%
and want to make a
reasonable profit,

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.850 align:middle line:84%
and want to be held responsible
for any damages done

00:43:43.850 --> 00:43:47.150 align:middle line:84%
by their business--
fine, let them do that.

00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the inhumane
practices have to stop,

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:52.940 align:middle line:84%
because the large
corporations are essentially

00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:54.887 align:middle line:90%
behaving in an inhumane way.

00:43:54.887 --> 00:43:56.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: They are
sinful structures.

00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:59.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And they
need to be taken apart.

00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And even the Libertarian Party,
with all of its shortcomings,

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:07.910 align:middle line:84%
had in its platform
for years that

00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:10.851 align:middle line:84%
the state-sponsored corporations
have to be eliminated.

00:44:10.851 --> 00:44:13.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think most of
the people listening to this

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:15.190 align:middle line:84%
are on the same page
with you on that one.

00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:15.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yes.

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'm
saying is that there

00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:21.680 align:middle line:84%
are some keys to the
solution to this problem.

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think we have to have an
independent party like that.

00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:28.390 align:middle line:84%
I think we need to start
mounting candidates

00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:30.257 align:middle line:84%
and we have to speak
out about this.

00:44:30.257 --> 00:44:32.257 align:middle line:84%
We have to come to grips
with the injustice that

00:44:32.257 --> 00:44:34.771 align:middle line:84%
is being performed to the
Native American people.

00:44:34.771 --> 00:44:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to get
right on that in just a second.

00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:39.895 align:middle line:84%
But what's beautiful and hopeful
about all this is I'm starting

00:44:39.895 --> 00:44:42.380 align:middle line:84%
to see-- we're all
starting to see--

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:44.540 align:middle line:84%
incidences around
the country where

00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:47.567 align:middle line:84%
totally unexpected and
unlikely people are popping

00:44:47.567 --> 00:44:48.650 align:middle line:90%
up and running for office.

00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And they're just claiming
to be honest citizens that

00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:52.255 align:middle line:90%
are somewhat informed.

00:44:52.255 --> 00:44:52.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yeah.

00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:53.150 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:54.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And that's beautiful.

00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:55.050 align:middle line:90%
That's how it should be.

00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:56.889 align:middle line:84%
Maybe again then we
can start reflecting

00:44:56.889 --> 00:44:57.930 align:middle line:90%
the wishes of the people.

00:44:57.930 --> 00:44:59.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yeah.

00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that needs to be done

00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:04.670 align:middle line:84%
is to have people
step forward and take

00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:06.690 align:middle line:84%
advantage of the
internet that exists now.

00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:07.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:07.490 --> 00:45:08.420 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:12.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: To put these
college courses online

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:14.475 align:middle line:84%
so that young kids in
their early years--

00:45:14.475 --> 00:45:16.100 align:middle line:84%
in junior high school
and high school--

00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:19.290 align:middle line:84%
can watch these courses,
learn critical thinking.

00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:23.086 align:middle line:84%
Even though their public
schools are run by the state,

00:45:23.086 --> 00:45:24.460 align:middle line:84%
that they can
stand up in class--

00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:25.418 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Self-educate.

00:45:25.418 --> 00:45:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: --and say,
look I've seen this thing,

00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:30.016 align:middle line:84%
I don't agree with what
you're saying here.

00:45:30.016 --> 00:45:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And there need to be enough
of them, so they don't say,

00:45:32.370 --> 00:45:34.610 align:middle line:84%
well, you're going to get
expelled, because you're

00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:36.540 align:middle line:84%
disrupting the class,
interfering with what

00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:38.130 align:middle line:90%
we're trying to teach here.

00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:41.240 align:middle line:84%
So I think that the
internet presents

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:43.400 align:middle line:84%
an extraordinary
opportunity for us

00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:47.280 align:middle line:84%
to establish a genuinely
independent political party

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:50.210 align:middle line:84%
and to get back to the
bedrock values of the American

00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:53.270 align:middle line:84%
Constitution, and to
share these values

00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:55.610 align:middle line:84%
in an open and honest way
with people around the world.

00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:56.530 align:middle line:90%
Not coerce them.

00:45:56.530 --> 00:45:58.500 align:middle line:90%
Not invade them.

00:45:58.500 --> 00:45:59.870 align:middle line:90%
Not infiltrate them.

00:45:59.870 --> 00:46:02.210 align:middle line:84%
Not set up covert
operations against them.

00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:06.040 align:middle line:84%
You make these options available
for the people of the world

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:07.790 align:middle line:90%
and see what the people do.

00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:09.245 align:middle line:90%
I think the people will respond.

00:46:09.245 --> 00:46:10.045 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:46:10.045 --> 00:46:10.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I do too.

00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:12.350 align:middle line:90%
We're on the same page.

00:46:12.350 --> 00:46:14.120 align:middle line:90%
I see it bright ahead.

00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:16.540 align:middle line:84%
We just have some more muck
to go through looks like.

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:18.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: We've got a temporary
period of some challenges.

00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:19.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, we do.

00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:20.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:21.440 align:middle line:90%
So let's move on to the Lakota.

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:23.850 align:middle line:90%
You're their counsel.

00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And there was recently
a very hopeful headline

00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:28.862 align:middle line:90%
that came up and--

00:46:28.862 --> 00:46:30.570 align:middle line:84%
we only have a couple
of minutes on that,

00:46:30.570 --> 00:46:32.530 align:middle line:84%
because I want to get
to something really,

00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:33.910 align:middle line:90%
really, really hopeful.

00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:35.150 align:middle line:90%
So tell us what's going on.

00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:38.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: On June 14, the
United States District Court

00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:41.050 align:middle line:84%
in Washington DC,
Judge Boasberg,

00:46:41.050 --> 00:46:48.720 align:middle line:84%
entered an opinion stating that
it was unlawful for the US Army

00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:51.900 align:middle line:84%
Corps of Engineers under
the Trump administration

00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:55.170 align:middle line:84%
to have granted a
certificate of easement

00:46:55.170 --> 00:46:57.450 align:middle line:84%
to the Dakota Access
Pipeline to allow them

00:46:57.450 --> 00:47:00.536 align:middle line:84%
to complete construction
and start pumping oil

00:47:00.536 --> 00:47:01.410 align:middle line:90%
through the pipeline.

00:47:01.410 --> 00:47:02.618 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which they've done.

00:47:02.618 --> 00:47:04.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Which
they've done not

00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:06.889 align:middle line:84%
in small part, because
Boasberg didn't enter

00:47:06.889 --> 00:47:08.680 align:middle line:84%
a temporary restraining
order against them,

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:09.930 align:middle line:90%
which he should have.

00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And so there's been
a lot of cheering

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:13.140 align:middle line:84%
going on now that
he has declared

00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:15.030 align:middle line:90%
that that was unlawful.

00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:16.620 align:middle line:84%
But the problem
is that because he

00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:20.104 align:middle line:84%
had allowed it to
go to completion,

00:47:20.104 --> 00:47:22.020 align:middle line:84%
the issue that we really
have to deal with now

00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:25.140 align:middle line:84%
is that he has said that
there were three major areas

00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:28.890 align:middle line:84%
that the US Army Corps of
Engineers and the Environmental

00:47:28.890 --> 00:47:33.262 align:middle line:84%
Protection Agency of the Trump
administration did not consider

00:47:33.262 --> 00:47:35.220 align:middle line:90%
and they have to consider those.

00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:38.490 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that Judge
Boasberg, in the same opinion,

00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:43.230 align:middle line:84%
has stated that, even if now
in retrospect the Environmental

00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Protection Agency and the
US Army Corps of Engineers

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:48.780 align:middle line:84%
do go back and look
at those issues

00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:50.950 align:middle line:84%
and whatever they say--
oh, we've looked at them

00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:53.700 align:middle line:84%
and we still determine
that even if we had given

00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:55.200 align:middle line:84%
full consideration
of this, we still

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:56.950 align:middle line:84%
should have gotten the
easement, we should

00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:58.080 align:middle line:90%
have granted the easement.

00:47:58.080 --> 00:47:59.460 align:middle line:84%
And they say, so
therefore, we're

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:02.327 align:middle line:84%
going to remedy those things,
we've considered them,

00:48:02.327 --> 00:48:04.410 align:middle line:84%
and we don't think they're
adequately serious that

00:48:04.410 --> 00:48:06.010 align:middle line:90%
should stop the pipeline.

00:48:06.010 --> 00:48:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not going to
get you anywhere after that.

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And he has said that the court
has very limited authority

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:17.280 align:middle line:84%
to gainsay the kind
of subjective decision

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:19.620 align:middle line:84%
that the agency is going
to make about that.

00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:21.715 align:middle line:84%
And he has said that
elections have consequences--

00:48:21.715 --> 00:48:23.490 align:middle line:84%
he actually said
it in his opinion--

00:48:23.490 --> 00:48:24.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:48:24.290 --> 00:48:24.930 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:26.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And that
therefore if they

00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:28.500 align:middle line:84%
have a judgment that even
after they've considered

00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:31.930 align:middle line:84%
those things, they still should
have granted the easement,

00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:33.850 align:middle line:84%
then the easement
will still be valid.

00:48:33.850 --> 00:48:38.580 align:middle line:84%
So the question that will be
in front of him on June 21,

00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:43.830 align:middle line:84%
is whether or not he should stop
the flow of oil in the pipeline

00:48:43.830 --> 00:48:47.550 align:middle line:84%
while those considerations
are being evaluated.

00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And I personally don't
believe he's going to do that.

00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:52.140 align:middle line:84%
Because the fact
is it isn't going

00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:55.590 align:middle line:84%
to take the Trump administration
EPA and the US Army

00:48:55.590 --> 00:48:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Corps of Engineers very long to
turn and look at those things

00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:00.510 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, we've
given those a good look,

00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:02.430 align:middle line:84%
we don't think those
are troublesome at all.

00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:05.760 align:middle line:84%
And so now we have checked
those little boxes,

00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:08.460 align:middle line:84%
we've crossed the t and
dotted the i on those things

00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:10.305 align:middle line:84%
that we might have
slipped up on before.

00:49:10.305 --> 00:49:11.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
oil keeps flowing.

00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:13.146 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And then
the oil keeps flowing.

00:49:13.146 --> 00:49:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And so that what
we're faced with

00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:17.310 align:middle line:84%
is a series of
some 800 people who

00:49:17.310 --> 00:49:20.640 align:middle line:84%
have been arrested and
charged with crimes

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:22.840 align:middle line:90%
by the state of North Dakota.

00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And some 150 of them,
180 of them now,

00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:30.150 align:middle line:84%
have been dismissed
by the judges

00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:32.220 align:middle line:84%
of them having absolutely
no evidence whatsoever

00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:33.720 align:middle line:90%
against those people.

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:37.350 align:middle line:84%
But there's still a
remaining 600 people or so.

00:49:37.350 --> 00:49:39.300 align:middle line:84%
There's about 50 of them
who have been charged

00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:40.785 align:middle line:90%
with serious felony crimes.

00:49:40.785 --> 00:49:42.660 align:middle line:84%
But there's only
one person who's

00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:45.780 align:middle line:84%
been charged with
inciting the riot,

00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:48.690 align:middle line:84%
instigating the insurrection
against the state of North

00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Dakota as it were,
and that's Chase Iron

00:49:51.590 --> 00:49:54.710 align:middle line:84%
Eyes, the Democratic
Party nominee.

00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:56.550 align:middle line:84%
The National Democratic
Party nominee

00:49:56.550 --> 00:50:00.660 align:middle line:84%
for the 2016 congressional
race for the one single seat

00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:02.880 align:middle line:84%
in Congress, in the
House of Representatives

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:04.320 align:middle line:90%
that the state has.

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:06.330 align:middle line:84%
He has been charged
with instigating

00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:09.690 align:middle line:84%
the entire insurrection
against the state.

00:50:09.690 --> 00:50:12.210 align:middle line:90%
And I'm representing him.

00:50:12.210 --> 00:50:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And I'll be representing a
couple of the other people that

00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:19.950 align:middle line:84%
have been charged with
participating in the riot.

00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And he's also been charged
with trespassing, interestingly

00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:25.140 align:middle line:84%
enough, on land
where his people have

00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:27.960 align:middle line:84%
been for hundreds
and hundreds of years

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:30.510 align:middle line:84%
prior to the US government
insisting they have

00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:32.680 align:middle line:90%
taken control of that land.

00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:34.800 align:middle line:84%
So there are a number
of major issues

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:36.830 align:middle line:90%
that are still at stake here.

00:50:36.830 --> 00:50:38.430 align:middle line:84%
There are other
people to be tried.

00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:40.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm just representing
a small handful

00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:42.847 align:middle line:84%
of the people that
have key charges that

00:50:42.847 --> 00:50:45.180 align:middle line:84%
have been made against them
that give us the opportunity

00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:48.569 align:middle line:84%
to raise these
fundamental challenges.

00:50:48.569 --> 00:50:50.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh my gosh, of
course, we've run out of time.

00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:53.370 align:middle line:84%
I want to just tease--
just a little tease--

00:50:53.370 --> 00:50:55.590 align:middle line:84%
the Monterey Community
Energy Company and what's

00:50:55.590 --> 00:50:57.090 align:middle line:84%
happening down
there, because you've

00:50:57.090 --> 00:51:01.211 align:middle line:84%
managed to take back control
over your own power company.

00:51:01.211 --> 00:51:02.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:51:02.210 --> 00:51:04.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about that
for two minutes, because we're

00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:04.670 align:middle line:90%
over.

00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:06.253 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: In the
state of California,

00:51:06.253 --> 00:51:09.080 align:middle line:84%
under the leadership of
Governor Jerry Brown,

00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:12.000 align:middle line:84%
we have passed legislation
that authorizes each county

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.290 align:middle line:84%
in the state of California
to set up its own independent

00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:18.990 align:middle line:84%
community choice
energy company--

00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:21.015 align:middle line:84%
publicly owned, not by
private stockholders

00:51:21.015 --> 00:51:23.020 align:middle line:84%
and not-for-profit--
and that they

00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:25.870 align:middle line:84%
can purchase completely
clean energy from wind

00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:28.180 align:middle line:90%
and solar and tidal power.

00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And what we've done now is
we've established the largest

00:51:30.790 --> 00:51:34.420 align:middle line:84%
community choice energy company
in the country-- in the world

00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:36.400 align:middle line:84%
actually-- for the
entire three counties

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:40.180 align:middle line:84%
around Monterey, and Santa
Cruz, and San Benito.

00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:41.770 align:middle line:84%
We're now going
to be expanding it

00:51:41.770 --> 00:51:45.590 align:middle line:84%
down south into San
Luis Obispo and Ventura

00:51:45.590 --> 00:51:47.170 align:middle line:90%
and down in San Diego.

00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's been moving
up north-- it's

00:51:49.070 --> 00:51:50.687 align:middle line:90%
now up in northern California.

00:51:50.687 --> 00:51:52.270 align:middle line:84%
We're going to move
up the coast line.

00:51:52.270 --> 00:51:54.478 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get the state
of Oregon and Washington

00:51:54.478 --> 00:51:56.020 align:middle line:90%
to pass these statutes.

00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And what we're doing is we're
replacing the Pacific Gas

00:51:58.850 --> 00:52:03.280 align:middle line:84%
and Electric Company
that is still using coal

00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:05.371 align:middle line:90%
and petroleum and natural gas--

00:52:05.371 --> 00:52:07.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
the rates they charge.

00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:08.578 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And in
fact, we're going

00:52:08.578 --> 00:52:11.830 align:middle line:84%
to be selling the
electricity for only 3/4

00:52:11.830 --> 00:52:13.950 align:middle line:84%
of what it costs
for the dirty fuel.

00:52:13.950 --> 00:52:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And also, we've gotten the
churches and synagogues

00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:18.700 align:middle line:84%
of all the denominations
that are now

00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:22.480 align:middle line:84%
starting to agree to put solar
panels on all of their churches

00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:24.405 align:middle line:90%
and houses of worship.

00:52:24.405 --> 00:52:25.780 align:middle line:84%
I keep trying to
get them to call

00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:28.150 align:middle line:90%
it the divine light and power.

00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:29.080 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:52:30.010 --> 00:52:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: But the bottom line
is that we have now 48 churches

00:52:32.890 --> 00:52:34.180 align:middle line:90%
that are--

00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:37.840 align:middle line:84%
the Catholic churches have
led the way on this, because

00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:40.960 align:middle line:84%
of Pope Francis' global
encyclical on global climate

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:42.010 align:middle line:90%
change.

00:52:42.010 --> 00:52:45.190 align:middle line:84%
So they've agreed to give--
the diocese in Monterey agreed

00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:47.290 align:middle line:84%
to give loans to
all the churches

00:52:47.290 --> 00:52:50.699 align:middle line:84%
to pay for putting
these on their roofs.

00:52:50.699 --> 00:52:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to be
generating more power than they

00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:55.650 align:middle line:84%
really need to pay
for years and then

00:52:55.650 --> 00:52:59.450 align:middle line:84%
selling it for one third of its
price to the energy company.

00:52:59.450 --> 00:53:01.299 align:middle line:84%
And then they can
sell it for only 3/4

00:53:01.299 --> 00:53:02.590 align:middle line:90%
of what they would have to pay.

00:53:02.590 --> 00:53:04.540 align:middle line:84%
So everybody is
saving money on this.

00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to reduce by
90% the global greenhouse gas

00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:10.840 align:middle line:84%
emissions within 10
years in California.

00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:11.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Love it.

00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:12.510 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:53:12.510 --> 00:53:13.990 align:middle line:84%
We had to get that in
before the end of the show.

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:16.573 align:middle line:84%
Because we were going to spend
a lot of time talking about it,

00:53:16.573 --> 00:53:17.422 align:middle line:90%
but there you go.

00:53:17.422 --> 00:53:19.880 align:middle line:84%
The other thing I would like
to talk to you down the road--

00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:22.300 align:middle line:84%
and we can talk about
this more at length--

00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:25.600 align:middle line:84%
about the energy industry and
globally as well, but also

00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:26.585 align:middle line:90%
water rights.

00:53:26.585 --> 00:53:30.775 align:middle line:84%
This is becoming-- this will
become the next major fight

00:53:30.775 --> 00:53:31.575 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:53:31.575 --> 00:53:32.491 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Absolutely.

00:53:32.491 --> 00:53:34.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we need to see
what our rights are, what

00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:38.795 align:middle line:84%
we can do to help assist,
and keeping water out

00:53:38.795 --> 00:53:39.595 align:middle line:90%
of private hands.

00:53:39.595 --> 00:53:40.761 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Absolutely right.

00:53:40.761 --> 00:53:42.790 align:middle line:10%
And what they can do is
people can contact us

00:53:42.790 --> 00:53:46.600 align:middle line:10%
at RomeroInstitute.org
And they can find there

00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:48.640 align:middle line:10%
on our website Green Power.

00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:49.490 align:middle line:10%
That's that one.

00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And then they can
find Lakota Law.

00:53:51.070 --> 00:53:53.537 align:middle line:84%
And they'll talk about both of
these projects that we have.

00:53:53.537 --> 00:53:54.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very good.

00:53:54.370 --> 00:53:55.412 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Danny.

00:53:55.412 --> 00:53:57.911 align:middle line:84%
Next time you come back, we'll
talk about those other issues

00:53:57.911 --> 00:53:58.960 align:middle line:90%
we just brought up.
