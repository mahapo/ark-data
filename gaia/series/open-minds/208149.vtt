>>MAUREEN HANCOCK:
As a young child,

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.730 align:middle line:84%
I realized that I was
seeing dead people.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.070 align:middle line:84%
I started to see people
walking all around my room.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.340 align:middle line:90%
It was very scary.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.770 align:middle line:84%
I thought they
were living people.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And I remember asking
one of my sisters, who

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.970 align:middle line:90%
are all these people?

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.230 align:middle line:90%
And she was like, be quiet.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.188 align:middle line:84%
They're going to take
you back to the hospital.

00:00:26.188 --> 00:00:27.990 align:middle line:90%
And I don't put it out there.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm like a light-hearted
comedian medium,

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.990 align:middle line:84%
and I like to create
a celebration of life.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.860 align:middle line:84%
But if I can help
people find closure,

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.820 align:middle line:90%
then I will use that ability.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.590 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of people that have
medium and psychic addiction.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And they really, really
rely on this other person

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.398 align:middle line:90%
to shape their life.

00:00:48.398 --> 00:00:50.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: When in
fact, you have to create it.

>>HANCOCK: I worked
on a case recently

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.830 align:middle line:84%
where they found
the teenager alive.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:56.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:57.170 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: And I
did remote viewing.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:59.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: And I saw her in
a triple decker in Boston.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.320 align:middle line:84%
I described it to the FBI,
and they found her alive.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And she was about
to be trafficked

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:08.870 align:middle line:90%
and sent out of the country.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:09.703 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my god.

00:01:09.703 --> 00:01:13.340 align:middle line:90%


00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.770 align:middle line:10%
In the 1980s as a
young news anchor,

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.510 align:middle line:10%
I convinced my news
director to let

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.910 align:middle line:10%
me cover psychic
phenomena that I thought

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.230 align:middle line:10%
the news audience would like.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.950 align:middle line:84%
In this case, I was looking
at psychics to solve crimes.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Everybody loved it,
as we still do today.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And Maureen Hancock
is from a lineage

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.660 align:middle line:84%
of Irish intuitive women who
uses her skills to do just

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.020 align:middle line:84%
that, to work with police,
hospice care, grieving parents,

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.070 align:middle line:90%
and much more.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.880 align:middle line:84%
So I can't wait to
hear your story.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.020 align:middle line:90%
I love this.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And at the time
in the '80s, that

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.630 align:middle line:84%
was a very big deal to put
psychic phenomena on the news.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:45.890 align:middle line:90%
Nobody did it.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.120 align:middle line:90%
But it proved something.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.420 align:middle line:90%
People love it.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.730 align:middle line:90%
They've always been interested.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.750 align:middle line:84%
But the news industries try to
keep anything phenomenal away

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:54.715 align:middle line:90%
from us, don't they?

00:01:54.715 --> 00:01:54.990 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.315 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Oh, yes, they do.

00:01:56.315 --> 00:01:57.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Welcome, Maureen.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Oh, it's
so great to be here.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I want to
find out a little bit more

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.480 align:middle line:84%
about you first before
we go any further.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.240 align:middle line:84%
It's such an interesting
story behind people

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.790 align:middle line:84%
who, well, chat
with the departed

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.340 align:middle line:84%
and are able to see
into other dimensions.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.960 align:middle line:90%
And we mentioned this up front.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.130 align:middle line:84%
You come from a long line of
an intuitive Irish lineage

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.010 align:middle line:90%
of women.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yes.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:18.610 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.130 align:middle line:10%
And my grandmother had the
ability, the gift, her sisters,

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.810 align:middle line:10%
and it's been handed down.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.490 align:middle line:90%
Even my mom did.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about that a little bit.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.990 align:middle line:84%
When I was reading the book,
the one that intrigued me

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.080 align:middle line:90%
was your grandma Annie.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.620 align:middle line:90%
Anne or Annie?

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.420 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.590 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Great aunt, yeah.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.840 align:middle line:10%
So my grandmother Margaret--

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.520 align:middle line:10%
Maggie-- her sister Annie was
a well-known Irish mystic.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.600 align:middle line:84%
So she had hundreds
of people camped out

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.790 align:middle line:84%
for healings and
readings outside

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.167 align:middle line:90%
of her thatched cottage.

00:02:51.167 --> 00:02:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now when
would this have been?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.030 align:middle line:90%
Put a date to it.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: So this
would probably

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.000 align:middle line:90%
be in the '40s and '50s.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.820 align:middle line:90%
And she had to move to Scotland.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.980 align:middle line:84%
One of the local
priests told her.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't so much like
you need to get out of town.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.320 align:middle line:84%
It was more, you
can't keep doing this.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.190 align:middle line:90%
This is killing you.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And it was a lot,
because people were

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.938 align:middle line:84%
desperate to hear
something, to get healing.

00:03:15.938 --> 00:03:18.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it wasn't that
the priest was saying, this

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.950 align:middle line:90%
is witchcraft, get out of here.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.620 align:middle line:84%
He was saying-- he was really
looking to protect her more?

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:23.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yes.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.337 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:26.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: And she had three
brothers who were priests,

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.610 align:middle line:84%
so this was one of the local
priests that her brothers knew.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So mediumship
is in your DNA.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.650 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about you and
how it started showing up

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.340 align:middle line:84%
in your life and what your great
aunt, your grandma, your mom--

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.330 align:middle line:84%
it's like, oh, here
comes another one.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.610 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what that
was like in your life.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: So as
a young child, I

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.610 align:middle line:84%
realized that I was
seeing dead people

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.290 align:middle line:90%
after a bout with an illness.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.280 align:middle line:84%
So I started to see people
walking all around my room.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.930 align:middle line:90%
It was very scary.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.490 align:middle line:84%
I thought they
were living people.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And I remember asking
one of my sisters, who

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.690 align:middle line:90%
are all these people?

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:03.950 align:middle line:90%
And she was like, be quiet.

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.080 align:middle line:84%
They're going to take
you back to the hospital.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And I just pulled up the
covers, like many kids

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.120 align:middle line:90%
that have abilities do.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed I always had
intuition like everybody.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.290 align:middle line:90%
And I was in a car accident.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.894 align:middle line:90%
So that is what catapulted me--

00:04:18.894 --> 00:04:21.019 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk about the
car accident for a minute.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.490 align:middle line:84%
You just kind of
scooted right over that.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: I did.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:23.590 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:29.580 align:middle line:84%
So I fell asleep at the wheel
on a stormy March night in 1992.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.070 align:middle line:90%
And I was the designated driver.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.870 align:middle line:84%
I had just dropped
all my friends off.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.610 align:middle line:84%
We were at a
nightclub in Boston.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.880 align:middle line:90%
And I got tired.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.880 align:middle line:84%
I was just-- it
was rainy and cold,

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.500 align:middle line:84%
and my eyes dropped,
and I hit a tree.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.630 align:middle line:84%
I had just taken the seatbelt
off, because it was a new car.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.190 align:middle line:84%
It was digging into my neck,
and I was right near my house.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And I felt my grandmother with
me, the same grandmother who

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.280 align:middle line:84%
had the intuitive
abilities, read tea leaves,

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.490 align:middle line:84%
and her sister was
the well-known mystic.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And she just said, oh, Maureen,
and went through my body.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And I was standing outside of a
completely crushed vehicle when

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.880 align:middle line:90%
the fire rescue team came.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And the woman who called 911
said that somebody shook her

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.820 align:middle line:84%
out of a sound sleep and said,
go downstairs to the kitchen

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:16.920 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And there I was, night
of the living dead.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:20.450 align:middle line:90%
Like, I was a mess.

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:21.908 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were
a little zombie.

00:05:21.908 --> 00:05:22.890 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: And so they
brought me to a local hospital

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.380 align:middle line:84%
where they realized every
bone in my face was broken.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.700 align:middle line:84%
I had to be rushed to Mass
General, Mass Eye and Ear

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.020 align:middle line:90%
in Boston.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And the second CAT scan after
the first one at the local

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.510 align:middle line:90%
was completely different.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.020 align:middle line:84%
Everything was healed when
they went to do surgery.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going to say,
you show no marks of that now.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.645 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: And I didn't
have to have anything done.

00:05:46.645 --> 00:05:48.640 align:middle line:90%
So it was a true miracle.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're talking fractured
skull, my eyes, cheeks, nose,

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:53.520 align:middle line:90%
jaw.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.600 align:middle line:84%
I had spinal fluid coming
out and stitches right down

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.620 align:middle line:90%
the middle of my face.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:59.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my God.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.300 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Mm.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.725 align:middle line:84%
And so after that I started
to hear dead people.

00:06:05.725 --> 00:06:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There was something
else that happened, though.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.370 align:middle line:90%
I have it written down here.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.410 align:middle line:84%
You as a little kid
went into a coma

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:16.730 align:middle line:84%
after munching on lots of lead
paint, because it was sweet.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And as I recall,
you ate enough lead

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.000 align:middle line:90%
paint to kill five grown men.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.800 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yes.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about
what happened in there too.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: So I was 18 months
old and probably teething.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:33.650 align:middle line:84%
I remember-- barely-- watching
my siblings play outside.

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:34.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm one of nine.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And I would chew on
the window sills,

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.330 align:middle line:90%
and I remember it was sweet.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's called pica,
when you get addicted

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.850 align:middle line:90%
to some type of substance.

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:44.990 align:middle line:90%
And it was the sweetness--

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Chalk, paint,
any of those things.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:47.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: And I
slipped into a coma.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And I spent three years in
and out of Children's Hospital

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:54.530 align:middle line:90%
in Boston.

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.080 align:middle line:84%
A year straight,
I was in a coma.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And when I came home
from the hospital,

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.750 align:middle line:84%
finally at five
years old, I used

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:05.250 align:middle line:84%
to see the sacred
heart of Jesus picture

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:08.120 align:middle line:84%
in every good Catholic
home speaking to me.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.710 align:middle line:90%
His lips were moving.

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And I said to my mother, my
little 4-foot-10" Irish mother,

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.150 align:middle line:84%
the guy is talking to me.
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) What's he

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:18.278 align:middle line:90%
saying?

00:07:18.278 --> 00:07:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And every day she
would take me down.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.120 align:middle line:90%
Is the man speaking to you?

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:21.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: And I
remember I said,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Grammy's going to have a
heart attack on Wednesday.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.810 align:middle line:84%
My mother's mother
lived with us.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:31.910 align:middle line:90%
And Wednesday came.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.590 align:middle line:84%
9:00 AM in the morning,
she had a heart attack.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:36.710 align:middle line:84%
My mother knew what
to do because we

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:38.590 align:middle line:90%
got the warning from Jesus H.

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:39.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:43.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: And I shut it off,
because after that my room was

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:49.620 align:middle line:84%
filled with what looked like
ancient people and pilgrims,

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.410 align:middle line:84%
and they would surround
my bed and stare at me.

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And I would just pull up
the covers like, go away.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.790 align:middle line:84%
As a child, I didn't know
what to do with all of that.

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And then as a teen, it
started to come back.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.410 align:middle line:84%
And then you start making
predictions, which sometimes

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:07.500 align:middle line:84%
does not endear you to the
family and the population,

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.300 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes it does.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.097 align:middle line:84%
So can you talk about
that a little bit?

00:08:11.097 --> 00:08:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes people don't
want to hear who's going to die

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.580 align:middle line:84%
and whose husband's going to run
out on them or whatnot, right?

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.180 align:middle line:90%
We don't always want a heads up.

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:19.980 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:20.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.118 align:middle line:90%
I start-- you're right.

00:08:21.118 --> 00:08:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And I started to get
psychic information, right?

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And just tapping into the
book of life for people.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And I went to school
for shiatsu massage

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:37.679 align:middle line:84%
while I was working at Logan
Airport in the litigation

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:38.970 align:middle line:90%
department.

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And I would lay my hands on
people and get information.

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:46.020 align:middle line:84%
Past, present,
future, and deceased.

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And it was always when
I touched their feet.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm Billy, her father.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I
was losing my mind.

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.220 align:middle line:90%
It was all the time.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
getting information

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.040 align:middle line:90%
from my grandmother for myself.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And I was at a birthday
party and I heard,

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:05.980 align:middle line:90%
go home to your apartment now.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And it was that nudge that
you feel with intuition

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:10.050 align:middle line:90%
that wouldn't leave me alone.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And so I went home and found
my fiancé fooling around with

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.760 align:middle line:84%
another woman
before our wedding.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.890 align:middle line:84%
So those intuitive
nudges, right?

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And then I started to get
information for people

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.950 align:middle line:84%
around me, like getting
feelings about people dying.

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And when I would watch the
news, if somebody was missing,

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.580 align:middle line:84%
I started to get hit when
I would see their picture.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:34.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's how I started
trying to introduce it

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:38.490 align:middle line:90%
to media back then.

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:42.930 align:middle line:84%
I think it was 1985, '86, I
started bringing those stories

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:44.340 align:middle line:90%
in as a news anchor.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.920 align:middle line:84%
Which as I said earlier, was not
a popular thing to do at all.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.510 align:middle line:84%
But it was really through
that more functional element

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:55.300 align:middle line:84%
of how they're helping
solve crimes and cold cases

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.680 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, because it seems
that people can embrace that

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.195 align:middle line:84%
a little more easily than
a lot of the rest of it.

00:10:01.195 --> 00:10:02.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Oh, right.

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:03.480 align:middle line:90%
They are just enthralled.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.960 align:middle line:84%
So when I do work
with FBI or police,

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.740 align:middle line:84%
I get calls from detectives
all over the country.

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:14.410 align:middle line:84%
They'll ask me-- they'll
start with, I'm a skeptic.

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:16.230 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe.

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:19.050 align:middle line:84%
However, if you can
help us get closer

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:22.140 align:middle line:84%
or if you can help us
bring this family closure,

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:23.170 align:middle line:90%
can you help us?

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And I can't say no, and
it's all volunteer work.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.670 align:middle line:90%
But it takes a lot out of me.

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:32.040 align:middle line:84%
So when I do a missing person
case or a cold case, a murder,

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.670 align:middle line:84%
I am in bed for
three days after.

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it because of the
density of what's happened,

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.970 align:middle line:84%
because of maybe the darkness
around the crimes that

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:42.900 align:middle line:90%
occurred around it?

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:46.792 align:middle line:84%
Or just to have to burrow into
another world to that extent?

00:10:46.792 --> 00:10:49.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah, it's
definitely a little bit of both

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.430 align:middle line:90%
because it's so heavy.

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:54.840 align:middle line:84%
But the tools I have to use are
different than my usual tuning

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.710 align:middle line:84%
into the departed or using that
lightness to get a connection.

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:00.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk about
those tools you

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:03.160 align:middle line:84%
have to use that are a little
different going into that work.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: So first, I'll look
at a photo of the person that's

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.580 align:middle line:84%
either missing,
possibly deceased,

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.200 align:middle line:90%
and I look in their eyes.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's the window to
the soul, as you know.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.400 align:middle line:90%
And I go deep.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.590 align:middle line:90%
And I do some remote viewing.

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:18.060 align:middle line:90%
So I go to--

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.850 align:middle line:84%
I ask, where were
they last seen?

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:24.180 align:middle line:84%
Then I bring myself
to that area.

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:25.620 align:middle line:90%
I'll look on a map.

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:27.120 align:middle line:90%
I'll use Google Earth.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.590 align:middle line:90%
I'll go there.

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:30.000 align:middle line:90%
And then I'll do remote viewing.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And I can look down
at what's happening,

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:34.110 align:middle line:84%
what transpired,
where did they go?

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:35.280 align:middle line:90%
When did they disappear?

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.510 align:middle line:90%
At what point?

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:38.880 align:middle line:90%
And then I become the victim.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.698 align:middle line:84%
So I take my energy and
I'm looking out from it--

00:11:42.698 --> 00:11:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that
becoming the victim thing

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:46.660 align:middle line:90%
has to be part of that drain.

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:47.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yes.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:48.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:49.380 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yes.

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:50.920 align:middle line:90%
Because it takes so much energy.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:54.180 align:middle line:84%
I raise my vibration
and then it comes down.

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And I don't feel it
physically, but I definitely

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.960 align:middle line:90%
can see what's going on.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And I worked on a
case recently where

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:08.100 align:middle line:90%
they found the teenager alive.

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:09.700 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: And I
did remote viewing.

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And I saw her in a
triple decker in Boston.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.790 align:middle line:90%
And I could see the street.

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:18.440 align:middle line:90%
I could see the whole area.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:21.740 align:middle line:84%
I described it to the
FBI and her mother.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And I said, she's
on the third floor

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:27.110 align:middle line:90%
in the back room, XYZ address.

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:29.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't usually
get that specific,

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:32.900 align:middle line:84%
but she was alive, so the
energy was really rocking.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And she talked to her
detectives and they said,

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.330 align:middle line:84%
we've already checked
that house and we've

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:39.930 align:middle line:90%
cleared it completely.

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:41.090 align:middle line:90%
And I was adamant.

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:43.400 align:middle line:90%
I said, you need to go back.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.020 align:middle line:90%
She's in the back room.

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:46.730 align:middle line:90%
I gave a name.

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:48.920 align:middle line:90%
They're like, we spoke with him.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:49.910 align:middle line:90%
He's cleared.

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:51.410 align:middle line:90%
I said, no, he's not.

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:52.830 align:middle line:90%
You need to go back.

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:56.690 align:middle line:84%
So we have a car outside
of that house right now.

00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:58.830 align:middle line:90%
We're going to send them in.

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:00.350 align:middle line:84%
I have chills just
talking about it.

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:02.270 align:middle line:90%
And they found her alive.

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And she was about
to be trafficked

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:06.410 align:middle line:84%
and sent out of the
country within an hour.

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:07.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my god.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:08.050 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Right.

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:09.860 align:middle line:90%
So using those tools--

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How about fine timing?

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.110 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Right.

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:14.010 align:middle line:90%
And I don't put it out there.

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:16.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm like the light-hearted
comedian medium.

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:18.980 align:middle line:84%
I like to create a
celebration of life.

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:22.880 align:middle line:84%
But if I can help
people find closure,

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:26.670 align:middle line:84%
then I will use that
ability, just sparingly.

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:28.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, understandably.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you for
sharing that story.

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:31.460 align:middle line:90%
That's intense.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's beautiful
in the timing of it,

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.970 align:middle line:90%
that you helped save that girl.

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:38.660 align:middle line:84%
So let me talk about
something else with you then.

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:41.990 align:middle line:84%
Again, years ago I did another
story with Russell Targ.

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:44.150 align:middle line:84%
He ran the remote viewing
and taught remote viewing

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:46.730 align:middle line:90%
to the spies for the CIA, OK?

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And so he was doing
experiments with the Soviet

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:52.610 align:middle line:84%
Union at the time, and there's
a very famous experiment.

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:55.190 align:middle line:84%
It's probably--
some people might--

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:56.195 align:middle line:90%
maybe not.

00:13:56.195 --> 00:13:58.080 align:middle line:90%
Maybe the video's gone.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:02.480 align:middle line:84%
But what they did was they
had the psychic view a site.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.520 align:middle line:84%
She was in Moscow,
and they had her view

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.070 align:middle line:90%
a site in San Francisco.

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:07.820 align:middle line:84%
She didn't know where
it was in the world.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And very specific,
so it had iconography

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:11.990 align:middle line:90%
you could easily draw.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:14.480 align:middle line:84%
Bottom line, the
kicker here was what

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.510 align:middle line:84%
was revealed when I interviewed
him back in the '80s

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:22.400 align:middle line:84%
was that they had her view
before the site had been chosen

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:25.940 align:middle line:90%
by a random generator.

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And he was saying, when we
have them view into the future,

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:32.150 align:middle line:84%
it seems there's
less interference.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:35.330 align:middle line:84%
The field is cleaner because
you're not in the static of now

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:37.610 align:middle line:84%
and what's already
occurred, which

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:39.060 align:middle line:90%
I found kind of interesting.

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.450 align:middle line:84%
So on that note,
what do you find

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:44.150 align:middle line:84%
if you try to project
into the future

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:46.820 align:middle line:90%
or look a bit into the future?

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:50.055 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: As far as being
able to read psychically?

00:14:50.055 --> 00:14:50.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:52.200 align:middle line:90%
What is it like for you?

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.613 align:middle line:84%
Is it a different experience
than reading the past?

00:14:55.613 --> 00:14:56.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: It sure is.

00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:57.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about it.

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: I love
that you just brought

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.280 align:middle line:84%
that up, because that
gets me thinking,

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.820 align:middle line:84%
wow, it is clear when
I look in the future,

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:07.540 align:middle line:84%
because there's possibilities,
and we have free will,

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.760 align:middle line:84%
and we can change
things with that.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.280 align:middle line:90%
And it's a clean slate.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:15.490 align:middle line:84%
But when I look in the back,
it's kind of mucky, you know?

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:18.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's like some
people going through mud,

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:22.150 align:middle line:84%
and it's a lower vibration
energetically for sure,

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:24.860 align:middle line:84%
where the future
has possibilities.

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And so many, especially
grieving parents will say to me,

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:30.310 align:middle line:90%
what is my purpose?

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:31.480 align:middle line:90%
Can you look in the future?

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Like, what do you see me doing
now that my child's passed

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:37.340 align:middle line:90%
or my husband, wife, whatever?

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times I give
them that responsibility.

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:44.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, what
do you want to do?

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:45.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.060 align:middle line:90%
That's the question.

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:46.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.355 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: And creating
this new possibility.

00:15:48.355 --> 00:15:52.390 align:middle line:84%
But I'll give them tips on
creating a better future

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:55.630 align:middle line:84%
and raising their consciousness
in many different ways

00:15:55.630 --> 00:16:00.190 align:middle line:84%
with meditation or creating the
space where they can connect

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:02.470 align:middle line:84%
in a non-physical way
to their loved one

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:06.040 align:middle line:84%
and create a strong
connection, even

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.890 align:middle line:84%
though their physical
body is gone.

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:10.855 align:middle line:84%
So I'm looking
forward to researching

00:16:10.855 --> 00:16:15.485 align:middle line:84%
that, more about that
lighter fare future energy.

00:16:15.485 --> 00:16:16.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.160 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'm glad I
brought it up then

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:21.918 align:middle line:84%
so we could have that
discussion, because one

00:16:21.918 --> 00:16:23.710 align:middle line:84%
of the things that
happens when you project

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:25.450 align:middle line:84%
into the future--
you just said it--

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:27.850 align:middle line:90%
that's a field of possibilities.

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:30.640 align:middle line:84%
And people become upset
if something is said

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.520 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't happen
the way someone was told.

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:38.080 align:middle line:84%
Predictive work is always
dicey, because you're just

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.030 align:middle line:84%
looking at fields
of possibilities,

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:42.670 align:middle line:84%
and which has more density
versus less density?

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:44.890 align:middle line:90%
More attraction or repulsion.

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:48.070 align:middle line:84%
So how do you deal with
that and reconcile it?

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:51.097 align:middle line:84%
Because so many people want
psychic advice for the future.

00:16:51.097 --> 00:16:52.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Right, they do.

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:57.020 align:middle line:84%
So what I say is, OK, this is
what it looks like right now.

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And like yin and yang,
it can change daily

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:02.860 align:middle line:90%
based on your actions.

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:06.640 align:middle line:84%
Even your diet, your
exercise, drinking.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.050 align:middle line:84%
Intuition and
nutrition I talk about.

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:11.829 align:middle line:84%
So I'll say, here's
how it looks now.

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:16.010 align:middle line:84%
I feel like this is going to
happen the end of December,

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:18.280 align:middle line:90%
and I see a new man coming in.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't often do sort
of the life stuff.

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:23.050 align:middle line:84%
But the deceased
and their guides

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:25.720 align:middle line:84%
like to tell them some
future possibilities

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.579 align:middle line:90%
to give them hope.

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And I say to them,
this could change.

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:30.970 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:31.330 align:middle line:90%
How?

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:32.650 align:middle line:90%
You just said you saw it.

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:35.710 align:middle line:84%
I say, because we have
free will, and every day

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:38.450 align:middle line:84%
everything's changing,
so it's not perfect.

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:40.390 align:middle line:84%
And I have a lot
of people that have

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:42.550 align:middle line:90%
medium and psychic addiction.

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And they really, really
rely on this other person

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:48.460 align:middle line:90%
to shape their life.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:50.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When in fact,
you have to create it.

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And what you say is
absolutely right.

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:56.470 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
moving parts, especially

00:17:56.470 --> 00:18:00.160 align:middle line:84%
if it involves the free will and
choice of another human being

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.770 align:middle line:84%
or a group of human
beings into the future

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:05.290 align:middle line:84%
for a future project,
love, whatever it is.

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:07.220 align:middle line:90%
Way too many moving parts.

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:09.100 align:middle line:84%
One thing inserts
itself to that person

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:11.140 align:middle line:84%
who was supposed to
show up in December,

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:12.400 align:middle line:90%
and they don't show up.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.450 align:middle line:90%
They get derailed.

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:14.290 align:middle line:90%
Their grandma dies.

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:15.010 align:middle line:90%
They have to leave.

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:16.750 align:middle line:84%
You never meet them
when you're supposed to.

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:18.417 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I think
it's so dangerous

00:18:18.417 --> 00:18:22.180 align:middle line:84%
to be addicted to psychic
prediction for people.

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:26.170 align:middle line:84%
It's good to have guidance,
but not hard and fast

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:27.290 align:middle line:90%
predictions to live by.

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:28.090 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Right.

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And I often will
say to folks too,

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:33.640 align:middle line:84%
when you're going
for these readings,

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.950 align:middle line:84%
how does it feel
to you in your gut?

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Because you hold
the measurement,

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:39.940 align:middle line:84%
and you hold the tools
to how that feels.

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:41.620 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yes, I went to
somebody and they

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:44.590 align:middle line:84%
told me XYZ was going
to happen, and that

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:48.070 align:middle line:84%
didn't feel right to me,
because that's not even a place

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:49.540 align:middle line:90%
I would ever go to.

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:51.110 align:middle line:90%
Well, then you have the answers.

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:55.700 align:middle line:84%
So don't we all hold the
answer within in our souls?

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:56.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.870 align:middle line:84%
Nonetheless, so I wanted
to get to the part too--

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:02.222 align:middle line:84%
we kind of skipped over it-- you
were a paralegal at one point?

00:19:02.222 --> 00:19:03.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: I was a paralegal.

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:05.263 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you were
starting to see stuff

00:19:05.263 --> 00:19:06.610 align:middle line:90%
when they're working on cases.

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:07.840 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that for a minute.

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:08.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yes.

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:13.370 align:middle line:84%
So I was a paralegal in Boston
at a few different law firms,

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:15.670 align:middle line:84%
and then I ended up
as litigation manager

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:17.110 align:middle line:90%
at Logan Airport.

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:21.580 align:middle line:84%
So when I would work
at one firm and I

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:23.320 align:middle line:84%
would be asked to
look through files,

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:26.688 align:middle line:90%
I started to get hits on--

00:19:26.688 --> 00:19:28.730 align:middle line:84%
let's say they were
investigating a workers' comp

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:29.530 align:middle line:90%
claim.

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:31.280 align:middle line:84%
This was one case
that comes to mind.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And I saw this dude working
at a construction site

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:37.280 align:middle line:90%
in South Boston.

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.020 align:middle line:90%
And I had visions.

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:44.400 align:middle line:84%
So they would just come in, just
like a cognitive in my mind's

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.200 align:middle line:90%
eye.

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you
know, Billy Smith

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:50.270 align:middle line:84%
is working at a
construction site

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:53.240 align:middle line:84%
on Constitution
Avenue in Southie.

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.688 align:middle line:84%
Can you send the detective
over there, private detective?

00:19:55.688 --> 00:19:57.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because he's trying
to claim benefits, right?

00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:58.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Mm-hmm.

00:19:58.220 --> 00:19:59.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:00.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: And they
found him working.

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:02.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:04.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: But nobody
ever asked me, like,

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:05.855 align:middle line:90%
how did you know that?

00:20:05.855 --> 00:20:06.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, that's weird.

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:08.202 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:20:08.202 --> 00:20:10.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: All the lawyers
on the floor started

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.660 align:middle line:90%
giving me cases to review.

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:12.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
you could crack them.

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:13.540 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Mm-hmm.

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:15.260 align:middle line:90%
But they didn't know how.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And then coincidence
would happen.

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:20.630 align:middle line:90%
I was eating at a restaurant.

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:21.890 align:middle line:90%
It was in '99.

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And I was working
on this big case.

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And the person in
question was behind me.

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
hear him talking

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:36.170 align:middle line:84%
about how he's faking
his back injury

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:40.230 align:middle line:84%
and working out at Gold's
Gym, et cetera, et cetera.

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:41.240 align:middle line:90%
So I went back.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.520 align:middle line:90%
And now, what put me there?

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:47.540 align:middle line:84%
We weren't even anywhere near
where the case was happening,

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:50.600 align:middle line:84%
and it was just this
obscure restaurant

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.060 align:middle line:90%
in Eastern Massachusetts.

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, I
said, go to Gold's Gym

00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:00.200 align:middle line:84%
and get all the records,
because people have to sign in.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they
broke that case.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.045 align:middle line:90%
So that was kind of fun.

00:21:03.045 --> 00:21:04.295 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You are very useful.

00:21:04.295 --> 00:21:05.435 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:21:05.435 --> 00:21:06.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah, right?

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:07.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:08.900 align:middle line:90%
So now you become--

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:09.830 align:middle line:90%
you're mature.

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:11.720 align:middle line:84%
You're in your adult
years and everything.

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And you ended up having
a child, which you

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:16.580 align:middle line:90%
say was kind of a miracle baby.

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:17.660 align:middle line:90%
Your son, right?

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:18.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yes.

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:22.710 align:middle line:84%
So the lead paint
poison typically

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:26.670 align:middle line:84%
makes women infertile
because the lead paint goes

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:30.060 align:middle line:84%
to the lining of the
uterus, and I was

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:31.990 align:middle line:90%
told I couldn't have children.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.770 align:middle line:90%
And I just accepted that.

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:34.570 align:middle line:90%
Like, oh, yeah.

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:36.690 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
be able to have kids.

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:40.560 align:middle line:84%
So I was on vacation
in Mexico in Tulum,

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:44.130 align:middle line:84%
and it was a 100-degree
day, and so I went--

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:48.540 align:middle line:84%
Irish, freckles-- I went into
the shade in a little cave.

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:53.490 align:middle line:84%
And I sat down on this little
sort of rock pole-type thing.

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And the folks that worked
there and the Mayans,

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:02.520 align:middle line:84%
Indigenous people, they
were giggling walking by.

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And I finally said, why are
they laughing to my guide.

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:08.440 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you're on the
fertility stone.

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.410 align:middle line:90%
I was like, mff.

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:12.780 align:middle line:90%
That's not going to help me.

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:14.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wasted on me.

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:15.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: I was pregnant.

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And so you were working on
him in utero too, right?

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.130 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: And then in utero--

00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:27.060 align:middle line:84%
in utero my grandfather,
whom I've never met,

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.190 align:middle line:90%
showed up on my ultrasound.

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:30.930 align:middle line:90%
I still have the pictures.

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:32.040 align:middle line:90%
So there's my--

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.623 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What do
you mean, showed up?

00:22:33.623 --> 00:22:37.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Oh, oh, we have
pictures of my grandfather,

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:38.340 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:44.040 align:middle line:84%
So James McGonagle showed up
in my pictures of the sonogram.

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:46.470 align:middle line:84%
So the sonogram they
were checking out

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:50.550 align:middle line:84%
because my son had
tumors on his eyes,

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:52.710 align:middle line:84%
and so I had to have
multiple sonograms.

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:56.510 align:middle line:84%
But the first one,
there's a smiley face

00:22:56.510 --> 00:23:00.320 align:middle line:90%
and then there's a man's face.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:01.340 align:middle line:90%
It's my grandfather.

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:03.320 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there's no denying.

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.180 align:middle line:90%
I've even posted it before.

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And angel wings
on the other side.

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:11.990 align:middle line:84%
And so I would pray
and I would do healing.

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:13.970 align:middle line:84%
So I do a lot of
hands-on healing

00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:17.900 align:middle line:84%
and I did some medical
qigong, and I was really just

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:20.300 align:middle line:90%
constantly working and praying.

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:22.190 align:middle line:90%
You know, please, please.

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:25.050 align:middle line:84%
He was going to come
out and be blind.

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:27.930 align:middle line:84%
We had a team of doctors at
Brigham and Women's Hospital

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:31.240 align:middle line:84%
in Boston surrounding
me on birth,

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:34.960 align:middle line:84%
which, by the way, giving
birth, I almost died.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:35.850 align:middle line:90%
I had a near-death.

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:39.090 align:middle line:90%
So they lost me.

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:41.490 align:middle line:90%
They lost Tyler.

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:42.990 align:middle line:84%
His heart rate went
down to nothing.

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:43.990 align:middle line:90%
I looked over at the--

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:47.260 align:middle line:90%
I said, am I going to die?

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:48.060 align:middle line:90%
Am I dying?

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:49.382 align:middle line:90%
And she wouldn't answer me.

00:23:49.382 --> 00:23:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at the
blood pressure thing,

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:53.250 align:middle line:90%
and it was crazy.

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:55.290 align:middle line:90%
Like, 43 over 20.

00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:58.210 align:middle line:84%
I was going, and I could feel
it, and there was no heartbeat.

00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:01.050 align:middle line:90%
And they just went crazy.

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And I came to, and I'm
praying to my grandmother.

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And then Tyler was born,
and he had the tumors

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:11.970 align:middle line:90%
on his eyes hours before.

00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:13.620 align:middle line:90%
No tumors.

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:14.850 align:middle line:90%
They had the specialists.

00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:18.000 align:middle line:90%
They whisked him away.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And then I had some
more complications.

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And I had 200 stitches from
an emergency situation.

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:27.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:27.750 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:28.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: 200 stitches.

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:29.560 align:middle line:90%
No cesarean.

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.525 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, no cesarean.

00:24:30.525 --> 00:24:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Mm-mm.

00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:31.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:33.203 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: So this
was a vacuum birth.

00:24:33.203 --> 00:24:35.130 align:middle line:90%
And I never felt any pain.

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:36.270 align:middle line:90%
I had no swelling.

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:41.805 align:middle line:10%
I was doing all my tai
chi and qigong in the bed.

00:24:41.805 --> 00:24:43.200 align:middle line:90%
And I was OK.

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.043 align:middle line:84%
And it was really
another miracle.

00:24:45.043 --> 00:24:46.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how old
is your son today?

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:48.300 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: He's 22.

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:49.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Congratulations.

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:50.210 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah.

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And he-- I have two sons, and
the birth of my second son was

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:57.380 align:middle line:84%
a little dicey as well
where I had another--

00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:58.650 align:middle line:90%
I have nine lives.

00:24:58.650 --> 00:24:59.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm a cat.

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:00.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yep.

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:01.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: [LAUGHS] I'm a cat.

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:02.105 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I hear you.

00:25:02.105 --> 00:25:04.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: But my younger
son has abilities.

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:06.390 align:middle line:90%
So he lays his hands on people.

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:07.710 align:middle line:90%
He's very shy.

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:12.480 align:middle line:84%
But my mother, before she
passed, had excruciating pain.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And she'd say, can Drew come
over and do some healing on me?

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:19.740 align:middle line:84%
So he lays his hands on
people and it just, boop!

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:21.210 align:middle line:90%
Goes away.

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And my oldest son, Tyler,
who's really into anthropology

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.865 align:middle line:84%
and the study of people
and nonprofits and he

00:25:27.865 --> 00:25:29.490 align:middle line:84%
wants to make a
difference in the world

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:31.350 align:middle line:90%
is like, you're special.

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:34.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's-- so
again, thank you for sharing.

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:36.670 align:middle line:90%
We're all loving these stories.

00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:39.120 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
what happens now.

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:41.010 align:middle line:90%
So your mom passed away.

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:42.510 align:middle line:90%
We all pass away, right?

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:46.170 align:middle line:84%
So oftentimes what
happens, it seems that when

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:47.700 align:middle line:90%
a mate passes away--

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:50.700 align:middle line:84%
and especially if the people
are still a little bit younger,

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:52.530 align:middle line:84%
you're not at the
end of life yet--

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:56.460 align:middle line:84%
is there seems to be
this situation of guilt

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:59.820 align:middle line:84%
when one wants to
move on, right?

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:03.333 align:middle line:84%
When the mate who's been left
behind is a year's gone by

00:26:03.333 --> 00:26:06.000 align:middle line:84%
and they're lonely and they want
to start again, and they think,

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.950 align:middle line:84%
oh, you know, what would
Mabel think of my doing that?

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:12.960 align:middle line:90%
Am I being disloyal?

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:16.440 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what it's
like from the other side

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.930 align:middle line:84%
after we've left
the body and we've

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:21.240 align:middle line:84%
left a mate behind and
the mate needs to move on.

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.040 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah.

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.900 align:middle line:84%
So I deal a lot with
widows and widowers.

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest
message is, please,

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.520 align:middle line:90%
I want you to live this life.

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.780 align:middle line:84%
Do it for-- if you can't do
it for you, do it for me.

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I'm going
to show you the way,

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:38.040 align:middle line:84%
or I'm going to help you
find the right person.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's not always
the right person.

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:44.790 align:middle line:84%
But the main message is,
please let go of guilt.

00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:45.990 align:middle line:90%
I want you to be happy.

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:47.740 align:middle line:90%
You're still here.

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:48.582 align:middle line:90%
You're still here.

00:26:48.582 --> 00:26:50.790 align:middle line:84%
What are you going to do
with the time you have left?

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And they always say, I'll
be here waiting for you

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:55.500 align:middle line:90%
when you come home.

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:58.500 align:middle line:84%
But for right now, living
the best life that you can--

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:02.920 align:middle line:84%
and they want us to feel love
and joy and experience things.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:06.630 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes the spirit
will say, go on that trip.

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:07.960 align:middle line:90%
Go to Italy.

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:08.760 align:middle line:90%
Go to Greece.

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:09.870 align:middle line:90%
What are you waiting for?

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:12.430 align:middle line:84%
Because it can be
gone in an instant.

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:13.455 align:middle line:90%
So live this life.

00:27:13.455 --> 00:27:14.580 align:middle line:90%
That's the biggest message.

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think sometimes
people think, oh, man.

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:18.810 align:middle line:90%
He or she was--

00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:19.830 align:middle line:90%
they loved me so much.

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:22.110 align:middle line:84%
They were so possessive
in this lifetime.

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:26.580 align:middle line:84%
They think that those traits
that are lower human traits

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:28.860 align:middle line:90%
carry over into the afterlife.

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:29.760 align:middle line:90%
Talk about that.

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:30.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Mm, yeah.

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.280 align:middle line:90%
That's the earthly stuff.

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:33.690 align:middle line:90%
This is Earth school, right?

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:35.680 align:middle line:84%
Where we have to learn
all these lessons.

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:38.265 align:middle line:84%
So they certainly don't
take that with them,

00:27:38.265 --> 00:27:42.330 align:middle line:84%
with a possessive or
making you feel guilty

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:45.270 align:middle line:84%
or you can't do
certain things, where

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:47.020 align:middle line:90%
they're going to be upset.

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:48.000 align:middle line:90%
That's not how it is.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.710 align:middle line:84%
When we come out of
the physical body,

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:52.020 align:middle line:90%
all that luggage is left here.

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, they'll
come through even

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:57.660 align:middle line:84%
changed because they'll say,
jeez, my husband was very angry

00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:01.230 align:middle line:84%
when he left, and we
had a disagreement

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:02.250 align:middle line:90%
or we were arguing.

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:04.140 align:middle line:90%
And I feel so bad and so guilty.

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:07.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, well, that's not how
he's coming through right now.

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:11.160 align:middle line:84%
He's asking you to let
that go and to forgive him

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:16.212 align:middle line:84%
and to forgive yourself, and
to find love and life, really.

00:28:16.212 --> 00:28:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's very
encouraging for people to hear.

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:19.740 align:middle line:90%
That's wonderful.

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:22.050 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about when
you have a mass event,

00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:27.210 align:middle line:84%
because I know for you,
9/11 had a great impact.

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:29.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah, 9/11 was
the turning point for me.

00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:32.220 align:middle line:84%
That's when I actually let
the cat out of the bag.

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And I was litigation
manager at Logan Airport,

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:38.370 align:middle line:84%
and I was just coming
back from maternity leave

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:41.000 align:middle line:90%
with my second son.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And so I was at home
when it happened,

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:47.980 align:middle line:84%
and then I had to go
back two days later.

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:51.580 align:middle line:84%
But I had a dream of
planes hitting a building.

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:54.370 align:middle line:84%
When I have-- I call
them my airplane dreams--

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:55.780 align:middle line:90%
they always come true.

00:28:55.780 --> 00:29:00.370 align:middle line:84%
I dreamt of another airline
being hijacked and told

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:02.570 align:middle line:84%
my friends at the
FBI, and whatnot.

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:04.575 align:middle line:84%
And this one I couldn't
get all the details.

00:29:04.575 --> 00:29:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And people always say, why
didn't you have details?

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:08.560 align:middle line:90%
Why couldn't you warn people?

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, it wasn't
totally clear.

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And then I went
back to Logan, and I

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.880 align:middle line:90%
had armed guards at the door.

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And I started hearing
voices of 9/11.

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And I had in my head
this one gentleman

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:28.150 align:middle line:84%
who wanted to get in touch
with his wife, Jeffrey Coombs.

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And I became friends
with his wife.

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And I started helping
widows of 9/11.

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:38.800 align:middle line:84%
So she would send me all of
her connections of people

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:43.240 align:middle line:84%
that lost their husbands or
wives in 9/11 in those groups.

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:45.280 align:middle line:90%
But it was really intense.

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:47.830 align:middle line:90%
And I left Logan Airport.

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:48.760 align:middle line:90%
I left my job.

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And it was a way for me
to open my healing center.

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And I started a
cancer foundation

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.976 align:middle line:84%
and working with people
with death and dying.

00:29:58.976 --> 00:30:00.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:01.730 align:middle line:90%
It was interesting.

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:04.270 align:middle line:84%
I remember what my
guides were talking

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:06.670 align:middle line:84%
about at that time at
9/11 and how fascinated

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:09.080 align:middle line:84%
they were, watching
what was going on,

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.560 align:middle line:84%
which was interesting, because
I hadn't heard this before.

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And that was they said
it happened so suddenly,

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:17.050 align:middle line:90%
so many at one time.

00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:19.960 align:middle line:84%
He said, they're fascinated,
the deceased are absolutely

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:21.760 align:middle line:90%
fascinated with what happened.

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And then he said, you
can see them still

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:27.610 align:middle line:84%
gathered around the site,
watching the rescue missions,

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:29.530 align:middle line:84%
watching the
unearthing, you know,

00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:31.030 align:middle line:90%
what was left of the buildings.

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And that there was this
kind of mass fascination

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:38.450 align:middle line:84%
among the deceased at
what had just happened.

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:42.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: I can see that,
because they gather together

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.930 align:middle line:84%
and collectively, and
their energy and love,

00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:50.250 align:middle line:84%
trying to help us heal, and
trying to help us even find

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:54.690 align:middle line:84%
one, you know, rescue
worker finding--

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:58.980 align:middle line:84%
I remember this-- the wedding
ring to someone weeks later.

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:01.440 align:middle line:84%
But he said he felt
he was guided there.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.720 align:middle line:84%
So there they were,
all gathered around.

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure when we are ripped
out of our physical body,

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:08.857 align:middle line:84%
there is like, hmm, I'm going
to stick around for a while

00:31:08.857 --> 00:31:10.440 align:middle line:84%
because I want to
make sure you're OK.

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:11.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and they
had a lot of company.

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Many people were ripped at
the same moment, essentially.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: And so they
all joined together

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:20.280 align:middle line:84%
to even help one
another, to help them

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:23.830 align:middle line:84%
not only to cross over,
but to help us left behind.

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:25.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think
that's a really good point

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:29.580 align:middle line:84%
to bring up, because we often
think, oh my god, my grandpa

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:32.820 align:middle line:84%
was alone, and when the plane
crashed we weren't with him,

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:34.090 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:37.870 align:middle line:84%
But as you're saying, no,
they're there with each other.

00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:38.820 align:middle line:90%
There is support.

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:41.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Helping each
other out and probably

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:43.710 align:middle line:84%
even looking at
one another like,

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:46.200 align:middle line:84%
let's help our-- let's go
in and do this together,

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:49.020 align:middle line:84%
because it can be stronger
energetically if we band

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:51.760 align:middle line:90%
together on the other side.

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about
kids when they pass early.

00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:55.230 align:middle line:90%
Gretchen, right?

00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:56.730 align:middle line:90%
Gretchen's daughter Lulu.

00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:59.220 align:middle line:84%
Let's tell the story
about Lulu, because that

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:01.110 align:middle line:90%
continues on a bit.

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:06.180 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: So Lulu was a
four-year-old blonde hair,

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:10.080 align:middle line:84%
big blue eyes, bubbly
personality little girl.

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And she passed down the Cape
in Wellfleet, Massachusetts.

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And she was leaning on a bike
rack, and it fell on her.

00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And it was Father's
Day, I believe.

00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:26.100 align:middle line:84%
And her dad went in
to get ice cream,

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:28.230 align:middle line:84%
and she was with
her two brothers.

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:30.550 align:middle line:90%
And so Lulu passed.

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:32.400 align:middle line:84%
I have chills talking
about it right now.

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And her mom took that
horrific, horrible death

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:40.560 align:middle line:84%
and turned it from
tragedy to triumph

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:45.240 align:middle line:84%
and created this whole series
of "Lulu's Rose Colored

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:48.930 align:middle line:84%
Glasses," the book and
the videos and series.

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And little Lulu had
a message from beyond

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:56.580 align:middle line:84%
for people to see through her
rose-colored glasses that were

00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:57.780 align:middle line:90%
in the backseat of the car.

00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:01.080 align:middle line:84%
I remember Gretchen Pyne,
her mom, telling me.

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:03.480 align:middle line:84%
She would say, Mommy, are
you having a hard day?

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:05.760 align:middle line:84%
Let's put on our
rose-colored glasses

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:09.510 align:middle line:84%
to see the world through
rose-colored glasses.

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:11.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And didn't
you say that she still

00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:14.940 align:middle line:84%
shows up and helps
you even to this day?

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Yes, I work
with young children

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:18.730 align:middle line:90%
who are passing with cancer.

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:23.580 align:middle line:84%
So I get hundreds of messages
of for adults passing, children.

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And I always say
passing, because they're

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:28.110 align:middle line:84%
passing from this
realm to the next,

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:31.080 align:middle line:84%
and it's the
physical death only.

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:32.010 align:middle line:90%
And she'll help me.

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:33.180 align:middle line:90%
So I have this team.

00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:36.630 align:middle line:84%
I have a young
teenager, Nick O'Neill,

00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:39.720 align:middle line:84%
who passed in the Rhode
Island nightclub fire

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.600 align:middle line:84%
if you remember that
from years back.

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:43.710 align:middle line:90%
He helps me.

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:47.220 align:middle line:84%
I have Jennifer Fay, who
was a missing, we believe,

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:50.400 align:middle line:84%
deceased teenager from
Brockton, Massachusetts.

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.060 align:middle line:90%
And I worked on her case.

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And then my nephew Sean, who
was 19 when a piece of his car

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.040 align:middle line:90%
fell on him and he passed.

00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And so I have this whole
team in addition to my guides

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:06.090 align:middle line:84%
and my angels and
my alien family,

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:08.250 align:middle line:84%
and everybody joins
together to help me.

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:12.140 align:middle line:84%
When I'm stuck with a
case, I call them in.

00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:12.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm.

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:15.989 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk about the
parents of grieving children,

00:34:15.989 --> 00:34:18.420 align:middle line:84%
and let's talk about some
of the messages that come--

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:20.159 align:middle line:84%
I mean, grieving
parents of children

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:22.350 align:middle line:84%
who have been lost to
cancer, for example,

00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:27.350 align:middle line:84%
or anomalous, kind of strange
deaths, unexpected deaths.

00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:29.420 align:middle line:84%
The nature of the
messages that come through

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:31.370 align:middle line:84%
from these children--
because we always

00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:35.600 align:middle line:84%
think, oh, their life
was truncated obviously.

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.070 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: The main
message from these children

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:44.480 align:middle line:84%
is, wow, I am working
with troubled children.

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:45.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm a teacher.

00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:46.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm a counselor.

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:49.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm helping you all
that are still here.

00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:52.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm helping my parents
to get through this.

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And when I sit with
parents who have physically

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:59.600 align:middle line:84%
lost their child, they come
through in such amazing ways.

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:01.190 align:middle line:84%
It's like they're
just talking to me.

00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:02.540 align:middle line:90%
They're in my ear.

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's unbelievable
to me even.

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And I still get amazed after
22 years of doing this work.

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:12.680 align:middle line:84%
But they'll say, I need
them to know I'm OK.

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:15.230 align:middle line:84%
They'll bring up very
specific, rare things.

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:17.210 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh, I see
they just built--

00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:21.380 align:middle line:84%
this was one case-- they built
a playground for special needs

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:22.850 align:middle line:90%
children--

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:24.860 align:middle line:84%
this one young girl
who passed recently,

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:26.630 align:middle line:90%
and she had cerebral palsy.

00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you're building a
playground for special needs

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:30.920 align:middle line:90%
children.

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.910 align:middle line:90%
[GASP] She sees that?

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:33.710 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:34.880 align:middle line:90%
She's actually helping you.

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:37.530 align:middle line:84%
Didn't you just get a
check for $10,000 grand?

00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:38.330 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:39.540 align:middle line:90%
She helped make that happen.

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:42.800 align:middle line:84%
So they're working for
us on the other side.

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And they say, I live
through you now.

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:48.380 align:middle line:84%
I didn't just disappear
into oblivion.

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:50.070 align:middle line:90%
I still exist.

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And then I just had a young
mom who lost her 14-year-old

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:57.350 align:middle line:90%
on a motorbike.

00:35:57.350 --> 00:35:59.300 align:middle line:90%
This was two months ago.

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And most of the moms and parents
have this appetite to find--

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:05.900 align:middle line:90%
I want to find Ava.

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:06.810 align:middle line:90%
Where is she?

00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:07.610 align:middle line:90%
Where is she?

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:09.920 align:middle line:84%
I need to find her, but
I can't go be with her.

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'm helping her and
coaching her to find her here.

00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:16.430 align:middle line:84%
So I'm teaching her
about meditation,

00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:17.900 align:middle line:90%
raising her consciousness.

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And she's doing all
the work, and she's

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:22.130 align:middle line:90%
like, I finally had a dream.

00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:25.340 align:middle line:84%
We had a conversation,
and I'm OK because I

00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:28.020 align:middle line:84%
know she's going to
help me to help others.

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:29.630 align:middle line:84%
So the message is
always like, what

00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:32.400 align:middle line:84%
can you do to serve
others in my memory?

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.200 align:middle line:90%
It's awesome.

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:36.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so when you talk
about this, what's striking me

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:38.690 align:middle line:84%
is, yes, you might
be in a child's body,

00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:40.520 align:middle line:84%
but you're a soul
who's been around

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:44.990 align:middle line:84%
and has great maturity, great,
vast wells of experience

00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:46.440 align:middle line:90%
within that soul.

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:49.490 align:middle line:84%
So when they come through
to you and work with you,

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:53.750 align:middle line:84%
are they coming through
as kind of the entity

00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:58.100 align:middle line:84%
that they were in their recent
incarnation, as little Lulu?

00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:00.470 align:middle line:84%
Or do they come through
in their kind of fullness

00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:02.160 align:middle line:90%
of their being and knowledge?

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.635 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: This is the best
question I've ever been asked.

00:37:04.635 --> 00:37:05.435 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:37:05.435 --> 00:37:05.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:06.440 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: I'm serious.

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:07.700 align:middle line:90%
So a little bit of both.

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:08.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:12.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: So Ava, the
14-year-old, she comes in.

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:14.910 align:middle line:84%
Tell my mother I'm
a very old soul.

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:16.590 align:middle line:90%
I've lived multiple lifetimes.

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And we touched base
on some of those,

00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:20.940 align:middle line:84%
which made sense for
some of the fears she

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:22.500 align:middle line:90%
brought into this lifetime.

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:23.805 align:middle line:90%
She didn't like water.

00:37:23.805 --> 00:37:24.930 align:middle line:90%
She was afraid of drowning.

00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:25.650 align:middle line:90%
Oh my gosh.

00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:26.160 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:26.960 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And then they come
through like, OK.

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:32.040 align:middle line:84%
This is what I was
like here on Earth,

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:36.870 align:middle line:84%
but here I am now in my light
self, my light consciousness

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:38.160 align:middle line:90%
and higher consciousness.

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And I help them to understand,
what does that mean?

00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Or they'll say, what
does that mean, old soul?

00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, well,
most of the kids

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:49.710 align:middle line:84%
that come to me are the light
workers that was sent here

00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:51.930 align:middle line:84%
for a short time
to do their work

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:55.590 align:middle line:84%
and then move on to the other
parts of whatever either

00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:58.800 align:middle line:84%
that soul contract is or
their Akashic Records.

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And I say to them, they
want you to understand

00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:06.000 align:middle line:84%
that this is their
book and they're

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.090 align:middle line:84%
onto the next chapter
that was assigned to them,

00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:11.855 align:middle line:84%
either from God or
the higher beings.

00:38:11.855 --> 00:38:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And I just offer
whatever they're

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:15.720 align:middle line:90%
comfortable with with that.

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:18.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So why do these
beings that you say--

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:20.940 align:middle line:84%
these light beings,
the kids that

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:24.060 align:middle line:84%
are coming through for
short periods of time--

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:26.940 align:middle line:84%
do they tell you why they needed
to come into physicality at all

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:28.720 align:middle line:84%
versus just working
from the other side?

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:29.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yes.

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:30.398 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:30.398 --> 00:38:31.856 align:middle line:84%
(WHISPERING) I love
your questions.

00:38:31.856 --> 00:38:32.656 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:38:32.656 --> 00:38:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: So they will--

00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:40.920 align:middle line:84%
it ranges from, I was here
to help my autistic brother,

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:42.990 align:middle line:84%
or I was here to
make a difference

00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:48.120 align:middle line:84%
in the lives of my mother,
father, sister, brother.

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:52.170 align:middle line:90%
I helped-- I had one gentleman.

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:57.420 align:middle line:84%
He was in his 20s, and he dove
off a building in Nantucket

00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:59.460 align:middle line:84%
where everybody dove
off this restaurant.

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And he said I was an
entrepreneur at 15 years old.

00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:07.650 align:middle line:84%
I was raising millions
of dollars for charities.

00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And now his family has
continued his legacy--

00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:11.880 align:middle line:90%
Corey Griffin.

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:15.140 align:middle line:84%
He helped start the
ice bucket challenge,

00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:17.790 align:middle line:90%
the ALS ice bucket challenge.

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:19.515 align:middle line:90%
And he did that before he left.

00:39:19.515 --> 00:39:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And then after it just
went through the roof,

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:22.530 align:middle line:90%
because he was still doing--

00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:23.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So he came
to establish this.

00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:24.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yes.

00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And he's still doing his
work from the other side.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.550 align:middle line:84%
There's multiple
charities set up

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:31.510 align:middle line:90%
in his name to help children.

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:33.270 align:middle line:84%
So they'll talk about
things like that,

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:35.970 align:middle line:84%
like I was here to do
this work, that work.

00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:38.400 align:middle line:90%
Even adults will say that to me.

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:43.180 align:middle line:84%
So I was here to create this
medical device called XYZ,

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:46.410 align:middle line:84%
and then my work was
done, and I had to go on.

00:39:46.410 --> 00:39:49.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, then why did they have
to die in that horrific way?

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, well, it's just
different for everyone.

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:53.040 align:middle line:90%
Some might agree to an illness.

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:54.900 align:middle line:90%
Some might agree to a tragedy.

00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:57.600 align:middle line:90%
It just depends on that soul.

00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:59.227 align:middle line:90%
And there's free will too.

00:39:59.227 --> 00:40:00.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Free will.

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:00.315 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:40:00.315 --> 00:40:00.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: So I'll
have parents say to me,

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:05.880 align:middle line:84%
I know my son did not
agree to be murdered.

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, he most
certainly did not.

00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:10.140 align:middle line:84%
But that perpetrator
had free will

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:13.110 align:middle line:84%
and made a horrible,
awful decision.

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:17.340 align:middle line:84%
But your son is at the top
of the line vibrationally.

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:21.810 align:middle line:84%
When I tune into kids that have
passed in such a horrific way,

00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:22.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm like this.

00:40:22.650 --> 00:40:24.360 align:middle line:90%
[GASP] I can't catch my breath.

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:28.950 align:middle line:84%
They're so beautiful and amazing
and at the top of the vibration

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:30.300 align:middle line:90%
chain.

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:32.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm going to bring
up something a little--

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:33.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:35.310 align:middle line:84%
I find it interesting
because it's something I

00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:37.380 align:middle line:90%
witnessed years ago, OK?

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And it had to do with two
people, two different people I

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.950 align:middle line:90%
knew.

00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And both of them had connected
with the same soul group

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:45.420 align:middle line:90%
that I talked about, my guides.

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you
know, your differences

00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:51.480 align:middle line:84%
need to be mended in this
time, because you already

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:54.090 align:middle line:84%
agreed to work on
a project together

00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:55.265 align:middle line:90%
in your next incarnation.

00:40:55.265 --> 00:40:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And it was very specific
what that project-- it was

00:40:57.390 --> 00:40:59.310 align:middle line:90%
technology-- was going to be.

00:40:59.310 --> 00:41:00.450 align:middle line:90%
He died on cue.

00:41:00.450 --> 00:41:01.540 align:middle line:90%
Boom, like that.

00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:02.340 align:middle line:90%
Died on cue.

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:03.270 align:middle line:90%
Had a massive stroke.

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:04.880 align:middle line:90%
Gone.

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:07.340 align:middle line:84%
She knew she was--
and she was very--

00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:10.070 align:middle line:84%
she was a very well-known
psychic, by the way.

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:14.025 align:middle line:84%
She knew what year she was
going to die in her life.

00:41:14.025 --> 00:41:15.650 align:middle line:84%
She was going to die
at 53, which would

00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:17.790 align:middle line:90%
have coincided with his death.

00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And instead, she brought me,
other people who can heal,

00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:24.540 align:middle line:84%
and a contingent of healers
in when she developed

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:27.090 align:middle line:90%
a multi-fingered breast tumor.

00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:29.190 align:middle line:84%
She brought everybody
in to do the healing.

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:31.680 align:middle line:84%
We all worked on it,
worked on it, worked on it.

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:34.380 align:middle line:84%
Her life was
horrible after that.

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:35.700 align:middle line:90%
Everything fell apart.

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:37.685 align:middle line:90%
She didn't die on cue.

00:41:37.685 --> 00:41:38.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Oh, interesting.

00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:39.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now I just
had to bring that up,

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:41.730 align:middle line:84%
because it's one
of the stranger--

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:43.080 align:middle line:90%
they had agreed to something.

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.120 align:middle line:84%
She's not going to be
there now, obviously.

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:50.940 align:middle line:84%
She's lingered on on opioids and
doesn't have abilities anymore.

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:54.660 align:middle line:84%
It's been a horrible extension
of her life from that time

00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:58.860 align:middle line:84%
forward after everyone helped
to preserve her physical life.

00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: So my
mind is going, like,

00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:03.450 align:middle line:84%
a mile a minute right
now with thoughts,

00:42:03.450 --> 00:42:08.205 align:middle line:84%
because I'll get a group of
people and do healings, and--

00:42:08.205 --> 00:42:11.310 align:middle line:84%
or I say to the people
that I'm working on,

00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:14.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm helping you to activate
your own healing abilities.

00:42:14.610 --> 00:42:18.030 align:middle line:84%
The healers are just here to
help you tap into your own,

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:19.200 align:middle line:90%
as you know.

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And I say if it's meant to be
or if it's part of their script,

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:30.360 align:middle line:84%
then they may receive
their own healing.

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:35.370 align:middle line:84%
But with my cancer work too and
my foundation I had for years,

00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:38.010 align:middle line:84%
I say, I'm not
promising anything,

00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:42.040 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to help you
activate your own inner healing

00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:42.840 align:middle line:90%
ability.

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:44.215 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
have more energy.

00:42:44.215 --> 00:42:47.357 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
teach you how to juice

00:42:47.357 --> 00:42:49.440 align:middle line:84%
and take these certain
supplements and things that

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:52.500 align:middle line:84%
might help you sleep
better and have peace.

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:55.260 align:middle line:84%
But I'll always be honest with--
they'll say, am I going to die?

00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:59.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, well, that's between
you and your gods, the side

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.090 align:middle line:84%
god, whatever you
want to call it.

00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:03.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't get the
greatest feeling.

00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:06.200 align:middle line:90%
But don't fight it.

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:08.457 align:middle line:90%
If it's part of your journey--

00:43:08.457 --> 00:43:09.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Your plan.

00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:11.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: --the plan.

00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:12.540 align:middle line:90%
But we're human, right?

00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:13.838 align:middle line:90%
So we always want to try and--

00:43:13.838 --> 00:43:14.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We want to try.

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: We want
to save everybody.

00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:16.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:19.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, and I wanted and the
others wanted to help her.

00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:20.930 align:middle line:84%
Although I already
knew the story,

00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:22.310 align:middle line:90%
I thought, it's interesting.

00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:24.500 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly--
showing up exactly when

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:26.540 align:middle line:84%
she's known since she
was a little kid she

00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:27.890 align:middle line:90%
was going to die at 53.

00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:29.240 align:middle line:90%
She had told me that before.

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:30.440 align:middle line:90%
And here she is, 53.

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:32.160 align:middle line:90%
This is happening.

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:32.960 align:middle line:90%
It was interesting.

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:36.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: I've had
young people say too

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:38.480 align:middle line:84%
that they told their
parents they weren't going

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:39.750 align:middle line:90%
to live past a certain age.

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:40.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:41.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:41.350 --> 00:43:44.570 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, that was just one
of those quirky things that

00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:47.070 align:middle line:90%
impacts potentially the future.

00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:50.270 align:middle line:84%
So just about you
now and what you do,

00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:54.140 align:middle line:84%
because you have a list a couple
thousand people long of people

00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:57.620 align:middle line:84%
wanting to talk to their
children who have passed away

00:43:57.620 --> 00:44:00.170 align:middle line:84%
and find out where they
are and how they're doing.

00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And you can't do everybody,
and you do all that pro bono.

00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:05.820 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
the rest of what you do.

00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:06.620 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah.

00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:08.640 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for
bringing that up.

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:12.950 align:middle line:84%
I do try to give this
ability, give this--

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:15.570 align:middle line:84%
we all have this ability,
but to give back.

00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And so I do a lot
of online things

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:18.860 align:middle line:90%
with helping parents heal.

00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:21.620 align:middle line:84%
It's a free Facebook
group that folks

00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:23.570 align:middle line:84%
that are watching that
unfortunately could

00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:25.460 align:middle line:90%
be in this position could join.

00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:27.500 align:middle line:90%
And they have mediums all week.

00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:29.690 align:middle line:90%
And then I do live events too.

00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:33.530 align:middle line:84%
But when I connect with
spirit, I'm hearing them.

00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And we all have these
abilities, as you know.

00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:38.240 align:middle line:90%
And it's the inside voice.

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:39.770 align:middle line:90%
And then I feel how they pass.

00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:42.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't take it on, so
that's the clairsentience

00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:43.640 align:middle line:90%
and the clairaudience.

00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:44.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm hearing.

00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'll smell scents
too, clairaroma.

00:44:48.830 --> 00:44:50.990 align:middle line:84%
Do you smell cigarette
smoke and nobody's there?

00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:54.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, and sometimes
there was one-- a man my son

00:44:54.830 --> 00:44:56.420 align:middle line:90%
and I called the garbage man.

00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:58.610 align:middle line:84%
He only lived in
one certain column

00:44:58.610 --> 00:45:00.350 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of
the living room,

00:45:00.350 --> 00:45:02.990 align:middle line:84%
and when you passed through
him, he smelled like garbage.

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:04.170 align:middle line:90%
Burning garbage.

00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:06.712 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you walked out
of that little three-foot area,

00:45:06.712 --> 00:45:07.760 align:middle line:90%
everything was fine.

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:10.040 align:middle line:84%
Took so long to
figure out it was

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:12.530 align:middle line:84%
an entity that was hanging out
with us in the living room.

00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:13.398 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:45:13.398 --> 00:45:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: And then finally
we're just like, hey.

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:16.070 align:middle line:90%
Yo.

00:45:16.070 --> 00:45:16.960 align:middle line:90%
How you doing?

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:17.495 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:45:17.495 --> 00:45:18.470 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:22.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: But yeah, the scent
will spark a memory within.

00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:27.560 align:middle line:84%
Cigarette smoke, maybe pipe
or flowers, a certain perfume.

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:29.340 align:middle line:90%
I always say Jean Nate.

00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:30.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my god.

00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.500 align:middle line:90%
That's--

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:32.015 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: Remember
Jean Nate in the fridge?

00:45:32.015 --> 00:45:33.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Blast to the past.

00:45:33.110 --> 00:45:34.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: My mother always
had it in the fridge.

00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:35.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:37.093 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: But it
will spark a memory.

00:45:37.093 --> 00:45:41.090 align:middle line:84%
Even a certain food
baking, maybe mothballs.

00:45:41.090 --> 00:45:44.130 align:middle line:84%
But then you know who
it associates with.

00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:48.270 align:middle line:84%
So we hear, we feel, we see,
and we can sense things.

00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And when the hair
stands up on end

00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:52.610 align:middle line:84%
when you're doing the
dishes or just looking

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:54.410 align:middle line:90%
outside and you see signs--

00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:56.570 align:middle line:90%
the cardinal or a certain bird.

00:45:56.570 --> 00:45:58.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or someone
touching you or-- yeah.

00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: So that's
the quickening.

00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:02.465 align:middle line:84%
So the quickening, when
people will say to me,

00:46:02.465 --> 00:46:05.090 align:middle line:84%
I just get goosebumps out of the
blue, I'm like, that's spirit.

00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:06.380 align:middle line:90%
They've come into your aura.

00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:08.240 align:middle line:84%
They've come into
your energy field.

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:09.740 align:middle line:90%
And so acknowledge them.

00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:11.310 align:middle line:90%
Say, I know you're here.

00:46:11.310 --> 00:46:12.120 align:middle line:90%
Well, I want more.

00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:14.120 align:middle line:84%
I want them to turn the
light off on demand.

00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:17.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, spirit
is not on demand.

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:18.780 align:middle line:90%
They can't do that.

00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:21.320 align:middle line:84%
They'll come when you least
expect it, and the reason why

00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:24.350 align:middle line:84%
is because you come out
of that overthinking

00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:26.990 align:middle line:84%
and always in your head, and
you lead with your heart.

00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And they can reach
you better when

00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:31.580 align:middle line:90%
you're half asleep, half awake.

00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:33.710 align:middle line:84%
So the witching hour,
3:00 to 4:00 AM.

00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: 3:00 to
4:00 in the morning.

00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:35.000 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.340 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Are you at 3:15--

00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:36.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yep.

00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:37.525 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: --person--

00:46:37.525 --> 00:46:39.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, 3:30,
but 3:00 to 4:00.

00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:40.080 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:40.880 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Yeah.

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:42.740 align:middle line:10%
And so there's many
ways that spirit

00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:46.040 align:middle line:10%
can get in touch in the way
that I communicate as well.

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:50.600 align:middle line:10%
But lately there's been a
shift, and I can literally

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:52.790 align:middle line:10%
hear them just talk to me.

00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:54.410 align:middle line:10%
Not all the time.

00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:56.630 align:middle line:10%
But I'm amazed after
all these years

00:46:56.630 --> 00:47:01.255 align:middle line:10%
that something's happening
on the energetic level

00:47:01.255 --> 00:47:02.880 align:middle line:10%
in the world.

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:03.680 align:middle line:90%
It's wild.

00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:06.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, have you noticed
a difference, especially

00:47:06.050 --> 00:47:09.380 align:middle line:84%
with the trials and tribulations
happening in the world?

00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:13.710 align:middle line:84%
I feel that we're being brought
to a much higher consciousness,

00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:14.780 align:middle line:90%
awareness.

00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:17.633 align:middle line:84%
Everybody wants to learn and
grow and come out of this.

00:47:17.633 --> 00:47:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think
the other side is really

00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:20.850 align:middle line:90%
trying to communicate.

00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed even
during that-- as you

00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:24.680 align:middle line:84%
call when you're falling
asleep in that kind

00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:25.940 align:middle line:90%
of subliminal state.

00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:30.650 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, I'll be just
observing people somewhere

00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:33.420 align:middle line:84%
at a dinner table, listening
to their conversations.

00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:35.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't know who they
are or why I'm even--

00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:38.360 align:middle line:84%
but I have a lot more of
that where I'm just seeing--

00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:39.620 align:middle line:90%
just wherever I am.

00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:42.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm in some sub-dimensional
field where other people are.

00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:45.503 align:middle line:84%
So I just listen and observe
and drift off to sleep.

00:47:45.503 --> 00:47:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HANCOCK: So you've
noticed that more lately?

00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:48.220 align:middle line:90%
Same.

00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:49.460 align:middle line:90%
And I mostly hear.

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:53.390 align:middle line:84%
I say I'm clairaudient, and
I have been seeing people.

00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:55.350 align:middle line:90%
And I'm doing a double take.

00:47:55.350 --> 00:47:57.487 align:middle line:90%
And I'm, like, used to this.

00:47:57.487 --> 00:47:58.820 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, what is happening?

00:47:58.820 --> 00:47:59.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So it's increasing.

00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:01.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they always say
the thinning of the veils.

00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:02.660 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:05.390 align:middle line:84%
But I think also
trauma blasts us open,

00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:07.590 align:middle line:84%
and we have been
traumatized in many ways.

00:48:07.590 --> 00:48:09.960 align:middle line:84%
So our beings are more
fragile, meaning more open,

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:12.980 align:middle line:84%
more permeable, more
open to influence.

00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
the culmination

00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:18.000 align:middle line:84%
of that with the beings from the
other side, screaming, it's OK.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:18.800 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:19.610 align:middle line:90%
Let me help you.

00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And we're feeling flooded
and lost and don't know

00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:23.870 align:middle line:90%
all this help is available.

00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:24.890 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Absolutely.

00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:31.255 align:middle line:84%
And I have noticed an influx
from the planets and--

00:48:31.255 --> 00:48:32.130 align:middle line:90%
you know what I mean?

00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:38.130 align:middle line:84%
Like, I'm getting my higher
helpers from back home.

00:48:38.130 --> 00:48:39.630 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, whoa.

00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:41.880 align:middle line:90%
This is an intense shift.

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And because we need
it more than ever now,

00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:48.690 align:middle line:84%
talking about forgiveness
and coming back to love.

00:48:48.690 --> 00:48:49.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:51.720 align:middle line:90%
That's the message we all need.

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:53.460 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for bringing
it full circle.

00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:55.110 align:middle line:90%
You're absolutely delightful.

00:48:55.110 --> 00:48:56.325 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: And so are you.

00:48:56.325 --> 00:48:58.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] This has
been a fun conversation.

00:48:58.890 --> 00:49:01.200 align:middle line:84%
I know everybody's had a
wonderful ride with you.

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:02.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HANCOCK: Well, thank you.

00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:03.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:06.090 align:middle line:10%
Again, Maureen's book is
"The Medium Next Door."

00:49:06.090 --> 00:49:08.500 align:middle line:10%
And she'll also be appearing
on some TV engagements,

00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:09.420 align:middle line:10%
so keep an eye out.

00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:11.370 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:49:11.370 --> 00:49:12.540 align:middle line:90%
on "Open Minds."
