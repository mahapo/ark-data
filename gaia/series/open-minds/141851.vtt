>>REGINA MEREDITH:
My guest Teal Swan

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.220 align:middle line:10%
has a story that's been
watched by millions

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.830 align:middle line:10%
of people on YouTube about
living with the shadow

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.120 align:middle line:10%
side of ourselves.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.300 align:middle line:84%
Her story was documented in
a film called "Open Shadow."

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.240 align:middle line:84%
Teal's story is one of
abuse from mothers and self

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.310 align:middle line:84%
and attempting to
heal through it.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:44.150 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Teal.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL SWAN: Thanks
for having me on.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.950 align:middle line:84%
I've done a few
kind of similar--

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.180 align:middle line:84%
not the same-- stories and
I'm just constantly left with,

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.530 align:middle line:84%
how can adults steal the
innocence of children

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.320 align:middle line:84%
because it comes down to the
innocence of children, right?

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.120 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Yes.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.879 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And in your case, it
wasn't any different and you

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.930 align:middle line:84%
have your own story and it's
something that is perpetuated--

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.370 align:middle line:84%
was perpetuated really
throughout your lifetime

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.040 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what it did to
your internal perception

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.160 align:middle line:90%
of yourself.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.790 align:middle line:84%
So let's start with one
of the terms that you use

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.190 align:middle line:84%
and you say that you've
made it your home

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.750 align:middle line:90%
to "live with the shadow."

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.982 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, first
of all, explain

00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:24.440 align:middle line:84%
what that means to
everyone so they

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.820 align:middle line:84%
can get a context for
this conversation.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.620 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: OK.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.850 align:middle line:10%
So the "shadow" essentially
means the subconscious.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.000 align:middle line:10%
When you're raised in any kind
of situation but especially

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.590 align:middle line:10%
these abusive types
of situations,

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.037 align:middle line:10%
it imprints your way of
looking at the world.

00:01:40.037 --> 00:01:41.870 align:middle line:84%
But you're not usually
conscious of the fact

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.650 align:middle line:84%
that you see the
world in that way.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.980 align:middle line:84%
So the process of
healing and the process

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.870 align:middle line:84%
of expanding, becoming
more, is a process

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.554 align:middle line:84%
of becoming conscious of what is
down there in the subconscious.

00:01:51.554 --> 00:01:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And we've been calling the
subconscious the "shadow"

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.010 align:middle line:90%
for a very long time.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.260 align:middle line:84%
It's just that most of what
we put in the subconscious

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.699 align:middle line:84%
is the stuff we don't
want to look at.

00:01:59.699 --> 00:02:02.240 align:middle line:84%
The misconception, though, is
that the only thing that's down

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.740 align:middle line:90%
there is stuff that's not good.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.290 align:middle line:84%
But actually, we suppress a lot
of good stuff in the shadow,

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.091 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:02:07.091 --> 00:02:07.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the subconscious
is simply a repository.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.300 align:middle line:90%
It's not dark nor light.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.930 align:middle line:90%
It's just what has been.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.130 align:middle line:84%
So it can create these
magnificent, lovely attractions

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.040 align:middle line:84%
in life, as well as
repulsions because of things

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.130 align:middle line:84%
that have happened on the darker
side of the spectrum, right?

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.930 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.110 align:middle line:84%
So you were born very open
psychically as a child.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.230 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about your
early life experience

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.110 align:middle line:84%
and what that was like
and how it showed itself,

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.730 align:middle line:84%
how it played out in your
family, and all of that.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:36.950 align:middle line:90%
Take your time.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.270 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: OK.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, being born extrasensory
or super open intuitively,

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.770 align:middle line:90%
it means a whole lot of things.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.410 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
is when you're

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.260 align:middle line:84%
overlapping these different
dimensional realities--

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.560 align:middle line:84%
let's say somebody
in the family dies.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.730 align:middle line:84%
To somebody grounded in
the physical, they're gone.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.740 align:middle line:84%
But to somebody who's
extrasensory, they're not gone.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:58.490 align:middle line:90%
They're hanging around.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:59.290 align:middle line:90%
You can see them.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.620 align:middle line:90%
You can hear them.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.600 align:middle line:84%
And so that was
the kind of stuff

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.340 align:middle line:90%
I was dealing with as a child.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.459 align:middle line:84%
Also, being a
medical intuitive, I

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.000 align:middle line:84%
could see what was
wrong with people.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.220 align:middle line:84%
I could see it manifest
in an energetic level

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.710 align:middle line:84%
before it was on
a physical level.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Little kids shouldn't
"know" that type of stuff.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:15.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And the parents don't like
those inconvenient truths when

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.740 align:middle line:90%
a kid blurts out something.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:20.540 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Well, yeah.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.472 align:middle line:84%
And when you've got
a tuned-in child,

00:03:22.472 --> 00:03:24.680 align:middle line:84%
it also means that you can't
hide anything from them.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.481 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:26.854 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: So you've
got a kid who's

00:03:26.854 --> 00:03:28.190 align:middle line:90%
like, you don't feel that way.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.356 align:middle line:90%
I can tell you how you feel.

00:03:29.356 --> 00:03:30.800 align:middle line:90%
You're mad right now.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.230 align:middle line:90%
You can't hide.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And it bled into a lot
of real issues for me

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.130 align:middle line:84%
because it's not just
a blessing to see

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.640 align:middle line:90%
more than a person should see.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.440 align:middle line:84%
Especially in a world that
thrives on suppression,

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.600 align:middle line:90%
it's quite painful.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.680 align:middle line:84%
So I had a very hard
time coexisting.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.180 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult
for a kid that's

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.920 align:middle line:84%
bringing in that
kind of information

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.056 align:middle line:84%
to do the things you want
them to do on time, to fit

00:03:55.056 --> 00:03:57.680 align:middle line:84%
into a society that doesn't make
sense to them because they're,

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.150 align:middle line:84%
of course, the kid that's
going to be like, why does it

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.690 align:middle line:90%
have to be this way?

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:01.940 align:middle line:90%
And can you give me an answer?

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.273 align:middle line:90%
And most parents actually can't.

00:04:03.273 --> 00:04:07.410 align:middle line:84%
So it ends up being
an invalidating child

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.290 align:middle line:90%
to have, to be quite honest.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.020 align:middle line:84%
If you're not prepared
for that type of child,

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.370 align:middle line:90%
it invalidates you as a parent.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.020 align:middle line:90%
It invalidates you as a person.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And so it's hard to have
any kind of insecurities

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.640 align:middle line:90%
and have that type of child.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And that was the problem
between me and my parents.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they chose the
classic route, which was

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.280 align:middle line:90%
to take you to a psychologist?

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.080 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Yeah.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.996 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about that experience.

00:04:28.996 --> 00:04:31.130 align:middle line:84%
How old were you and
how did they begin

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.150 align:middle line:84%
and what kind of
therapies did they use?

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.260 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: Well, I think I
went earlier, but about 11

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.990 align:middle line:84%
was when it became, we
have to really figure out

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.730 align:middle line:90%
what's wrong with this kid.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.280 align:middle line:84%
So they were dragging me
to people who were, I mean,

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.830 align:middle line:84%
standard therapists, who were
looking at me in terms of,

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.250 align:middle line:90%
is she schizoaffective?

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.600 align:middle line:90%
Is she schizophrenic?

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.100 align:middle line:90%
Is she bipolar?

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.512 align:middle line:90%
What's with all the emotions?

00:04:56.512 --> 00:04:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And they could never put their
finger on what was going on.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.560 align:middle line:90%
But of course, by that age--

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.900 align:middle line:84%
some people know my
story, some people don't--

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.220 align:middle line:90%
because of my abilities--

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going
to get into your story.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.080 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: You're going
to get into it?

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah, all of it.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.980 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hm.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.396 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: Well, nobody really
could put their finger on what

00:05:10.396 --> 00:05:11.710 align:middle line:90%
was going wrong with me.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And so I got slapped with
all kinds of diagnoses

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.077 align:middle line:84%
only because they wanted
to try medication.

00:05:16.077 --> 00:05:18.410 align:middle line:84%
You can't give somebody a
medication without giving them

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:19.940 align:middle line:90%
a diagnosis.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.650 align:middle line:84%
So I got all kinds of
diagnoses and I started to--

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What were they,
the plethora of diagnoses?

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.250 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: Well, every single one
of the therapists that I saw

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.050 align:middle line:90%
from--

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, by the time I
got out of childhood,

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.040 align:middle line:84%
it would have been probably
15 or 16 therapists just

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.300 align:middle line:90%
by that point.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.320 align:middle line:84%
Every one of them said that I
was a borderline personality.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.820 align:middle line:84%
Three of them said I
was schizoaffective.

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.642 align:middle line:90%
Two of them bipolar--

00:05:49.642 --> 00:05:52.100 align:middle line:84%
other people would switch their
diagnosis between all three

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.900 align:middle line:90%
of those things.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.280 align:middle line:84%
But it was that spectrum
that they put me on.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.229 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What kind of
drugs were you put on

00:05:57.229 --> 00:05:58.520 align:middle line:90%
and did you actually take them?

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.320 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Oh, yeah.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.570 align:middle line:84%
I did because what
people don't understand

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.970 align:middle line:84%
is when you have a kid
and you're dragging them

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.640 align:middle line:84%
to all these therapists,
the kid isn't thinking,

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.680 align:middle line:90%
oh, I'm perfectly fine.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.180 align:middle line:84%
I was walking in
that room thinking,

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.510 align:middle line:90%
something is wrong with me.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.060 align:middle line:84%
I have no other explanation
for the way that people

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.100 align:middle line:84%
are treating me and the fact
that I can't fit in no matter

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.180 align:middle line:90%
what I do.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.700 align:middle line:84%
So I was desperate just
to make them like me, just

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.090 align:middle line:90%
to make them be OK with me.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.180 align:middle line:84%
So I took them, yeah, because
I was in emotional hell.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.980 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so what was
the effect of the drugs?

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: Most of them made
the situations worse.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:31.577 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How so?

00:06:31.577 --> 00:06:33.410 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: They put me on
Abilify, for example,

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.320 align:middle line:84%
and for whatever reason,
it made me puke blood

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.910 align:middle line:90%
for about two straight weeks.

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And when we called
the therapist saying

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:44.930 align:middle line:84%
that this is what was happening,
he said, just keep taking it.

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.930 align:middle line:84%
Prozac-- I was on
Prozac for a while.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And instead of having suicidal
and cutting-type behavior,

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.847 align:middle line:84%
I swung and started
having homicidal thoughts.

00:06:55.847 --> 00:06:56.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.320 align:middle line:84%
You don't usually hear
about that side effect.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.450 align:middle line:90%
It says suicidal tendencies.

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:02.492 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't say homicidal.

00:07:02.492 --> 00:07:04.116 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: Well this is
the thing, though,

00:07:04.116 --> 00:07:05.600 align:middle line:84%
is there's this
huge study that's

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.700 align:middle line:84%
going into Prozac because
what they're finding

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.199 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of these
school shootings

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:11.040 align:middle line:84%
and things like
that where kids pop

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.670 align:middle line:84%
is that there's a
lot of medication

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.390 align:middle line:90%
for specifically Prozac.

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:15.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.180 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: And this is the problem.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.870 align:middle line:84%
These guys are
using these drugs.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.870 align:middle line:84%
They don't actually know
enough about the brain.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.120 align:middle line:84%
We don't know enough
about the brain

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.744 align:middle line:84%
to know how anything's
going to happen.

00:07:23.744 --> 00:07:24.740 align:middle line:90%
So it's kind of a dart.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And the real blessing I
think in my childhood, which

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.670 align:middle line:84%
we didn't heal much, but we
went to a child psychologist who

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:33.840 align:middle line:84%
sat my parents down
and said, look,

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
be able to tell you

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.010 align:middle line:84%
what's going on
with your daughter

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:39.760 align:middle line:90%
because we don't know enough.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.950 align:middle line:84%
What I do know is that
she was able to tell me

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.680 align:middle line:84%
something about my son
that I never told her

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.420 align:middle line:90%
and that nobody knows.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.400 align:middle line:90%
I have no explanation for it.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.560 align:middle line:84%
What I can do for
you is to basically

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.500 align:middle line:84%
just start with the drugs
that begin with an A name.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.597 align:middle line:84%
Start with the drugs that begin
with a B name and then a C name

00:07:56.597 --> 00:07:58.180 align:middle line:84%
and see if anything
works because it's

00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:59.796 align:middle line:90%
the best that I can do for you.

00:07:59.796 --> 00:08:00.920 align:middle line:90%
And at least he was honest.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.020 align:middle line:90%
My mother was like, I'm done.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:02.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm done.

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:03.940 align:middle line:90%
I can't do this anymore.

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.398 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What did
this do when you

00:08:05.398 --> 00:08:07.891 align:middle line:84%
were on these various
drugs to your abilities

00:08:07.891 --> 00:08:08.890 align:middle line:90%
within the other realms?

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:10.140 align:middle line:90%
Did it leave you--

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:11.020 align:middle line:90%
you were still open.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.100 align:middle line:84%
You still had access
to all of that.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.370 align:middle line:90%
So you were still nuts.

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:15.170 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Yeah.

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:17.420 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it didn't help
that part that they were hoping

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:21.730 align:middle line:90%
would conveniently go away.

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:25.260 align:middle line:84%
It just gave you all of the
other negatively impacted

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.580 align:middle line:90%
behaviors.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.990 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about then
getting into kind

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:35.770 align:middle line:84%
of the crux of the story or
the breaking point of the story

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.330 align:middle line:84%
because this is
something that people

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:41.740 align:middle line:84%
have a really hard time with
and I have a hard time with.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And part of it is the
parents' lack of awareness

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.425 align:middle line:90%
around these things.

00:08:46.425 --> 00:08:47.800 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk
about what happened

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:52.270 align:middle line:84%
when you were placed in the
trust of this man, "Doc."

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:55.620 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about Doc, who
he was, how old you were,

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.980 align:middle line:84%
and the beginning of
this whole relationship.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:08:59.780 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: OK.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:03.310 align:middle line:84%
When I met Doc, I
was five but I didn't

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:06.910 align:middle line:84%
become a figment of his
reality until I was about six.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And he was a
psychopath, honestly,

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.542 align:middle line:90%
if you want a diagnosis.

00:09:10.542 --> 00:09:13.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what did he look
like in the mainstream world

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.210 align:middle line:84%
that your parents would
have entrusted you to him?

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:21.520 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: A veterinarian, very
upstanding, super charismatic,

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.160 align:middle line:90%
leader-type personality--

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.800 align:middle line:84%
most of the people in the
society that we were living in

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:31.360 align:middle line:84%
saw him as a very let's say
cutting-edge type of a person

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.000 align:middle line:84%
because he was into
the alternative field.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.610 align:middle line:84%
So when he came in
and said, I know

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:38.770 align:middle line:84%
what these types
of abilities are,

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:40.780 align:middle line:84%
nobody else in that type
of my parents' circle

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.994 align:middle line:84%
or anybody in that society
knew anything about that.

00:09:42.994 --> 00:09:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And so they were
like, wow, here's

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:46.420 align:middle line:84%
a different perspective
on this kid.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:48.520 align:middle line:90%
Nobody wants to be around Teal.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.410 align:middle line:84%
So here we have somebody
saying, not only

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:51.535 align:middle line:90%
do I want to be around her.

00:09:51.535 --> 00:09:52.840 align:middle line:90%
I can really help.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
my parents were

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:57.340 align:middle line:84%
desperate not just
to change my issues

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.632 align:middle line:90%
but also to make me more happy.

00:09:58.632 --> 00:09:59.431 align:middle line:90%
So I was--

00:09:59.431 --> 00:10:02.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this was really
key to understanding because you

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.360 align:middle line:84%
see your parents in
the film and think,

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.500 align:middle line:84%
there's so much regret there
and sadness on their part.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.030 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the
heaviness in their hearts.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's because
they failed you,

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:14.770 align:middle line:84%
but they did it because
they were actually

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:16.390 align:middle line:90%
trying to help you.

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:18.160 align:middle line:90%
And they were hoodwinked by--

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.870 align:middle line:84%
was this man a
charismatic, as well?

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:21.240 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Super.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, you said,
"the community I lived in."

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:27.550 align:middle line:90%
You need to set that up for us.

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:28.350 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: OK.

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:29.310 align:middle line:90%
So the community--

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:31.601 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is a part of
the story that's important.

00:10:31.601 --> 00:10:32.950 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Thank you, mom and dad.

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:35.500 align:middle line:84%
The community they decided
to live in as liberal hippies

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:38.140 align:middle line:84%
was an incredibly
ultra conservative,

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.550 align:middle line:90%
rural Mormon community.

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:40.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I said I
think it's a key point.

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:43.560 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Yeah.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.940 align:middle line:90%
So I was not received well.

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:48.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In your opinion
looking back on it,

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:52.360 align:middle line:84%
why were they attracted to
that community as hippies?

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.940 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: Because my
parents are nature freaks

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:56.350 align:middle line:90%
and they were forest rangers.

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And so where they got a job
with the National Forest Service

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:02.942 align:middle line:84%
was in the very rural
mountains in northern Utah.

00:11:02.942 --> 00:11:04.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This just put
them in close proximity

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.410 align:middle line:84%
with the community and they
thought, well, it's community.

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:08.210 align:middle line:90%
We have a child.

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: Ironically, they
thought it was safe.

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:11.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:12.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:13.020 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:14.720 align:middle line:84%
So now we get the
backdrop to it.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.770 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about Doc,
this charismatic, upstanding

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:22.270 align:middle line:84%
veterinarian within this little
cultish Mormon community.

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:23.070 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: OK.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:28.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, he was a vet but a
vet that travels around.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And he was really interested
in doing acupuncture and things

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:32.680 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:37.080 align:middle line:84%
And my issue is at
that age, I am not

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:41.250 align:middle line:84%
aware of how he hooked
up with my parents.

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:43.350 align:middle line:84%
What I do know is
that the first time

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:46.350 align:middle line:84%
that I had run-ins with him
was not at my family home.

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:49.920 align:middle line:84%
So I got on his radar
separate of them.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.760 align:middle line:84%
But he did have a
relationship, I found out,

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.885 align:middle line:84%
not a romantic relationship
but a work relationship

00:11:53.885 --> 00:11:55.830 align:middle line:84%
with my mother that
happened before I was even

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:57.240 align:middle line:84%
born because my
mother went to college

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.590 align:middle line:90%
in this town for a little while.

00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:59.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:11:59.010 --> 00:11:59.850 align:middle line:90%
So he knew her?

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:01.837 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:01.837 --> 00:12:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: However he
found out about me,

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:07.472 align:middle line:84%
I actually had a friend in
school, a kind of friend--

00:12:07.472 --> 00:12:09.180 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really have
friends but somebody

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:10.888 align:middle line:84%
who went to the same
kindergarten class--

00:12:10.888 --> 00:12:14.680 align:middle line:84%
whose father was part
of a satanic coven.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And Doc was the one
that was supplying blood

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:19.836 align:middle line:90%
to the satanic group.

00:12:19.836 --> 00:12:21.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: From
animals or people?

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:23.730 align:middle line:90%
From animals-- OK.

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:26.400 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: Because as a vet, he has
access because part of the job

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.390 align:middle line:84%
is to go to the primary
slaughterhouse that's

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:29.190 align:middle line:90%
there in the town.

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:30.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, sure.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:33.150 align:middle line:84%
So there were these
dubious connections

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:35.040 align:middle line:84%
that had occurred
before you ever

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.930 align:middle line:90%
came into contact with him.

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:40.290 align:middle line:84%
Now at this time, was the entire
community under the impression

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:42.520 align:middle line:84%
that he was this man that
he presented himself as?

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.320 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Oh, yeah.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there was no
real suspicion of him at all.

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:47.040 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: No.

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.614 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't say so.

00:12:48.614 --> 00:12:51.030 align:middle line:84%
In retrospect, when my parents
had been talking to people,

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:52.488 align:middle line:84%
there's more than
a few people that

00:12:52.488 --> 00:12:55.020 align:middle line:84%
have a real issue
with him, people

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:57.670 align:middle line:84%
who have expressed that
they didn't like him at all.

00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:59.700 align:middle line:84%
There's been red flags
but no, in the community,

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:02.940 align:middle line:84%
he was not only upstanding
but incredibly sociable.

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:05.040 align:middle line:84%
You'd never ever guess
in a million lifetimes,

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.370 align:middle line:84%
especially because he
selected for a job that made

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:10.950 align:middle line:90%
him look like a real good guy.

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:12.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:13.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:16.080 align:middle line:84%
So now you're in contact
with him and as you say,

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:20.400 align:middle line:84%
the delusional or illusory
kind of relationship

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.430 align:middle line:84%
started developing
by the age of six.

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:25.510 align:middle line:90%
What was that like?

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:27.750 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: Well, he was
coming into my room

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:30.270 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the night,
taking me out of my bed

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:33.164 align:middle line:84%
and putting me back
before the morning.

00:13:33.164 --> 00:13:34.455 align:middle line:90%
He was showing up at my school.

00:13:34.455 --> 00:13:35.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
where was he taking

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:36.674 align:middle line:90%
you and what was happening?

00:13:36.674 --> 00:13:39.680 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Cult rituals, mostly.

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.362 align:middle line:90%
So he was--

00:13:41.362 --> 00:13:42.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you were aware.

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:44.850 align:middle line:84%
You never lost your
understanding or memory.

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:48.030 align:middle line:84%
You were cognizant of
everything going on.

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:50.000 align:middle line:90%
Let's slow this story down.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.810 align:middle line:84%
What happened when
you would be taken out

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:53.985 align:middle line:90%
of bed and to the cult ritual?

00:13:53.985 --> 00:13:56.110 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: Well, it depended
on the particular ritual.

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:58.962 align:middle line:84%
But for example, let's say
that this particular group

00:13:58.962 --> 00:14:01.170 align:middle line:84%
that he was a part of-- he
had multiple personalities

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:03.690 align:middle line:84%
so there were two different
cult groups in the area

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:05.300 align:middle line:90%
that he was a part of.

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And so let's say that
this particular cult

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:12.810 align:middle line:84%
ritual on this night requires
an actual sacrifice of a child.

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:13.950 align:middle line:90%
He would put me in the car.

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:16.470 align:middle line:84%
We would go around sometimes
with another person, sometimes

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:19.200 align:middle line:84%
just us, and we would be
casing these neighborhoods

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.500 align:middle line:84%
in southern Idaho for
children that were unattended.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why would he take you?

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: Because he
was training me--

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:26.260 align:middle line:90%
that was the whole thing.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:26.790 align:middle line:90%
I was his apprentice.

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:27.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:29.310 align:middle line:84%
You were to be the
sorcerer's apprentice.

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: 100%.

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:33.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now you
as the little kid,

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:36.780 align:middle line:84%
what happened to
you in all of this?

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:39.560 align:middle line:90%
What did you feel?

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:46.230 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: Dissociated-- these
guys are much smarter than just

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:48.180 align:middle line:84%
picking a kid up,
especially because he

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.240 align:middle line:84%
didn't kidnap me and then
disappear with me permanently.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.190 align:middle line:90%
I was going home to my parents.

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:54.570 align:middle line:90%
So it was deliberate.

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:55.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was an adventure.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:56.730 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Yeah.

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.350 align:middle line:90%
So it was programming, though.

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:01.490 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like they just
leave you with no explanation.

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:03.180 align:middle line:90%
I was given the explanation.

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:05.730 align:middle line:84%
You're a demon that took over
the body of a little child.

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:07.290 align:middle line:90%
You're my daughter.

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:08.790 align:middle line:84%
This is all a lie
you're living--

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:10.620 align:middle line:90%
tons of proof to back it up.

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:11.970 align:middle line:90%
I 100% bought it.

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:13.530 align:middle line:84%
He capitalized on
that gap between me

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:15.510 align:middle line:84%
and my parents, the 'you don't
belong in this family' thing,

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:16.770 align:middle line:90%
and it worked.

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:18.790 align:middle line:84%
I was feeling miserably
isolated and lonely.

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And so when this guy said,
I'm actually your real dad

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:22.628 align:middle line:84%
and the real truth about
you is all this stuff,

00:15:22.628 --> 00:15:24.837 align:middle line:84%
it made a lot more
sense to me emotionally.

00:15:24.837 --> 00:15:26.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How did you
feel as a little child

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.170 align:middle line:84%
to think that you
were a demon that

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:30.630 align:middle line:90%
was cloaked in a human body?

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:32.940 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: Absolutely
horrific-- it made

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:34.830 align:middle line:84%
all the extrasensory
stuff make sense,

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:38.850 align:middle line:84%
but I just wanted to
be good so, so badly.

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:41.080 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be good and I
couldn't figure out a way

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:41.880 align:middle line:90%
how to do it.

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So by being his
little sorcerer's apprentice,

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.405 align:middle line:90%
you were being a good girl.

00:15:45.405 --> 00:15:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Yeah.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:47.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Now what happened on the
nights that you took children

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:52.290 align:middle line:90%
that were meant for the group?

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And what do you mean by there
were incentives and payoffs

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:56.610 align:middle line:90%
that occurred in this?

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:58.774 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: In these
cult groups, anytime

00:15:58.774 --> 00:16:00.690 align:middle line:84%
you do something that
benefits the cult group,

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:05.370 align:middle line:84%
there are kickbacks, financial
kickbacks, sexual kickbacks,

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:07.380 align:middle line:90%
status kickbacks, for example.

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And him procuring me
in the first place--

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:13.210 align:middle line:84%
I was in a role that the cult
group calls the "oracle."

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:15.210 align:middle line:84%
It's basically like a
direct channel from source

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:17.130 align:middle line:84%
consciousness and
we're essentially

00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:19.260 align:middle line:84%
raised to become what they
call the "Pythia," which

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.830 align:middle line:84%
is the top female position
within a cult group.

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:24.180 align:middle line:90%
And that's a very large group.

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:25.256 align:middle line:90%
It's not rural.

00:16:25.256 --> 00:16:26.880 align:middle line:84%
It's intended to
basically be handed up

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:27.720 align:middle line:90%
all the way to the top.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:28.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The top
of the government--

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:29.925 align:middle line:90%
the top of the governments.

00:16:29.925 --> 00:16:30.724 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Yeah.

00:16:30.724 --> 00:16:31.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:34.030 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: So that's their goal.

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:36.030 align:middle line:84%
Their goal is to raise
one of these oracles

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:39.780 align:middle line:84%
to become the Pythia and that
pipeline gives anybody downwind

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:41.340 align:middle line:90%
a hell of a lot of kickbacks.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:44.620 align:middle line:84%
So within the group, he's
what they call a "tracker."

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:48.540 align:middle line:84%
A tracker is in charge of making
sure that nobody ever finds out

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:50.175 align:middle line:90%
what this cult group is doing.

00:16:50.175 --> 00:16:52.050 align:middle line:84%
So they're the ones that
clean up the scenes,

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:53.490 align:middle line:84%
find out where to
put the scenes,

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:56.160 align:middle line:84%
find out how to dispose of
bodies, track people who

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.310 align:middle line:84%
have been defected,
basically, these people who've

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:02.130 align:middle line:84%
run away-- they make it not
happen so nobody finds out.

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:03.300 align:middle line:90%
That's a tracker.

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:06.780 align:middle line:84%
It's a lower standing
role within this group,

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:09.510 align:middle line:84%
lower status, than what
they call the "keeper."

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:12.450 align:middle line:84%
A keeper is a role where
somebody is caretaking,

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:14.250 align:middle line:84%
completely responsible
for, and owning--

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:16.770 align:middle line:90%
kind of like a zookeeper--

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:19.094 align:middle line:84%
a younger being of
a higher status.

00:17:19.094 --> 00:17:20.760 align:middle line:84%
It would be like
taking care of a prince

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.290 align:middle line:84%
or a princess would
be the closest

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:24.060 align:middle line:90%
type of explanation for that.

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:25.480 align:middle line:84%
As a result of
finding me, he was

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.180 align:middle line:84%
elevated from the role
of tracker to keeper

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:31.290 align:middle line:84%
or another word for
keeper is "handler."

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this works
similarly in other circles,

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:38.490 align:middle line:84%
but I would guess it's
because each of those circles

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:42.600 align:middle line:84%
has a similar goal to create
the same kind of creature

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.310 align:middle line:84%
at the top because
"handler" keeps coming up,

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:47.640 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the political
community doing this.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:50.580 align:middle line:84%
As in Cathy O'Brien's
case and whatnot,

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:53.160 align:middle line:84%
it always comes back to
the keeper and the handler.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And this person usually
stays with the young subject

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.060 align:middle line:90%
for a long time.

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:58.330 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Oh, yeah.

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:02.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about after these forays

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:05.490 align:middle line:84%
and let's say that, OK, they've
delivered a kid to the group

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:06.660 align:middle line:90%
for those sacrifices.

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying they
were doing child sacrifices

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.440 align:middle line:90%
at that time as a group.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:16.890 align:middle line:84%
What are they hoping
to obtain in doing this

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:19.440 align:middle line:90%
on the psychospiritual level?

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:22.075 align:middle line:84%
Explain to us what they think
they're getting out of this.

00:18:22.075 --> 00:18:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: What they
think they're getting

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:26.100 align:middle line:84%
is that whoever the
sacrifice is done in favor of

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:30.450 align:middle line:84%
is absorbing all of the vital
force of the sacrificed victim.

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it is the
innocence of children.

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.455 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Essentially.

00:18:34.455 --> 00:18:35.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:36.470 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:39.680 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
rest of-- you were young.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:40.530 align:middle line:90%
He was tracking you.

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:41.330 align:middle line:90%
He's your handler.

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:44.270 align:middle line:84%
You're going and you're helping
procure the children for this.

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:47.240 align:middle line:84%
But let's go into more
how you were worked with,

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:50.047 align:middle line:90%
how you became--

00:18:50.047 --> 00:18:52.130 align:middle line:84%
what ultimately ended up
happening with you, which

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:54.050 align:middle line:90%
was highly self-destructive.

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:55.640 align:middle line:90%
There's a good reason for it.

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.850 align:middle line:84%
So what was the training
of you like, aside

00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:01.640 align:middle line:90%
from these forays in the night?

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.310 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: Well, very ritualized
programming sessions

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.380 align:middle line:84%
over and over and over
and over and over.

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:09.140 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if he was
trying to do perpetrator bonding

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:11.480 align:middle line:84%
programs, he would
sit me somewhere,

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:14.210 align:middle line:84%
like in the cave
overnight, leave

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:17.810 align:middle line:84%
me there totally
terrorized, traumatized,

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:20.030 align:middle line:84%
and then he would
come in as the savior.

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:22.520 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the most
basic ways of programming.

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.800 align:middle line:84%
You create a
situation of distress

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:26.800 align:middle line:84%
that you then come in
as the rescuer for.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And even though it creates some
kind of cognitive dissonance

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:34.280 align:middle line:84%
for the victim, basically,
you bond to that person

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:35.847 align:middle line:90%
like they're your life.

00:19:35.847 --> 00:19:36.680 align:middle line:90%
I can't describe it.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You understood he
was dropping you in that cave

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:39.920 align:middle line:90%
and how cruel that was?

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.662 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: Sometimes, but he
always had an explanation.

00:19:42.662 --> 00:19:44.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What
would an explanation

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:46.670 align:middle line:84%
be for leaving a little
girl in a cave at night?

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:48.020 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: That there were demons
that were after me and that

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.410 align:middle line:90%
was the only place to hide me.

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:50.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And you're young enough
and you kind of buy it.

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:53.920 align:middle line:90%
But you actually--

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.128 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Oh, I bought it 100%.

00:19:55.128 --> 00:19:56.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:57.276 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: I had nothing.

00:19:57.276 --> 00:19:58.610 align:middle line:90%
This is the thing.

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:01.790 align:middle line:84%
Explaining to an adult
the perspective of a child

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:03.260 align:middle line:90%
is very, very hard.

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.582 align:middle line:84%
I had no other thing to
believe, nothing else.

00:20:05.582 --> 00:20:07.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
you had no one else

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.990 align:middle line:84%
you were in resonance
with, right?

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:11.749 align:middle line:84%
So this is the only person you
really had a relationship with.

00:20:11.749 --> 00:20:13.290 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: Nobody sits
you down as a kid

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:14.330 align:middle line:84%
and is like, oh,
by the way, there

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:16.340 align:middle line:84%
are these people who do these
kinds of things to children.

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:18.980 align:middle line:84%
It's just like, not only
does this explain everything,

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:20.780 align:middle line:84%
which they do a
very, very good job

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:23.690 align:middle line:84%
of making things fit
in with your reality,

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:24.710 align:middle line:90%
it's distorted reality.

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:27.470 align:middle line:84%
They pick truths to
back up these lies.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:30.740 align:middle line:84%
So not only did that make sense,
what it really comes down to is

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:36.370 align:middle line:84%
I have no other reason that
this would be happening.

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:37.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this
must be the truth.

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:39.350 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: Yeah, you
just swallow it.

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:40.766 align:middle line:84%
You swallow it,
especially the bit

00:20:40.766 --> 00:20:43.160 align:middle line:84%
that it's your fault because
that is the only control you

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.660 align:middle line:90%
have over anything.

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:47.180 align:middle line:84%
It is a level of powerlessness
that most people on Earth

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:47.980 align:middle line:90%
will never touch.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.557 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, mm-mm.

00:20:49.557 --> 00:20:51.140 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: So it was
like, you know what?

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:51.500 align:middle line:90%
Fine.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:52.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Somehow,
you deserved it.

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:53.440 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Exactly.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And if I deserve it, then maybe
I can do something about it.

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:57.738 align:middle line:84%
If I deserve it, then I
had some power over it.

00:20:57.738 --> 00:21:00.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm not just a victim who's
completely out of control.

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:02.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they did creepy
hypnotherapy sessions with you?

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:05.120 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: Oh, yeah,
constantly, under ketamine.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Under ketamine--
talk about that.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.000 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: OK.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.887 align:middle line:84%
So being in the
profession that he's in

00:21:09.887 --> 00:21:11.720 align:middle line:84%
and some other people
in this group are in--

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:12.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They had
access to ketamine.

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:13.730 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Access to ketamine and--

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:14.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Explain
what ketamine is--

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.950 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Dormitor and Xylazine--

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:17.600 align:middle line:90%
it's basically synthetic heroin.

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:20.270 align:middle line:84%
But it makes it so
that you're in a state

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:23.760 align:middle line:90%
of unconscious impression.

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:26.600 align:middle line:84%
So you can implant
programs, behaviors,

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.160 align:middle line:84%
way deeper into the
subconscious mind

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:31.130 align:middle line:84%
when you're under the influence
of these types of medications.

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:34.220 align:middle line:84%
It also in my teen
years helped to subdue

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:38.220 align:middle line:84%
what they call the
breakthrough effects of trauma.

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:40.550 align:middle line:84%
So when you're trying
to program a person,

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:42.620 align:middle line:84%
there are all
these layers to it.

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:47.540 align:middle line:84%
But naturally, a program system
has to be done through trauma

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:49.650 align:middle line:90%
and trauma creates distress.

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:51.110 align:middle line:84%
So you get
breakthrough symptoms.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:54.080 align:middle line:84%
You get symptoms like
rashes, constantly going

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:57.380 align:middle line:84%
into the doctor's
office for infections--

00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:01.040 align:middle line:84%
you get anxiety attacks
and things like that.

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:04.144 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you are easily
programmable under trauma,

00:22:04.144 --> 00:22:05.060 align:middle line:90%
the effects of trauma.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:05.861 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: 100%.

00:22:05.861 --> 00:22:06.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:08.330 align:middle line:84%
So ketamine-- so what
were these creepy

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:09.500 align:middle line:90%
hypnotherapy sessions like?

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:11.540 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: Well, it depended
on the time again.

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:16.100 align:middle line:84%
There was a cult trainer who
was actually separate from Doc.

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:19.550 align:middle line:84%
So the cult trainer is
basically a scientist

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:22.310 align:middle line:84%
and his whole entire
job is, how do I

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:23.900 align:middle line:90%
program a certain behavior?

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:25.830 align:middle line:84%
Programming is very
easy to understand.

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:27.680 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing more than training.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:31.430 align:middle line:84%
It's I inflict this stimulus
and I want this response.

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And there's a billion
different ways

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.330 align:middle line:84%
that each trainer
goes about doing that.

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And literally, with the
psychologist and the trainers,

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:39.530 align:middle line:84%
it is a cat and
mouse game to try

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:43.130 align:middle line:84%
to figure out how to
deprogram and how to program.

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:43.960 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a science.

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:45.860 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Oh, yeah.

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:47.276 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we've
heard about it

00:22:47.276 --> 00:22:49.130 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of the
conspiracy shows having

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:51.860 align:middle line:84%
to do with some of the people
that were very effective at it

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:54.080 align:middle line:84%
coming over from Germany
post-World War II

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.960 align:middle line:84%
and sharing those technologies
with our intelligence community

00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:58.760 align:middle line:90%
and beyond.

00:22:58.760 --> 00:22:59.564 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hm.

00:22:59.564 --> 00:23:00.980 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: So let's
say that you want

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:03.620 align:middle line:84%
to implant in a child--
this is me at 12 years

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:05.120 align:middle line:84%
old-- you want to
implant in a child

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:09.140 align:middle line:84%
or deeper implant the
concept of a split identity.

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:11.420 align:middle line:84%
One of the foundations of
creating a program system

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:13.520 align:middle line:84%
within a human is you
have to create splits

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.014 align:middle line:90%
within the personality spectrum.

00:23:15.014 --> 00:23:16.430 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, there's
too much weight

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:18.080 align:middle line:90%
on a singular personality.

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:19.576 align:middle line:90%
It can't hold.

00:23:19.576 --> 00:23:21.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
why, that personality

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.090 align:middle line:90%
will become dominant over time?

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:24.910 align:middle line:10%
>>TEAL: No, it
will break through.

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:25.910 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Break through?

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:28.040 align:middle line:10%
>>TEAL: You need
compartments in order

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:32.360 align:middle line:10%
to inflict this much trauma on
a person and this much training.

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.520 align:middle line:84%
So if you had one
personality and I

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.310 align:middle line:84%
was damaging that
personality, the likelihood

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:40.220 align:middle line:84%
of you being able to
succeed is slim to nothing.

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:42.549 align:middle line:84%
But if I create a split
in your personality

00:23:42.549 --> 00:23:44.090 align:middle line:84%
and this one is the
one that's taking

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:46.700 align:middle line:84%
all the trauma and this one is
just programmed for success--

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:47.908 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And reinforcement--

00:23:47.908 --> 00:23:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: I can make
you just switch.

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:54.350 align:middle line:84%
So basically, it's synthetically
creating multiple personality

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:55.506 align:middle line:90%
disorder.

00:23:55.506 --> 00:23:57.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you say,
switching from trauma,

00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:58.970 align:middle line:84%
we heard some of
what the trauma was.

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:00.530 align:middle line:84%
But what was the
offsetting part?

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:02.420 align:middle line:84%
What was the
successful part of you

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:04.760 align:middle line:84%
that was being created that
made you feel empowered?

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.339 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: Well, for example, so
those were actually more fun--

00:24:07.339 --> 00:24:08.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure, I would guess--

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:11.540 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: Situations
where they set up a goal

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:12.870 align:middle line:90%
and the goal gets a reward.

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:14.960 align:middle line:84%
But this time, if they're
doing "gold program"

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.760 align:middle line:84%
and they call it, you're
going to make the goal.

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And when you make that goal,
you get huge rewards for it.

00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:21.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
would be a goal

00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:23.300 align:middle line:84%
and what would be a reward,
just to give us an idea?

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: Like an
obstacle course--

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:25.900 align:middle line:84%
it could be something
very, very simple.

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.024 align:middle line:84%
They don't usually make
those very, very elaborate.

00:24:28.024 --> 00:24:30.020 align:middle line:84%
So they set up an
obstacle course

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:31.490 align:middle line:84%
and getting to the
end of it means

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:33.950 align:middle line:84%
that you get a certain candy
after you've been starved

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:35.414 align:middle line:90%
for a certain amount of time.

00:24:35.414 --> 00:24:36.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's
extra rewarding.

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:38.240 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Yeah.

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:41.080 align:middle line:84%
So you go through
it and when you win,

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:44.040 align:middle line:84%
they'll flash the color
gold in front of your face.

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.920 align:middle line:84%
So you're basically
forming a connection

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:49.100 align:middle line:84%
between the color gold and
success and that feeling.

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And they even get you to
anchor it into all your cells

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:53.390 align:middle line:90%
and feel it.

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And so they do this multiple
times so that they can actually

00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:00.470 align:middle line:84%
create a correlation between
the color gold and that feeling

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:01.640 align:middle line:90%
sensation.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And then they cut
it off and they'll

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:06.530 align:middle line:84%
start to program an
actual personality of it.

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:08.280 align:middle line:84%
So they'll inject
you with ketamine

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:10.250 align:middle line:84%
and then say,
while you're under,

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:11.630 align:middle line:90%
you're a very successful person.

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:12.796 align:middle line:90%
What do you do for a living?

00:25:12.796 --> 00:25:14.480 align:middle line:84%
If you can't answer,
they'll tell you.

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:14.810 align:middle line:90%
They actually--

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:15.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do they
give you a name,

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:17.690 align:middle line:84%
like a whole separate
legend, so to speak?

00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:22.737 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: It depends on how
much influence the surrounding

00:25:22.737 --> 00:25:24.320 align:middle line:84%
community is going
to have on a person

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:27.530 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't benefit
them to have somebody who's,

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:30.170 align:middle line:84%
let's say, really
involved in school saying,

00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:32.600 align:middle line:90%
oh, now I'm no longer Mary.

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jane.

00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:35.160 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't benefit them.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:38.840 align:middle line:84%
So it depends on
the amount of access

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:42.200 align:middle line:84%
a person has to
mainstream society

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.220 align:middle line:84%
or how surrounded they
are by just cult members

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:46.220 align:middle line:84%
whether they will program
actual names or not.

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:46.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:48.140 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: And sometimes
they'll program names

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:49.350 align:middle line:90%
and keep them secret.

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:50.164 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:25:50.164 --> 00:25:51.830 align:middle line:84%
But only the handler
would use that name

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:52.950 align:middle line:90%
for a particular task?

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:53.750 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Exactly.

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:56.510 align:middle line:84%
But this is why they use
color programming so often.

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:57.927 align:middle line:84%
So basically, a
cult trainer knows

00:25:57.927 --> 00:25:59.635 align:middle line:84%
that if they come up
to you and they say,

00:25:59.635 --> 00:26:01.250 align:middle line:84%
here's a gold
necklace, it'll trigger

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:02.774 align:middle line:90%
all of it plus the personality.

00:26:02.774 --> 00:26:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is is they'll
cut that personality off

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:06.270 align:middle line:90%
from the trauma.

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:08.810 align:middle line:84%
So if you talk to a person
who's in a gold program,

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:10.970 align:middle line:84%
they won't have any
memory of their childhood.

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:12.770 align:middle line:84%
They will have no
memory of the trauma.

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:15.050 align:middle line:84%
They only see themselves as
a super successful person

00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:17.540 align:middle line:84%
who always has been successful
and failure doesn't exist.

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:19.456 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So is this a
part of the personality

00:26:19.456 --> 00:26:21.680 align:middle line:84%
that they would then,
had you gone all the way

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.480 align:middle line:84%
through the system,
send out into the world

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.490 align:middle line:84%
as the upstanding
citizen charismatic?

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:26.420 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Yes.

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:28.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
the successful part.

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:28.580 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Yes.

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:29.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:32.250 align:middle line:84%
So this is a very
long-term program.

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:33.050 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Oh, yeah.

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:34.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is a
lifetime of training

00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:36.890 align:middle line:84%
until you reach adult
years, pretty much, right?

00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:39.348 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: Even past them because
you need to keep reinforcing

00:26:39.348 --> 00:26:40.880 align:middle line:90%
certain programs--

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.520 align:middle line:84%
but you can set up a program
system within a human

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.319 align:middle line:84%
so that it is self-triggering
and that's really

00:26:46.319 --> 00:26:47.360 align:middle line:90%
what they want to go for.

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.943 align:middle line:84%
What they want to
go for is without me

00:26:48.943 --> 00:26:51.110 align:middle line:84%
having to-- let's say
that I was a trainer

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:52.490 align:middle line:90%
and you were a subject.

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:54.410 align:middle line:84%
My goal with you from
day one is to set up

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:56.220 align:middle line:84%
enough triggers in you that I
don't even need to be there.

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.056 align:middle line:84%
You're triggering
yourself just by virtue

00:26:58.056 --> 00:26:59.930 align:middle line:84%
of being around people,
hearing certain words

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:01.250 align:middle line:84%
that you're inevitably
going to hear--

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:02.875 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Seeing gold
necklaces, right?

00:27:02.875 --> 00:27:04.416 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: You're going
to be triggered.

00:27:04.416 --> 00:27:05.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:08.670 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: Now, this is where the
cult trainers really get off

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:12.470 align:middle line:84%
because really, these people, no
humanity, no empathy, nothing--

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:15.560 align:middle line:84%
it's really a game
because I also

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:19.280 align:middle line:84%
don't want you getting triggered
negatively in situations where

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:20.930 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't benefit me.

00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:23.330 align:middle line:84%
So do you see how
complicated this gets?

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:25.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes,
incredibly complex,

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:29.000 align:middle line:84%
a very ugly and dangerous
game but incredibly

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.600 align:middle line:84%
complex and clever
at the same time.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:32.400 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.170 align:middle line:90%
So now your parents--

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:36.530 align:middle line:84%
they must have seen
some changes in you.

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:40.010 align:middle line:84%
Or did they just think you were
so weird anyway that it just

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:41.120 align:middle line:90%
went unnoticed?

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.640 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: I think it's
a little bit of both.

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:48.150 align:middle line:84%
I was so weird, anyway
and so unhappy, anyway.

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:50.660 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, they saw me take
a serious sharp decline.

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:52.700 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of times
when I would come home,

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:54.170 align:middle line:84%
they had a
relationship with Doc.

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:56.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did they know you
were being taken at night?

00:27:56.170 --> 00:27:56.685 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: No.

00:27:56.685 --> 00:27:57.485 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:27:57.485 --> 00:27:59.060 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't by
their permission?

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:00.640 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: No.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.390 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it was not
until two years later

00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:04.176 align:middle line:84%
that it was with
their permission.

00:28:04.176 --> 00:28:06.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They ultimately
did get permission?

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:06.560 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Yeah.

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
did they think they

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:09.230 align:middle line:90%
were giving permission for?

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:13.069 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: Horseback riding lessons
and sort of mentor relationship

00:28:13.069 --> 00:28:14.360 align:middle line:90%
with somebody who loved horses.

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:15.999 align:middle line:84%
I was a horse
freak so of course,

00:28:15.999 --> 00:28:18.290 align:middle line:84%
my parents were like, let's
get her around horses then.

00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:19.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Maybe
that'll make her happy.

00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:19.970 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Yes.

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:20.675 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:20.675 --> 00:28:22.460 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: So we've got this
guy that's like, look,

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:23.260 align:middle line:90%
I can take her.

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:24.940 align:middle line:90%
I can show her everything.

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:25.940 align:middle line:90%
And so they're like, OK.

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So then
the obvious question

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:30.720 align:middle line:84%
becomes, did you tell your
parents what was happening?

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:31.520 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Hell no.

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:33.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because they weren't
going to listen, anyway

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:34.460 align:middle line:84%
or because you
didn't trust them?

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:35.510 align:middle line:90%
You only trusted him?

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:35.750 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: No.

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:37.627 align:middle line:84%
It's because what
they tell you they're

00:28:37.627 --> 00:28:38.960 align:middle line:90%
going to do if you say anything.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I
see, the threats.

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:40.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:41.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, that
makes more sense.

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:42.610 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:45.620 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: But this is
what people have to get.

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:48.690 align:middle line:84%
It's bad enough and it
usually will shut somebody up

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:51.260 align:middle line:84%
If the threats are
just unsubstantial.

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:53.559 align:middle line:84%
But what these
people do is they'll

00:28:53.559 --> 00:28:55.100 align:middle line:84%
kill animals in
front of you and say,

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:56.721 align:middle line:84%
this is going to
be your brother.

00:28:56.721 --> 00:28:58.220 align:middle line:84%
Or they'll do what
they did with me,

00:28:58.220 --> 00:28:59.660 align:middle line:84%
which is to inject
me with ketamine

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:01.993 align:middle line:84%
and actually walk me through
a visualization of each one

00:29:01.993 --> 00:29:03.590 align:middle line:84%
of my family
members being killed

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:05.000 align:middle line:90%
as a result of me talking.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that was part
of the hypnosis process.

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:07.070 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Yeah.

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:09.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there's a
huge incentive not to talk.

00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:10.190 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:13.550 align:middle line:90%
So now you started drawing.

00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:20.930 align:middle line:10%
You had a very interesting
kind of life journal-wise,

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:23.390 align:middle line:10%
in terms of a language
you developed-- also

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:25.520 align:middle line:10%
the imagery and the artistry.

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.340 align:middle line:10%
But one of the things
that was interesting

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:31.730 align:middle line:10%
was you started drawing
these beings that

00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:35.540 align:middle line:10%
had the kind of vertical
pupil that looked,

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:37.460 align:middle line:10%
as people in this
community would say,

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.380 align:middle line:10%
almost reptilian in nature.

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:42.200 align:middle line:84%
What were those, why did you
draw those, what did you see,

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:45.710 align:middle line:84%
and did you ever see any of
that with your inside eyes

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:48.020 align:middle line:84%
when you were at some of
these satanic gatherings?

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:49.670 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about this.

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:51.470 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Oh, I saw all of them.

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:54.400 align:middle line:84%
See, it's like a
like attracts like.

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.144 align:middle line:84%
So some of these
beings which humans

00:29:56.144 --> 00:29:57.560 align:middle line:84%
have been calling
demons or things

00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:59.406 align:middle line:84%
like that, they are
at these rituals.

00:29:59.406 --> 00:30:00.530 align:middle line:90%
They're all over the place.

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:01.580 align:middle line:84%
They're feeding
off of the energy

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:02.996 align:middle line:84%
fields of a lot
of people that are

00:30:02.996 --> 00:30:05.420 align:middle line:84%
in those types of situations
and I was seeing all of it

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:05.810 align:middle line:90%
as a child.

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:07.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were
seeing the unseen realm

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:09.350 align:middle line:90%
beings and the human realms?

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:11.270 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever see those
same eyes reflected

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:13.040 align:middle line:84%
in the human realm,
where it was almost

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.200 align:middle line:90%
like a shapeshifting thing?

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:15.200 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Yes.

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:18.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So both
humans and demons--

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:21.280 align:middle line:90%
beings from other lower realms.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:23.950 align:middle line:10%
And so you were documenting
this in your journal

00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:24.920 align:middle line:10%
via your artwork.

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:25.720 align:middle line:10%
>>TEAL: Yes.

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.050 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:30.020 align:middle line:84%
What were you also attempting
to do in your journals

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:34.340 align:middle line:84%
at this time because you were
in so much conflict and pain?

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:36.597 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: I was trying to
find some kind of outlet

00:30:36.597 --> 00:30:38.680 align:middle line:84%
because it's just like the
amount of pressure that

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.670 align:middle line:90%
was on my system was too much.

00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted a way
to record, also.

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:43.635 align:middle line:84%
I did it in a
different language,

00:30:43.635 --> 00:30:46.220 align:middle line:84%
but I wanted a way to record
what was happening in a way

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:49.430 align:middle line:84%
that my parents wouldn't
be able to read it.

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:52.304 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This language you
created is symbolic in nature.

00:30:52.304 --> 00:30:54.470 align:middle line:84%
It looks like it could have
come from another planet

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:55.610 align:middle line:90%
or anywhere, really.

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:58.486 align:middle line:84%
So tell us a little bit about
the language you constructed.

00:30:58.486 --> 00:31:00.110 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: Well, it is
channeled, in fact.

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:01.610 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like I
sat there and was

00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:03.770 align:middle line:84%
like, this is going to be A
and this is going to be B. It

00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:04.790 align:middle line:90%
was like a channeled language.

00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:06.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A symbolic language--

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:06.980 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Yeah.

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:07.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And so where did you download
this from, you believe?

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:11.910 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Arcturus.

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:12.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And so if the
Arcturans were there,

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:17.960 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about their
perspective in watching over

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:22.200 align:middle line:84%
you and what was going on
and why this was going on.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.000 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: OK.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, basically, before
coming into this life,

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:27.004 align:middle line:84%
I intended to go
into the darkest

00:31:27.004 --> 00:31:29.420 align:middle line:84%
of the darkest of the darkest
of the deepest of the lowest

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:31.540 align:middle line:84%
types of vibrations that
you can find on the planet.

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:33.498 align:middle line:84%
Let's call it "the darkest
of the human shadow"

00:31:33.498 --> 00:31:36.984 align:middle line:84%
because my life soul imprint
purpose is integration.

00:31:36.984 --> 00:31:38.900 align:middle line:84%
I want to bridge the gap
between that and this

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:41.690 align:middle line:84%
because we as people, we
love to look at these lower

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:43.910 align:middle line:84%
vibrational fields and
say, that's not me.

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:46.910 align:middle line:84%
So we look at a serial killer
and say, that's not me.

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it is because
oneness is the ultimate truth

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:50.690 align:middle line:90%
of this universe.

00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:52.970 align:middle line:84%
There is not a single
thing that is not you.

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:56.420 align:middle line:84%
So it is the integration
of the demon that makes it

00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:58.310 align:middle line:84%
so the demon no longer
acts out in the way

00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:59.450 align:middle line:90%
that it is acting out.

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:01.250 align:middle line:84%
It's the integration
of the war in me

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:03.110 align:middle line:90%
that causes war to dissipate.

00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:06.482 align:middle line:84%
It is basically the
ultimate definition

00:32:06.482 --> 00:32:07.940 align:middle line:84%
of love, which is
to take something

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:11.840 align:middle line:84%
as thyself, which reunites the
fragmented aspects of source

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:12.724 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:32:12.724 --> 00:32:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you had a
contract before birth--

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:14.960 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: I did--

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To go into
the darkest of the dark

00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:19.130 align:middle line:84%
and the Arcturans
are your guides?

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Or is that also a place
that perhaps you've

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.440 align:middle line:84%
been or visited
and lived in before

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:26.810 align:middle line:84%
and you chose to come
into the Earth existence

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:27.620 align:middle line:90%
for this purpose?

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:28.530 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Yes.

00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:29.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:31.080 align:middle line:84%
So they continued
guiding you, right?

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:31.880 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Yes.

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:33.650 align:middle line:84%
But also, I was actually
talking about this

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:35.025 align:middle line:84%
because what's
really interesting

00:32:35.025 --> 00:32:38.330 align:middle line:84%
is people assume, oh, that's
why Teal survived is because she

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:40.890 align:middle line:84%
had all this access to these
guides that were helping her

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:41.690 align:middle line:90%
the whole time.

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:42.630 align:middle line:90%
But this is the thing.

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:43.430 align:middle line:90%
It actually--

00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:44.638 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They put you in it.

00:32:44.638 --> 00:32:45.610 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Yeah.

00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:46.820 align:middle line:90%
It made it worse.

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:51.050 align:middle line:84%
I actually still kind of
have to honestly get over

00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:53.654 align:middle line:84%
a lot of this I call it
the "spirit guide trauma."

00:32:53.654 --> 00:32:55.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
they abandoned you.

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:55.345 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Yeah.

00:32:55.345 --> 00:32:57.553 align:middle line:84%
Or oftentimes, I'd be standing
there getting tortured

00:32:57.553 --> 00:33:01.914 align:middle line:84%
and they're just like, I
reach out to try to grab them

00:33:01.914 --> 00:33:03.080 align:middle line:90%
and there's nothing to grab.

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And I realized reviewing
my own soul contracts

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:08.420 align:middle line:84%
much later that it was
an agreement we made.

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:11.270 align:middle line:84%
No matter how deep I get,
no matter how dark I go,

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:13.790 align:middle line:84%
I have to understand what
it means to have no help.

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:14.960 align:middle line:90%
I mean nothing.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:18.477 align:middle line:84%
So I had told them to do
that, but I did forget that.

00:33:18.477 --> 00:33:20.810 align:middle line:84%
So basically going through
it and having your own spirit

00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:23.000 align:middle line:84%
guides stare at you while
you're getting tortured

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000 align:middle line:84%
is like now I've
got bystander trauma

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.250 align:middle line:90%
relative to my own guides.

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:27.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:28.450 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:29.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:31.820 align:middle line:84%
That sucks when even your
guides don't feel like they're

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:32.900 align:middle line:90%
coming through for you.

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:36.050 align:middle line:84%
So now you're a beautiful
young girl and turning

00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:37.370 align:middle line:90%
into a beautiful young lady.

00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:39.790 align:middle line:84%
Were there ever sexual
connotations in all this

00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:41.320 align:middle line:90%
and any sexual abuse in it?

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.760 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: Usually,
I was prostituted

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:44.850 align:middle line:84%
to men out of outdoor
gas station bathrooms.

00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:45.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about that
and what age you were.

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:49.640 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: I started at age eight.

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:54.350 align:middle line:84%
He would take out the stack
of Polaroid photographs

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:59.600 align:middle line:84%
and I would watch him walk
across the little parking lot.

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.100 align:middle line:84%
Wendover was a
really common place

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:03.751 align:middle line:84%
where we were, this
little gambling town.

00:34:03.751 --> 00:34:04.750 align:middle line:90%
Somebody would meet him.

00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:06.980 align:middle line:84%
I would have no idea how they
would arrange the meeting

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:07.510 align:middle line:90%
because I wasn't part of that.

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:09.093 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What was
on the photographs?

00:34:09.093 --> 00:34:12.830 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: It was just pictures
of me in different poses.

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them
were sadomasochistic.

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:16.940 align:middle line:84%
So he'd take photographs
in a basement of me

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:20.239 align:middle line:84%
with a wife beater that
was torn with animal blood.

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:21.889 align:middle line:84%
So he would take
them over, hand them

00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:24.409 align:middle line:84%
to whatever guy had
come that night,

00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:26.022 align:middle line:84%
and then the guy
would look through it

00:34:26.022 --> 00:34:27.980 align:middle line:84%
and then they would
basically make an agreement

00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:33.139 align:middle line:84%
upon how much money they would
pay him for what act of mine.

00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And then he would take me
either into the motel room

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:39.130 align:middle line:84%
or into these bathrooms
and have their way.

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that went
on for years, I take it.

00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:41.590 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Yeah.

00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:43.350 align:middle line:84%
It started to shift
when I was about 12,

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:49.159 align:middle line:84%
13 because these men who were
paying insane amounts of money

00:34:49.159 --> 00:34:51.380 align:middle line:84%
to have sex with a
child, they're not

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:53.600 align:middle line:90%
really interested in a woman.

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:57.410 align:middle line:84%
So when I started
transitioning from kid to teen,

00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:59.530 align:middle line:84%
it was not the same
demographic of interest.

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And so it was at that point
that the group in general

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:05.720 align:middle line:84%
started to shift their
attitude towards maybe

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:07.550 align:middle line:90%
we should put her into modeling.

00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:09.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This was almost
exclusively, I assume,

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:10.540 align:middle line:90%
male clientele.

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:11.340 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Yeah.

00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:13.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And were
many of them sadists?

00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:14.960 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Oh, yeah.

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there was a danger
to you during all of this,

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:17.940 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:18.230 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Oh, yeah.

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:19.775 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them were
into asphyxiation.

00:35:19.775 --> 00:35:21.650 align:middle line:84%
I actually liked those
clients, to be honest.

00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds really horrific
because I would almost die.

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:28.532 align:middle line:84%
There's a panic when
somebody is suffocating you.

00:35:28.532 --> 00:35:30.990 align:middle line:84%
There's an absolute terror that
you can't actually control.

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:32.360 align:middle line:90%
It's just visceral.

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:34.460 align:middle line:84%
But right after that panic,
it's like the closest

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:36.085 align:middle line:84%
you can get to being
out of everything.

00:35:36.085 --> 00:35:37.190 align:middle line:90%
It was freedom.

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:40.710 align:middle line:84%
I guess in that whole
twisted scene you were in,

00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:42.980 align:middle line:84%
it would feel like an
escape of some kind.

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:45.401 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: I really
wanted it to happen.

00:35:45.401 --> 00:35:46.400 align:middle line:90%
It's that level of pain.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.600 align:middle line:84%
It's the kind of pain where
when you're a little child

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:50.150 align:middle line:84%
and there's a man so
heavy on top of you

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:51.570 align:middle line:84%
that it feels like he's
going to break your bones,

00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:54.069 align:middle line:84%
there's a point that you wish
you're going to break in half,

00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:56.399 align:middle line:84%
that the torture becomes that
your body isn't breaking.

00:35:56.399 --> 00:35:58.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So was this
also part of breaking

00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:59.634 align:middle line:90%
your psyche, the prostitution?

00:35:59.634 --> 00:36:01.550 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there's some money
to gain on their part

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:03.110 align:middle line:90%
and there's more trauma for you.

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:05.744 align:middle line:84%
Is this a traditional part
of the training and splitting

00:36:05.744 --> 00:36:07.160 align:middle line:84%
of the psyche
further and further?

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:08.750 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: "Kitten
programming," they call it.

00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:09.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: "Kitten?"

00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:10.260 align:middle line:90%
What's that mean?

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:12.510 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: Well, it's either
kitten or siren programming.

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:14.940 align:middle line:84%
The siren programming is
trained to try to lure a man in

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:16.880 align:middle line:84%
and the kitten
programming is more

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:18.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to chase the guy.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:20.529 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of that was
kitten programming.

00:36:20.529 --> 00:36:22.070 align:middle line:84%
It's how you behave
and move sexually

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:24.740 align:middle line:84%
so you can completely manipulate
the way a person feels.

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you were taught
to manipulate them in that way.

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:28.640 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Oh, yeah.

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.199 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right--
well, because you

00:36:30.199 --> 00:36:31.990 align:middle line:84%
would need that training
for later in life.

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.280 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Yes.

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You need
that skill set.

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:35.630 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: Well, me
specifically in my role.

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:35.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.410 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: What they train
you depends on your role

00:36:37.410 --> 00:36:38.576 align:middle line:90%
that they've chosen you for.

00:36:38.576 --> 00:36:41.240 align:middle line:84%
The Pythia Is what they
call on the "light side."

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:42.830 align:middle line:84%
The light side of
these cult groups

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:45.500 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that know all the
goings-on of the entire cult

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:46.040 align:middle line:90%
group.

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:47.270 align:middle line:84%
On the dark side,
you're part of it

00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:48.686 align:middle line:84%
but you don't
actually know what's

00:36:48.686 --> 00:36:50.040 align:middle line:90%
going on at the higher levels.

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:52.850 align:middle line:84%
So I had to be raised with the
knowledge of every single one

00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:56.300 align:middle line:84%
of these behaviors, every
one of these let's call

00:36:56.300 --> 00:37:02.120 align:middle line:84%
them groups or roles
within this program.

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:05.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so now you're
not only writing in your diary.

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:09.380 align:middle line:84%
You have these demonic
images of these people

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:11.870 align:middle line:90%
with vertical pupils.

00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:13.919 align:middle line:84%
You've created a new
language, a code language

00:37:13.919 --> 00:37:14.960 align:middle line:90%
that you haven't created.

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:15.930 align:middle line:90%
It's been downloaded.

00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:17.765 align:middle line:84%
But from the looks
of it, other people

00:37:17.765 --> 00:37:19.700 align:middle line:84%
would say, what
the heck is that?

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:22.010 align:middle line:84%
So you're obviously
speaking in codes now.

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And now you start smearing
blood on the diaries.

00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:27.200 align:middle line:84%
At what point did
all of the self-harm

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:28.920 align:middle line:90%
start coming into play?

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:30.342 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: 11.

00:37:30.342 --> 00:37:34.190 align:middle line:84%
That was when it was really
permissible from the group

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:37.887 align:middle line:84%
itself for me to be doing that
to try to distract from them.

00:37:37.887 --> 00:37:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that it would look
like it was really all on you.

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:41.370 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Mm-hm.

00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:42.175 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:42.175 --> 00:37:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: And it has
to be a way for them

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:46.830 align:middle line:84%
to cover it up
because at that age,

00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:48.660 align:middle line:84%
one of the rules
of the oracle is

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:52.481 align:middle line:84%
that we get our blood
actually drunk by the groups.

00:37:52.481 --> 00:37:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was there
bloodletting where they ever

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.020 align:middle line:90%
drank your blood?

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:56.010 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Several times.

00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:56.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: It was like a common
occurrence throughout the year.

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's a cover to
have you cutting yourself.

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:01.470 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Yes.

00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:03.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you were
not afraid of sharp objects,

00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:04.320 align:middle line:90%
I'll say that.

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:07.690 align:middle line:84%
But again, I couldn't even
conceive of doing such a thing.

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:08.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm terrified of knives.

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:11.460 align:middle line:84%
But you had a
really big incentive

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:14.000 align:middle line:84%
and that was it would
at least end all of it.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:14.910 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Yeah.

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so a lot of
times because it's become such

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:22.950 align:middle line:84%
a phenomenon of your age group
and younger to cut themselves

00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:23.850 align:middle line:90%
now--

00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:25.900 align:middle line:84%
young girls of all
kinds, high school,

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:28.350 align:middle line:84%
junior high school girls
cutting themselves-- this

00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:30.750 align:middle line:84%
is something I think
that others don't really

00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:33.870 align:middle line:84%
understand what's going
on because the rest of us

00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:35.970 align:middle line:90%
are afraid of knives, for one.

00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, it seems
to be for almost effect.

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Other times, it's
to take one's life.

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:45.840 align:middle line:84%
So explain to us this
cutting phenomena in general.

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:46.640 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: OK.

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:48.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, the cutting
phenomenon in general

00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:51.560 align:middle line:84%
happens in an environment that
is invalidating, specifically

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:53.542 align:middle line:90%
relative to negative emotion.

00:38:53.542 --> 00:38:55.250 align:middle line:84%
So let's say that
you've got a young girl

00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:56.666 align:middle line:84%
and it's usually
the relationship,

00:38:56.666 --> 00:38:58.800 align:middle line:84%
to be honest, between
the girl and the mother.

00:38:58.800 --> 00:38:59.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:00.770 align:middle line:90%
More the mother than the father?

00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:01.430 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Much more.

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And how so?

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:02.790 align:middle line:90%
Explain that to us.

00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:05.280 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: Because well, either
the mother's being the enabler

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:10.080 align:middle line:84%
for a dysfunctional, sometimes
even sexual relationship--

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:11.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Incestuous
or otherwise, yeah.

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:14.126 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: The enabler causes
a hell of a lot of damage

00:39:14.126 --> 00:39:16.640 align:middle line:84%
because they're in
denial and it's denial

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:18.659 align:middle line:90%
that really causes cutting.

00:39:18.659 --> 00:39:20.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you go to
your mother and say,

00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:22.490 align:middle line:84%
this is what's happening
with my stepdad.

00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And the mother's like,
oh, don't talk about that

00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:28.190 align:middle line:84%
and you can't break through
to get her attention.

00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:29.336 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: That's one example.

00:39:29.336 --> 00:39:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Another example
is you don't have

00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:31.820 align:middle line:84%
any of that abuse
going on but you've

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:34.060 align:middle line:84%
got an incredibly invalidating
mother, the type of mother,

00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:35.720 align:middle line:84%
let's say, that they're
on the narcissist spectrum

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:37.677 align:middle line:84%
where it's like your
reality doesn't exist.

00:39:37.677 --> 00:39:39.260 align:middle line:84%
My reality is the
only one that exists

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:41.540 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have
the right to have

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:43.670 align:middle line:90%
an emotion that's not mine.

00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:46.550 align:middle line:84%
So whenever the child expresses
a negative emotion, especially

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:49.220 align:middle line:84%
relative to something
the mother is doing,

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.270 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't get validated.

00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:52.669 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't get
treated as reality.

00:39:52.669 --> 00:39:54.210 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
having somebody puke

00:39:54.210 --> 00:39:56.085 align:middle line:84%
and then having somebody
stuff the vomit back

00:39:56.085 --> 00:39:57.200 align:middle line:90%
down their throat.

00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:58.767 align:middle line:84%
So the cutting
becomes the only way

00:39:58.767 --> 00:40:00.350 align:middle line:84%
to try to show how
much pain you're in

00:40:00.350 --> 00:40:03.260 align:middle line:84%
and also to bleed yourself free
of the negative energy, which

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:04.160 align:middle line:90%
is the poison.

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:07.950 align:middle line:84%
It feels like poison
inside your body.

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:10.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It takes a
lot of courage, really

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:14.150 align:middle line:84%
kind of baseline courage, to
do that, though, doesn't it?

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:16.440 align:middle line:84%
Or does it just seem like
that to someone like me?

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:17.240 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: No.

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:20.900 align:middle line:84%
It's just that
the depths of pain

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:23.120 align:middle line:84%
that a human being
can get to are

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:25.610 align:middle line:84%
unfathomable for the
majority of people.

00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:27.230 align:middle line:84%
There are depths
of emotional pain

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:31.360 align:middle line:84%
where physical pain is
so much of a relief.

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:33.530 align:middle line:90%
And it's that.

00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why has it become
almost a cultural phenomenon

00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:38.919 align:middle line:90%
in certain ways at this time?

00:40:38.919 --> 00:40:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: I think it's
because children

00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:43.580 align:middle line:84%
are being born with more
and more and more need

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:46.490 align:middle line:84%
to actually be individuals,
to be themselves.

00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:49.730 align:middle line:84%
On just a purely
extrasensoral level,

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:51.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing these
children who are now

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:53.750 align:middle line:84%
incarnating with such
a clear vision for what

00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:55.280 align:middle line:90%
they want to create.

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And so if you have
an individualist born

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:02.180 align:middle line:84%
to this world who's like,
you can't make me go sideways

00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:05.750 align:middle line:84%
and yet society itself is
inherently invalidating,

00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:07.370 align:middle line:84%
especially of
emotion, you're going

00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:10.170 align:middle line:84%
to see a rise in all
of these symptoms.

00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:11.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:14.090 align:middle line:84%
So now let's talk
about what happened.

00:41:14.090 --> 00:41:19.160 align:middle line:84%
This program lasted 13
years, something like that.

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:22.010 align:middle line:84%
So you had to be now
in your late teens.

00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:22.910 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Yeah, 19.

00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:28.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: 19-- so let's talk
about how that program ended.

00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:29.017 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: OK.

00:41:29.017 --> 00:41:30.350 align:middle line:90%
Well, it wasn't supposed to end.

00:41:30.350 --> 00:41:31.975 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know it
wasn't supposed to.

00:41:31.975 --> 00:41:33.920 align:middle line:90%
So how did it end?

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: I was talking
about running away,

00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:37.670 align:middle line:90%
which is not permissible.

00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:39.140 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't talking
about that to the group.

00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:40.723 align:middle line:84%
I was talking about
that to my mother.

00:41:40.723 --> 00:41:43.454 align:middle line:84%
My mother didn't know that Doc
was part of this-- ended up

00:41:43.454 --> 00:41:45.620 align:middle line:84%
admitting to him that I was
talking about moving out

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:47.950 align:middle line:90%
of state and it infuriated him.

00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:49.700 align:middle line:84%
I was having so many
breakthrough symptoms

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:53.020 align:middle line:84%
at this point in my teen years,
multiple suicide attempts,

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:56.450 align:middle line:84%
that he'd given me a vial
of ketamine to administer

00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:58.860 align:middle line:84%
to my pulse points when I was
feeling too much of a panic

00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:00.094 align:middle line:90%
attack.

00:42:00.094 --> 00:42:01.760 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't really
accounting for the fact

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:05.600 align:middle line:84%
that that would increase my
capacity to deal with the drug.

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:07.490 align:middle line:90%
So he misdosed me.

00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:10.130 align:middle line:84%
He was planning a very
elaborate programming

00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:12.800 align:middle line:84%
session that would make
it so I couldn't leave

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:16.550 align:middle line:84%
but he miscalculated how much
it would take to put me under.

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:19.010 align:middle line:84%
When he injected me and put
me in the back of this van,

00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:21.860 align:middle line:84%
I didn't lose consciousness
like I should have done.

00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:23.337 align:middle line:84%
So I had no lapse
in consciousness.

00:42:23.337 --> 00:42:25.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what happened
once you were put in the van?

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:27.419 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: I was driven
up to southern Idaho.

00:42:27.419 --> 00:42:29.240 align:middle line:84%
He took me out of
the car and one

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:32.390 align:middle line:84%
of the people that is part
of this group is a mortician.

00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And this is part of how this
group disposes of bodies.

00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:40.570 align:middle line:90%
So oftentimes, they would use--

00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:43.040 align:middle line:84%
let's say they didn't
procure a subject.

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:45.890 align:middle line:84%
They would use somebody
who had died naturally

00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:49.191 align:middle line:84%
and was given to the
mortician's office.

00:42:49.191 --> 00:42:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
family would have

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:52.800 align:middle line:84%
no idea what would be
happening to their loved one,

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:54.508 align:middle line:84%
but this is what the
cult group would do.

00:42:54.508 --> 00:42:56.780 align:middle line:84%
They'd take the body and
do rituals with the body.

00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:59.660 align:middle line:84%
So he took me out to the
middle of these woods--

00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:01.250 align:middle line:90%
got me out of the truck.

00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:02.810 align:middle line:84%
I was stumbling
around, of course,

00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:04.790 align:middle line:84%
because I was drugged up but not
drugged up enough to not know

00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:05.720 align:middle line:90%
what's going on.

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:07.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What was
his intention that was

00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:08.299 align:middle line:90%
going to happen in the woods?

00:43:08.299 --> 00:43:09.590 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: This'll explain it all.

00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:11.590 align:middle line:84%
There was a body that was
out there in the woods

00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:12.867 align:middle line:90%
that he had put out there.

00:43:12.867 --> 00:43:15.200 align:middle line:84%
He took me by the back of my
neck, threw me on the floor

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:17.690 align:middle line:84%
as fast as he could, and he
said, look what you've done.

00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:20.660 align:middle line:84%
This is what happens when
I take my eyes off you.

00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:23.450 align:middle line:84%
So he was trying to convince
me that I had killed this man.

00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:25.700 align:middle line:84%
It was one of the worst
experiences I've ever

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:26.840 align:middle line:84%
had in my life because
I looked at him

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:29.256 align:middle line:84%
and it was like, this is the
first I ever thought, if this

00:43:29.256 --> 00:43:30.465 align:middle line:90%
is a lie, what else is a lie?

00:43:30.465 --> 00:43:31.264 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:43:31.264 --> 00:43:32.420 align:middle line:90%
Now you realize it's a lie.

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:34.430 align:middle line:90%
So now what happens?

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:36.080 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: It was instinctual.

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:39.500 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't very rational.

00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:42.380 align:middle line:84%
It's like the moment you
know you just have to run.

00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:45.269 align:middle line:84%
And I started thinking, OK,
I'm going to get in my car

00:43:45.269 --> 00:43:46.310 align:middle line:90%
and I'm going to go away.

00:43:46.310 --> 00:43:46.700 align:middle line:90%
No, you're not.

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:47.300 align:middle line:90%
You're going to stay.

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:48.940 align:middle line:84%
No, I'm going to get
in my car and go away.

00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:49.250 align:middle line:90%
No, you're not.

00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:50.330 align:middle line:90%
You're going to stay.

00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:52.640 align:middle line:84%
Dissociating-- coming
back to seeing him

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:55.421 align:middle line:84%
in a really jolly mood
burning this body back to I'm

00:43:55.421 --> 00:43:57.920 align:middle line:84%
going to run away, planning how
I'm going to get in the car.

00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And I did by the
end of the night.

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:01.907 align:middle line:84%
I got in the car,
super drugged up still,

00:44:01.907 --> 00:44:04.490 align:middle line:84%
and I drove all the way through
the night to the home of a man

00:44:04.490 --> 00:44:06.890 align:middle line:90%
that I had met only twice.

00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:09.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
was the end of it?

00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: I wish it
was the end of it.

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:12.697 align:middle line:90%
It was the last time I saw him.

00:44:12.697 --> 00:44:14.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it
wasn't the end of it?

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:15.080 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: No.

00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:16.494 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So what happened?

00:44:16.494 --> 00:44:17.910 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: I wasn't
actually planning

00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:19.118 align:middle line:90%
on running away running away.

00:44:19.118 --> 00:44:22.440 align:middle line:84%
I got there, flipped out,
cut the hell out of myself,

00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:25.120 align:middle line:90%
and planned to go back.

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:27.370 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I'm just going
to stay here for the night.

00:44:27.370 --> 00:44:29.000 align:middle line:84%
But one night turned
into two nights

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.250 align:middle line:84%
turned into three nights
turned into four nights.

00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:34.922 align:middle line:84%
And this guy was treating me so
well that I was like, I'm just

00:44:34.922 --> 00:44:35.880 align:middle line:90%
never going to go back.

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:36.810 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to ever go back.

00:44:36.810 --> 00:44:38.640 align:middle line:84%
I started developing real
panic about going back

00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:40.710 align:middle line:84%
because the reality is if
you do something like that,

00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:41.070 align:middle line:90%
oh my gosh--

00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:42.986 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're not
going to be well-received

00:44:42.986 --> 00:44:43.820 align:middle line:90%
at your homecoming.

00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:45.514 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: No.

00:44:45.514 --> 00:44:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And they're not going
to come after you.

00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:49.080 align:middle line:90%
That's what people don't get.

00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:51.480 align:middle line:84%
They only kill people that
are enough of a liability

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:54.114 align:middle line:90%
that it's worth killing them.

00:44:54.114 --> 00:44:55.530 align:middle line:84%
You don't kill
something that's as

00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:59.070 align:middle line:84%
valuable as a programmed
human being, especially

00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:00.630 align:middle line:84%
when the rule of
the game is I've

00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:02.740 align:middle line:84%
failed if I have to-- so let's
say that I'm the cold trainer

00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:03.810 align:middle line:90%
and you're the subject.

00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:05.624 align:middle line:84%
If I have to come
after you, I've failed.

00:45:05.624 --> 00:45:07.290 align:middle line:84%
I only win when you
come back willingly.

00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:09.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so if they've
broken you appropriately,

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:10.620 align:middle line:84%
you'll come back
of your own accord.

00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:11.730 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Yes.

00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:12.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you did?

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:13.500 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: No, I didn't.

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:14.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:14.970 align:middle line:90%
So what happened?

00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:15.980 align:middle line:90%
Was that the end then?

00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:16.780 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: No.

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:19.620 align:middle line:84%
It was the end of the
abuse, but the reason

00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:22.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying that
wasn't the end is

00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:24.680 align:middle line:84%
when you're that programmed,
it's never the end.

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:25.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, of course.

00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:29.190 align:middle line:84%
I was just talking about the
way in which that would happen.

00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And so you found your
way to other people.

00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And you met a man named
Blake and you found

00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:37.030 align:middle line:84%
your way into people who
were, it seems from--

00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:37.830 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:41.350 align:middle line:84%
I can only say what I saw
in the documentary, right--

00:45:41.350 --> 00:45:44.880 align:middle line:90%
seemingly kind people.

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:49.350 align:middle line:84%
There seemed to be a type of
innocence and kindness both.

00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:51.450 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: Super
codependent people.

00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:53.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So how did that work?

00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:55.280 align:middle line:84%
You'd been through everything
and this person probably

00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:59.002 align:middle line:84%
couldn't begin to understand
what you had been through.

00:45:59.002 --> 00:46:00.960 align:middle line:84%
What did that create
because that really set up

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:03.460 align:middle line:84%
a template for some
future relationships?

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:05.015 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: Blake is
my guardian angel.

00:46:05.015 --> 00:46:06.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
it seems like it.

00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:09.150 align:middle line:84%
He seemed like just
such a kind human being.

00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:10.030 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Oh, yeah.

00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:11.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so he
is your Earth angel.

00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:13.060 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: 100%.

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:15.210 align:middle line:84%
That is what he
is and anybody who

00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:17.140 align:middle line:84%
meets him feels the
same way about him.

00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:18.060 align:middle line:90%
He's just that way.

00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:18.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He seems like it.

00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: He's the most
unconditional person

00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:20.880 align:middle line:90%
I've ever met in my life.

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:23.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he's still in your
life as a dear, dear guardian

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:23.650 align:middle line:90%
angel.

00:46:23.650 --> 00:46:24.170 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Oh, yeah.

00:46:24.170 --> 00:46:24.987 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:46:24.987 --> 00:46:26.820 align:middle line:84%
So the relationship
part of it, that went on

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:29.220 align:middle line:84%
and you had another
relationship after that.

00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:30.990 align:middle line:84%
But what I found
interesting in the film

00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:34.340 align:middle line:84%
is the men that you
chose all looked alike

00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:37.320 align:middle line:84%
and they seemed to have
a similar expression.

00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:38.970 align:middle line:84%
So you were looking
for this kind

00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:45.439 align:middle line:84%
of angelic savior within men to
bring you around to yourself.

00:46:45.439 --> 00:46:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: It was, but there's
a sadder story behind that.

00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:47.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:46:47.970 --> 00:46:48.960 align:middle line:90%
What's that?

00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:51.820 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: When I was younger, part
of the programming that they do

00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:53.040 align:middle line:90%
is giving you an out.

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:55.080 align:middle line:84%
So they'll say, OK, once
you get this object,

00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:56.419 align:middle line:90%
you get to be out of your role.

00:46:56.419 --> 00:46:57.960 align:middle line:84%
Or once you meet
this type of person,

00:46:57.960 --> 00:46:59.580 align:middle line:90%
you get to be out of your role.

00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And being in a Mormon
community, you've

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.530 align:middle line:84%
got a lot of
Scandinavian-looking boys.

00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:06.210 align:middle line:84%
So what they programmed
me to believe

00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:08.760 align:middle line:84%
was that once I met a
blond-haired, blue-eyed guy who

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:10.590 align:middle line:84%
totally would rescue
me, then I could

00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:12.460 align:middle line:84%
be out of the group, knowing
that that would never happen,

00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:14.430 align:middle line:84%
especially in a community
that ostracizes me

00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:15.940 align:middle line:84%
and that is not OK
with non-Mormons.

00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:16.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:19.110 align:middle line:84%
So you ended up
perpetuating this program.

00:47:19.110 --> 00:47:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And what did it
end up ultimately

00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:25.770 align:middle line:84%
doing to these relationships
with that planted inside?

00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:28.487 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: I have been a
disaster in relationships.

00:47:28.487 --> 00:47:29.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, I gathered that.

00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:31.244 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:31.244 --> 00:47:33.660 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: You just don't get out
of this type of programming

00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:34.850 align:middle line:90%
and have an OK relationship.

00:47:34.850 --> 00:47:36.720 align:middle line:84%
They're incredibly
volatile relationships.

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:38.178 align:middle line:84%
Even if the person
on the other end

00:47:38.178 --> 00:47:43.670 align:middle line:84%
is more sweet and
codependent, just you

00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:45.210 align:middle line:90%
can't make a relationship work.

00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:46.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How can they
know how to deal with you?

00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: They can't.

00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And the terror of
abandonment is beyond--

00:47:50.550 --> 00:47:52.760 align:middle line:90%
it's not rational.

00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:53.752 align:middle line:90%
So they were very--

00:47:53.752 --> 00:47:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beyond codependent.

00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:55.590 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Yeah.

00:47:55.590 --> 00:47:56.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:56.170 --> 00:47:56.970 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:56.970 --> 00:47:58.130 align:middle line:90%
Gotcha.

00:47:58.130 --> 00:47:58.930 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:58.930 --> 00:48:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's not funny, but it's
so outrageously true, it almost

00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:07.380 align:middle line:84%
has a type of humor
to it because,

00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:10.440 align:middle line:84%
how do you go about
actually starting

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:13.899 align:middle line:90%
to overwrite the programming?

00:48:13.899 --> 00:48:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: I'm still in the process
of trying to figure this out

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:19.470 align:middle line:84%
because the reality
is that nobody knows.

00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:22.880 align:middle line:84%
I visited some of the most
brilliant ritual programming

00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:27.330 align:middle line:84%
minds and trauma abuse
therapists and nobody

00:48:27.330 --> 00:48:30.227 align:middle line:84%
really fully knows because it's
so much developmental trauma.

00:48:30.227 --> 00:48:31.310 align:middle line:90%
And developmental trauma--

00:48:31.310 --> 00:48:31.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:48:31.850 --> 00:48:33.000 align:middle line:84%
It's totally different
than what you

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.208 align:middle line:90%
would experience as an adult.

00:48:34.208 --> 00:48:35.410 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Totally.

00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're
running into-- and really

00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:40.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm excited to go with
most of my career--

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:42.240 align:middle line:90%
and I've done that to a degree.

00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:44.400 align:middle line:84%
But where I'm excited to
go with most of my career

00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:45.774 align:middle line:84%
is in this direction
because it's

00:48:45.774 --> 00:48:50.220 align:middle line:84%
a huge blind spot and an
unknown zone for psychology,

00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:51.630 align:middle line:90%
for spirituality, for all of it.

00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:54.007 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like there's
this demographic of people

00:48:54.007 --> 00:48:55.590 align:middle line:84%
that come from the
worst of the worst,

00:48:55.590 --> 00:48:59.490 align:middle line:84%
especially in childhood
trauma abuse situations,

00:48:59.490 --> 00:49:02.130 align:middle line:84%
where nothing's
working for them.

00:49:02.130 --> 00:49:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And the rate of
success is horrible.

00:49:04.170 --> 00:49:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And the science is really
horrible behind it,

00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:09.450 align:middle line:84%
saying you're always going
to be suffering from this.

00:49:09.450 --> 00:49:13.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's almost like
you're an experimental vehicle

00:49:13.070 --> 00:49:16.230 align:middle line:90%
that collapses time, collapses--

00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:22.200 align:middle line:84%
the way I would put it-- almost
many, many incarnations--

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:24.697 align:middle line:84%
of which certainly
people, human beings,

00:49:24.697 --> 00:49:26.280 align:middle line:84%
have been through
every kind of abuse,

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:28.200 align:middle line:84%
every kind of torture
and darkness at one

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:29.340 align:middle line:90%
point or another--

00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:31.620 align:middle line:84%
collapsing it all
into one lifetime

00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:35.820 align:middle line:84%
and then offering yourself up to
be examined and see, how do you

00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:40.129 align:middle line:84%
start reversing the programming
of the subconscious mind?

00:49:40.129 --> 00:49:41.670 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: That is
probably the best way

00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:43.640 align:middle line:90%
anybody has ever summed me up.

00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:45.660 align:middle line:84%
And yes, that's exactly
what I feel like.

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:48.764 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're an ongoing
experiment, so to speak.

00:49:48.764 --> 00:49:50.430 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: I am and I
would love to not be.

00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:52.596 align:middle line:84%
I would love to be like,
look, I figured it all out.

00:49:52.596 --> 00:49:54.695 align:middle line:84%
But no, I'm an
ongoing experiment.

00:49:54.695 --> 00:49:56.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it
makes perfect sense.

00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:59.070 align:middle line:84%
At least you're offering
yourself up for it

00:49:59.070 --> 00:50:01.400 align:middle line:84%
because it does have to
be looked at in there.

00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And if they can figure
out this conundrum,

00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:06.390 align:middle line:84%
then we can begin looking
at the subconscious

00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:07.860 align:middle line:84%
mind in a different
way and having

00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:10.890 align:middle line:84%
maybe more useful tools
than the dark tools that

00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:11.807 align:middle line:90%
have been used on you.

00:50:11.807 --> 00:50:12.606 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Yes.

00:50:12.606 --> 00:50:13.980 align:middle line:90%
And I have a few of them.

00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:15.380 align:middle line:90%
I have a few of these cues now.

00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:18.180 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not going to say
that I'm completely better,

00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:21.990 align:middle line:84%
but I do have some of them
and I know areas where we've

00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:23.290 align:middle line:90%
been falling short, finally.

00:50:23.290 --> 00:50:26.340 align:middle line:84%
And that is really
an area of passion.

00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:27.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good.

00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:29.730 align:middle line:84%
If you can help in that
field, that's tremendous?

00:50:29.730 --> 00:50:33.060 align:middle line:84%
Are you still subject to
hurting yourself and such?

00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:36.710 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: My relapses are much
fewer and farther between.

00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:38.700 align:middle line:84%
But I'm in the same
position that most people

00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:40.560 align:middle line:84%
are in when they have a
serious addiction, where it's

00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:41.910 align:middle line:84%
like, I don't want
to really ever say

00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:43.701 align:middle line:84%
that it's completely
gone because it's just

00:50:43.701 --> 00:50:45.330 align:middle line:84%
the behavior, the
default behavior when

00:50:45.330 --> 00:50:48.780 align:middle line:84%
things get way too much
stress, way too much pressure.

00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:52.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you've had
many views of your interview

00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:54.630 align:middle line:90%
and your documentary--

00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:56.190 align:middle line:90%
a lot.

00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:59.695 align:middle line:84%
And so you have
people, young people--

00:50:59.695 --> 00:51:01.320 align:middle line:84%
mostly, it looks like
it must be people

00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:03.540 align:middle line:90%
in their 20s and some teens--

00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:08.160 align:middle line:84%
that are maybe looking to
have the pain in themselves

00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:09.880 align:middle line:90%
revealed through your pain.

00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:11.010 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Yes.

00:51:11.010 --> 00:51:17.007 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so that attraction
is that maybe you can see them

00:51:17.007 --> 00:51:18.340 align:middle line:90%
for what they're going through--

00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:19.140 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: And I can--

00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:21.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where
other people can't.

00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And so that's really the service
that you bring to the world

00:51:25.230 --> 00:51:30.300 align:middle line:84%
is to help them be able to start
if not stepping in and becoming

00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:32.880 align:middle line:84%
friends with their shadow,
at least feeling like someone

00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:34.700 align:middle line:84%
knows that they're
dealing with a shadow.

00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:35.500 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Exactly.

00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:36.300 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'm in love with doing
this because the reality is

00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:41.640 align:middle line:84%
that even in the
spiritual field,

00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:46.020 align:middle line:84%
you've got a bunch of people who
have very solid beliefs like,

00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:47.740 align:middle line:84%
it's a choice to
feel good or bad.

00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:49.149 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:51:49.149 --> 00:51:51.190 align:middle line:84%
No, it's not, not if it's
that deeply programmed.

00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:51.460 align:middle line:90%
It's not a choice.

00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:52.751 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: That's what I'm saying.

00:51:52.751 --> 00:51:55.937 align:middle line:84%
So some of these let's call them
"higher spiritual truths," when

00:51:55.937 --> 00:51:58.020 align:middle line:84%
you present that to this
demographic of people who

00:51:58.020 --> 00:52:00.450 align:middle line:84%
have suffered this much, they
react the same way I reacted

00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:01.954 align:middle line:90%
when I was 17.

00:52:01.954 --> 00:52:03.120 align:middle line:90%
How dare you say that to me?

00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:03.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:04.950 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: It's just made
it 50 times worse.

00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:06.330 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for the
extra pressure.

00:52:06.330 --> 00:52:08.970 align:middle line:84%
So basically, I'm the person
who's saying, you know what?

00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:11.110 align:middle line:90%
I have access to these things.

00:52:11.110 --> 00:52:12.540 align:middle line:90%
That's easy for me.

00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:14.040 align:middle line:84%
But we've got to
bridge the gap here

00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:15.690 align:middle line:84%
because it's not
OK to just come in

00:52:15.690 --> 00:52:17.340 align:middle line:84%
with these higher dimensional
truths to somebody who's

00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:18.212 align:middle line:90%
been through that.

00:52:18.212 --> 00:52:19.670 align:middle line:84%
It actually has to
be acknowledged.

00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:21.210 align:middle line:90%
It actually has to be validated.

00:52:21.210 --> 00:52:22.380 align:middle line:90%
It has to be integrated.

00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:23.850 align:middle line:90%
It can't just be, you know what?

00:52:23.850 --> 00:52:24.870 align:middle line:90%
That's not who I am.

00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:26.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to just get
rid of the illusion.

00:52:26.650 --> 00:52:27.858 align:middle line:90%
We've got to do the opposite.

00:52:27.858 --> 00:52:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes when pain is
bad enough, it forces you to.

00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:31.680 align:middle line:90%
It's not an option not to.

00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:32.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And we're at a point
in history where

00:52:34.410 --> 00:52:36.930 align:middle line:84%
so much is bubbling
up from underneath,

00:52:36.930 --> 00:52:39.990 align:middle line:84%
deep in the psyche of the
Earth of the collective

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:43.020 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, that if we
can start looking at it

00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:45.480 align:middle line:84%
and contending with it and
maybe finding, like I said,

00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:50.460 align:middle line:84%
new tools to begin
unearthing it, healing,

00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:51.900 align:middle line:90%
and so that's your job.

00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:55.070 align:middle line:84%
That's what you're part of is
to unearth this subconscious

00:52:55.070 --> 00:52:59.390 align:middle line:84%
shadow and help people
begin bringing it to light.

00:52:59.390 --> 00:53:00.190 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Yes.

00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:00.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:01.760 align:middle line:90%
Anything else?

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:03.090 align:middle line:90%
We're just about out of time.

00:53:03.090 --> 00:53:05.610 align:middle line:84%
Anything else you'd like to
say that we haven't gotten to?

00:53:05.610 --> 00:53:09.250 align:middle line:90%


00:53:09.250 --> 00:53:10.450 align:middle line:90%
>>TEAL: Yeah.

00:53:10.450 --> 00:53:13.306 align:middle line:84%
I think it's really important
that people understand

00:53:13.306 --> 00:53:15.180 align:middle line:84%
that there's nothing
that they can go through

00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:16.104 align:middle line:90%
that they can't heal.

00:53:16.104 --> 00:53:18.520 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing they can go
through that can't get better.

00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:20.978 align:middle line:84%
It's really important for people
to have that kind of hope.

00:53:20.978 --> 00:53:24.540 align:middle line:84%
But I also have really
moved into the space where

00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:26.800 align:middle line:84%
what's critical for me
to express to people

00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:29.970 align:middle line:84%
and have them understand
is that really, it's

00:53:29.970 --> 00:53:33.484 align:middle line:84%
not about getting better, that
there's almost a kind of pain

00:53:33.484 --> 00:53:35.400 align:middle line:84%
when you approach yourself
with that attitude.

00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:37.483 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, there's
the kind of self-defeatism

00:53:37.483 --> 00:53:38.790 align:middle line:90%
that ends up happening.

00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:39.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:41.010 align:middle line:10%
>>TEAL: Why do you
have to get better?

00:53:41.010 --> 00:53:43.426 align:middle line:10%
There's a part of me that's
really interested in this type

00:53:43.426 --> 00:53:44.234 align:middle line:10%
of exploration.

00:53:44.234 --> 00:53:45.900 align:middle line:10%
Why does everything
have to be improved?

00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:48.900 align:middle line:10%
Why can't you just be really,
really loved the way you are?

00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:50.805 align:middle line:10%
Why can't we join
each other in pain

00:53:50.805 --> 00:53:53.700 align:middle line:10%
instead of spend our life trying
to get somebody out of it?

00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:56.160 align:middle line:84%
It can be just as self-hating
or other-hating an act

00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:58.450 align:middle line:84%
as it can be self-loving
and other-loving.

00:53:58.450 --> 00:53:59.250 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hm.

00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:01.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, and you have
millions of young people

00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:02.880 align:middle line:90%
that feel the same way.

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:03.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:05.520 align:middle line:84%
>>TEAL: So for that,
thank you, Teal.

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:06.651 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:54:06.651 --> 00:54:09.150 align:middle line:10%
>>TEAL: Again, the name of the
documentary about Teal's life

00:54:09.150 --> 00:54:10.564 align:middle line:10%
is called "Open Shadow."

00:54:10.564 --> 00:54:12.480 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:13.860 align:middle line:90%
on "Open Minds."
