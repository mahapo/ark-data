00:00:12.896 --> 00:00:27.940 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.690 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: In
my last conversation

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.920 align:middle line:10%
with Simon Chokoisky,
we spoke about his book

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.580 align:middle line:10%
on the five Dharma types.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.800 align:middle line:10%
The interview received
such positive feedback

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.300 align:middle line:10%
that we decided to have Simon
back and look at his newest

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.490 align:middle line:10%
work, "Sex, Love, and Dharma."

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.520 align:middle line:84%
It helps us see ourselves
in terms of relationships

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.740 align:middle line:84%
through our Dharma type and I
found it really interesting.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And everybody just loved
the last talk we had,

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.840 align:middle line:84%
because-- we were just talking
off-camera a moment ago,

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.190 align:middle line:84%
and you said, well, what
did you like about the book,

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.400 align:middle line:84%
and I said, because it's
an incredibly useful guide

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.570 align:middle line:84%
to seeing ourselves in
some kind of context,

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.270 align:middle line:90%
which we don't get from birth.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.780 align:middle line:84%
There's no manual
on these things.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.110 align:middle line:90%
Well, there is now, I suppose.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.810 align:middle line:10%
>>SIMON CHOKOISKY: Yeah,
it's a survival manual--

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:09.799 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:11.840 align:middle line:10%
>>CHOKOISKY: --for everything
from health to love

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.110 align:middle line:10%
to your relationship
with the divine,

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.300 align:middle line:10%
and I think part of
the reason, maybe,

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.440 align:middle line:10%
for the positive feedback is
that as I mentioned to you,

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.930 align:middle line:10%
you and I, it's like
talking to an old friend,

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.117 align:middle line:10%
so you certainly make people
more comfortable and--

00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:25.200 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, thank you.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.325 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: --and at ease.

00:01:26.325 --> 00:01:27.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad to be here.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.014 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
everyone saw this.

00:01:29.014 --> 00:01:30.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, by the time
they see this, it

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.638 align:middle line:84%
will have been a little
while, so what I'd like to do

00:01:32.638 --> 00:01:36.770 align:middle line:84%
is just take the first few
minutes to set up the Dharma

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.220 align:middle line:84%
types again, and
then we're going

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.814 align:middle line:84%
to start the overlays in this
very complex subject of love.

00:01:41.814 --> 00:01:42.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: OK.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK?

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.430 align:middle line:10%
>>CHOKOISKY: The Dharma type
is simply a practical tool

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.940 align:middle line:10%
to help you understand,
what is your gift, what

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.760 align:middle line:10%
is my gift in the
world, and what

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.710 align:middle line:10%
keeps me from expressing it?

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.770 align:middle line:84%
So I've had people call me
recently on the phone and say,

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Simon, you told
me I'm a Merchant,

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.930 align:middle line:84%
and I feel so amazing, it
just let all the stress out,

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.640 align:middle line:84%
and it's OK to be
who I am, because--

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.230 align:middle line:84%
and I explain what
a Merchant is.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.870 align:middle line:84%
Their purpose is to share
laughter, to connect people,

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.410 align:middle line:84%
to produce value in the
world by giving people

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.040 align:middle line:90%
opportunities, and so on.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And so this person
changed their profession,

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.330 align:middle line:84%
they changed the way
they see their lives,

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.940 align:middle line:84%
and they're happy
being who they are.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:29.940 align:middle line:90%
And that's the purpose--

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:30.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's huge.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.758 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: That's it.

00:02:31.758 --> 00:02:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And so the Dharma type says it's
OK to be who you are, or just

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.530 align:middle line:84%
understand who you are, and out
of that, what your purpose is

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.190 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also what
the innate challenges

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.649 align:middle line:90%
might be to that type.

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:45.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: And every
type has challenges.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, they do.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.890 align:middle line:84%
But if you know what
they are, you think,

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.030 align:middle line:90%
oh my gosh, well, really?

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of sitting
right where I need to be.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:51.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Right.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.734 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
expected, and now it's

00:02:52.734 --> 00:02:53.940 align:middle line:90%
just transcending that.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.710 align:middle line:84%
One thing you say is you
talk about in the West,

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:04.210 align:middle line:84%
we have more of a framework
of "I matter" versus "my role

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.420 align:middle line:84%
matters," and because when we're
talking about relationship,

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.950 align:middle line:84%
we end up in definitely
role-oriented territory.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.600 align:middle line:84%
Explain the difference
between those two.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: So the "I
matter" is valuable.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.920 align:middle line:84%
It says, I can step out
today and do anything I want.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.510 align:middle line:84%
I can become a
real estate agent.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.890 align:middle line:90%
I can climb Mount Everest.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.780 align:middle line:90%
I can train to be a firefighter.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.060 align:middle line:84%
I have choice and I can
exercise that in the world.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.700 align:middle line:84%
Understanding your Dharma in the
East, especially, it was said,

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.070 align:middle line:84%
yes, you have choice and some
choices are better than others.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.170 align:middle line:84%
So understand how you are
built. The way I was built

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.800 align:middle line:90%
may not make me an athlete.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.880 align:middle line:84%
It just won't work, and
I'll have pain and injuries,

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.830 align:middle line:84%
and I won't lead a full
life if I go that route.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.300 align:middle line:84%
So understanding
your design helps

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.280 align:middle line:90%
you to channel your free will.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.000 align:middle line:84%
So this is why East and
West are coming together,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.570 align:middle line:84%
because East was all about
this is your framework,

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.920 align:middle line:84%
and this is what you're
built for, West is--

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is what I want.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.930 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: This
is what I want.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:06.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.676 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: And
now East and West

00:04:07.676 --> 00:04:10.110 align:middle line:84%
are coming together and
saying, do what you want,

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.460 align:middle line:84%
and do it in a way
that will produce

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.430 align:middle line:90%
long-term happiness for you.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.390 align:middle line:84%
Long-term health, long-term
relationship success,

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.900 align:middle line:84%
because it's based on who
you are, on your identity.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so now
we-- well, first of all,

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.640 align:middle line:84%
why did you decide to
write this second book?

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Because it grabbed
ahold of me and it wouldn't let

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.160 align:middle line:84%
go, and these things
write themselves.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And I was telling you
earlier, sometimes

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what's
in this book.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.170 align:middle line:84%
I'll open it, and
read it, and say, oh,

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.400 align:middle line:84%
wow, that's interesting,
and somehow I

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.790 align:middle line:84%
wrote that, and it-- a lot of
research, a lot of inspiration,

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.040 align:middle line:84%
a lot of perspiration, but
it's my purpose as an Educator,

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.952 align:middle line:90%
and that's my Dharma type.

00:04:55.952 --> 00:04:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And I hate talking about
myself, but maybe this

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.327 align:middle line:84%
is an introduction
to these types.

00:04:59.327 --> 00:05:00.201 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:05:00.201 --> 00:05:01.010 align:middle line:90%
It's important.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: I'm a
blah, blah, blah kind

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.335 align:middle line:84%
of windbag kind of person,
where I could be driving a taxi

00:05:07.335 --> 00:05:10.820 align:middle line:84%
or just walking down the street,
but I'll be telling people, oh,

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.550 align:middle line:84%
did you know that those shoes
are made in blah, blah, blah?

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:14.640 align:middle line:84%
Oh, did you know
that this building--

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Can't help yourself.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.700 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: I can't help it.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:22.290 align:middle line:84%
So my Dharma, my purpose
is to share wisdom and let

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.780 align:middle line:84%
other people do with it what
they will, so I write books.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.465 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And relationship
specifically was calling you.

00:05:29.465 --> 00:05:31.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Relationship
specifically,

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.560 align:middle line:84%
because once you know who you
are, we are relational beings.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.060 align:middle line:84%
The way we express who
we are is in the context

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.470 align:middle line:84%
of one-on-one
relationships and society,

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.670 align:middle line:84%
and our social relationship
is our profession.

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.480 align:middle line:84%
What is my identity
within my tribe?

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.970 align:middle line:90%
And then one-on-one.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.100 align:middle line:84%
But what permeates those
is, the fundamental

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.080 align:middle line:84%
is understanding
who I am, and that's

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.060 align:middle line:84%
why the book-- really,
the title of the book

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.050 align:middle line:84%
should be "Dharma,
Love, and Sex,"

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.020 align:middle line:90%
because Dharma comes first.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.760 align:middle line:84%
Dharma just means--
it's a fancy word,

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.010 align:middle line:84%
but it just means your
purpose, your design,

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:10.990 align:middle line:90%
your divine design.

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And honoring your divine design
will attract the right people

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.620 align:middle line:84%
in your life, the
right profession,

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.750 align:middle line:84%
and the right spiritual
experiences for you.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.810 align:middle line:84%
So it has-- so the
Dharma type is implicit

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.896 align:middle line:84%
both in our everyday life--
what we eat for breakfast--

00:06:27.896 --> 00:06:30.500 align:middle line:84%
in our social life--
what we do for a living--

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.190 align:middle line:84%
and in our spiritual life,
how we relate to the divine.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
looking around us,

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:40.770 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
the world at large.

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:44.230 align:middle line:84%
Certainly in the United States,
the divorce rate is 50%.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.080 align:middle line:84%
So every time
someone gets married

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.420 align:middle line:84%
and they have their beautiful
flowers and dresses,

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:54.180 align:middle line:84%
it's 50-50 that's not going
to last for however long.

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you look at the world
through your lens, how often do

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.440 align:middle line:84%
you see, when marriages
end in divorce,

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.470 align:middle line:84%
that they're really not
suited for one another

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:05.810 align:middle line:90%
on a Dharma type level?

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.970 align:middle line:90%


00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: I reference
ancient cultures a lot,

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.830 align:middle line:84%
and it's not because I'm in
love with everything ancient,

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.320 align:middle line:84%
but there are some wisdom
teachings that I think

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.360 align:middle line:90%
are valuable for us today.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.710 align:middle line:84%
In some ancient
cultures, they used

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:25.550 align:middle line:84%
to match couples based not
only on their sexuality, which

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:29.610 align:middle line:84%
is one important aspect, on
their emotional understanding,

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.630 align:middle line:84%
but also on how that couple
would impact society.

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:35.750 align:middle line:84%
If these two people
get together,

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:39.140 align:middle line:84%
will their children
be prosperous?

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.440 align:middle line:90%
Will they be prosperous?

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.150 align:middle line:84%
Or will just the
dynamic that they

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.210 align:middle line:84%
create bring them down
in the eyes of society?

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:49.790 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at a fictional
example, Romeo and Juliet.

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:51.800 align:middle line:90%
They were perfectly compatible.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.140 align:middle line:84%
These two were inseparable,
and yet, socially, they

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:58.450 align:middle line:84%
had terrible compatibility,
so that tragedy--

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:00.127 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Took down
their clans, yeah.

00:08:00.127 --> 00:08:03.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yeah,
and of course,

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:06.330 align:middle line:84%
the way you do this is by
looking at the horoscope,

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.455 align:middle line:84%
and I know this may sound
a little far out for some

00:08:08.455 --> 00:08:08.955 align:middle line:90%
people--

00:08:08.955 --> 00:08:10.582 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, not
for our audience.

00:08:10.582 --> 00:08:12.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: --but
the horoscope is

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.680 align:middle line:84%
a map of your life--
of your karmic DNA,

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.860 align:middle line:84%
if you want to say
it that way, and when

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.590 align:middle line:84%
you match two
horoscopes, you can

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:23.090 align:middle line:84%
see how two people match up,
not only for love and health,

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:27.650 align:middle line:84%
but also for prosperity and each
other's spiritual evolution.

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:29.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, and
so societies that

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:34.120 align:middle line:84%
do that tend to create matches
that have more staying power?

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:39.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: As a general
rule, yes, but then again,

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:41.089 align:middle line:90%
free will is still there.

00:08:41.089 --> 00:08:42.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, of course.

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:42.190 align:middle line:90%
We're human.

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:43.648 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: And
there is something

00:08:43.648 --> 00:08:46.684 align:middle line:84%
to be said for that lightning,
the [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:08:46.684 --> 00:08:47.600 align:middle line:90%
as they say in French.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.433 align:middle line:84%
That lightning hits
you, and you're in love,

00:08:49.433 --> 00:08:52.930 align:middle line:90%
and let's just go for it.

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:53.665 align:middle line:90%
Forget the--

00:08:53.665 --> 00:08:54.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, and you do.

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:58.330 align:middle line:84%
The lightning, that to me
is speaking to the soul.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:02.370 align:middle line:84%
It's an expression of the soul
that pay attention, be alert,

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.506 align:middle line:84%
be in this moment, now
there's a reason for it,

00:09:04.506 --> 00:09:06.130 align:middle line:84%
or the lightning
wouldn't be happening.

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:09.040 align:middle line:84%
There's something there,
but what about what

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.850 align:middle line:90%
happens more often?

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:13.870 align:middle line:84%
Oh, gosh, I'm 34,
I'm not married yet,

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:17.240 align:middle line:84%
I want, I need, and people go,
and then they look for someone,

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.705 align:middle line:84%
and find someone, and,
you know, seal it.

00:09:20.705 --> 00:09:21.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: What about it?

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:22.990 align:middle line:90%
You mean settling?

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:24.260 align:middle line:90%
The idea of settling or--

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:25.676 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
the notion that we

00:09:25.676 --> 00:09:27.570 align:middle line:84%
get into an area
more of need and what

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:29.750 align:middle line:84%
is perceived that
we should be doing

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:32.515 align:middle line:84%
by a certain time of life, which
oftentimes is why people do

00:09:32.515 --> 00:09:33.015 align:middle line:90%
get married.

00:09:33.015 --> 00:09:35.870 align:middle line:84%
It's like, ah, gee,
the clock's ticking.

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: There
are pros and cons.

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.810 align:middle line:84%
Another feature of
the ancient traditions

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:42.750 align:middle line:84%
is they teach us how to
honor the cycles of time,

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:48.299 align:middle line:84%
both the daily cycle-- there's
a best time to ask for a raise,

00:09:48.299 --> 00:09:50.590 align:middle line:84%
there's a worst time to ask
for a raise during the day,

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.310 align:middle line:90%
or to make love, and so on.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And within the general
cycle of your life,

00:09:55.970 --> 00:10:01.260 align:middle line:84%
there are times when marriage
relationships are most likely,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.030 align:middle line:84%
and I can see that
on a horoscope.

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:07.094 align:middle line:84%
So when a client comes to me
and says, Simon, I'm single.

00:10:07.094 --> 00:10:08.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:10.384 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say, there's
nothing wrong with you,

00:10:10.384 --> 00:10:12.875 align:middle line:84%
that karma simply
hasn't fruitioned.

00:10:12.875 --> 00:10:15.190 align:middle line:84%
There are some trees
that take years

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:19.330 align:middle line:84%
to produce fruit and some trees
flower and fruit right away.

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.956 align:middle line:84%
You are the tree that's going to
fruit in two and a half years,

00:10:21.956 --> 00:10:23.954 align:middle line:84%
and then a relationship
is coming, and this is--

00:10:23.954 --> 00:10:25.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And is
this usually correct?

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.500 align:middle line:84%
Do you find in your casting
of charts for people

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.740 align:middle line:90%
that it generally plays out?

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:32.660 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Usually, yeah.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, a skeptic might say,
well, you planted that idea

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.140 align:middle line:90%
in their mind.

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely, and
there is always that effect.

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:39.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: And
I tell my clients,

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:41.870 align:middle line:84%
never let anyone
lay a trip on you.

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:42.810 align:middle line:90%
Not even me.

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:46.690 align:middle line:84%
Not even God, or your
idea of God, that this

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:49.700 align:middle line:84%
is what I should do based
on my religion, my family,

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.920 align:middle line:90%
or my social expectations.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.190 align:middle line:84%
Nonetheless, it's my
role as a counselor

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:58.470 align:middle line:84%
to sort of walk that tightrope,
and give the information as I

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:02.960 align:middle line:84%
interpret it, and let them
take away what they take away.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:06.241 align:middle line:84%
And more often than
not, it's correct.

00:11:06.241 --> 00:11:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I will look at a
chart and go blank, and not

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:12.960 align:middle line:84%
see anything, and I say, here's
your money back, thank you,

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:13.600 align:middle line:90%
and I--

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why would
you see nothing?

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.950 align:middle line:90%
What--

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.390 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: It's not my
lot to be part of their--

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:19.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I see.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.330 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:20.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: --of their flow--

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:21.195 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I see
what you're saying.

00:11:21.195 --> 00:11:23.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: --and
for whatever reason.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:26.580 align:middle line:84%
It's not showing itself
to you for a reason.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:27.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: I
just can't see it.

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I understand.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: So I
simply can't interact

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:33.616 align:middle line:84%
and I just say, well, we can
try again in a year maybe.

00:11:33.616 --> 00:11:35.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
because the information

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.549 align:middle line:84%
isn't for their conscious
knowledge at that time.

00:11:37.549 --> 00:11:38.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Or for mine.

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:39.798 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or for yours, yeah.

00:11:39.798 --> 00:11:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And as the saying
goes, there's a time

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:43.470 align:middle line:90%
for every purpose under heaven.

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:44.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Oh, very much so.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And in this book, I do
talk about cycles a lot,

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:52.305 align:middle line:84%
your 24-hour cycle, the cycle--
the general seasonal cycles,

00:11:52.305 --> 00:11:55.140 align:middle line:84%
and of course, we're
becoming more conscious,

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:56.474 align:middle line:90%
eat what's in season, right?

00:11:56.474 --> 00:11:57.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:59.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: That's an
awareness of nature's cycles.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.830 align:middle line:84%
Why am I eating mango in the
middle of winter in Colorado?

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know, when I'm
served a salad or something

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:07.730 align:middle line:84%
that has these little tomatoes,
these little plastic tomatoes

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:10.050 align:middle line:90%
on them, I just push them away.

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:12.170 align:middle line:84%
It's consciously, it's
not even an option

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:13.295 align:middle line:90%
to eat those in the winter.

00:12:13.295 --> 00:12:15.461 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: And it's not
so much that it's an idea,

00:12:15.461 --> 00:12:17.820 align:middle line:84%
but we have bugs in our
bodies that know it's winter,

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:21.380 align:middle line:84%
and they're made to digest
the food that's in the winter,

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.960 align:middle line:84%
and there are studies now
that show that if you feed

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.600 align:middle line:84%
off-season food to
a deer, it'll die,

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:30.194 align:middle line:84%
because its microflora is
not ready for that food.

00:12:30.194 --> 00:12:31.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:33.450 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: It eats roots
when it's time to eat roots.

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:36.110 align:middle line:84%
It eats grass when
it's spring and summer.

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:37.590 align:middle line:90%
And its body knows what to do.

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're part
of nature as well.

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:41.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if we
decide, no, I'm doing

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:44.350 align:middle line:90%
salads and juice all winter.

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: You know, human
beings are the most resilient

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:48.720 align:middle line:84%
and the most
adaptable, so that's

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:53.790 align:middle line:84%
why we can be vegetarian,
or Atkins diet, or vegan.

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:55.200 align:middle line:90%
We have the adaptability.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.000 align:middle line:84%
The question is,
what's best for you?

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, and not forcing
ourself into one or the other,

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:01.490 align:middle line:90%
because I've done that.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:03.615 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yeah, and I
think we've all done that,

00:13:03.615 --> 00:13:06.920 align:middle line:84%
and that's where this book comes
from is, what's right for me?

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:07.890 align:middle line:90%
What's my Dharma?

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:09.350 align:middle line:90%
What's my Dharma type?

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And also from Ayurveda,
what's my Dosha?

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:14.957 align:middle line:84%
Which is something we touched on
in the last interview as well.

00:13:14.957 --> 00:13:15.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And that does play-- it does
factor well into the Dharma

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.350 align:middle line:90%
type, so, OK.

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:22.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's just do
a quick little recap

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.610 align:middle line:84%
so we get the basic
Dharma types before we

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:25.980 align:middle line:90%
start overlaying relationship.

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:27.422 align:middle line:90%
Let's start with Warrior.

00:13:27.422 --> 00:13:28.130 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yes.

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:31.180 align:middle line:84%
The Warrior's gift is
the ability to lead.

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:34.200 align:middle line:84%
The Warrior knows what to
do in a given situation

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.310 align:middle line:90%
or they quickly find out.

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:38.010 align:middle line:90%
Warriors do well in emergencies.

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:42.590 align:middle line:84%
So when there's an explosion
outside, everyone freaks out,

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:45.000 align:middle line:90%
the Warrior becomes calm.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.760 align:middle line:84%
They look around and say,
OK, what do I need to do?

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.140 align:middle line:84%
Because their Dharma
comes to the forefront.

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And when you're living your
Dharma, you feel in the zone,

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:54.760 align:middle line:90%
you get in that zone.

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So military leaders,
I mean, that would be,

00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:58.354 align:middle line:90%
like, the most classic extreme.

00:13:58.354 --> 00:14:00.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: That's a
classic, but single moms

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:01.080 align:middle line:90%
raising their kids.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.288 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right, yeah.

00:14:02.288 --> 00:14:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Because they
are-- that's their purpose.

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:07.550 align:middle line:90%
A Warrior is a leader.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Their role, their Dharma, their
purpose is to solve problems.

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.690 align:middle line:84%
The best Warriors do it
quietly, so that no one

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:16.820 align:middle line:90%
knows they were there.

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:20.070 align:middle line:84%
The worst Warriors do
it with lots of [ROARS].

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:21.970 align:middle line:84%
That's the lowest
form of the Warrior.

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:26.480 align:middle line:90%


00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:27.920 align:middle line:90%
So that's the Warrior's Dharma.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.390 align:middle line:90%


00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:34.887 align:middle line:84%
And Warriors take on
qualities from Educators, so--

00:14:34.887 --> 00:14:36.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
where we're going next.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: That's
what we're going

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:42.620 align:middle line:84%
is, finding their just cause is
very important for a Warrior,

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.800 align:middle line:84%
because they have natural
leadership ability,

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:48.490 align:middle line:84%
but knowing which cause to
anchor it to, how to use it,

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:49.417 align:middle line:90%
is key.

00:14:49.417 --> 00:14:51.875 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's go to--
should we go to the Educator

00:14:51.875 --> 00:14:52.040 align:middle line:90%
then?

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:52.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yeah.

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:53.211 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:14:53.211 --> 00:14:55.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: The
Educator, as I mentioned

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.050 align:middle line:84%
previously, their purpose,
their Dharma, their gift,

00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:01.880 align:middle line:84%
is to bring information, wisdom,
and truth into the world.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:02.660 align:middle line:90%
To council.

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, you don't have
to be a teacher,

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.350 align:middle line:90%
or a counselor, a scientist.

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:09.860 align:middle line:84%
Whatever profession you do,
you're doing that naturally

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:12.290 align:middle line:90%
just by virtue of who you are.

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.010 align:middle line:84%
If you're an Educator,
people will always

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:19.715 align:middle line:84%
kind of come up to you and say,
hey, you seem pretty decent.

00:15:19.715 --> 00:15:22.647 align:middle line:84%
[SIGH] You know, I broke up
with my girlfriend yesterday,

00:15:22.647 --> 00:15:23.230 align:middle line:90%
and I really--

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:24.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: People want
to talk to you a lot.

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:24.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: And they'll
just start talking to you,

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.440 align:middle line:90%
and I'm like, do I know you?

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.900 align:middle line:84%
This just happened in the
airport yesterday with me,

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.080 align:middle line:84%
and I had a long
one-hour conversation

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:34.350 align:middle line:84%
with no introduction
with the person.

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:36.170 align:middle line:90%
That's an Educator.

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:38.460 align:middle line:90%
That's your Dharma.

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:42.740 align:middle line:84%
Then there is the Merchant type,
and the Merchant's unique gift

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:46.450 align:middle line:84%
is the ability to connect
people, to find value

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:49.060 align:middle line:90%
where it wasn't before.

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:51.330 align:middle line:84%
They'll take a coconut
they found on the ground

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:56.250 align:middle line:84%
in Thailand, bring it to the
US, pluck a couple of hairs,

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:58.090 align:middle line:84%
and go, this is
the Elvis coconut,

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:01.040 align:middle line:90%
and sell it for $150 on eBay.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.580 align:middle line:84%
They have the ability
to visualize value,

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:06.080 align:middle line:84%
to bring out value, and
make people want it.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:10.270 align:middle line:90%
It's a gift to connect people.

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:11.890 align:middle line:90%
Regina, have you met Ellie?

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:12.990 align:middle line:90%
Let me connect you guys.

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:13.490 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:15.960 align:middle line:84%
And a whole-- a
company is founded

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.490 align:middle line:90%
on that type of connection.

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:21.800 align:middle line:84%
Merchants are the
masters of that.

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.140 align:middle line:90%
Then we have the Laborer.

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:26.580 align:middle line:84%
The Laborer is the
foundation of society.

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:28.834 align:middle line:90%
Their unique gift is to build.

00:16:28.834 --> 00:16:29.818 align:middle line:90%
Build, build, build.

00:16:29.818 --> 00:16:34.890 align:middle line:84%
Build families, build
homes, build communities.

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Laborers have the gift of
nourishing others in a way

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:44.580 align:middle line:84%
that no one else can do, not
none of the other Dharma types.

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:47.500 align:middle line:84%
So they're the nourishers and
the builders of the Dharma type

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.930 align:middle line:90%
family.

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:52.440 align:middle line:90%
And finally we have Outsiders.

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And Outsiders, as we were
talking about earlier,

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:55.970 align:middle line:90%
they're the thumb.

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:57.310 align:middle line:90%
They go in their own direction.

00:16:57.310 --> 00:16:59.990 align:middle line:84%
Their Dharma is to go
in a different direction

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:02.570 align:middle line:84%
than the other
four types, right?

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And often, Outsiders--
not often, but sometimes

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:08.589 align:middle line:84%
you'll see Outsiders
wear a thumb ring,

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:10.599 align:middle line:84%
and if you see that,
whether it's the coffee

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:13.280 align:middle line:84%
barista or the CEO,
you know what's

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:17.430 align:middle line:84%
up, that they are strong
individuals, asserting

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:20.520 align:middle line:84%
that they are somehow
different from the ebb

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.500 align:middle line:84%
and flow of the normal
sort of social structure.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.199 align:middle line:90%
I'm unique.

00:17:24.199 --> 00:17:24.865 align:middle line:90%
I'm independent.

00:17:24.865 --> 00:17:26.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What do they offer?

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:29.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Their
gift is innovation.

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:32.350 align:middle line:84%
Without Outsiders, things
get stale and boring.

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:37.160 align:middle line:84%
It's the same old "Leave It
to Beaver" kind of existence.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.760 align:middle line:84%
Outsider comes in and
they're rock and roll.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:43.330 align:middle line:84%
They bring something
fresh, new, and innovative.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:45.850 align:middle line:84%
It may not always
be received well,

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:48.800 align:middle line:84%
at least initially, by
society, so Outsiders also

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.880 align:middle line:90%
have a deep sense of anxiety.

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:55.050 align:middle line:84%
Their nervous system tends
to be a little bit more

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:59.360 align:middle line:84%
sensitive than others, which is
why I have specific meditations

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:03.480 align:middle line:84%
and breathing exercises so
they can ease into that.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.150 align:middle line:84%
And just understanding that
they are wired differently

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:09.260 align:middle line:84%
can help an Outsider go,
OK, well, this is who I am.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:12.060 align:middle line:84%
It's OK to be a little
more anxious, a little more

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:15.254 align:middle line:84%
different than-- or
sensitive than other people.

00:18:15.254 --> 00:18:17.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was interesting
to read in your book,

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:20.042 align:middle line:84%
because I've-- I took the
test again, in the first book,

00:18:20.042 --> 00:18:22.500 align:middle line:84%
and then, of course, the second
one, to see if I'd changed.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:23.375 align:middle line:90%
No, I hadn't changed.

00:18:23.375 --> 00:18:27.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm mostly Outsider,
secondary effect, Educator,

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.417 align:middle line:84%
which is, for what I
do, as an example--

00:18:29.417 --> 00:18:30.500 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: It's perfect.

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:31.333 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --perfect.

00:18:31.333 --> 00:18:33.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm always looking at
new ways in the media

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:38.440 align:middle line:84%
to introduce new themes, new
subjects, go into new territory

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:42.880 align:middle line:84%
all the time, but yet in
a very-- a lifelong path

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:43.930 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:45.680 align:middle line:84%
There's been a stability
to it, but you're

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.720 align:middle line:84%
right about that
nervous system thing.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.580 align:middle line:84%
There's always a low
kind of level anxiety

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:53.654 align:middle line:84%
when you're doing things that
are against the mainstream.

00:18:53.654 --> 00:18:55.820 align:middle line:10%
>>CHOKOISKY: Joseph Campbell
was an Outsider playing

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:59.660 align:middle line:10%
an Educator, and when he
was asked, give us one word

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.620 align:middle line:10%
to describe you, he didn't
say teacher or professor,

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:04.177 align:middle line:10%
he said maverick.

00:19:04.177 --> 00:19:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:05.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: I'm a rebel.

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:06.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, a rebel.

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:08.541 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: That's
who he is at his heart,

00:19:08.541 --> 00:19:10.940 align:middle line:84%
even though he was a
professor all his life.

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:15.470 align:middle line:84%
Woody Allen, same thing,
Outsider playing an Educator.

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:16.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:16.765 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:16.765 --> 00:19:18.890 align:middle line:84%
It made sense though, but
the nervous system part I

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:20.130 align:middle line:90%
found interesting.

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Every type
has a physical correlation.

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's talk
about, now, the typology

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:26.220 align:middle line:84%
and how they show up in
society, because there

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:28.860 align:middle line:84%
are many different systems
of looking at people.

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:30.310 align:middle line:84%
One of them is
Human Design, which

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:31.730 align:middle line:90%
I find kind of interesting.

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:33.317 align:middle line:84%
Are you familiar
with that at all?

00:19:33.317 --> 00:19:34.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Only cursory.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.510 align:middle line:90%
Not on a deep level.

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:37.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it could
have some very similar kind

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:40.710 align:middle line:84%
of correlations
with Dharma types

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:43.990 align:middle line:84%
in that you have, for example,
the Laborer would be called

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:47.330 align:middle line:84%
the Generator in
that system, and that

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:51.880 align:middle line:90%
is the majority of society.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.530 align:middle line:84%
There's a higher
percentage, in Human Design,

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:57.950 align:middle line:84%
of Generators who have the
energy and power to go in

00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:00.530 align:middle line:84%
and get things done,
keep things moving.

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:02.100 align:middle line:90%
They have the energy behind it.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:03.720 align:middle line:84%
Is it the same in
the Dharma types

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:06.520 align:middle line:84%
or is it evenly split--
more evenly split?

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:10.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: In the Dharma
types, in the current age,

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:14.440 align:middle line:84%
there are more Outsiders
than any other type,

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.210 align:middle line:84%
because societies
have blended so much.

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:18.174 align:middle line:90%
Bloodlines have mixed.

00:20:18.174 --> 00:20:19.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:21.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: And I can
be in Burma tomorrow,

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:25.290 align:middle line:84%
in the jungles, if I
got on a plane tonight.

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:29.010 align:middle line:84%
There's a sense of
being in connection

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:31.290 align:middle line:84%
with outside cultures
that didn't exist

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:34.470 align:middle line:84%
2,000 years ago,
or 5,000 years ago,

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:36.070 align:middle line:84%
or even a couple
hundred years ago.

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:38.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it requires
innovation and adaptation.

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:38.968 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yes.

00:20:38.968 --> 00:20:42.899 align:middle line:84%
So in my mind, there
are more Outsiders now,

00:20:42.899 --> 00:20:44.315 align:middle line:84%
and certainly in
my practice there

00:20:44.315 --> 00:20:46.230 align:middle line:84%
are more Outsiders
than any other type.

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:49.170 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, Outsiders
often show up as Laborers,

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:52.871 align:middle line:84%
because when you think
about, let's say, people

00:20:52.871 --> 00:20:55.120 align:middle line:84%
coming to this country, or
let's use an older example.

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:59.660 align:middle line:84%
The Roman Empire
conquers a piece of land.

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:02.750 align:middle line:84%
The people from that land
speak a different language

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:05.560 align:middle line:84%
from the Romans, from
Latin and Italian.

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:09.400 align:middle line:84%
So they come in and they join
the workforce as Laborers,

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:13.679 align:middle line:84%
basically, even though they
are Outsiders, because--

00:21:13.679 --> 00:21:15.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They were explorers
but now they're working--

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:16.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: They might
have been doctors,

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:19.198 align:middle line:84%
they might have been something
else in their society,

00:21:19.198 --> 00:21:20.550 align:middle line:90%
but they've become subsumed.

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And we live in
that kind of world

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:26.620 align:middle line:84%
now, where English is the lingua
franca of the Western world,

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:28.970 align:middle line:84%
sort of has economic
superiority.

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:31.242 align:middle line:90%
So we make Outsiders.

00:21:31.242 --> 00:21:32.450 align:middle line:90%
There are a lot of Outsiders.

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:33.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We crank them out.

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:33.540 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:33.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: We crank them out.

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:34.996 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So more Outsiders.

00:21:34.996 --> 00:21:40.115 align:middle line:84%
And what would be maybe
the less populated?

00:21:40.115 --> 00:21:42.710 align:middle line:90%


00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:44.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: That's
a good question.

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:48.985 align:middle line:84%
I would say, most likely,
probably Educators

00:21:48.985 --> 00:21:50.244 align:middle line:90%
would be the least.

00:21:50.244 --> 00:21:51.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yeah,
because it doesn't

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:54.110 align:middle line:90%
require a lot of Educators.

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:57.410 align:middle line:90%
Gandhi was an Educator.

00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:02.140 align:middle line:84%
It only took one of him to
spread an idea, you know?

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:05.720 align:middle line:84%
Because their realm
is ideas, and an idea

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:08.000 align:middle line:84%
can spread quickly with the
written word or the spoken

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:08.240 align:middle line:90%
word.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.213 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the population
doesn't require as many

00:22:10.213 --> 00:22:10.713 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:22:10.713 --> 00:22:11.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yeah.

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:12.910 align:middle line:90%
We're a dying breed.

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:15.500 align:middle line:90%


00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:16.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm a dinosaur.

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:18.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're a dinosaur.

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:22.360 align:middle line:84%
It's funny because when I had
various people take the test,

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:25.420 align:middle line:84%
there were a fair number
of Educators among them.

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:28.050 align:middle line:84%
So maybe that's because
we like to share ideas

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:31.010 align:middle line:84%
and we're attracted to each
other because of that element.

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:33.052 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yeah, and
that's interesting.

00:22:33.052 --> 00:22:34.380 align:middle line:90%
That's your society.

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:35.270 align:middle line:90%
That's your tribe.

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, mostly Outsiders
and Educators it seems.

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:40.770 align:middle line:90%
Oddly.

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:41.590 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:43.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Well, which may
not be globally representative,

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:43.870 align:middle line:90%
but it's--

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:45.286 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, no,
it's just-- this

00:22:45.286 --> 00:22:49.075 align:middle line:84%
is Sedona, Arizona, A, so just
has a different population.

00:22:49.075 --> 00:22:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Probably everyone
there is an Outsider.

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:51.340 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Enough said.

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:52.506 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, enough said.

00:22:52.506 --> 00:22:55.740 align:middle line:84%
So OK, now, what if
you score more evenly?

00:22:55.740 --> 00:23:00.140 align:middle line:84%
One person scored virtually
evenly on four of the types.

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:02.056 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Outsider.

00:23:02.056 --> 00:23:05.030 align:middle line:84%
When you can see yourself
in all of the types,

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:06.930 align:middle line:84%
it's very likely that
you're an Outsider.

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:10.780 align:middle line:84%
That's a corollary to the test
that if it's very difficult

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:14.300 align:middle line:84%
to isolate one or two, then
likely you're the Outsider who

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:17.110 align:middle line:84%
can-- because the Outsider's
Dharma-- your Dharma,

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:21.300 align:middle line:84%
Regina-- is to understand
each of the types.

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:23.970 align:middle line:84%
So the Outsider has, in a
sense, the toughest road,

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:28.460 align:middle line:84%
because they have to learn how
to be Educators, Warriors, when

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.290 align:middle line:90%
society needs it from them.

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:32.264 align:middle line:84%
Outsiders have the
ability to wear many hats.

00:23:32.264 --> 00:23:32.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: I'll take
on the Laborer coat,

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:37.197 align:middle line:84%
take it off, put on the
Merchant coat when I need to.

00:23:37.197 --> 00:23:39.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is good to know
since are so many of us, this--

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:40.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Adaptable.

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:41.404 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --valuable
information.

00:23:41.404 --> 00:23:44.557 align:middle line:84%
We are adaptable and we
need to remain adaptable.

00:23:44.557 --> 00:23:46.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: But when Outsiders
come to me for readings,

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:52.030 align:middle line:84%
my job is then to say, listen,
you can be anybody you want,

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:55.950 align:middle line:84%
you're very adaptable, but this
is your basic core expression.

00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And I might say,
listen, just focus

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:00.740 align:middle line:84%
on being a Warrior for
the next five years.

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:01.930 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:04.344 align:middle line:84%
And that helps to put
you on your track.

00:24:04.344 --> 00:24:06.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you can
see that in their chart.

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:07.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: We can, yeah.

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:08.154 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's wonderful.

00:24:08.154 --> 00:24:09.930 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, we're
going to start going

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:12.202 align:middle line:84%
into the relational aspects
of the conversation,

00:24:12.202 --> 00:24:13.910 align:middle line:84%
and one thing you
write about in the book

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:19.730 align:middle line:84%
is that if you are taking
kind of a baseline of society,

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:25.412 align:middle line:84%
women tend to fall into
the role of Laborer.

00:24:25.412 --> 00:24:29.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: It is an
evolutionary sort of look.

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:32.800 align:middle line:84%
In my book, I talk about women
as Laborers, men as Warriors,

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.780 align:middle line:84%
because even the most
mild-mannered man

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:40.150 align:middle line:84%
within an intimate
relationship assumes

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:42.650 align:middle line:90%
the role of the Warrior.

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:45.440 align:middle line:84%
In a sense he becomes
the penetrator.

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- so every man has
to learn how to be a Warrior.

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:54.200 align:middle line:84%
That's what a lot
of the initiations

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.640 align:middle line:90%
in the teenage years center on.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And our society-- the Western
society, which is so free,

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.250 align:middle line:84%
we've lost a lot of
these initiations

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:04.800 align:middle line:84%
so boys have to try
to do it themselves

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:08.910 align:middle line:84%
through sports, fraternities,
drinking too much,

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:11.660 align:middle line:84%
climbing buildings,
testing themselves to prove

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:14.430 align:middle line:84%
that, hey, I'm not a
boy anymore, I'm a man.

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then let's talk
about the overlay of that

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:21.520 align:middle line:84%
usually has inconvenient
energy patterns for people who

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.740 align:middle line:84%
are educating them, maybe even
their parents and such, so

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:26.800 align:middle line:90%
they drug them.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yes, which is one
of the worst things you can do.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.490 align:middle line:84%
What ancient societies
did is they recognized

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:35.425 align:middle line:84%
that this time was coming,
and the elders in the tribe

00:25:35.425 --> 00:25:40.420 align:middle line:84%
would take that boy away
from the social structure

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:43.000 align:middle line:84%
and lead them through
one of these initiations.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.440 align:middle line:84%
It can be a walkabout through
nature or some kind of test

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.180 align:middle line:90%
that the elders controlled.

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:52.860 align:middle line:84%
So they knew it was safe,
because they controlled

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:54.980 align:middle line:90%
the environment to some degree.

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:57.780 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't completely wild,
but there's still the chance

00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:58.784 align:middle line:90%
of harm for that boy.

00:25:58.784 --> 00:25:59.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:00.900 align:middle line:84%
Because they're pushing
their boundaries.

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:01.660 align:middle line:90%
They have to.

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:03.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yes.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And once that was done, and the
boy went through that ordeal,

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:10.110 align:middle line:84%
and faced their fear,
and came out of it,

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:13.190 align:middle line:84%
the boy dies, basically,
and becomes a man.

00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:16.140 align:middle line:84%
Then he gets reintroduced
into society.

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:19.626 align:middle line:84%
So the ordeal happens here, not
within the social structure.

00:26:19.626 --> 00:26:21.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But right
now, it's happening

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:22.990 align:middle line:84%
within the social
structure and people

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:25.740 align:middle line:84%
are trying to mediate
it all the time

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:27.680 align:middle line:84%
or they're trying
to self-medicate.

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:30.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yeah, they're
trying to deal with it rather

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:31.520 align:middle line:90%
than encouraging it--

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:32.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:32.853 align:middle line:90%
It's very sad.

00:26:32.853 --> 00:26:34.190 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: --in a healthy way.

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And women have-- now, for boys
it's harder, I should say,

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:41.630 align:middle line:84%
because for women,
once menstruation,

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:43.620 align:middle line:84%
with the first
menstruation, this

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:47.430 align:middle line:84%
is a sign that the girl is now
becoming a woman or on her way.

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:49.282 align:middle line:90%
Boys don't have that.

00:26:49.282 --> 00:26:52.470 align:middle line:84%
So it's a little bit harder
for them to find themselves,

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:54.070 align:middle line:84%
which is why the
elders of the tribe

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:55.680 align:middle line:84%
are very important
in teaching them.

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.920 align:middle line:10%
And I talk about, in the
book, specific things

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:00.850 align:middle line:10%
you can do to help
your-- to help

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:04.200 align:middle line:10%
you become-- to embody
that Warrior ethic.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.520 align:middle line:90%
And what is a Warrior?

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:09.420 align:middle line:84%
A Warrior protects those who
can't protect themselves.

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:14.090 align:middle line:84%
So whatever your Dharma
type-- I, as a man,

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:16.320 align:middle line:84%
if something happened
right now, it's

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:19.280 align:middle line:84%
my Dharma, my duty, to turn
around and step on that roach

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:22.480 align:middle line:84%
if it's there, or
to protect society.

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And equipment, and you, and
everyone else from danger.

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:27.900 align:middle line:90%
Nevermind that I'm an Educator.

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:32.940 align:middle line:84%
That's a more basic
kind of primal role

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:36.060 align:middle line:84%
that we all have to learn
to become masculine men,

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:40.380 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes you'll see men who
are grown up, they're 30 or 40,

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:41.380 align:middle line:90%
but they're still boys--

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:42.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ooh, I--

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: --inside.

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:44.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You see a lot of that.

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:46.675 align:middle line:84%
That's more dominant,
it seems, than men

00:27:46.675 --> 00:27:49.730 align:middle line:84%
who've been able to go through
the process of really becoming

00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:51.505 align:middle line:84%
men and taking on
that responsibility.

00:27:51.505 --> 00:27:52.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: And
have compassion.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:53.499 align:middle line:90%
It's not easy.

00:27:53.499 --> 00:27:54.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I do.

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:55.900 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And society doesn't really
promote it or allow it even.

00:27:58.440 --> 00:27:59.256 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yeah.

00:27:59.256 --> 00:28:00.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:05.040 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, the basic
biological, you can say,

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:07.280 align:middle line:84%
role of the woman
is as a nurturer,

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:10.730 align:middle line:84%
and remember I said earlier
that Laborers build and nurture.

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:16.550 align:middle line:84%
Society is built around
the hearth, the-- one

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:20.130 align:middle line:84%
of my mentors used to say,
if it weren't for women,

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:23.130 align:middle line:84%
all men would still
live in caves.

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:25.270 align:middle line:84%
We don't have that
organizing principle,

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:27.960 align:middle line:84%
so the woman is the
center of value.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.930 align:middle line:84%
The word for it in
Sanskrit is Shakti.

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:32.930 align:middle line:90%
In Hebrew, it's Shekhinah.

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:35.950 align:middle line:84%
This sense of the
divine manifest

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:40.610 align:middle line:84%
and it's most manifest
in women as brilliance,

00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:43.990 align:middle line:84%
as shine, which is why
commercials for hair products--

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:47.360 align:middle line:84%
your hair will shine,
you will be brilliant--

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:51.040 align:middle line:84%
because this is an essential
quality of femininity.

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:55.430 align:middle line:84%
It's brilliant, bright, and it's
what brings value to anything.

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:57.674 align:middle line:84%
If there is a
woman-- and Laborers

00:28:57.674 --> 00:28:58.840 align:middle line:90%
do that as well, by the way.

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:00.710 align:middle line:90%
They create value.

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:04.690 align:middle line:84%
Like Merchants, they build
the things that have value.

00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:07.090 align:middle line:84%
So the fundamental role
of the woman-- and this

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:10.430 align:middle line:84%
may sound a little bit
misogynistic or at least

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:13.150 align:middle line:84%
patriarchal until you
understand what I truly

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:15.340 align:middle line:90%
mean-- is as the Laborer.

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:20.271 align:middle line:84%
You give birth, you nurture,
and you build, nurture society,

00:29:20.271 --> 00:29:20.770 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:22.195 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which creates
the glue for society.

00:29:22.195 --> 00:29:23.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: It is the glue.

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:25.250 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And even this idea of
the hearth and cooking,

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:33.420 align:middle line:84%
think about the cultures
that are best known

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:35.710 align:middle line:84%
for their food
and their cuisine,

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:37.260 align:middle line:90%
like the French cuisine--

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:38.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Italian.

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:39.426 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Italian food.

00:29:39.426 --> 00:29:40.800 align:middle line:84%
And then think
about the cultures

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:43.990 align:middle line:84%
that are best known for their
lovers, and their sensuality,

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:44.545 align:middle line:90%
and romance.

00:29:44.545 --> 00:29:45.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Same.

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:46.500 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: It's the same.

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:49.130 align:middle line:84%
So there is some
link between working

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:53.400 align:middle line:84%
with food and the senses--
touch, taste, smell--

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:56.340 align:middle line:84%
and your ability to
express sensuality.

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:59.380 align:middle line:90%


00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:00.930 align:middle line:84%
So learning how
to work with food

00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:03.860 align:middle line:84%
and learning how
to nurture society

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:07.110 align:middle line:84%
is the role of the Laborer
and, in a biological sense,

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:08.590 align:middle line:90%
of women.

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:11.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that just
lays a general, as you say,

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:12.255 align:middle line:90%
primal platform--

00:30:12.255 --> 00:30:13.130 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Correct.

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:14.090 align:middle line:90%
That's the primal platform.

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:15.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --with many variances.

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:19.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and assuming we
choose our incarnation path,

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:23.900 align:middle line:84%
we are making a commitment,
at any given time or lifetime,

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:27.076 align:middle line:84%
to one of the other, and
to embody one or the other.

00:30:27.076 --> 00:30:28.450 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: The
problem is if we

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:32.330 align:middle line:84%
don't have this handle, that
very basic primal platform,

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:36.250 align:middle line:84%
then building on your
Dharma type-- so I'm a man.

00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:39.390 align:middle line:84%
At some level I have Warrior
qualities that are just

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:42.860 align:middle line:84%
wired in me, but--
and if I don't

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:46.500 align:middle line:84%
have that handled, how will I
express myself as an Educator?

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:48.130 align:middle line:84%
How will I be able
to fully express

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:52.230 align:middle line:84%
my personality if that base
foundation isn't there?

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:54.300 align:middle line:84%
Which is why I
teach people-- and I

00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:56.180 align:middle line:84%
talk about it in
the book-- get this

00:30:56.180 --> 00:31:00.030 align:middle line:84%
down first if you really want to
be able to express your Dharma

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:00.530 align:middle line:90%
type.

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:03.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and I
noticed more in my age group

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:05.910 align:middle line:84%
with my peers, my
friends, I have

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:08.610 align:middle line:84%
quite a number of girlfriends
that either never married,

00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:12.990 align:middle line:84%
or never had children, and it's
a very different expression,

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:15.260 align:middle line:84%
on one hand, but what
happened in their lives,

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:19.050 align:middle line:84%
in almost every case,
is they ended up

00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:24.750 align:middle line:84%
becoming very involved in, like,
the lives of their neighbor's

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:28.070 align:middle line:84%
children and that became their
children, or their nieces

00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:33.125 align:middle line:84%
and nephews, or some
other means to utilize

00:31:33.125 --> 00:31:35.000 align:middle line:84%
that nurturing that's
innately sitting there,

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.580 align:middle line:84%
even though they're
gung-ho in their career,

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:40.050 align:middle line:84%
travel photographers,
all these things,

00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:41.642 align:middle line:84%
it still had to
show itself somehow.

00:31:41.642 --> 00:31:42.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yes.

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:43.080 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:43.950 align:middle line:90%
And it will.

00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:46.580 align:middle line:84%
It will whether you
allow it or not, and--

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:47.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:49.030 align:middle line:90%
It just seemed to be natural.

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:52.100 align:middle line:84%
I watched it evolve over
the last few decades

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:54.050 align:middle line:90%
and it's been interesting.

00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:57.760 align:middle line:84%
They still found a way to
show the Laborer portion.

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:01.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: The thing is, these
ideas, these names and labels,

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:04.420 align:middle line:84%
they're not something somebody
thought of, thought up,

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:08.060 align:middle line:84%
they're something someone
observed in human nature

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:10.460 align:middle line:84%
and said, OK, we'll
call this a Laborer.

00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:12.100 align:middle line:84%
It's like the signs
of the zodiac.

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:15.280 align:middle line:84%
People think, well,
where's the bull in Taurus?

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:17.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't see a bull, there's
just a bunch of stars,

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:20.040 align:middle line:84%
and you're right, it is
just a bunch of stars.

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:23.290 align:middle line:84%
There is no well-outlined
shape of a bull,

00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:25.320 align:middle line:84%
let's say, in this
part of the sky.

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:29.290 align:middle line:84%
What there is, though, is that
when the ancients saw planets

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:32.450 align:middle line:84%
passing through that
little swath of the sky,

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:35.409 align:middle line:84%
they noticed it had an
effect on agriculture.

00:32:35.409 --> 00:32:37.950 align:middle line:84%
So when the sun was there, when
Saturn was-- when the sun was

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:39.230 align:middle line:90%
there, things would grow.

00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:41.130 align:middle line:84%
When Saturn's there,
things don't grow.

00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:44.000 align:middle line:84%
So OK, that part of the sky
has to do with agriculture,

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.400 align:middle line:84%
so let's put a bull
there to symbolize that.

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:47.530 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:48.950 align:middle line:90%
That's how astrology works.

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:49.690 align:middle line:90%
It's not so much that we put--

00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
through observation.

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: --our ideas,
we observe what's happening

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:57.490 align:middle line:84%
and then try to capture
that information

00:32:57.490 --> 00:32:59.880 align:middle line:84%
in an easy to access
way, which, in this case,

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:01.827 align:middle line:84%
is the zodiac and
the Dharma types.

00:33:01.827 --> 00:33:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:02.410 --> 00:33:05.110 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now let's go
to-- we've looked

00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:06.380 align:middle line:90%
at our base primal types.

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, you say here that women,
it is our innate nature

00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:16.850 align:middle line:84%
to poke at, test, and look
for higher qualities in men.

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And that is what we
truly should be doing

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.960 align:middle line:84%
is to test them,
and poke at them,

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:25.830 align:middle line:84%
and let them be the best they
can be, prove themselves to us.

00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:28.290 align:middle line:84%
But instead, you get
also, a lot of women

00:33:28.290 --> 00:33:31.210 align:middle line:84%
who are total enablers,
which have allowed men

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:31.835 align:middle line:90%
to remain boys.

00:33:31.835 --> 00:33:32.835 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON CHOKOISKY: Yeah.

00:33:32.835 --> 00:33:35.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- this is nothing
but evolutionary biology,

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:38.040 align:middle line:84%
by the way, because from the
standpoint of evolutionary

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:45.420 align:middle line:84%
biology, women face a much more
precarious situation in having

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:49.430 align:middle line:84%
to maintain a pregnancy for nine
months and then rear and raise

00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:51.360 align:middle line:90%
a child for however many years.

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:52.560 align:middle line:90%
They're vulnerable.

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:55.940 align:middle line:84%
So you want to test the
man, the partner, who's

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:59.850 align:middle line:84%
with you to see if they're going
to be capable of helping you.

00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:03.220 align:middle line:84%
If they're real men to sort
of support you and nurture,

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:04.770 align:middle line:90%
find food for you.

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:07.220 align:middle line:84%
This goes back to
hunter gatherer times.

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:09.980 align:middle line:90%
So it's innate.

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:12.989 align:middle line:84%
So a woman will test
you by-- test you

00:34:12.989 --> 00:34:17.510 align:middle line:84%
if you're a man by, there
are a number of ways,

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:20.857 align:middle line:84%
but essentially by keeping
true to who you are.

00:34:20.857 --> 00:34:22.190 align:middle line:90%
You didn't take out the garbage?

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:23.489 align:middle line:84%
Hey, why didn't you
take out the garbage?

00:34:23.489 --> 00:34:24.812 align:middle line:90%
Means, why are you sleeping in?

00:34:24.812 --> 00:34:25.770 align:middle line:90%
Why are you being lazy?

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:28.500 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't you a Warrior
standing up to protect me?

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.850 align:middle line:84%
That's what why didn't you
take out the garbage means.

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And for a man to not
recognize that, oh, just

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.659 align:middle line:84%
stop nagging, I'll do it
later, I'm watching the game.

00:34:36.659 --> 00:34:37.199 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The bin's
only half-full.

00:34:37.199 --> 00:34:37.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: It's
only half-full.

00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:39.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Don't worry about it.

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:43.381 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: So there's
interplay, there's play there,

00:34:43.381 --> 00:34:45.710 align:middle line:84%
and the man can become
too lazy, a woman

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:48.070 align:middle line:84%
can become too
demanding, but you have

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:49.570 align:middle line:90%
to recognize what's happening.

00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:50.370 align:middle line:90%
It's a test.

00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:51.440 align:middle line:90%
Everything is a test.

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:52.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:54.706 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, what are men
looking for in women?

00:34:54.706 --> 00:34:56.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Well, again,
from the standpoint

00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:58.640 align:middle line:84%
of evolutionary
biology, men are looking

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:05.030 align:middle line:84%
for a woman who can reproduce,
and this is very basic.

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:09.500 align:middle line:84%
But beyond that, men are looking
for the qualities of Shakti,

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:13.380 align:middle line:84%
as I mentioned earlier, that
shine, that divinity that says,

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:15.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm a radiant being.

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And the Goddess in
traditional cultures

00:35:19.410 --> 00:35:22.790 align:middle line:84%
is the civilizing
impulse of society.

00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:27.030 align:middle line:84%
In Vedic traditions,
she's called Saraswati.

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:30.785 align:middle line:84%
And Saraswati is the goddess
of culture, of agriculture,

00:35:30.785 --> 00:35:33.950 align:middle line:84%
of music, of art
and poetry, and men

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:37.930 align:middle line:84%
don't come up with music, art,
and poetry for themselves.

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:40.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, there's usually
a subject or object of it.

00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:43.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: There is an object
and it is usually Shakti,

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:47.660 align:middle line:84%
because we see it, and
some other part of us

00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:50.390 align:middle line:84%
wakes up and connects
us to our divine,

00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:52.310 align:middle line:90%
and that brings that out.

00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:58.110 align:middle line:84%
So Shakti is-- it's the
reason we're all here, really.

00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:01.280 align:middle line:84%
We're not here just to
survive, as human beings.

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:04.790 align:middle line:84%
In "Dead Poets Society," Robin
Williams-- the late Robin

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:08.070 align:middle line:84%
Williams-- says, you
know, law, medicine,

00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:10.980 align:middle line:84%
these are noble professions,
but the reason we're here

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:13.420 align:middle line:90%
is love, poetry, and art, right?

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:15.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
that was beautiful.

00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:15.910 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:16.600 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: That's Shakti.

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:17.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:17.660 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:24.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, we'll come back to
the kind of faked versions,

00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:26.900 align:middle line:84%
or the girl/woman,
boy/man later,

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:31.070 align:middle line:84%
but first, let's look at how
relationship and sexuality

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:33.350 align:middle line:84%
plays out in each of the
types that we've already

00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:36.570 align:middle line:84%
had the overlay for--
I mean, the base for.

00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:39.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Well, if
you are a man or a woman,

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:41.320 align:middle line:84%
and you're an
Educator, and you're

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:45.280 align:middle line:84%
looking to attract a partner
in your life, for Educators,

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:48.310 align:middle line:90%
we're not the party hardy kind.

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:56.810 align:middle line:84%
We're more of the aloof knowers,
the generators of wisdom.

00:36:56.810 --> 00:37:00.520 align:middle line:84%
So it can be very painful
to go to parties and kind

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:05.167 align:middle line:84%
of not fit in, or try to make
yourself look a certain way,

00:37:05.167 --> 00:37:05.875 align:middle line:90%
or have muscles--

00:37:05.875 --> 00:37:06.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, go out--

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:06.890 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: --or have that.

00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:08.473 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --feeling
awkward and awful.

00:37:08.473 --> 00:37:10.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: And
you feel awkward.

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:15.520 align:middle line:84%
Your strength is in your
wisdom and, let's say,

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:18.670 align:middle line:84%
so I'm a man, from a male
perspective, if I'm on a date,

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:21.080 align:middle line:84%
rather than going like
this, hey, how you doing?

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:22.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Want to arm wrestle?

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:23.194 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Hey, how you doing?

00:37:23.194 --> 00:37:24.060 align:middle line:90%
Hey.

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:25.160 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:28.700 align:middle line:84%
I want to show my
strength is in my wisdom.

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:32.100 align:middle line:84%
Oh, this wine, yes, this
is from France, 1942,

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:33.850 align:middle line:84%
and that year was a
very interesting year,

00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:35.580 align:middle line:90%
and let me tell you about it.

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:37.246 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, you
guys sometimes that--

00:37:37.246 --> 00:37:38.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Hmm.

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:40.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that also seen
as a know-it-all sometimes?

00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:43.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Oh, yes, and
it can be painful too,

00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:47.410 align:middle line:84%
which is why certain
types go well together.

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:49.770 align:middle line:84%
So Educators match
well with Warriors,

00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:51.250 align:middle line:84%
and we'll talk
about this, I guess,

00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:53.090 align:middle line:84%
in a second, because Warriors
go, yeah, yeah, yeah,

00:37:53.090 --> 00:37:53.950 align:middle line:90%
OK, enough of that.

00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:55.430 align:middle line:90%
Now, next.

00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:57.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They
want to get to it.

00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:58.853 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: They
hold you accountable

00:37:58.853 --> 00:38:00.400 align:middle line:84%
and they'll keep
you from wandering

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.730 align:middle line:84%
if you're an Educator,
whereas the Educator gives

00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:05.950 align:middle line:84%
the Warrior their highest
cause to fight for.

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:08.810 align:middle line:84%
Honey, did you see that
there was a volcano--

00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:10.540 align:middle line:90%
an earthquake in Nepal?

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:11.510 align:middle line:90%
There is?

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:13.710 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god, I need to go help.

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:15.120 align:middle line:90%
Well, let me tell you about it.

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And so Educators feed
Warriors the just cause.

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:23.090 align:middle line:84%
But back to this idea of how
to attract the mate for you.

00:38:23.090 --> 00:38:24.920 align:middle line:90%
Be yourself.

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And you see this in
self-help books everywhere.

00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:30.460 align:middle line:84%
What do men want
to see in a woman

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:32.200 align:middle line:84%
and what do women
want to see in a man?

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:35.510 align:middle line:84%
It's confidence, a sense
of self, but where does

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:36.700 align:middle line:90%
that come from?

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:39.310 align:middle line:84%
It comes from knowing
your Dharma, your purpose.

00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And again, that's why I
sort of defer back to that.

00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:46.840 align:middle line:84%
So be yourself as an Educator,
be yourself as a Warrior.

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Show your mate that you have a
cause that you're fighting for.

00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:51.906 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So as Warriors,
that's how you show up if you're

00:38:51.906 --> 00:38:52.865 align:middle line:90%
on a date, for example.

00:38:52.865 --> 00:38:53.572 align:middle line:90%
You meet someone.

00:38:53.572 --> 00:38:55.450 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Listen,
you might have no money,

00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:59.020 align:middle line:84%
you might have no job even,
but you take your date

00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:02.470 align:middle line:84%
and you show them that you
teach guitar to inner city kids,

00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:05.130 align:middle line:84%
and they look up to
you, and you create

00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:09.320 align:middle line:84%
that's safe space for them,
your date will admire that,

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:12.100 align:middle line:84%
regardless of the fact that
the other stuff isn't going on.

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:16.150 align:middle line:84%
Show your potential partner
what your true purpose

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:18.120 align:middle line:90%
is, express it.

00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:20.689 align:middle line:84%
So if you're a Laborer, show
them how nurturing you are.

00:39:20.689 --> 00:39:22.480 align:middle line:84%
If you're a Merchant,
show them how fun you

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:25.300 align:middle line:84%
are, and just, like, being
with you is, like, wow,

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm always smiling
when I'm around you.

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:27.840 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:28.970 align:middle line:90%
That's their gift.

00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:32.420 align:middle line:84%
They might not know where-- they
might not have the other gifts,

00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:34.840 align:middle line:84%
but that's OK, you
have your gift.

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:37.810 align:middle line:84%
That's how you attract
the right person for you.

00:39:37.810 --> 00:39:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And in the book,
I talk about which

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:42.940 align:middle line:84%
places to hang out--
briefly talk about this.

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:44.440 align:middle line:84%
If you're an Educator,
you might not

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:46.050 align:middle line:84%
want to hang out
at the night clubs

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:47.710 align:middle line:84%
all the time, because
the people who--

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:48.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
not who you are.

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:49.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: That's
not who you are

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.150 align:middle line:84%
and you won't find the
right people there.

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:51.733 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But Merchants
do well there.

00:39:51.733 --> 00:39:53.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: They do well, yes.

00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:57.871 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of
a basic nutshell.

00:39:57.871 --> 00:40:00.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So a Warrior has to
show they can do what they do.

00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:04.800 align:middle line:84%
A Merchant has to show that they
can really provide a good time,

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:06.829 align:middle line:90%
essentially, create fun and--

00:40:06.829 --> 00:40:07.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Light.

00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:08.990 align:middle line:84%
Take you away from
your troubles.

00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:10.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Take you away
from your troubles.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: When I'm
around a Merchant,

00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:13.150 align:middle line:84%
I forget about my
depression, I forget

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:15.710 align:middle line:90%
about my fears and my anxieties.

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:16.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm just having fun.

00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:19.157 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now, what
about being around Laborers?

00:40:19.157 --> 00:40:20.656 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Being
around Laborers--

00:40:20.656 --> 00:40:22.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or Laborers
projecting so that they

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:23.900 align:middle line:90%
can find the right match.

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:26.137 align:middle line:90%
What do they need to project?

00:40:26.137 --> 00:40:28.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: So for men
and women, it's different,

00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:29.220 align:middle line:90%
so let's start with men.

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:35.615 align:middle line:84%
If I'm a Laborer man, I show
that I am solid, dependable--

00:40:35.615 --> 00:40:36.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You can--

00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:36.710 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: --and you can't--

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:38.126 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --build
stuff, do stuff.

00:40:38.126 --> 00:40:39.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: --you
can't push me over.

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:43.120 align:middle line:84%
You're stupid,
get away from him.

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:45.800 align:middle line:84%
You don't use force, you're
just solid, you're there.

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:48.740 align:middle line:84%
Harrison Ford, Laborer
type, has a certain quality.

00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:50.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm useful, number two.

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:51.790 align:middle line:90%
Oh, flat tire.

00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:53.431 align:middle line:90%
I'll fix that for you.

00:40:53.431 --> 00:40:54.496 align:middle line:90%
Oh, house is leaking.

00:40:54.496 --> 00:40:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Let me take care
of that for you.

00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:59.270 align:middle line:84%
Laborers often show
love through acts

00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:02.190 align:middle line:84%
of caring rather
than, oh, honey, you

00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:03.830 align:middle line:90%
have the most beautiful eyes.

00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:07.570 align:middle line:84%
They tend to be less
verbal and more kinesthetic

00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:09.540 align:middle line:90%
in their display of emotion.

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:12.180 align:middle line:84%
But they also have
a strong-- Laborers

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:13.500 align:middle line:90%
relate to the earth element.

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:17.820 align:middle line:84%
Earth has to do with smell
and they have a strong sensor

00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:19.700 align:middle line:90%
pheromones chemistry.

00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:23.160 align:middle line:84%
They'll know if you're the one
just the first second they meet

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:26.410 align:middle line:84%
you just by that subtle
smell, or they'll

00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:28.670 align:middle line:84%
know if you're
not the right one.

00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:29.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's earthy.

00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:35.289 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: It's earthy
and you can't take

00:41:35.289 --> 00:41:36.580 align:middle line:90%
the square root of a pheromone.

00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:39.890 align:middle line:84%
You can't figure it
out, but you know it.

00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And Laborers have that
heart to heart connection,

00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:45.080 align:middle line:84%
or they'll take your hand
and just give you a massage,

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:46.130 align:middle line:90%
and you go, oh, OK.

00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and so
women who are Laborers then,

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:52.849 align:middle line:84%
they would be maybe the ones
who would make a beautiful meal

00:41:52.849 --> 00:41:53.390 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:54.340 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: A beautiful meal.

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:56.550 align:middle line:84%
The way to a person's heart
is through their stomach,

00:41:56.550 --> 00:42:01.060 align:middle line:84%
and I say person because
it works both ways.

00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And again, that sensual
quality of touch,

00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:06.420 align:middle line:84%
that ability to nurture,
and the man just

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:08.022 align:middle line:90%
feels nurtured, taken care of.

00:42:08.022 --> 00:42:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like I
can take a breath.

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:10.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: I
can take a breath.

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:12.608 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's talk
about the Outsider again,

00:42:12.608 --> 00:42:13.310 align:middle line:90%
because--

00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:13.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Outsider.

00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:14.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --since
there are so many.

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:15.560 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Exotic.

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:18.420 align:middle line:90%
You are exotic.

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:21.210 align:middle line:84%
I was in a long 30-year
Outsider period,

00:42:21.210 --> 00:42:24.270 align:middle line:84%
and I would say that,
as I was dating,

00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:26.870 align:middle line:84%
the thing people found
most interesting about me

00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:28.640 align:middle line:90%
was that I was different.

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:30.300 align:middle line:84%
I spoke different
languages, I had

00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:32.720 align:middle line:84%
traveled to different
places, and I brought

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:36.730 align:middle line:90%
a sense of wonder, mysticism.

00:42:36.730 --> 00:42:38.620 align:middle line:84%
Whether-- again, so
let's say you're a woman,

00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:40.125 align:middle line:84%
you're an Outsider, and
you're meeting a man,

00:42:40.125 --> 00:42:42.020 align:middle line:84%
and he's a Merchant
or something else,

00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:44.790 align:middle line:84%
he's going to try
to figure you out.

00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:48.986 align:middle line:84%
What is it about you that's,
like, I can't place you.

00:42:48.986 --> 00:42:51.480 align:middle line:84%
You can't place me,
You can't own me, man.

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:53.270 align:middle line:84%
But here's the
mystery that I bring.

00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:53.960 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:55.335 align:middle line:84%
Let's get out of
this restaurant.

00:42:55.335 --> 00:42:57.450 align:middle line:84%
Let's go jump in
the fountain, right?

00:42:57.450 --> 00:42:59.500 align:middle line:84%
There's that sense
of impulsivity,

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:03.625 align:middle line:84%
but also innovation, new,
newness that Outsiders bring.

00:43:03.625 --> 00:43:04.730 align:middle line:90%
It's exciting.

00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:07.174 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's exciting, and
perhaps also intimidating,

00:43:07.174 --> 00:43:08.590 align:middle line:84%
depending on the
type you're with,

00:43:08.590 --> 00:43:11.770 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to talk
about type, the best matches

00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:13.184 align:middle line:90%
and mismatches for each type.

00:43:13.184 --> 00:43:13.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: OK.

00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:14.615 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK?

00:43:14.615 --> 00:43:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Outsiders,
because they are adaptable,

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:21.210 align:middle line:84%
can fit when they want to
with any of the other types.

00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:23.100 align:middle line:84%
Often it's best to
have another Outsider,

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:25.240 align:middle line:84%
though, because you really
understand each other.

00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:25.740 align:middle line:90%
You--

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:28.079 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know things
are going to shift a lot.

00:43:28.079 --> 00:43:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: And even more
fundamental than that is you

00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:34.650 align:middle line:84%
understand each other's
need to be different,

00:43:34.650 --> 00:43:35.590 align:middle line:90%
and to have freedom.

00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:38.070 align:middle line:84%
Outsiders require freedom
more than anything else.

00:43:38.070 --> 00:43:40.740 align:middle line:84%
As much as they require
air, they need freedom.

00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:41.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's true.

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:43.970 align:middle line:84%
I know, my friends and I
will often-- or there'll

00:43:43.970 --> 00:43:44.680 align:middle line:90%
be little games.

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:46.410 align:middle line:84%
What's the most
important thing to you?

00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:47.420 align:middle line:90%
I always say freedom.

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:49.031 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Freedom.

00:43:49.031 --> 00:43:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And I should have started
that at the beginning,

00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:53.780 align:middle line:84%
because freedom is the
keyword for Outsiders,

00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:55.830 align:middle line:90%
wisdom for Educators.

00:43:55.830 --> 00:43:57.246 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What is
it for each one?

00:43:57.246 --> 00:43:58.420 align:middle line:90%
The keyword.

00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:00.470 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: So
value for Merchants,

00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:07.490 align:middle line:84%
and stability or nourishment
for Laborers, and for Warriors,

00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:10.850 align:middle line:90%
it's actually purpose.

00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:13.280 align:middle line:84%
Having something to
fight for gives them

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:15.540 align:middle line:90%
their purpose, right?

00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:18.730 align:middle line:84%
I'll take a bullet, but who
am I taking a bullet for?

00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:21.230 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's the pope.

00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:23.400 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I'm willing to do
that, because that's

00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:24.930 align:middle line:90%
something high and worthy.

00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:26.260 align:middle line:90%
I will give my life for that.

00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:28.470 align:middle line:90%
And it makes them feel good.

00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:30.750 align:middle line:84%
On a lower level, it's,
you're Michael Jordan

00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:32.820 align:middle line:90%
you're playing for a team.

00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:34.750 align:middle line:84%
I'll sacrifice
myself for my team.

00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:36.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if it
sprains my ankle or not,

00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:38.580 align:middle line:90%
I'll dive for that ball, right?

00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Because it's my
team and teammates

00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:40.530 align:middle line:90%
that I'm fighting for.

00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:41.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a
kind of good lens

00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:44.370 align:middle line:84%
to look through when you look
at athletes in different Dharma

00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:45.800 align:middle line:90%
types.

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:48.352 align:middle line:84%
Does that usually show up
in the positions they play?

00:44:48.352 --> 00:44:50.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: With the
positions they play, how they--

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:51.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And the way they play.

00:44:51.070 --> 00:44:52.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: And
the way they play.

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:57.310 align:middle line:84%
I just read an article on the
plane about Jimmy Johnson,

00:44:57.310 --> 00:44:59.490 align:middle line:84%
the coach of the
Dallas Cowboys in 1993,

00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:01.430 align:middle line:90%
and how he motivate them.

00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And the thrust of the
article, basically,

00:45:03.610 --> 00:45:07.117 align:middle line:84%
was that some teams are
motivated by discipline.

00:45:07.117 --> 00:45:08.700 align:middle line:84%
This is what we're
going to do, you're

00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:10.700 align:middle line:84%
going to turn in at 10:00
PM, and tomorrow we're

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:12.420 align:middle line:84%
going to play the
game of our lives.

00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:15.630 align:middle line:90%
Other teams, by no discipline.

00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:18.080 align:middle line:84%
All right, I don't know where
you guys are going tonight,

00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:21.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to know,
no curfew, have fun,

00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:26.230 align:middle line:84%
get relaxed before the game, and
tomorrow just show up excited.

00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And those are
different strategies

00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:31.650 align:middle line:84%
from different types of
teams, and teams have

00:45:31.650 --> 00:45:33.120 align:middle line:90%
Dharma types, a collective--

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:34.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just like a
marriage or any partnership.

00:45:34.450 --> 00:45:36.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Just like a
marriage and a country.

00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:37.570 align:middle line:90%
America's a Merchant country.

00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:41.610 align:middle line:84%
Italy's a Merchant country--
Laborer, Merchant country.

00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:42.590 align:middle line:90%
So a team.

00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:44.360 align:middle line:84%
So once you know your
team's personality--

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:45.901 align:middle line:84%
and Jimmy Johnson
was a psychologist,

00:45:45.901 --> 00:45:48.130 align:middle line:84%
he studied psychology,
he understood well--

00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:52.056 align:middle line:90%
you know how to motivate them.

00:45:52.056 --> 00:45:53.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
go back now to

00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:57.060 align:middle line:84%
within the types, who each of
the types are most suited with.

00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:58.900 align:middle line:84%
So we just said
Outsiders can kind of

00:45:58.900 --> 00:45:59.890 align:middle line:84%
go anywhere they want as
long as they choose to.

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:01.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: They
can go anywhere,

00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:03.410 align:middle line:84%
but they feel at most at
home with other Outsiders.

00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:04.493 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Other Outsiders.

00:46:04.493 --> 00:46:06.160 align:middle line:90%
OK, how about the Merchant?

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: The
Merchant feels most

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:11.340 align:middle line:84%
at ease-- or their most
evolutionary partner

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:13.110 align:middle line:90%
is a Laborer.

00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:16.280 align:middle line:84%
Because Merchants
have the excitement,

00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:18.190 align:middle line:90%
but Merchants have a dilemma.

00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:22.320 align:middle line:84%
They have a hole in their
heart that often there's

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:25.340 align:middle line:84%
a sense of emptiness,
which they try

00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:28.820 align:middle line:84%
to fill with experiences, with
the newest radio, the newest

00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:32.740 align:middle line:84%
stereo, the newest
partner, the newest car,

00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:34.270 align:middle line:90%
but these things are temporary.

00:46:34.270 --> 00:46:37.400 align:middle line:90%
What fills them is charity.

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:40.420 align:middle line:84%
So the Merchant's gift
is the gift of giving.

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:44.140 align:middle line:84%
Laborers teach them that
better than any other type.

00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:45.369 align:middle line:90%
Laborers are stable.

00:46:45.369 --> 00:46:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
they're nourishing.

00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:48.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: There's
a nourishing quality,

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:51.940 align:middle line:90%
and they evolve together.

00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:56.500 align:middle line:84%
For the Laborer who can become
a little bit too complacent,

00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:58.330 align:middle line:90%
too stuck in a rut.

00:46:58.330 --> 00:47:00.780 align:middle line:84%
I only listen to that
classic rock station

00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:02.010 align:middle line:90%
and that's all I listen to.

00:47:02.010 --> 00:47:04.100 align:middle line:84%
It's Credence Clearwater
Revival every day

00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:06.880 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of my life.

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:12.540 align:middle line:84%
OK, CCR is great, but if
that's all you do every day,

00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:13.780 align:middle line:90%
you're stuck in a rut.

00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:14.950 align:middle line:90%
Merchants are exciting.

00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:15.980 align:middle line:90%
They get them out of their rut.

00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:17.896 align:middle line:84%
Hey, honey, I'm going
to take you by the hand.

00:47:17.896 --> 00:47:19.797 align:middle line:90%
Let's go take a staycation.

00:47:19.797 --> 00:47:20.880 align:middle line:90%
Let's go see the fountain.

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:22.907 align:middle line:84%
Let's go see the sunrise
above, I don't know,

00:47:22.907 --> 00:47:23.740 align:middle line:90%
above the mountains.

00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:25.474 align:middle line:84%
It takes them out
of their routine.

00:47:25.474 --> 00:47:26.390 align:middle line:90%
So they work together.

00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:27.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they
complement each other.

00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:29.588 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: It's not
always comfortable.

00:47:29.588 --> 00:47:33.630 align:middle line:84%
It's a sense of opposites
attract and work together.

00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:37.190 align:middle line:84%
The sense of opposites detract,
or don't work together,

00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:39.060 align:middle line:84%
is a Merchant--
since we're talking

00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:43.270 align:middle line:90%
about Merchants-- and Warriors.

00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:45.390 align:middle line:84%
Merchants and Warriors
don't work well together.

00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:48.446 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Purpose driven
and more sensually

00:47:48.446 --> 00:47:49.570 align:middle line:90%
pleasure driven in a sense.

00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:50.278 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yes.

00:47:50.278 --> 00:47:51.070 align:middle line:90%
Correct.

00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:53.202 align:middle line:84%
And they each give
up their principles--

00:47:53.202 --> 00:47:54.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To
accommodate the other.

00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:55.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: --when
they're around each other.

00:47:55.890 --> 00:47:57.848 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean that that
relationship can't work.

00:47:57.848 --> 00:48:00.810 align:middle line:84%
It means it needs
work, and it needs work

00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:04.440 align:middle line:84%
means communication,
communication, communication.

00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:10.440 align:middle line:84%
When I said, I don't know,
take out the garbage,

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:12.270 align:middle line:84%
I didn't mean to
scold you, what I

00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:14.850 align:middle line:84%
meant was that, because
there's something fermenting

00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:18.490 align:middle line:84%
and growing in there, it's
going to affect your allergies

00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:21.050 align:middle line:84%
and you won't feel
good tomorrow, right?

00:48:21.050 --> 00:48:23.680 align:middle line:84%
But this person heard,
take out the garbage.

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:25.872 align:middle line:90%
Why is she always yelling at me?

00:48:25.872 --> 00:48:26.830 align:middle line:90%
And the Warrior, right?

00:48:26.830 --> 00:48:28.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it takes
more communication--

00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:30.025 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Communication.

00:48:30.025 --> 00:48:32.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --than is
necessarily between types

00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:33.596 align:middle line:90%
that are compatible.

00:48:33.596 --> 00:48:35.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Communicate,
communicate as much as possible

00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:37.370 align:middle line:84%
so that that
Warrior, who's maybe

00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:39.790 align:middle line:84%
trying to protect
the Merchant, doesn't

00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:42.750 align:middle line:84%
sound like they're trying
to punish the Merchant,

00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:45.440 align:middle line:90%
and vice versa.

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:48.550 align:middle line:84%
So in relationships where the
types are less compatible,

00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:50.870 align:middle line:90%
communication's very important.

00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:52.940 align:middle line:90%
So that's the Merchant.

00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:54.610 align:middle line:90%
Opposites attract with Laborers.

00:48:54.610 --> 00:48:56.860 align:middle line:90%
Opposites detract with Warriors.

00:48:56.860 --> 00:48:59.230 align:middle line:90%
The Outsider, we talked about.

00:48:59.230 --> 00:49:02.400 align:middle line:84%
Then the Laborer,
again, same thing.

00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:04.700 align:middle line:90%
They work well with Merchants.

00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:09.870 align:middle line:84%
They disintegrate and they
detract around Educators.

00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:14.360 align:middle line:84%
Laborers like Oprah Winfrey
often say-- like Pavarotti--

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:17.510 align:middle line:84%
that when they're around quote,
unquote, "smart or worldly"

00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:19.640 align:middle line:90%
people, they feel diminished.

00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:21.780 align:middle line:84%
Even Oprah used to
say, I read somewhere,

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:23.770 align:middle line:84%
that when she's
around these doctors,

00:49:23.770 --> 00:49:27.350 align:middle line:84%
PhDs-- this is Oprah, the most
powerful woman in the world,

00:49:27.350 --> 00:49:29.510 align:middle line:84%
she could eat people
for breakfast,

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:32.510 align:middle line:84%
but she feels-- because
being a Laborer type,

00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:36.050 align:middle line:84%
there is a sense of, well,
I don't know these things,

00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:40.130 align:middle line:84%
therefore, I'm not enough,
and that's total bull.

00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:43.446 align:middle line:84%
Pavarotti couldn't read
music, but could he sing?

00:49:43.446 --> 00:49:44.550 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:49:44.550 --> 00:49:47.070 align:middle line:90%
What's important is the outcome.

00:49:47.070 --> 00:49:51.660 align:middle line:84%
So Laborers around Educators
may feel a little small,

00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:53.790 align:middle line:84%
and Educators
around Laborers may

00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:57.460 align:middle line:84%
feel that they are
not appreciated

00:49:57.460 --> 00:50:00.730 align:middle line:84%
for their subtle
gifts of wisdom,

00:50:00.730 --> 00:50:03.090 align:middle line:84%
that their wisdom
isn't understood.

00:50:03.090 --> 00:50:05.851 align:middle line:84%
It may be understood, but the
Laborer doesn't express it,

00:50:05.851 --> 00:50:06.350 align:middle line:90%
so again--

00:50:06.350 --> 00:50:07.766 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or the
Educator may want

00:50:07.766 --> 00:50:10.459 align:middle line:84%
to share all this
enlightened wisdom and all

00:50:10.459 --> 00:50:12.000 align:middle line:84%
of their interests,
and the Laborer's

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.650 align:middle line:84%
wanting to build
them a rock garden.

00:50:13.650 --> 00:50:14.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yes.

00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:14.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's like--

00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:14.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Beautiful.

00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:16.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --not happening.

00:50:16.170 --> 00:50:21.100 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: And Educator
is the air element.

00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:22.620 align:middle line:90%
Laborers are the earth element.

00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:25.960 align:middle line:84%
When there's too much
wind, it erodes the other.

00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:27.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:28.536 align:middle line:90%
The Warrior.

00:50:28.536 --> 00:50:29.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Warrior.

00:50:29.410 --> 00:50:32.770 align:middle line:84%
So the Warrior disintegrates
with the Merchant,

00:50:32.770 --> 00:50:35.530 align:middle line:84%
as we talked about, and they
integrate into the Educator.

00:50:35.530 --> 00:50:38.430 align:middle line:84%
So there's the
opposites attract.

00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Warriors and Educators
need each other

00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:42.190 align:middle line:90%
to become the best they can be.

00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:43.590 align:middle line:90%
It's not always easy.

00:50:43.590 --> 00:50:45.840 align:middle line:84%
It can be tumultuous,
but if you're

00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:49.350 align:middle line:84%
focused on growing and
evolving, the Warrior

00:50:49.350 --> 00:50:51.550 align:middle line:84%
will keep you true
as an Educator,

00:50:51.550 --> 00:50:53.690 align:middle line:84%
and the Educator will
give you the purpose

00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:56.630 align:middle line:84%
to live for that you
seek as a Warrior.

00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:59.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do some
people, sometimes,

00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:02.680 align:middle line:84%
do they feel-- say, a Merchant
with a Merchant, like, woo,

00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:03.250 align:middle line:90%
let's party.

00:51:03.250 --> 00:51:03.850 align:middle line:90%
Let's have a wonderful time.

00:51:03.850 --> 00:51:04.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: You get each other.

00:51:04.810 --> 00:51:06.018 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You get each other.

00:51:06.018 --> 00:51:09.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: But it can become
boring, in that, OK, fine,

00:51:09.150 --> 00:51:10.824 align:middle line:90%
I know how to party.

00:51:10.824 --> 00:51:11.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Now what do we do?

00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.710 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Now what?

00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:13.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Who has the wisdom?

00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:14.600 align:middle line:90%
Who has the Laborer?

00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:15.808 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: It's still good.

00:51:15.808 --> 00:51:17.500 align:middle line:90%
It's still good, mind you.

00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:20.020 align:middle line:84%
It's a-- I call it
good compatibility,

00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:22.332 align:middle line:90%
not excellent compatibility.

00:51:22.332 --> 00:51:24.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because there
needs to be something--

00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:24.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Some dynamic.

00:51:24.930 --> 00:51:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --in which you can,
yeah, grow from the union,

00:51:27.330 --> 00:51:27.700 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:28.508 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yeah.

00:51:28.508 --> 00:51:29.720 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:35.230 align:middle line:84%
The good news is that we all, at
times, enter Merchant, Laborer

00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:37.410 align:middle line:90%
different periods in our lives.

00:51:37.410 --> 00:51:41.130 align:middle line:84%
I just had a consultation
with an Educator,

00:51:41.130 --> 00:51:43.500 align:middle line:84%
and he's in a Merchant
period, and I said,

00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:47.237 align:middle line:84%
you're focused on marketing,
networking your ideas,

00:51:47.237 --> 00:51:48.320 align:middle line:90%
your knowledge and wisdom.

00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:49.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you could see
this in his chart again.

00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:50.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Oh, easy.

00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And he said, that's exactly
what I'm doing, and I said,

00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:55.460 align:middle line:84%
even though you're
an Educator, this

00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:59.510 align:middle line:84%
is your time to market yourself
now, so go for it, do it.

00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:04.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is-- and I'll
be honest-- this is the,

00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:07.190 align:middle line:84%
maybe, the difficult
part of the Dharma types

00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:12.010 align:middle line:84%
is that number one, it takes
a little time to know yours,

00:52:12.010 --> 00:52:14.850 align:middle line:84%
and number two, it may take
a personal consultation

00:52:14.850 --> 00:52:16.300 align:middle line:84%
to really understand
where you're

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:17.341 align:middle line:90%
at with your Dharma type.

00:52:17.341 --> 00:52:19.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you're having
to grow other parts, right?

00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:20.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Right.

00:52:20.330 --> 00:52:20.580 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:21.079 align:middle line:90%
And your--

00:52:21.079 --> 00:52:24.979 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you're a Warrior
having to now play Merchant--

00:52:24.979 --> 00:52:26.270 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: You need guidance.

00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:27.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that's
antithetical to who you are.

00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:28.709 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yeah.

00:52:28.709 --> 00:52:30.840 align:middle line:84%
So here I am working
for a big corporation,

00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:33.440 align:middle line:84%
making money, doing
something I don't believe in,

00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:34.890 align:middle line:90%
but I have to do it.

00:52:34.890 --> 00:52:35.540 align:middle line:90%
What to do?

00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:36.206 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:52:36.206 --> 00:52:39.020 align:middle line:90%


00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Those are very difficult choice
points in people's lives.

00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:45.470 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: But you see,
we've established a language

00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:48.460 align:middle line:84%
to describe the situation,
because this person,

00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:49.886 align:middle line:84%
often when they
come to a reading,

00:52:49.886 --> 00:52:51.260 align:middle line:84%
they don't know
what's happening.

00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:52.404 align:middle line:90%
They just know I'm stuck.

00:52:52.404 --> 00:52:53.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:53.210 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't feel good.

00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:55.001 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: There's
resistance in my life.

00:52:55.001 --> 00:52:56.080 align:middle line:90%
I don't feel good.

00:52:56.080 --> 00:52:57.870 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why though.

00:52:57.870 --> 00:53:00.680 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I know I don't like my
job, but why don't I like it?

00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:01.812 align:middle line:90%
I should like it.

00:53:01.812 --> 00:53:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And when we have a
language, well, you're

00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:07.010 align:middle line:84%
a Warrior, so continue
doing this job,

00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:10.030 align:middle line:84%
take 10% of your income and
donate it to this cause,

00:53:10.030 --> 00:53:12.360 align:middle line:84%
and take 10% of
your time and start

00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:13.920 align:middle line:84%
doing something
that protects those

00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:14.955 align:middle line:90%
who can't protect themselves.

00:53:14.955 --> 00:53:15.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:53:15.850 --> 00:53:16.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Young mothers--

00:53:16.410 --> 00:53:16.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So there is a way to--

00:53:16.850 --> 00:53:17.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: --young children.

00:53:17.350 --> 00:53:18.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --apply it
in a larger sense.

00:53:18.810 --> 00:53:21.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Now you feel
good walking into the office.

00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:24.930 align:middle line:84%
I was just at the farm
helping give birth

00:53:24.930 --> 00:53:27.640 align:middle line:84%
to baby animals that otherwise
would have been slaughtered.

00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:28.860 align:middle line:90%
You feel good.

00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:31.330 align:middle line:84%
Nothing you say is
going to get me down.

00:53:31.330 --> 00:53:31.830 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:53:31.830 --> 00:53:34.157 align:middle line:84%
So there is a way to
deal with that situation.

00:53:34.157 --> 00:53:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK now
let's talk about one,

00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:37.387 align:middle line:84%
you read "Cosmopolitan"
magazine.

00:53:37.387 --> 00:53:39.720 align:middle line:84%
How to be a better lover, how
many times you should have

00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:40.905 align:middle line:90%
sex a week, all these kind of--

00:53:40.905 --> 00:53:41.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Oh yeah.

00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:44.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --you know,
paint by number things.

00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:46.350 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's take each
type and talk about,

00:53:46.350 --> 00:53:50.820 align:middle line:84%
essentially, intimately,
how involved or uninvolved,

00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:55.270 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, each type is by
nature, in terms of, like, sex.

00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:56.790 align:middle line:84%
The Laborer in
your book, they're

00:53:56.790 --> 00:53:59.720 align:middle line:84%
the most earthy, the
most sexually active.

00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:02.910 align:middle line:84%
It's more common to have
sex regularly as a Laborer.

00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:04.124 align:middle line:90%
Let's go through each.

00:54:04.124 --> 00:54:05.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: This
is a deep topic.

00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:07.289 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know and
we have five minutes.

00:54:07.289 --> 00:54:08.480 align:middle line:90%
We have five minutes left.

00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:10.230 align:middle line:84%
But just to kind of
hit it, because people

00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:12.563 align:middle line:84%
can pick up your book, which
I highly recommend they do,

00:54:12.563 --> 00:54:15.300 align:middle line:84%
and read the rest, but give
us a thumbnail sketch of each.

00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:16.716 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: I'm
going to give you

00:54:16.716 --> 00:54:20.520 align:middle line:84%
a thumbnail sketch of just a
general sexual dynamic as seen

00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:21.330 align:middle line:90%
in nature.

00:54:21.330 --> 00:54:25.270 align:middle line:84%
So there's a menstrual period,
typically, every 28 days, give

00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:28.200 align:middle line:90%
or take a week or so, in women.

00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:32.860 align:middle line:84%
In men, it takes 30 to 35
days, according to Ayurveda,

00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:35.277 align:middle line:90%
to completely--

00:54:35.277 --> 00:54:36.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Replenish.

00:54:36.110 --> 00:54:37.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Replenish.

00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:39.240 align:middle line:84%
So there's a
principle in my book--

00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:41.330 align:middle line:84%
this is applicable
for everyone--

00:54:41.330 --> 00:54:44.500 align:middle line:84%
that I call sex for
procreation, which is simply

00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:46.190 align:middle line:84%
a look at this old
adage that says,

00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:48.570 align:middle line:84%
you should only have
sex for procreation.

00:54:48.570 --> 00:54:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Looking at it in the real sort
of constructive way, which

00:54:51.770 --> 00:54:54.410 align:middle line:84%
is having sex once
a month, which

00:54:54.410 --> 00:54:57.200 align:middle line:84%
is what sex for procreation
is, during the time that that

00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:00.450 align:middle line:84%
fertile window, maybe those
two or three days in a month

00:55:00.450 --> 00:55:07.020 align:middle line:84%
that are most fertile, is
what sex for procreation is.

00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:08.580 align:middle line:90%
OK, once a month?

00:55:08.580 --> 00:55:09.080 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:10.211 align:middle line:90%
Are you kidding me?

00:55:10.211 --> 00:55:12.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But again, we're
each different types,

00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:13.770 align:middle line:84%
so we have different
requirements.

00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:15.936 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: And each type
can have more or less sex

00:55:15.936 --> 00:55:18.740 align:middle line:84%
during that three, sometimes
three or five day window,

00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:21.310 align:middle line:84%
depending on whether they're
an Educator, Merchant, Laborer,

00:55:21.310 --> 00:55:22.851 align:middle line:84%
and I know that's
what you're asking.

00:55:22.851 --> 00:55:25.200 align:middle line:90%


00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:27.860 align:middle line:84%
OK, and I could speak to
that, but what I really

00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:30.015 align:middle line:84%
want to speak to, at
the fundamental core,

00:55:30.015 --> 00:55:33.190 align:middle line:84%
is that you can still
have relationship--

00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:36.220 align:middle line:84%
sexual relations, outside of
that time, but for the man,

00:55:36.220 --> 00:55:39.760 align:middle line:84%
it's not when you
want to ejaculate.

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:43.210 align:middle line:84%
You want to hold it, and what
that creates is a dynamic,

00:55:43.210 --> 00:55:47.220 align:middle line:84%
because haven't you noticed that
lovers who spend too much time

00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:51.130 align:middle line:84%
in the bedroom feel depleted,
the man gets irritable,

00:55:51.130 --> 00:55:53.230 align:middle line:90%
the man-- you become--

00:55:53.230 --> 00:55:55.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can reduce
yourself to sloth.

00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:57.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Reduce
yourself to inability

00:55:57.810 --> 00:55:59.110 align:middle line:90%
to be the Warrior that you are.

00:55:59.110 --> 00:55:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:55:59.750 --> 00:56:00.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Whereas
when you hold it--

00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:02.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a lot of energy.

00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:05.190 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: --there becomes
a-- the polarity remains.

00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:07.120 align:middle line:84%
If you lose the polarity,
it's like having

00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:08.270 align:middle line:90%
two minuses together.

00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:10.080 align:middle line:10%
The man is the plus,
woman is the minus,

00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:13.280 align:middle line:10%
and that creates attraction,
and it creates a dynamic

00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:15.650 align:middle line:10%
where the woman now tries
to seduce you, and get that

00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:18.233 align:middle line:10%
from you, and you're, like, no,
no, no, I won't give, and yes,

00:56:18.233 --> 00:56:19.920 align:middle line:10%
and it becomes playful again.

00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:22.260 align:middle line:10%
Polarity is very
playful and it's

00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:25.990 align:middle line:10%
what deep passionate
relationships are built on.

00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:31.680 align:middle line:10%
Lose that polarity at your
peril and your relationship

00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:33.470 align:middle line:10%
may suffer.

00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:34.580 align:middle line:90%
OK, so quickly.

00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:39.590 align:middle line:84%
Educators, well, Laborers
can have the most.

00:56:39.590 --> 00:56:45.960 align:middle line:84%
Outsiders can experiment
the most in different ways.

00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:48.890 align:middle line:84%
The people who should
have-- Warriors

00:56:48.890 --> 00:56:53.069 align:middle line:84%
tend to be less, because they
need to preserve their energy.

00:56:53.069 --> 00:56:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And Merchant's kind
of in the middle.

00:56:54.610 --> 00:56:55.729 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And educators?

00:56:55.729 --> 00:56:57.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Educators
are very interesting type,

00:56:57.770 --> 00:57:00.380 align:middle line:84%
because Educators,
their secret challenge

00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:03.380 align:middle line:84%
is they have strong,
powerful passions,

00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:05.500 align:middle line:84%
and they tend to repress
them, so educators

00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:07.380 align:middle line:90%
should have sex more often.

00:57:07.380 --> 00:57:10.450 align:middle line:84%
I would say, up
there with Laborers.

00:57:10.450 --> 00:57:11.476 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:57:11.476 --> 00:57:13.350 align:middle line:84%
But their tendency is
not to necessarily to--

00:57:13.350 --> 00:57:15.058 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Their
tendency is to repress

00:57:15.058 --> 00:57:18.005 align:middle line:84%
that, so they can seem prim and
proper, but they have passion,

00:57:18.005 --> 00:57:19.470 align:middle line:84%
and they're very
passionate people,

00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:23.010 align:middle line:84%
and if you know Educators,
and if you really kind of dig,

00:57:23.010 --> 00:57:24.219 align:middle line:90%
you will find that.

00:57:24.219 --> 00:57:25.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to name any names.

00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:26.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes, OK.

00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:30.331 align:middle line:84%
Final thoughts, because we
literally just have a minute

00:57:30.331 --> 00:57:30.830 align:middle line:90%
or so.

00:57:30.830 --> 00:57:32.450 align:middle line:84%
We didn't get to a lot
of different things,

00:57:32.450 --> 00:57:32.710 align:middle line:90%
but that's OK.

00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:33.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: We just started.

00:57:33.230 --> 00:57:34.313 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We just started.

00:57:34.313 --> 00:57:37.000 align:middle line:84%
We can always do this again,
but any final thoughts before we

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:38.710 align:middle line:90%
sign off this time?

00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:40.710 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Know your
Dharma, know your purpose

00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:43.400 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, and
your life will unfold.

00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:45.830 align:middle line:90%
Dharma erases karma.

00:57:45.830 --> 00:57:47.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: On that,
thank you so much.

00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:48.822 align:middle line:90%
The time has flown.

00:57:48.822 --> 00:57:49.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Thank you.

00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:51.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wish we
had a little more.

00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:52.490 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Simon.

00:57:52.490 --> 00:57:55.430 align:middle line:84%
We only touched the surface
of the content of the book,

00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:57.570 align:middle line:84%
as Simon goes into
great detail on how

00:57:57.570 --> 00:58:01.050 align:middle line:84%
to enliven our physical
vitality, sexual vitality,

00:58:01.050 --> 00:58:03.230 align:middle line:84%
and make more
enduring partnerships,

00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:05.670 align:middle line:84%
also to attract the
right person for us.

00:58:05.670 --> 00:58:08.810 align:middle line:84%
Again, the title of the book
is "Sex, Love, and Dharma,"

00:58:08.810 --> 00:58:10.950 align:middle line:84%
which can be found
at major booksellers.

00:58:10.950 --> 00:58:13.100 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:14.750 align:middle line:90%
on "Open Minds."
