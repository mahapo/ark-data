>> Regina Meredith: What if our
biology has its own imagination?

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:35.102 align:middle line:84%
Who or what would be
dreaming its outcome?

00:00:35.102 --> 00:00:37.737 align:middle line:84%
We've heard that science only
understands about four percent

00:00:37.737 --> 00:00:39.906 align:middle line:90%
of our DNA and the rest is junk.

00:00:39.906 --> 00:00:41.575 align:middle line:84%
Well, according to
William Brown, you can make

00:00:41.575 --> 00:00:43.844 align:middle line:84%
that one percent
of hard coded DNA.

00:00:43.844 --> 00:00:45.178 align:middle line:90%
So what's the rest?

00:00:45.178 --> 00:00:47.748 align:middle line:84%
How about genetic material
that can both transmit

00:00:47.748 --> 00:00:51.718 align:middle line:84%
and receive information from
the quantum field and beyond?

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:54.488 align:middle line:84%
He's with us today to explain
that our DNA is anything

00:00:54.488 --> 00:00:57.991 align:middle line:84%
but junk, in fact, it
can perform miracles.

00:00:57.991 --> 00:00:59.726 align:middle line:84%
William, thank you
for being with us.

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:02.229 align:middle line:84%
You are the few-- you're
one of those people I refer

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:06.199 align:middle line:84%
to as the new shiny ones, the
new-- you are the new science,

00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:10.270 align:middle line:84%
and this is really causing
a challenge for some people

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.906 align:middle line:84%
in the traditional sciences
that are set in their ways

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:17.377 align:middle line:84%
because you see beyond a lot of
what they've been locked into.

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:20.280 align:middle line:84%
So I want to start by us just
getting to know you a little bit

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.718 align:middle line:84%
in terms of your childhood
and when this ability to see

00:01:24.718 --> 00:01:28.522 align:middle line:84%
on this quantum level really
started coming out in your life?

00:01:28.522 --> 00:01:32.692 align:middle line:84%
>> William Brown: Well,
even as a child I was kind

00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:37.164 align:middle line:84%
of a natural born
scientist, really, you know,

00:01:37.164 --> 00:01:44.004 align:middle line:84%
a natural curiosity for
nature, animals, you know,

00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:49.276 align:middle line:84%
just always wanted to
investigate every aspect

00:01:49.276 --> 00:01:52.479 align:middle line:84%
of whatever I could
and, you know, it was--

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.649 align:middle line:90%
that was play, and it still is.

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.320 align:middle line:84%
>>Regina Meredith: Yeah,
I can tell it is for you.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.655 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Yeah, yeah.

00:02:01.655 --> 00:02:05.659 align:middle line:84%
And so actually, at a young
age, I was really fascinated

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:14.734 align:middle line:84%
with astronomy, so even in my
third grade class, I read a book

00:02:16.102 --> 00:02:19.973 align:middle line:84%
on astronomy and I went and
I was telling my dad's friend

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:22.809 align:middle line:84%
about it and he thought
I was making it up

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:25.111 align:middle line:84%
and when he double
checked and saw they're

00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:27.747 align:middle line:84%
like actually every
single fact that was

00:02:27.747 --> 00:02:32.485 align:middle line:84%
in there was coming
out, but so-- just--

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:40.160 align:middle line:84%
I grew up actually just really
loving astronomy, cosmology

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.165 align:middle line:84%
and physics, and this
corresponded to a great deal

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:47.334 align:middle line:90%
with where I was living.

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:48.702 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Where were you
living at the time?

00:02:48.702 --> 00:02:50.070 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Flagstaff, Arizona.

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.037 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Oh, yes, OK.

00:02:51.037 --> 00:02:52.873 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: So we had Lowell
Observatory.

00:02:52.873 --> 00:02:53.940 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.641 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: So I get to go
and see the planets.

00:02:55.641 --> 00:02:56.776 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Is that spectacular?

00:02:56.776 --> 00:02:58.177 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking personally
because I live in Sedona

00:02:58.177 --> 00:03:00.313 align:middle line:84%
and I've been meaning to go
up there and I've never been--

00:03:00.313 --> 00:03:02.315 align:middle line:84%
and we're just thinking
about this.

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:03.216 align:middle line:90%
Is it phenomenal?

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:05.619 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: I just love it there.

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:06.119 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Oh yes.

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.786 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:06.786 --> 00:03:07.621 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: It's really--

00:03:07.621 --> 00:03:08.989 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: The fieldtrip is in order.

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.258 align:middle line:84%
So that's really
what you grew up on.

00:03:11.258 --> 00:03:13.260 align:middle line:90%
How did you end up going to NYU?

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.796 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what a harsh reality,
especially for your energy.

00:03:16.796 --> 00:03:19.466 align:middle line:90%
How did that work for you?

00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:25.672 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: Well, so, because I was
so familiar with astronomy,

00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:28.241 align:middle line:84%
physics, when I got
to the college level,

00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:31.845 align:middle line:84%
there wasn't actually
anything new to learn.

00:03:31.845 --> 00:03:33.280 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: What a surprise.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.415 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Starting out.

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:44.157 align:middle line:84%
But when I'd go to the biology
classes, here was another world

00:03:44.157 --> 00:03:50.530 align:middle line:84%
that I was unfamiliar with, and
that's what really excited me.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.266 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of went
from this exploration

00:03:54.266 --> 00:04:00.640 align:middle line:84%
of the large outer world to the
inner world and in all ways.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.975 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: And so when I got my
initial degree, I wanted to work

00:04:12.152 --> 00:04:18.324 align:middle line:84%
with molecular genetics and New
York University had this amazing

00:04:18.324 --> 00:04:25.598 align:middle line:84%
program to do so, so--
and I wanted to get out--

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:26.399 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Sure.

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:27.267 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: -- go on an adventure.

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:27.934 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Get out of
this small town.

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:28.468 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Yeah.

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:29.169 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yeah.

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:30.503 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Yeah, yes, so--

00:04:30.503 --> 00:04:31.604 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: And so what kind of
adventure must that have been?

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:34.607 align:middle line:84%
Your energies are so
sensitive and refined,

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:36.476 align:middle line:84%
how was that for you
being in New York?

00:04:36.476 --> 00:04:43.516 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: I learned how to be
in that kind of environment

00:04:43.516 --> 00:04:51.524 align:middle line:84%
and that's actually very
useful for learning how

00:04:51.524 --> 00:04:56.963 align:middle line:90%
at anytime the quiet, that noise

00:04:56.963 --> 00:05:01.735 align:middle line:84%
that even this harmonious
vibration, we can find ourselves

00:05:01.735 --> 00:05:05.905 align:middle line:84%
around in center and
find it, you know,

00:05:05.905 --> 00:05:07.807 align:middle line:90%
in the center is peace, calm.

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:11.077 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: And you used to
meditate on the subway, right?

00:05:11.077 --> 00:05:13.880 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: I would meditate
on the subway.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.083 align:middle line:84%
And after a couple
of years, you know,

00:05:17.083 --> 00:05:21.654 align:middle line:84%
it was like our long subway
ride, and after a couple

00:05:21.654 --> 00:05:24.057 align:middle line:90%
of years, people began--

00:05:24.057 --> 00:05:26.860 align:middle line:84%
they could tell I was
meditating on the subway.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.131 align:middle line:84%
I'd open my eyes and they'd
clear out in front of me.

00:05:31.131 --> 00:05:31.664 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Oh really?

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:32.966 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Yeah.

00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:35.368 align:middle line:84%
I think they felt that I was
like reading their minds.

00:05:35.368 --> 00:05:37.537 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Well, it's
very interesting.

00:05:37.537 --> 00:05:38.338 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Yeah.

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:39.706 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: So then you ended up--

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:42.942 align:middle line:84%
and so you got which
degree at NYU then?

00:05:42.942 --> 00:05:47.647 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: So, it's a
degree in biology

00:05:47.647 --> 00:05:53.086 align:middle line:84%
but the program was applied
recombinant DNA technology,

00:05:53.086 --> 00:05:57.257 align:middle line:84%
and so it's really-- I
was doing a lot of work

00:05:57.257 --> 00:06:04.497 align:middle line:84%
with the DNA itself,
isolating it,

00:06:04.497 --> 00:06:12.372 align:middle line:84%
how to actually rearrange
the DNA and of course,

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:17.444 align:middle line:84%
this was for the purposes
of studying the DNA.

00:06:17.444 --> 00:06:21.815 align:middle line:84%
It's coding mechanisms
and how it's expressed

00:06:21.815 --> 00:06:29.389 align:middle line:84%
at the biological level
and so I had, you know,

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:34.828 align:middle line:84%
from that pretty in-depth
hands-on understanding.

00:06:34.828 --> 00:06:37.430 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Were you doing-- but--
the things you were doing,

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.468 align:middle line:84%
were they unique and exotic at
that time or was this kind of--

00:06:41.468 --> 00:06:43.736 align:middle line:84%
still within the
realm of science

00:06:43.736 --> 00:06:46.706 align:middle line:84%
that we understand today,
traditional sciences?

00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:49.976 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: You know, it's
actually kind of a--

00:06:49.976 --> 00:06:53.613 align:middle line:84%
[inaudible] even I should
say antiquated a lot

00:06:53.613 --> 00:06:56.281 align:middle line:90%
of the techniques, you know,

00:06:56.281 --> 00:06:59.786 align:middle line:84%
that that's where they start you
off when they're teaching you.

00:06:59.786 --> 00:07:03.890 align:middle line:84%
So it was-- this is the
technique we were using twenty

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:04.624 align:middle line:90%
years ago--

00:07:04.624 --> 00:07:05.391 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Right.

00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:06.226 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: -- to work with DNA.

00:07:06.226 --> 00:07:07.360 align:middle line:90%
And they take you through it.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.030 align:middle line:84%
But when I actually
finally got into a lab

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:15.468 align:middle line:84%
to do the thesis work,
you know, that was--

00:07:15.468 --> 00:07:19.672 align:middle line:84%
what are you going to
call, cutting edge work.

00:07:19.672 --> 00:07:23.943 align:middle line:90%
But, you know, it was all

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:30.016 align:middle line:84%
within the bounds of,
kind of, consensus--

00:07:30.016 --> 00:07:30.650 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Right.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:31.718 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: And science.

00:07:31.718 --> 00:07:35.755 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until I
got to the PhD level,

00:07:35.755 --> 00:07:37.457 align:middle line:90%
they'd-- I got to [inaudible].

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:38.858 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Start breaking free?

00:07:38.858 --> 00:07:42.662 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: Started getting into some
of the more exotic stuff, yeah.

00:07:42.662 --> 00:07:45.498 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: You know, I've interviewed
a lot of people who had

00:07:45.498 --> 00:07:48.768 align:middle line:84%
to leave the system
because they couldn't deal

00:07:48.768 --> 00:07:50.904 align:middle line:84%
with the restrictions
that were on them.

00:07:50.904 --> 00:07:52.605 align:middle line:84%
How did you function
within that?

00:07:52.605 --> 00:07:55.308 align:middle line:84%
Were you able to take them
to a new level, or would--

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:57.911 align:middle line:84%
did they accept what
you were coming up with?

00:07:57.911 --> 00:08:01.014 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: You know, I
would ask questions

00:08:01.014 --> 00:08:04.183 align:middle line:84%
that would make students
and professors very uneasy.

00:08:04.183 --> 00:08:12.725 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was connections
that, you know, they didn't want

00:08:12.725 --> 00:08:17.630 align:middle line:84%
to get into, they didn't
see always where it's coming

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:24.337 align:middle line:84%
from with it and more often
than not it would stomp--

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:25.138 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yeah.

00:08:25.138 --> 00:08:26.539 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: -- the professor but--

00:08:26.539 --> 00:08:27.874 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Well, you were
just really--

00:08:27.874 --> 00:08:30.476 align:middle line:84%
you were what, in
your mid-20s yourself

00:08:30.476 --> 00:08:32.111 align:middle line:90%
when you began teaching?

00:08:32.111 --> 00:08:33.613 align:middle line:90%
And were you teaching what--

00:08:33.613 --> 00:08:36.382 align:middle line:84%
some of your own
discoveries by this point?

00:08:36.382 --> 00:08:37.784 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

00:08:37.784 --> 00:08:38.985 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, 'cause the--

00:08:38.985 --> 00:08:40.118 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Who let you do that?

00:08:40.118 --> 00:08:42.722 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: Well, it was
really a serendipity sign,

00:08:42.722 --> 00:08:44.791 align:middle line:90%
I guess I could say.

00:08:44.791 --> 00:08:50.296 align:middle line:84%
So, the way that the course was
set up, there's 250 students

00:08:50.296 --> 00:08:53.132 align:middle line:84%
in this molecular
genetics course

00:08:53.132 --> 00:08:56.769 align:middle line:84%
and the professor
would teach the class

00:08:56.769 --> 00:09:01.441 align:middle line:84%
and then we would
have our own labs--

00:09:01.441 --> 00:09:02.508 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: OK.

00:09:02.508 --> 00:09:03.810 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: -- where we
would teach in the lab.

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:07.480 align:middle line:84%
I'd have a lecture in-- or
opportunities that start off

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.716 align:middle line:84%
with a lecture and
then, you know,

00:09:09.716 --> 00:09:12.251 align:middle line:90%
we would do the hands-on work.

00:09:12.251 --> 00:09:19.792 align:middle line:84%
And I felt it was incumbent
upon myself to show how a lot

00:09:19.792 --> 00:09:22.729 align:middle line:84%
of the things that
were being taught

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:25.765 align:middle line:84%
out of the textbook
weren't entirely accurate.

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:28.768 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: I'm sure your
professors appreciated that.

00:09:28.768 --> 00:09:33.940 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: And, you know, actually
though because of the amount

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:39.479 align:middle line:84%
of liberty that I had, I've
never gone in trouble with that,

00:09:39.479 --> 00:09:44.384 align:middle line:84%
partly because the professor
never really found out.

00:09:44.384 --> 00:09:46.552 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: And you know what else
about you that I think part

00:09:46.552 --> 00:09:49.022 align:middle line:84%
of the reason may have been,
this is just my opinion,

00:09:49.022 --> 00:09:52.358 align:middle line:84%
observing you is that you're
unlike a lot of people

00:09:52.358 --> 00:09:55.161 align:middle line:84%
in the world of science, you
really are not coming from ego.

00:09:55.161 --> 00:09:57.730 align:middle line:84%
You have this very pure
heart-centered state

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:00.900 align:middle line:84%
of being that's just relaying
what you find as truth.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:05.238 align:middle line:84%
That's so unusual and extremely
refreshing that I'm certain

00:10:05.238 --> 00:10:07.707 align:middle line:84%
that it's a hard
thing to go up against

00:10:07.707 --> 00:10:11.544 align:middle line:84%
when you offer no
resistance to begin with.

00:10:11.544 --> 00:10:15.748 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Well, and it's just the--

00:10:15.748 --> 00:10:20.553 align:middle line:84%
it's really it's about the
pursuit of understanding.

00:10:20.553 --> 00:10:22.322 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:10:22.322 --> 00:10:28.261 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: And if that's our goal
and it should be, I think,

00:10:28.261 --> 00:10:35.601 align:middle line:84%
pure intentioned, when you
come up against that ego,

00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:39.238 align:middle line:84%
it is not facilitating
that process.

00:10:39.238 --> 00:10:44.610 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's-- you're
not getting a pure-- well--

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:45.745 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: You're not--
there's nothing

00:10:45.745 --> 00:10:48.114 align:middle line:90%
to feed off of there, you know.

00:10:48.114 --> 00:10:55.521 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: And I just-- I like
it to be open, unbiased,

00:10:55.521 --> 00:11:01.527 align:middle line:84%
let's explore interesting
facts, interesting thoughts.

00:11:01.527 --> 00:11:02.795 align:middle line:90%
What do you know?

00:11:02.795 --> 00:11:05.565 align:middle line:84%
I want to hear you, let me
share some things I know.

00:11:05.565 --> 00:11:14.374 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like-- I
think the-- you know, it's--

00:11:14.374 --> 00:11:17.477 align:middle line:84%
if that is where-- and
certainly science functions

00:11:17.477 --> 00:11:22.048 align:middle line:84%
at its best but, you know, in my
experience that happens about--

00:11:22.048 --> 00:11:23.049 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yeah.

00:11:23.049 --> 00:11:25.651 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: -- 0.1 percent
of the time.

00:11:25.651 --> 00:11:26.619 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yeah.

00:11:26.619 --> 00:11:28.287 align:middle line:84%
Exactly. That's why
I brought it up.

00:11:28.287 --> 00:11:29.655 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:11:29.655 --> 00:11:31.958 align:middle line:84%
Off-camera we were talking about
something, so throughout all

00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:35.728 align:middle line:84%
of these experiments and your
discoveries, a lot of people say

00:11:35.728 --> 00:11:38.097 align:middle line:84%
that science has finally
evolved to the point

00:11:38.097 --> 00:11:40.967 align:middle line:84%
where it can explain
consciousness but you're saying,

00:11:40.967 --> 00:11:45.104 align:middle line:84%
"No, no, actually, it's
the other way around."

00:11:45.104 --> 00:11:48.408 align:middle line:84%
And so that begins our journey
down the scientific road today.

00:11:48.408 --> 00:11:50.176 align:middle line:84%
Explain what you mean
when you say, "No,

00:11:50.176 --> 00:11:52.712 align:middle line:90%
it's the other way around."

00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:56.048 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: Well, oftentimes
when I share what kind

00:11:56.048 --> 00:11:59.819 align:middle line:84%
of work I've been doing,
the research, you know,

00:11:59.819 --> 00:12:03.523 align:middle line:84%
people will say, "Oh, you
know, that's so exciting.

00:12:03.523 --> 00:12:09.295 align:middle line:84%
You're using science
to prove spirituality."

00:12:09.295 --> 00:12:13.332 align:middle line:84%
And I understand that
where they're coming from

00:12:13.332 --> 00:12:16.502 align:middle line:84%
but that is not where
I'm coming from at all.

00:12:16.502 --> 00:12:25.077 align:middle line:84%
For me, the experiences that
I've had in my life and that,

00:12:25.077 --> 00:12:30.483 align:middle line:84%
you know, what would be
termed spiritual experiences,

00:12:30.483 --> 00:12:34.253 align:middle line:84%
those are real, you
know, that's--

00:12:34.253 --> 00:12:36.355 align:middle line:90%
there's where the truth is.

00:12:36.355 --> 00:12:39.759 align:middle line:90%
And for me it is.

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:44.230 align:middle line:84%
And so I can't do
that to explain

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:49.535 align:middle line:84%
or more fully develop
the science,

00:12:49.535 --> 00:12:51.838 align:middle line:84%
to make the science
more accurate.

00:12:51.838 --> 00:13:00.112 align:middle line:84%
So, its just an exploration of
what is reality, of what it is

00:13:00.112 --> 00:13:04.317 align:middle line:84%
to be human, what is the
universe, how do humans relate

00:13:04.317 --> 00:13:06.219 align:middle line:90%
to the universe, I can explore

00:13:06.219 --> 00:13:10.623 align:middle line:84%
that in my own personal
experiences

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:19.298 align:middle line:84%
like a consciousness cosmonaut,
thing they call as a psychonaut.

00:13:19.298 --> 00:13:19.799 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yeah.

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:21.200 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:26.539 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: But if you do that kind
of, you know, experimentation

00:13:26.539 --> 00:13:29.041 align:middle line:90%
with your own consciousness

00:13:29.041 --> 00:13:33.546 align:middle line:84%
and you had these experiences
that's directly relatable

00:13:33.546 --> 00:13:39.619 align:middle line:84%
to what we're doing in the
science so you can, you know--

00:13:39.619 --> 00:13:45.224 align:middle line:84%
and we do, we use that to
produce a more accurate science,

00:13:45.224 --> 00:13:51.297 align:middle line:84%
a science that is more
informed, actually.

00:13:51.297 --> 00:13:51.864 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:13:51.864 --> 00:13:52.932 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Because--

00:13:52.932 --> 00:13:55.701 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: And this is
common to most people

00:13:55.701 --> 00:13:58.070 align:middle line:84%
that made their breakthrough
theories, it's something

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:00.840 align:middle line:84%
that happened in a dream
or were riding on a bus,

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.176 align:middle line:84%
it's something they saw when
sitting in a tree one day.

00:14:04.176 --> 00:14:12.184 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: It's so many major
breakthroughs in science come

00:14:12.184 --> 00:14:18.224 align:middle line:84%
from those kind of experiences
even what would be called an

00:14:18.224 --> 00:14:19.558 align:middle line:90%
esoteric type.

00:14:19.558 --> 00:14:20.593 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:14:20.593 --> 00:14:21.594 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: They're experienced
as visions.

00:14:21.594 --> 00:14:23.496 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: So let's get
into you and some

00:14:23.496 --> 00:14:26.899 align:middle line:84%
of your breakthrough experiences
you had and what you bring

00:14:26.899 --> 00:14:29.502 align:middle line:84%
to the world of science because
we're going to be talking

00:14:29.502 --> 00:14:31.938 align:middle line:84%
about genetics but we're
not going to get into a lot

00:14:31.938 --> 00:14:36.175 align:middle line:84%
of molecular models and such,
so people don't need to freak

00:14:36.175 --> 00:14:38.511 align:middle line:84%
out because you have a way
of explaining it beyond that.

00:14:38.511 --> 00:14:42.614 align:middle line:84%
But the implications of what
you have discovered in your own,

00:14:42.614 --> 00:14:45.251 align:middle line:84%
as you say, kind of esoteric
travels that you've brought back

00:14:45.251 --> 00:14:46.352 align:middle line:90%
to the lab and the classroom.

00:14:46.352 --> 00:14:50.022 align:middle line:84%
So, please share where
this began with you.

00:14:50.022 --> 00:14:57.897 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: Well, so, there's
already a very strong foundation

00:14:57.897 --> 00:15:02.768 align:middle line:84%
within biology although
it is an alternative model

00:15:02.768 --> 00:15:11.277 align:middle line:84%
for describing the emergence
of a form and function

00:15:11.277 --> 00:15:13.346 align:middle line:90%
within the biological organism.

00:15:13.346 --> 00:15:21.120 align:middle line:84%
So there's the classic or
mainstream consensus model

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:26.926 align:middle line:84%
which is that there's genes and
they have all the information,

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:28.461 align:middle line:90%
they are the blueprint,

00:15:28.461 --> 00:15:34.033 align:middle line:84%
they determine an organism's
function, its form and actually,

00:15:34.033 --> 00:15:36.669 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's gone
to the extreme nearly

00:15:36.669 --> 00:15:39.538 align:middle line:90%
with genetic determinism--

00:15:39.538 --> 00:15:43.609 align:middle line:84%
although I think we're
coming back from that even

00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:44.677 align:middle line:90%
within the mainstream.

00:15:44.677 --> 00:15:46.112 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: I mean there's even--

00:15:46.112 --> 00:15:49.081 align:middle line:84%
there's scarier stuff
transhumanism.

00:15:49.081 --> 00:15:52.084 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we won't talk about
that right now, that's creepy.

00:15:52.084 --> 00:15:53.552 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: You know, that's
a huge area.

00:15:53.552 --> 00:15:54.086 align:middle line:90%
They--

00:15:54.086 --> 00:15:54.653 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yeah.

00:15:54.653 --> 00:15:55.221 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: I study--

00:15:55.221 --> 00:15:56.555 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: You do?

00:15:56.555 --> 00:16:00.593 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: in-- yeah, yeah, I mean,
it's central to a lot of--

00:16:00.593 --> 00:16:03.129 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Oh, well, OK, so we
can get into that after we--

00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:04.096 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: OK.

00:16:04.096 --> 00:16:05.031 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Please explain
this other part

00:16:05.031 --> 00:16:08.734 align:middle line:84%
and then we could
talk about that.

00:16:08.734 --> 00:16:09.935 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: OK, OK.

00:16:09.935 --> 00:16:17.309 align:middle line:84%
But when-- at face
value, that model,

00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:20.946 align:middle line:90%
genes determine everything.

00:16:20.946 --> 00:16:25.117 align:middle line:84%
It's like, OK, when
you dig deeper though,

00:16:25.117 --> 00:16:30.523 align:middle line:84%
there are major inconsistencies
in that model,

00:16:30.523 --> 00:16:37.129 align:middle line:84%
areas that are completely
unexplained such as how do genes

00:16:37.129 --> 00:16:42.735 align:middle line:84%
in any way determine
the form of an organism?

00:16:42.735 --> 00:16:46.972 align:middle line:84%
So this is developmental
biology.

00:16:46.972 --> 00:16:50.743 align:middle line:90%
It's not explained at all.

00:16:50.743 --> 00:16:55.848 align:middle line:84%
In fact, New York University,
they're kind of at the forefront

00:16:55.848 --> 00:17:00.352 align:middle line:84%
of what's called systems
biology where they're attempting

00:17:00.352 --> 00:17:06.258 align:middle line:84%
to explain the emergence of
form and function in an organism

00:17:06.258 --> 00:17:10.095 align:middle line:84%
through the genes and
it's a complete mess.

00:17:10.095 --> 00:17:11.964 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Yeah, and I get-- yeah,
they're not going to do it.

00:17:11.964 --> 00:17:13.699 align:middle line:84%
Well, now a lot of
people are accustomed

00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:15.101 align:middle line:90%
to Bruce Lipton's work.

00:17:15.101 --> 00:17:17.903 align:middle line:84%
So, over the last ten or twelve
years, he started introducing us

00:17:17.903 --> 00:17:21.073 align:middle line:84%
to the notion of epigenetics,
how our beliefs, emotions,

00:17:21.073 --> 00:17:24.076 align:middle line:84%
environment can form
how the genes express,

00:17:24.076 --> 00:17:27.645 align:middle line:84%
but you go considerably
beyond that.

00:17:27.645 --> 00:17:34.353 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: 'Cause some of them, there
is the morphogenetic aspect.

00:17:34.353 --> 00:17:38.924 align:middle line:84%
So this is kind of
the alternative model.

00:17:38.924 --> 00:17:40.392 align:middle line:90%
You know, Rupert Sheldrake--

00:17:40.392 --> 00:17:41.460 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:42.528 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: is really the--
at the forefront,

00:17:42.528 --> 00:17:44.897 align:middle line:90%
the founder in a way--

00:17:44.897 --> 00:17:45.598 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:17:45.598 --> 00:17:46.999 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: -- of this theory.

00:17:46.999 --> 00:17:53.873 align:middle line:84%
He's just developed a beautiful
scientifically eloquent model

00:17:53.873 --> 00:17:55.207 align:middle line:90%
for this.

00:17:55.207 --> 00:18:04.116 align:middle line:84%
And now, so what I find is
that this model explains areas

00:18:05.384 --> 00:18:09.355 align:middle line:84%
that in my investigation
previously were not explained

00:18:09.355 --> 00:18:14.560 align:middle line:84%
and it does so comprehensively
and logically, I like that.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:17.062 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: So, give us the
nutshell explanation

00:18:17.062 --> 00:18:20.466 align:middle line:84%
of what morphogenetic fields
are, Rupert's theories.

00:18:20.466 --> 00:18:26.739 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: So it's really
the understanding

00:18:26.739 --> 00:18:34.880 align:middle line:84%
that even the biology extends
beyond what you can see.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:38.751 align:middle line:90%
It's connected into a field.

00:18:38.751 --> 00:18:43.189 align:middle line:84%
Even the biological system,
the biological molecules,

00:18:43.189 --> 00:18:50.796 align:middle line:84%
the fields like-- they're
not isolated, concrete,

00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:55.868 align:middle line:84%
solid objects, that's
the model right now,

00:18:55.868 --> 00:18:57.236 align:middle line:90%
that's the consensus model.

00:18:57.236 --> 00:19:01.507 align:middle line:84%
Like if you could picture
billiard balls going around

00:19:01.507 --> 00:19:04.543 align:middle line:84%
and colliding and
every now and then,

00:19:04.543 --> 00:19:10.749 align:middle line:84%
there's a biochemical reaction
and that drives the cell

00:19:10.749 --> 00:19:13.519 align:middle line:90%
in the human is just ludicrous.

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:15.421 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Kind of going to
a bowling alley versus--

00:19:15.421 --> 00:19:16.522 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Yeah.

00:19:16.522 --> 00:19:17.356 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: -- playing a fine
flute or something.

00:19:17.356 --> 00:19:17.890 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Yeah.

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:18.657 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yeah.

00:19:18.657 --> 00:19:22.194 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Well, quantum jazz.

00:19:22.194 --> 00:19:22.695 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:19:22.695 --> 00:19:23.229 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:23.229 --> 00:19:23.929 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: It is.

00:19:23.929 --> 00:19:28.534 align:middle line:90%
It's a musical ensemble.

00:19:28.534 --> 00:19:34.473 align:middle line:84%
And though that that sound
vibration is reaching every

00:19:34.473 --> 00:19:37.309 align:middle line:84%
constituent molecule
of the cell,

00:19:37.309 --> 00:19:41.247 align:middle line:90%
that's a field like behavior.

00:19:41.247 --> 00:19:49.321 align:middle line:84%
Now, within the field, so
the field is not localized

00:19:49.321 --> 00:19:51.190 align:middle line:90%
to any specific region.

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:53.993 align:middle line:84%
So, really what we're
talking about is space.

00:19:53.993 --> 00:19:55.928 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: So if we're talking space,

00:19:55.928 --> 00:19:59.064 align:middle line:84%
the one thing I've always
wondered about this is how much

00:19:59.064 --> 00:20:04.570 align:middle line:84%
of what is informing the other
99 percent that you speak of,

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:06.605 align:middle line:90%
that's really coming more

00:20:06.605 --> 00:20:10.409 align:middle line:84%
through multidimensional
sources, it's not defined--

00:20:10.409 --> 00:20:13.612 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's the-- defined
beyond time, beyond space,

00:20:13.612 --> 00:20:15.281 align:middle line:84%
and beyond our dimensional
fields

00:20:15.281 --> 00:20:17.783 align:middle line:84%
that we're aware
of, I would assume.

00:20:17.783 --> 00:20:21.787 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: So, the information
that is coming through,

00:20:21.787 --> 00:20:26.091 align:middle line:84%
how much of that is
multidimensional?

00:20:26.091 --> 00:20:31.096 align:middle line:84%
It is by its nature
multidimensional,

00:20:31.096 --> 00:20:40.172 align:middle line:84%
and so we use the term
holofractal which is really

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:47.446 align:middle line:84%
to mean that actually
any element,

00:20:47.446 --> 00:20:50.616 align:middle line:84%
any unit that you can
think of, so like a unit

00:20:50.616 --> 00:20:53.652 align:middle line:84%
of information is
actually contains

00:20:53.652 --> 00:20:58.490 align:middle line:84%
within it the information of
the entire, say, universe.

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:01.593 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: OK, you have a slide that
you use in your presentation

00:21:01.593 --> 00:21:07.066 align:middle line:84%
that I just love, and it's a
brain cell, energy emanating

00:21:07.066 --> 00:21:10.302 align:middle line:84%
from the brain cell
and from the cosmos

00:21:10.302 --> 00:21:12.671 align:middle line:84%
that is exactly what
you're talking--

00:21:12.671 --> 00:21:15.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it shows
you holographics

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:18.444 align:middle line:84%
in such a literal way,
as above so below.

00:21:18.444 --> 00:21:22.648 align:middle line:84%
All the information is
contained from the macroscopic

00:21:22.648 --> 00:21:25.084 align:middle line:84%
to the microscopic,
it's just beautiful.

00:21:25.084 --> 00:21:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: And so the information
that you receive from the field

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:34.360 align:middle line:84%
through the morphogenetic
field, the information field,

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:40.966 align:middle line:84%
the source field, all different
descriptions of the same field,

00:21:40.966 --> 00:21:48.007 align:middle line:84%
that information carries
with it that universal scan.

00:21:48.007 --> 00:21:53.112 align:middle line:84%
So that's why your
brain cell is structured

00:21:53.112 --> 00:21:55.514 align:middle line:90%
like super galactic clusters.

00:21:55.514 --> 00:21:58.350 align:middle line:90%
There's a resonate transmission.

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:04.256 align:middle line:84%
And so that information
is coming in.

00:22:04.256 --> 00:22:10.896 align:middle line:84%
Now, that is multidimensional
in scan, universal in scope,

00:22:10.896 --> 00:22:16.101 align:middle line:84%
as well as transtemporal,
that now that term--

00:22:16.101 --> 00:22:18.036 align:middle line:90%
it's very important to think.

00:22:18.036 --> 00:22:21.840 align:middle line:90%
What that term means is just a--

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:25.244 align:middle line:84%
just like the field isn't
restricted to any one point

00:22:25.244 --> 00:22:27.246 align:middle line:90%
in space, neither is time.

00:22:27.246 --> 00:22:27.746 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Time.

00:22:27.746 --> 00:22:28.280 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.248 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Yeah.

00:22:29.248 --> 00:22:30.883 align:middle line:84%
So that information
that's coming

00:22:30.883 --> 00:22:37.389 align:middle line:84%
through is actually coming
from what we perceive

00:22:37.389 --> 00:22:40.192 align:middle line:90%
as all points in time.

00:22:40.192 --> 00:22:42.327 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:22:42.327 --> 00:22:44.797 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: It's so-- that to me then,

00:22:44.797 --> 00:22:48.967 align:middle line:84%
my next question would be there
is an organizing principle

00:22:48.967 --> 00:22:49.802 align:middle line:90%
behind all of it.

00:22:49.802 --> 00:22:52.504 align:middle line:90%
How can you take this vast sea

00:22:52.504 --> 00:22:55.908 align:middle line:84%
of holographic multidimensional
information

00:22:55.908 --> 00:22:59.111 align:middle line:84%
and have it expressed
through a given vehicle

00:22:59.111 --> 00:23:02.614 align:middle line:90%
to become what it is?

00:23:02.614 --> 00:23:07.519 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: Well, so, how
does that information--

00:23:07.519 --> 00:23:10.656 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Organize itself
to become you?

00:23:10.656 --> 00:23:16.695 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: And now this is a
very interesting question.

00:23:16.695 --> 00:23:21.433 align:middle line:84%
This is where it really
gets into a lot of the work

00:23:21.433 --> 00:23:25.504 align:middle line:90%
that we've been doing.

00:23:25.504 --> 00:23:34.580 align:middle line:84%
So, the DNA molecule, this is--
you know, everybody, generally,

00:23:36.582 --> 00:23:39.184 align:middle line:90%
we have this good understanding

00:23:39.184 --> 00:23:44.756 align:middle line:84%
that if you have a particular
set of genetic material,

00:23:44.756 --> 00:23:51.763 align:middle line:84%
deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA,
and you put it into a cell,

00:23:51.763 --> 00:23:55.501 align:middle line:84%
that's how we'll develop
into a specific organism,

00:23:55.501 --> 00:24:01.106 align:middle line:84%
form and function,
that is specific

00:24:01.106 --> 00:24:04.877 align:middle line:90%
to the nature of that molecule.

00:24:04.877 --> 00:24:10.849 align:middle line:84%
So we all-- we have a good
understanding that that's

00:24:10.849 --> 00:24:13.752 align:middle line:84%
where this information
is coming from.

00:24:13.752 --> 00:24:18.223 align:middle line:84%
At least initially, you
have to have their molecule

00:24:18.223 --> 00:24:25.797 align:middle line:84%
to really get the
specific form and function

00:24:25.797 --> 00:24:32.504 align:middle line:84%
such as a human being,
in this instance.

00:24:32.504 --> 00:24:36.508 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've already kind of
alluded to the fact that--

00:24:36.508 --> 00:24:40.779 align:middle line:90%
I don't think it's the genes.

00:24:40.779 --> 00:24:47.853 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's the genes
in and of themselves, per se.

00:24:47.853 --> 00:24:51.823 align:middle line:84%
They're obviously
important, obviously.

00:24:51.823 --> 00:24:58.797 align:middle line:84%
But if I were to rate their
level of importance on a scale,

00:24:58.797 --> 00:25:02.768 align:middle line:84%
it would be-- well, it-- just
as an example, that they make

00:25:02.768 --> 00:25:05.237 align:middle line:84%
up one percent of
the human genome.

00:25:05.237 --> 00:25:06.605 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Right, right.

00:25:06.605 --> 00:25:10.175 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: And so, I don't know
if I'd give that low a number

00:25:10.175 --> 00:25:12.945 align:middle line:84%
but that's a good
ballpark range.

00:25:12.945 --> 00:25:14.780 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: So then you have
to look at what are all

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:17.316 align:middle line:84%
of the other driving,
creative factors.

00:25:17.316 --> 00:25:19.218 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Yes, yeah.

00:25:19.218 --> 00:25:25.891 align:middle line:84%
Also, the genes are one
percent of the human genome.

00:25:25.891 --> 00:25:29.828 align:middle line:84%
So, what are genes
technically speaking?

00:25:29.828 --> 00:25:37.369 align:middle line:84%
They're a nucleotide code so
the constituents, the molecules

00:25:37.369 --> 00:25:41.306 align:middle line:84%
that make up the DNA,
they form a code.

00:25:41.306 --> 00:25:46.078 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's the different ordering
of these nucleotides that make

00:25:46.078 --> 00:25:49.581 align:middle line:90%
up the code that we call a gene.

00:25:49.581 --> 00:25:54.886 align:middle line:84%
They can be translated by
the molecular apparatus

00:25:54.886 --> 00:25:57.756 align:middle line:90%
in the cell to make proteins.

00:25:57.756 --> 00:26:04.029 align:middle line:84%
Now, proteins do biochemistry,
and they also are the functional

00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:06.365 align:middle line:90%
or the structural, actually,

00:26:06.365 --> 00:26:08.667 align:middle line:84%
the structural building
blocks of the cell.

00:26:08.667 --> 00:26:09.368 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Right.

00:26:09.368 --> 00:26:10.702 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Very important.

00:26:10.702 --> 00:26:15.107 align:middle line:84%
You need to be able to do
metabolic reactions and you need

00:26:15.107 --> 00:26:19.378 align:middle line:84%
to have structure to the cell
because that's the substrates

00:26:19.378 --> 00:26:22.547 align:middle line:84%
where the metabolic reactions
are taking place, et cetera.

00:26:22.547 --> 00:26:27.853 align:middle line:84%
But there's no information
there for--

00:26:27.853 --> 00:26:34.326 align:middle line:84%
that specifies any
really specific

00:26:34.326 --> 00:26:35.360 align:middle line:90%
or unique characteristics.

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:35.861 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Characteristics.

00:26:35.861 --> 00:26:36.395 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:36.395 --> 00:26:37.229 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Yeah.

00:26:37.229 --> 00:26:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yeah.

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:42.668 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: So, if you compare
the genes across species,

00:26:42.668 --> 00:26:45.570 align:middle line:84%
they're actually
nearly universal.

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:53.545 align:middle line:84%
Just a case in point, dolphins,
they have 19 chromosomes.

00:26:53.545 --> 00:26:55.781 align:middle line:90%
Of those 19 chromosomes,

00:26:55.781 --> 00:27:01.186 align:middle line:84%
there are identical matches
throughout those 19 chromosomes

00:27:01.186 --> 00:27:05.123 align:middle line:84%
with comparative regions
in the human genome.

00:27:05.123 --> 00:27:10.328 align:middle line:84%
Dolphins and humans
have identical sequence,

00:27:10.328 --> 00:27:13.832 align:middle line:90%
what was called homology.

00:27:13.832 --> 00:27:14.966 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:27:14.966 --> 00:27:17.836 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: So what makes them
so much smarter than us?

00:27:17.836 --> 00:27:20.906 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: Well, the difference
is the--

00:27:20.906 --> 00:27:23.642 align:middle line:84%
it's arranged differently
in the chromosome.

00:27:23.642 --> 00:27:24.643 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:27:24.643 --> 00:27:26.445 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: And that is it.

00:27:26.445 --> 00:27:28.380 align:middle line:90%
That's it, right there.

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:31.817 align:middle line:84%
It's the global architectural
arrangement.

00:27:31.817 --> 00:27:35.921 align:middle line:90%
It's how they're structured,

00:27:35.921 --> 00:27:40.192 align:middle line:84%
how the genetic material
is arranged and ordered.

00:27:40.192 --> 00:27:42.861 align:middle line:90%
Now, that does play a part

00:27:42.861 --> 00:27:48.333 align:middle line:84%
in regulating how the genes
are transcribed and translated,

00:27:48.333 --> 00:27:51.369 align:middle line:90%
their epigenetic regulation.

00:27:51.369 --> 00:27:53.972 align:middle line:90%
But it's not just that,

00:27:53.972 --> 00:27:58.009 align:middle line:84%
and there's something more
important, something deeper.

00:27:58.009 --> 00:28:02.881 align:middle line:84%
The architectural arrangement,
so how things are ordered

00:28:02.881 --> 00:28:05.350 align:middle line:84%
and really the structural
components

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:10.722 align:middle line:84%
of the genetic material,
it determines its form

00:28:10.722 --> 00:28:14.459 align:middle line:84%
so it can adopt different
conformations

00:28:14.459 --> 00:28:16.294 align:middle line:90%
and different structures.

00:28:16.294 --> 00:28:21.299 align:middle line:84%
Now, we know from geometry,
the different structures

00:28:21.299 --> 00:28:23.435 align:middle line:90%
and forms are important.

00:28:23.435 --> 00:28:27.873 align:middle line:84%
And we know from
certainly physics

00:28:27.873 --> 00:28:31.476 align:middle line:90%
that in different arrangements,

00:28:31.476 --> 00:28:35.080 align:middle line:84%
different molecular arrangements
give you very different

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:38.784 align:middle line:84%
and important functional
characteristics.

00:28:38.784 --> 00:28:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, the DNA molecule
is extremely plastic,

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:46.191 align:middle line:84%
it can move itself
into a variety

00:28:46.191 --> 00:28:50.328 align:middle line:84%
of different conformations,
different forms.

00:28:50.328 --> 00:28:57.002 align:middle line:84%
These forms allow it to
resonate in different ways

00:28:57.002 --> 00:28:59.805 align:middle line:84%
with the quantum
field-- with the field.

00:28:59.805 --> 00:29:00.939 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: So you're talking

00:29:00.939 --> 00:29:05.310 align:middle line:84%
about the architecture
of this, the biology?

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:07.012 align:middle line:90%
What is the architect?

00:29:07.012 --> 00:29:09.481 align:middle line:90%
Or who? Or what?

00:29:09.481 --> 00:29:13.018 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously, consciousness
is ubiquitous throughout the

00:29:13.018 --> 00:29:15.153 align:middle line:90%
universe, in every single thing.

00:29:15.153 --> 00:29:20.358 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: The universe is the
architect of its own design.

00:29:20.358 --> 00:29:23.161 align:middle line:84%
We are the architect
of our own design.

00:29:23.161 --> 00:29:25.664 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: OK, now, this--
OK, I had a--

00:29:25.664 --> 00:29:27.499 align:middle line:84%
something, can I
share this with you?

00:29:27.499 --> 00:29:28.033 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Absolutely.

00:29:28.033 --> 00:29:29.367 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:29:29.367 --> 00:29:30.936 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: It was-- it's a physicist,
I won't mention who it is.

00:29:30.936 --> 00:29:34.606 align:middle line:84%
He's very high profile and was
with one of the administrations.

00:29:34.606 --> 00:29:37.175 align:middle line:84%
He was writing a
book and it had to do

00:29:37.175 --> 00:29:40.312 align:middle line:84%
with the organizing
principle of the human mind,

00:29:40.312 --> 00:29:42.747 align:middle line:90%
the individuated human mind.

00:29:42.747 --> 00:29:45.984 align:middle line:84%
And so, I said, "Would
you know the answer yet?"

00:29:45.984 --> 00:29:49.488 align:middle line:84%
He was writing the book
and he said, "No, I don't."

00:29:49.488 --> 00:29:51.923 align:middle line:84%
But by the time I finish the
book, I'll know the answer.

00:29:51.923 --> 00:29:53.225 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: That's a--

00:29:53.225 --> 00:29:54.326 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: And so I went to bed
and I woke up in the morning

00:29:54.326 --> 00:29:57.295 align:middle line:84%
and as I was awakening,
I heard these words,

00:29:57.295 --> 00:30:02.634 align:middle line:84%
"it said the organizing
principle behind the quantum

00:30:02.634 --> 00:30:03.935 align:middle line:90%
development of the human--

00:30:03.935 --> 00:30:08.573 align:middle line:84%
individuated human mind is
the intention of the soul,"

00:30:09.641 --> 00:30:11.476 align:middle line:84%
meaning the soul
that's going to take

00:30:11.476 --> 00:30:14.212 align:middle line:90%
on that vehicle is manipulating

00:30:14.212 --> 00:30:18.016 align:middle line:84%
through its own field the
intelligence of, as you say,

00:30:18.016 --> 00:30:21.253 align:middle line:84%
the DNA and such to express
what it needs to to occupy

00:30:21.253 --> 00:30:23.355 align:middle line:90%
that for an experience.

00:30:23.355 --> 00:30:24.122 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:30:24.122 --> 00:30:25.724 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Absolute sense.

00:30:25.724 --> 00:30:30.128 align:middle line:84%
Now, actually, although
that's put

00:30:30.128 --> 00:30:34.766 align:middle line:84%
in a little bit more
esoteric terminology

00:30:34.766 --> 00:30:40.205 align:middle line:84%
than what I would use for
a scientific discussion.

00:30:40.205 --> 00:30:42.107 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: That's just
the way I heard it.

00:30:42.107 --> 00:30:43.174 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: Yes, yes, yes,
and that's--

00:30:43.174 --> 00:30:44.943 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: I passed it on to him.

00:30:44.943 --> 00:30:45.911 align:middle line:90%
He said, "Where'd you get that?"

00:30:45.911 --> 00:30:46.912 align:middle line:84%
I said, "I heard
it when I woke up."

00:30:46.912 --> 00:30:47.879 align:middle line:90%
And he said, "Oh!"

00:30:47.879 --> 00:30:49.281 align:middle line:90%
And then so he dismissed it

00:30:49.281 --> 00:30:52.951 align:middle line:84%
because it was just
something I heard.

00:30:52.951 --> 00:30:56.221 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: Yes, those soul
intonations are not

00:30:56.221 --> 00:30:57.555 align:middle line:90%
to be dismissed.

00:30:57.555 --> 00:30:59.724 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: So how would you put
that in more scientific terms

00:30:59.724 --> 00:31:02.861 align:middle line:84%
because it's right at the crux
of what we're talking about?

00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:09.234 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: So this-- what you
experienced is actually the

00:31:09.234 --> 00:31:12.904 align:middle line:90%
model that I'm developing

00:31:12.904 --> 00:31:20.812 align:middle line:84%
to describe human
consciousness and sentience.

00:31:20.812 --> 00:31:22.914 align:middle line:90%
Because beyond that of course--

00:31:22.914 --> 00:31:24.249 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yeah.

00:31:24.249 --> 00:31:29.888 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: So human consciousness,
sentience and the genesis

00:31:29.888 --> 00:31:38.964 align:middle line:84%
of order that the genesis
of everything really,

00:31:39.998 --> 00:31:46.738 align:middle line:84%
it's a cosmogenic
model, cosmogenesis.

00:31:46.738 --> 00:31:48.740 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Cosmogenesis, yes.

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:54.980 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: Now, I had said that we're
receiving information from--

00:31:54.980 --> 00:32:00.318 align:middle line:84%
at a universal scale, the
universal mind, you know,

00:32:00.318 --> 00:32:04.656 align:middle line:84%
this has been described
as a mental field,

00:32:04.656 --> 00:32:08.460 align:middle line:84%
[inaudible] by physicists
such as Dr. [inaudible].

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:12.697 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Yes, that is true,
and even in very complex

00:32:12.697 --> 00:32:16.468 align:middle line:84%
and sophisticated
spiritual tradition such as

00:32:16.468 --> 00:32:19.504 align:middle line:84%
that of [inaudible], for
example, they explain this

00:32:19.504 --> 00:32:22.207 align:middle line:90%
as that mental plane as well.

00:32:22.207 --> 00:32:23.341 align:middle line:90%
So this is where science

00:32:23.341 --> 00:32:26.578 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness
again starts merging.

00:32:26.578 --> 00:32:30.682 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: And this is where
science becomes informed--

00:32:30.682 --> 00:32:31.783 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:32:31.783 --> 00:32:35.987 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: In the spiritual
philosophies.

00:32:35.987 --> 00:32:43.395 align:middle line:84%
Well, so you can already see
how that information could be,

00:32:43.395 --> 00:32:46.531 align:middle line:84%
I mean, of a pretty
extraordinary nature

00:32:46.531 --> 00:32:50.201 align:middle line:84%
if it's linked at
a universal scale.

00:32:50.201 --> 00:32:58.443 align:middle line:84%
Well, they even more importantly
to rate it, so to speak,

00:32:58.443 --> 00:33:01.646 align:middle line:90%
is that transtemporal aspect.

00:33:01.646 --> 00:33:02.647 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Across time.

00:33:02.647 --> 00:33:03.581 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Across time.

00:33:03.581 --> 00:33:08.186 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you talk
about the soul,

00:33:08.186 --> 00:33:14.125 align:middle line:84%
that level of consciousness
is overlaying what we would

00:33:14.125 --> 00:33:18.863 align:middle line:84%
experience as multiple
timelines, past, present,

00:33:18.863 --> 00:33:25.170 align:middle line:90%
future, parallel timelines.

00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:32.243 align:middle line:84%
So, most of the time that
information that when we receive

00:33:32.243 --> 00:33:36.648 align:middle line:84%
that just like you did,
that information is coming

00:33:36.648 --> 00:33:40.985 align:middle line:84%
from what we would
perceive as a future time.

00:33:40.985 --> 00:33:43.655 align:middle line:84%
But of course, you
know, that's a linear--

00:33:43.655 --> 00:33:45.256 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Hard to say
because it's not linear.

00:33:45.256 --> 00:33:46.091 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Yeah, yeah.

00:33:46.091 --> 00:33:46.858 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: It came from somewhere.

00:33:46.858 --> 00:33:47.492 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:47.492 --> 00:33:48.193 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Well, it's--

00:33:48.193 --> 00:33:48.960 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Somewhere in time.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.428 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: It's there right now

00:33:50.428 --> 00:33:55.133 align:middle line:84%
but we can't call it a future
timeline in that at some point,

00:33:55.133 --> 00:33:57.569 align:middle line:90%
our physical consciousness,

00:33:57.569 --> 00:34:01.139 align:middle line:84%
our physical awareness is
going to experience that.

00:34:01.139 --> 00:34:05.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's going to be
experience is a passage of time

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:08.746 align:middle line:84%
but that's not mechanically
what's occurring

00:34:08.746 --> 00:34:13.217 align:middle line:84%
because it's already there, it's
already existing, you know, so--

00:34:13.217 --> 00:34:20.858 align:middle line:84%
but-- so when you talk
about human consciousness

00:34:20.858 --> 00:34:24.162 align:middle line:84%
or consciousness in
general, how do we explain

00:34:24.162 --> 00:34:26.396 align:middle line:90%
that in a scientific way?

00:34:26.396 --> 00:34:35.473 align:middle line:84%
And there is actually
a really coherent

00:34:36.641 --> 00:34:41.713 align:middle line:84%
and scientifically
eloquent theory that does so

00:34:41.713 --> 00:34:50.788 align:middle line:84%
and it has very much to do
with that future timeline.

00:34:53.224 --> 00:34:58.363 align:middle line:84%
Now, this has been called
like the omega point.

00:34:58.363 --> 00:35:02.934 align:middle line:84%
Actually, even that the
transhumanist would even call

00:35:02.934 --> 00:35:07.806 align:middle line:84%
this kind of like the--
well, post singularity point

00:35:07.806 --> 00:35:10.375 align:middle line:90%
that even the singulatarians--

00:35:10.375 --> 00:35:11.576 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes, Ray Kurzweil.

00:35:11.576 --> 00:35:13.344 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Well, Ray Kurzweil have

00:35:13.344 --> 00:35:20.985 align:middle line:84%
within their philosophy the
idea, the understanding,

00:35:20.985 --> 00:35:23.488 align:middle line:84%
I would even say that
we could reach a level

00:35:23.488 --> 00:35:26.124 align:middle line:90%
of technological sophistication

00:35:26.124 --> 00:35:30.094 align:middle line:84%
in which we begin
endowing physical matter

00:35:30.094 --> 00:35:31.763 align:middle line:90%
with intelligence.

00:35:31.763 --> 00:35:36.801 align:middle line:84%
That now, you know, they
have their own ideas

00:35:36.801 --> 00:35:38.069 align:middle line:90%
of how that would happen.

00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:44.142 align:middle line:84%
But there is an attractor
point to the universe,

00:35:44.142 --> 00:35:46.578 align:middle line:90%
to how things are evolving--

00:35:46.578 --> 00:35:50.315 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: And your belief and your
understanding is that it's--

00:35:50.315 --> 00:35:54.686 align:middle line:84%
you see, it's a conspiracy
toward advancement,

00:35:54.686 --> 00:35:57.488 align:middle line:84%
advancement of consciousness,
advancement, period.

00:35:57.488 --> 00:35:58.323 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Yes.

00:35:58.323 --> 00:36:02.560 align:middle line:90%
There is a hidden conspiracy.

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.661 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:36:03.661 --> 00:36:10.101 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: It is playing
out, it is driving us

00:36:10.101 --> 00:36:14.639 align:middle line:90%
and the universe, really--

00:36:14.639 --> 00:36:16.007 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Right.

00:36:16.007 --> 00:36:21.613 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: -- towards greater and
greater levels of intelligence.

00:36:21.613 --> 00:36:23.448 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: OK. Can I ask-- just
going to ask you something

00:36:23.448 --> 00:36:25.116 align:middle line:84%
at this point because
you've just gotten--

00:36:25.116 --> 00:36:27.485 align:middle line:84%
you just touched on it and
I said we would go there.

00:36:27.485 --> 00:36:34.626 align:middle line:84%
Explain your vision of
informing the physical process

00:36:34.626 --> 00:36:38.363 align:middle line:84%
for organic human
advancement as opposed

00:36:38.363 --> 00:36:43.868 align:middle line:84%
to the transhuman agenda,
not agenda, but belief in how

00:36:43.868 --> 00:36:46.938 align:middle line:84%
that should be done or can
be done or will be done.

00:36:46.938 --> 00:36:47.939 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Well--

00:36:47.939 --> 00:36:49.707 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: And the outcomes
of both, I mean,

00:36:49.707 --> 00:36:52.877 align:middle line:84%
these are two different-- it's
completely different thoughts.

00:36:52.877 --> 00:36:58.883 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: I think that the main
distinguishing factors is--

00:36:58.883 --> 00:37:04.088 align:middle line:84%
comes from our difference
in beliefs this close.

00:37:04.088 --> 00:37:05.757 align:middle line:90%
Now, they're more

00:37:05.757 --> 00:37:10.194 align:middle line:84%
of the mainstream consensus
scientific paradigm.

00:37:10.194 --> 00:37:13.531 align:middle line:84%
And so if you look at
exactly what that says,

00:37:13.531 --> 00:37:22.607 align:middle line:84%
it says that life arose on Earth
through abiogenic processes,

00:37:23.775 --> 00:37:28.446 align:middle line:84%
that you had a primordial
ooze, it was struck

00:37:28.446 --> 00:37:31.015 align:middle line:90%
by lightning and formed--

00:37:31.015 --> 00:37:32.850 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Kind of classical
evolution, right?

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:33.384 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Yeah, yeah.

00:37:33.384 --> 00:37:34.218 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yeah.

00:37:34.218 --> 00:37:35.453 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Now, this is a serious--

00:37:35.453 --> 00:37:39.090 align:middle line:84%
actually, going back to
the origin of the universe,

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:42.694 align:middle line:84%
this is all just a series of
happenstance from the states--

00:37:42.694 --> 00:37:43.394 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Right.

00:37:43.394 --> 00:37:44.128 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: -- and accidents.

00:37:44.128 --> 00:37:45.797 align:middle line:90%
Completely random.

00:37:45.797 --> 00:37:51.102 align:middle line:84%
There's no order in principle
aside from natural laws

00:37:51.102 --> 00:37:52.804 align:middle line:84%
that appeared out of
nowhere for no reason

00:37:52.804 --> 00:37:55.540 align:middle line:84%
and were random in
and of themselves.

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:58.376 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: So we randomly became
intelligent enough to be able

00:37:58.376 --> 00:38:00.845 align:middle line:84%
to know and view matter
with intelligence?

00:38:00.845 --> 00:38:03.881 align:middle line:90%
OK. So what's the agenda there?

00:38:03.881 --> 00:38:06.751 align:middle line:90%
I mean besides immortality.

00:38:06.751 --> 00:38:10.021 align:middle line:84%
If you go to intelligence.org
and you read the background

00:38:10.021 --> 00:38:12.190 align:middle line:84%
of each of the people involved,
you know, there are a lot

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:14.926 align:middle line:84%
of the primary people involved
in the transhuman movement,

00:38:14.926 --> 00:38:17.996 align:middle line:84%
you can see that it's
highly academic and mental.

00:38:17.996 --> 00:38:22.033 align:middle line:84%
There's no heart, there's no
real respect for the beauty

00:38:22.033 --> 00:38:25.336 align:middle line:84%
of the refinement
process in humans,

00:38:25.336 --> 00:38:27.538 align:middle line:90%
in consciousness and nature.

00:38:27.538 --> 00:38:30.341 align:middle line:84%
It's very oriented toward
trying to find the holy grail

00:38:30.341 --> 00:38:33.444 align:middle line:84%
of immortality or domination
[multiple speakers] abomination.

00:38:33.444 --> 00:38:36.447 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: Well, because the only
way you could have that kind

00:38:36.447 --> 00:38:39.884 align:middle line:84%
of perspective and agenda is
if there is no heart involved.

00:38:39.884 --> 00:38:40.585 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: That's right.

00:38:40.585 --> 00:38:41.152 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Yeah.

00:38:41.152 --> 00:38:42.520 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Exactly.

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:46.724 align:middle line:84%
There's no heart, you won't
find that on intelligence.org.

00:38:46.724 --> 00:38:49.494 align:middle line:84%
So that's that agenda
which maybe is toward--

00:38:49.494 --> 00:38:53.765 align:middle line:84%
with a militaristic domination
with, you know, super species

00:38:53.765 --> 00:38:54.899 align:middle line:90%
like we see in Hollywood.

00:38:54.899 --> 00:38:56.667 align:middle line:84%
Hollywood is reflecting
all of these back out.

00:38:56.667 --> 00:38:57.769 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: They like the idea.

00:38:57.769 --> 00:38:58.970 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: I-- they do like the idea.

00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:01.806 align:middle line:84%
It's really scary and it
really is disempowering,

00:39:01.806 --> 00:39:03.608 align:middle line:84%
so now let's look at
your version because I'd

00:39:03.608 --> 00:39:05.476 align:middle line:84%
like to see the Hollywood
version

00:39:05.476 --> 00:39:07.678 align:middle line:90%
of how you see it happening.

00:39:07.678 --> 00:39:08.780 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: That would be amazing.

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:09.647 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: That would be amazing.

00:39:09.647 --> 00:39:11.616 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what that looks like,

00:39:11.616 --> 00:39:14.352 align:middle line:84%
what it's like in the
agenda, so to speak?

00:39:14.352 --> 00:39:23.428 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: Well, so I think in no way
was this set of random mistakes,

00:39:24.796 --> 00:39:27.899 align:middle line:90%
of accidents, unbelievable to me

00:39:27.899 --> 00:39:31.602 align:middle line:84%
that that could be
entertained for a moment.

00:39:31.602 --> 00:39:34.038 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can entertain
it for a moment

00:39:34.038 --> 00:39:37.508 align:middle line:84%
and then have a good
laugh afterwards.

00:39:37.508 --> 00:39:46.584 align:middle line:84%
So, there is underlying
intelligence to the emergence

00:39:47.718 --> 00:39:55.860 align:middle line:84%
of the form and function
of humans-- of all life.

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:58.463 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I've got
in-depth discussions

00:39:58.463 --> 00:40:05.937 align:middle line:84%
on exactly what I mean by that
and how that works actually,

00:40:05.937 --> 00:40:15.012 align:middle line:84%
so this-- that the biological
organism isn't this result

00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:23.321 align:middle line:84%
of just selective
Darwinian processes,

00:40:23.321 --> 00:40:27.925 align:middle line:84%
it is from that transhumanist
perspective flawed,

00:40:27.925 --> 00:40:34.298 align:middle line:84%
it's flawed in many ways, it's
lesser than our technologies.

00:40:34.298 --> 00:40:41.672 align:middle line:84%
Our technologies are superior to
this flawed Darwinian product.

00:40:41.672 --> 00:40:50.748 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you look actually
though at the physics

00:40:51.916 --> 00:40:55.319 align:middle line:84%
of the biological system,
at the biomolecules,

00:40:55.319 --> 00:40:58.723 align:middle line:84%
the molecular biology
of these organisms

00:40:58.723 --> 00:41:01.425 align:middle line:84%
that the paracrystalline
arrangement that--

00:41:01.425 --> 00:41:02.493 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Oh, just the beauty

00:41:02.493 --> 00:41:04.562 align:middle line:84%
and the geometry
alone, laying color--

00:41:04.562 --> 00:41:12.270 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: And the function-- and you
experience what this organism

00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:14.405 align:middle line:90%
can do.

00:41:14.405 --> 00:41:17.174 align:middle line:84%
If you see some of the
things this organism can do,

00:41:17.174 --> 00:41:22.713 align:middle line:84%
some of the things the mind
can do, it's far superior

00:41:22.713 --> 00:41:26.083 align:middle line:84%
to anything that our own
technologies can replicate.

00:41:26.083 --> 00:41:27.552 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: OK, so it's Hollywood.

00:41:27.552 --> 00:41:29.520 align:middle line:90%
We're now coming to your movie.

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:31.956 align:middle line:84%
Tell us how this
can express itself.

00:41:31.956 --> 00:41:36.427 align:middle line:84%
How you see it already capable
of expressing itself, how it--

00:41:36.427 --> 00:41:40.331 align:middle line:84%
we express ourselves in the
future even down to how,

00:41:40.331 --> 00:41:42.600 align:middle line:90%
as I said in the beginning,

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:45.670 align:middle line:84%
an individual molecule
has its own imagination

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:48.439 align:middle line:90%
and can image a future outcome?

00:41:48.439 --> 00:41:55.146 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: So instead of trying
to transfer ourselves

00:41:55.146 --> 00:42:00.685 align:middle line:84%
into computers which I have
no idea how it was determined,

00:42:00.685 --> 00:42:05.723 align:middle line:84%
those are superior in
any ways as a human--

00:42:05.723 --> 00:42:08.392 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Better at math
than most of us, faster.

00:42:08.392 --> 00:42:10.861 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: Unless you see
some of these advance.

00:42:10.861 --> 00:42:11.829 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yeah, you have no--

00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:13.564 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying than most
of us, I get it.

00:42:13.564 --> 00:42:15.232 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: Than most of
us, yeah, yeah.

00:42:15.232 --> 00:42:21.739 align:middle line:84%
Well, in my Hollywood version,
it would be people coming

00:42:21.739 --> 00:42:26.043 align:middle line:84%
to the understanding that
there are amazing unparalleled

00:42:26.043 --> 00:42:32.984 align:middle line:84%
capabilities of the molecular
biology and the body as a whole

00:42:32.984 --> 00:42:35.720 align:middle line:90%
of this biological system,

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:39.557 align:middle line:84%
and that your development
doesn't end

00:42:39.557 --> 00:42:43.694 align:middle line:84%
at when you become an
adult, that's the beginning.

00:42:43.694 --> 00:42:48.933 align:middle line:84%
There is a lifetime
more of development

00:42:48.933 --> 00:42:51.802 align:middle line:90%
that the human being undergoes.

00:42:51.802 --> 00:43:00.878 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of this development
produces really amazing levels

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:04.048 align:middle line:90%
of awareness.

00:43:04.048 --> 00:43:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And so in this Hollywood
version,

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:12.723 align:middle line:84%
people would be accessing
the technology

00:43:12.723 --> 00:43:17.728 align:middle line:84%
of the biological system,
their inner technology.

00:43:17.728 --> 00:43:22.066 align:middle line:84%
And from my perspective,
this is--

00:43:22.066 --> 00:43:28.272 align:middle line:84%
that the biological organism
is very close to the apex

00:43:28.272 --> 00:43:33.377 align:middle line:84%
of the capabilities of
technological achievement

00:43:33.377 --> 00:43:36.614 align:middle line:84%
that they can be achieved
by physical matter.

00:43:36.614 --> 00:43:40.351 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: A lot of people would find
that an astounding statement--

00:43:40.351 --> 00:43:41.619 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: It's just--

00:43:41.619 --> 00:43:43.421 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: -- because we denigrate
the biology as some kind

00:43:43.421 --> 00:43:47.224 align:middle line:84%
of slave that either works
for us or against us.

00:43:47.224 --> 00:43:49.093 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: And-- yeah, yeah.

00:43:49.093 --> 00:43:54.265 align:middle line:84%
But the reason is just
because it's so advanced,

00:43:54.265 --> 00:43:57.234 align:middle line:84%
we can't recognize
it, we cannot see it.

00:43:57.234 --> 00:44:01.238 align:middle line:84%
The scientist-- scientists,
we can't see it.

00:44:01.238 --> 00:44:05.509 align:middle line:84%
Now, as our understanding
is progressing

00:44:05.509 --> 00:44:08.412 align:middle line:84%
like what our quantum
physics experiments,

00:44:08.412 --> 00:44:11.782 align:middle line:84%
so what we're trying
to understand

00:44:11.782 --> 00:44:14.852 align:middle line:84%
that the quantum
mechanical nature of matter.

00:44:14.852 --> 00:44:18.556 align:middle line:84%
Now, because of the way that's
done in the lab, it's that,

00:44:18.556 --> 00:44:20.725 align:middle line:90%
"Oh well, there's no way

00:44:20.725 --> 00:44:23.327 align:middle line:84%
that biological system could
have anything to do with it,"

00:44:23.327 --> 00:44:28.632 align:middle line:84%
as if our meager
understanding and how we set it

00:44:28.632 --> 00:44:32.103 align:middle line:84%
up in the lab has anything
to do with how nature--

00:44:32.103 --> 00:44:32.870 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: I know [inaudible].

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:34.138 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Nature's capability.

00:44:34.138 --> 00:44:39.110 align:middle line:84%
But billions of years just
transcendental, you know,

00:44:39.110 --> 00:44:43.647 align:middle line:84%
multidimensional, that this
design, this architect,

00:44:43.647 --> 00:44:50.955 align:middle line:84%
you know, this process,
so-- but coming--

00:44:50.955 --> 00:44:54.992 align:middle line:84%
so we're just scratching the
surface at that, you know,

00:44:54.992 --> 00:44:56.861 align:middle line:84%
starting to understand
quantum physics.

00:44:56.861 --> 00:45:01.799 align:middle line:84%
Now, a couple of scientists is
[inaudible], well, what if it's

00:45:01.799 --> 00:45:03.768 align:middle line:90%
in the biological system

00:45:03.768 --> 00:45:06.036 align:middle line:84%
and we just start
scratching the surface of that

00:45:06.036 --> 00:45:12.042 align:middle line:84%
and instantly you start seeing
a quantum mechanical phenomena,

00:45:12.042 --> 00:45:14.211 align:middle line:90%
not in the trivial sense,

00:45:14.211 --> 00:45:20.518 align:middle line:84%
but really phenomenal
quantum mechanical activities

00:45:20.518 --> 00:45:23.721 align:middle line:84%
like superconduction,
what they call it actually

00:45:23.721 --> 00:45:26.123 align:middle line:90%
ballistic conduction.

00:45:26.123 --> 00:45:29.794 align:middle line:84%
Now, what-- it's basically
a hundred percent efficiency

00:45:29.794 --> 00:45:35.699 align:middle line:84%
of transfer of like electrons
within the biological system.

00:45:35.699 --> 00:45:38.235 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: When I was listening
to one of your talks,

00:45:38.235 --> 00:45:41.505 align:middle line:84%
you were explaining
that it's the coding,

00:45:41.505 --> 00:45:44.074 align:middle line:90%
the coding like the membrane.

00:45:44.074 --> 00:45:46.510 align:middle line:90%
If a cell, for example,

00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:50.881 align:middle line:84%
that's able to receive this
transtemporal information

00:45:50.881 --> 00:45:55.252 align:middle line:90%
infused light.

00:45:55.252 --> 00:45:56.654 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Well, so--

00:45:56.654 --> 00:46:01.225 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: So it's communicating far
beyond anything our brain could

00:46:01.225 --> 00:46:03.427 align:middle line:90%
conceive it.

00:46:03.427 --> 00:46:11.936 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: Yeah, yeah, yeah, so the
deeper you go at that level,

00:46:11.936 --> 00:46:16.507 align:middle line:84%
actually the further out,
it expands it and the level

00:46:16.507 --> 00:46:17.808 align:middle line:90%
of information is coming in.

00:46:17.808 --> 00:46:21.212 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's one of the
reasons that meditation is

00:46:21.212 --> 00:46:22.813 align:middle line:90%
so efficacious like a--

00:46:22.813 --> 00:46:23.681 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:46:23.681 --> 00:46:25.015 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: You kind of go in.

00:46:25.015 --> 00:46:28.786 align:middle line:90%
Well, so but actually,

00:46:28.786 --> 00:46:34.992 align:middle line:84%
nearly all of the biological
structures are involved

00:46:34.992 --> 00:46:39.730 align:middle line:84%
in this information
transduction,

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:45.035 align:middle line:84%
this information exchange with
the field, the unified field,

00:46:45.035 --> 00:46:49.173 align:middle line:84%
the quantum field through
light, light transmission.

00:46:49.173 --> 00:46:50.574 align:middle line:90%
Now, each one--

00:46:50.574 --> 00:46:54.712 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: And light's carrying
information, it is information.

00:46:54.712 --> 00:46:55.346 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Right.

00:46:55.346 --> 00:46:56.413 align:middle line:90%
It is information.

00:46:56.413 --> 00:46:57.314 align:middle line:84%
Like, well, when you
think light, think--

00:46:57.314 --> 00:46:58.883 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes, think information.

00:46:58.883 --> 00:47:00.184 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: -- information.

00:47:00.184 --> 00:47:01.652 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and-- it's, it's--

00:47:01.652 --> 00:47:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: And that's just
the visible spectrum

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:05.789 align:middle line:90%
of the information so to speak.

00:47:05.789 --> 00:47:06.957 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:47:06.957 --> 00:47:11.462 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: Now that the
biological system is working

00:47:11.462 --> 00:47:14.198 align:middle line:84%
with that light, you
know, across the spectrum.

00:47:14.198 --> 00:47:15.499 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yeah.

00:47:15.499 --> 00:47:17.635 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: Even quite possibly
in the areas of the spectrum

00:47:17.635 --> 00:47:22.640 align:middle line:84%
that we have yet to
be able to work with,

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:26.110 align:middle line:84%
with physical instrumentation,
et cetera.

00:47:26.110 --> 00:47:28.078 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Right.

00:47:28.078 --> 00:47:32.016 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: But so every
structure of the cell,

00:47:32.016 --> 00:47:38.155 align:middle line:84%
the biological organism, it is
involved in this light exchange.

00:47:38.155 --> 00:47:42.593 align:middle line:84%
It's just that each
structure is doing it

00:47:42.593 --> 00:47:47.698 align:middle line:84%
in a slightly different fashion,
and this is where you get kind

00:47:47.698 --> 00:47:51.969 align:middle line:84%
of the evolution and
computation, not the best word,

00:47:51.969 --> 00:47:58.842 align:middle line:84%
metaphorically speaking, but the
processing of this information.

00:47:58.842 --> 00:48:03.047 align:middle line:84%
In terms of the membranes,
the membrane,

00:48:03.047 --> 00:48:07.217 align:middle line:90%
the surface structures, I think

00:48:07.217 --> 00:48:11.689 align:middle line:84%
that those are primarily
involved

00:48:11.689 --> 00:48:15.893 align:middle line:84%
in actual transmission
of imagery.

00:48:15.893 --> 00:48:16.860 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Interesting.

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:18.195 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Literal images.

00:48:18.195 --> 00:48:21.432 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Images, that's where
you're talking about ourselves,

00:48:21.432 --> 00:48:23.434 align:middle line:90%
how they're-- or the molecules

00:48:23.434 --> 00:48:26.570 align:middle line:84%
in our body have their
own ability to imagine.

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And is that transtemporal
as well?

00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:35.212 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: Well, that is--
yeah, absolutely,

00:48:35.212 --> 00:48:38.215 align:middle line:84%
'cause that the images,
the imagery,

00:48:38.215 --> 00:48:42.686 align:middle line:90%
holographic images really,

00:48:42.686 --> 00:48:47.358 align:middle line:84%
they're coming literally
from the field.

00:48:47.358 --> 00:48:52.262 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's not just that the
field is randomly filling the

00:48:52.262 --> 00:48:54.231 align:middle line:90%
center, that their structure,

00:48:54.231 --> 00:48:58.802 align:middle line:84%
topological structure
to the field as well.

00:48:58.802 --> 00:49:06.977 align:middle line:84%
Now, at that level of the field
that is nonlocal, transtemporal,

00:49:06.977 --> 00:49:11.582 align:middle line:90%
that's our soul again.

00:49:11.582 --> 00:49:20.024 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is where these images
are ultimately coming from.

00:49:20.024 --> 00:49:21.392 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: That's architect.

00:49:21.392 --> 00:49:22.993 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Yeah, yeah.

00:49:22.993 --> 00:49:24.128 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yeah.

00:49:24.128 --> 00:49:32.569 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: Now, this level of
the field, it's called--

00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:39.977 align:middle line:84%
it's a hyperspace
because it's more

00:49:39.977 --> 00:49:44.248 align:middle line:84%
than just normal three
physical spatial dimensions--

00:49:44.248 --> 00:49:45.349 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Right.

00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:47.651 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: -- that we're
used to dealing with.

00:49:47.651 --> 00:49:53.991 align:middle line:84%
Now, within the science,
this hyperspace,

00:49:53.991 --> 00:49:59.696 align:middle line:84%
it's eight-dimensional
complexified domain.

00:49:59.696 --> 00:50:03.233 align:middle line:84%
Don't need to worry of what that
means exactly, but another word

00:50:03.233 --> 00:50:07.271 align:middle line:90%
for it is the imaginary domain.

00:50:07.271 --> 00:50:10.140 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: The creative domain,
the domains of creation.

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:10.841 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:12.810 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: And imagination.

00:50:12.810 --> 00:50:13.644 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:50:13.644 --> 00:50:15.212 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Right.

00:50:15.212 --> 00:50:19.049 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: And this is,
you know, where that--

00:50:19.049 --> 00:50:23.821 align:middle line:84%
that light, the information
is coming from has images.

00:50:23.821 --> 00:50:31.261 align:middle line:84%
Now because when you think, you
know, when we're having thoughts

00:50:31.261 --> 00:50:34.298 align:middle line:84%
which is unfortunately
running throughout the day,

00:50:34.298 --> 00:50:38.502 align:middle line:84%
and that we sit down,
hopefully get some time to quiet

00:50:38.502 --> 00:50:43.207 align:middle line:84%
down a little bit, it's
images, it's imagery.

00:50:43.207 --> 00:50:44.541 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Right.

00:50:44.541 --> 00:50:47.544 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: That's how we think,
of course, there's, you know,

00:50:47.544 --> 00:50:51.281 align:middle line:84%
a narrative but especially
even when we're doing

00:50:51.281 --> 00:50:58.655 align:middle line:84%
that creative process, when
we're in the act of creating,

00:50:58.655 --> 00:51:01.759 align:middle line:84%
we're using imagery,
imagination.

00:51:01.759 --> 00:51:03.160 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Right.

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:09.233 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: Now, I think that's
happening at a literal level.

00:51:09.233 --> 00:51:15.005 align:middle line:84%
We're literally accessing
this field,

00:51:15.005 --> 00:51:17.908 align:middle line:90%
this domain that is imagination

00:51:17.908 --> 00:51:21.011 align:middle line:84%
and we're bringing
these images through.

00:51:21.011 --> 00:51:24.114 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it's happening
in nanoseconds--

00:51:24.114 --> 00:51:25.249 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Right.

00:51:25.249 --> 00:51:26.917 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: -- in split
second, extremely rapidly.

00:51:26.917 --> 00:51:31.855 align:middle line:84%
And it just so happens that
I think that the membrane

00:51:31.855 --> 00:51:37.494 align:middle line:84%
of the cell is the perfect place
for those images to be encoded

00:51:37.494 --> 00:51:41.865 align:middle line:84%
and transmitted within
split seconds.

00:51:41.865 --> 00:51:42.666 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:51:42.666 --> 00:51:44.835 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: So that the generation

00:51:44.835 --> 00:51:49.139 align:middle line:84%
of the images is
actually quite literal.

00:51:49.139 --> 00:51:52.176 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: OK, so now, there's so--

00:51:52.176 --> 00:51:56.547 align:middle line:84%
there are a number of things I
want to tap into regarding that.

00:51:56.547 --> 00:52:02.352 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we have the notion,
very simplified, that the soul,

00:52:02.352 --> 00:52:07.891 align:middle line:84%
the multidimensional aspect,
other dimensional aspect

00:52:07.891 --> 00:52:11.995 align:middle line:84%
of our self that we commonly
refer to as a soul, it has--

00:52:11.995 --> 00:52:15.732 align:middle line:84%
is using the creative
process to inform the DNA

00:52:15.732 --> 00:52:19.403 align:middle line:84%
for a certain type of expression
which is a different kind

00:52:19.403 --> 00:52:24.274 align:middle line:84%
of soul force, for example
then, a banana slug who is--

00:52:24.274 --> 00:52:28.011 align:middle line:84%
that's how they're choosing
to create their reality.

00:52:28.011 --> 00:52:30.781 align:middle line:84%
And the same with the great
apes, there's a difference

00:52:30.781 --> 00:52:33.684 align:middle line:84%
in the level of certain
capabilities, for example,

00:52:33.684 --> 00:52:36.486 align:middle line:90%
that we can measure or monitor.

00:52:36.486 --> 00:52:39.756 align:middle line:84%
What happens in the
healing process?

00:52:39.756 --> 00:52:43.026 align:middle line:84%
So now we've imaged this,
now we've gone through a lot

00:52:43.026 --> 00:52:45.596 align:middle line:84%
of different things in life,
we have damaged some of this,

00:52:45.596 --> 00:52:47.531 align:middle line:84%
now some of the vehicle
is taking us

00:52:47.531 --> 00:52:50.901 align:middle line:84%
in really negative
images, let's talk about--

00:52:50.901 --> 00:52:53.003 align:middle line:90%
OK, and take that further.

00:52:53.003 --> 00:52:54.304 align:middle line:90%
We have a lot of radiation

00:52:54.304 --> 00:52:56.707 align:middle line:84%
around the planet right
now, moving like crazy.

00:52:56.707 --> 00:52:57.708 align:middle line:90%
They're not talking about it

00:52:57.708 --> 00:53:00.010 align:middle line:84%
on mainstream news,
got a lot of it.

00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:02.012 align:middle line:84%
Some people are going
to be just fine with it,

00:53:02.012 --> 00:53:06.416 align:middle line:90%
just as happened with Hiroshima.

00:53:06.416 --> 00:53:10.420 align:middle line:84%
Some people were almost immune
to the effects of radiation,

00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:12.022 align:middle line:90%
others succumbed to it.

00:53:12.022 --> 00:53:13.290 align:middle line:90%
Talk about what happens there

00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:16.326 align:middle line:84%
so we can see how we
can recover ourselves

00:53:16.326 --> 00:53:18.829 align:middle line:90%
when damage has occurred.

00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:24.268 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: Well, so there
is, you know,

00:53:24.268 --> 00:53:28.605 align:middle line:84%
I always like to start
off just with the--

00:53:28.605 --> 00:53:33.877 align:middle line:84%
because of how the
soul is informing--

00:53:33.877 --> 00:53:34.444 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:53:34.444 --> 00:53:35.545 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: you know--

00:53:35.545 --> 00:53:36.346 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: The nature of
the soul has something

00:53:36.346 --> 00:53:38.649 align:middle line:90%
to do with this, too, yeah.

00:53:38.649 --> 00:53:43.186 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: There is a very physical
component to it so, you know,

00:53:43.186 --> 00:53:48.025 align:middle line:84%
in terms of dealing with the
radiation inclusion, you know,

00:53:48.025 --> 00:53:53.363 align:middle line:84%
of course, doing thorough
detoxification systems

00:53:53.363 --> 00:54:01.038 align:middle line:84%
to the body and be very aware
of the sources of the nutrients

00:54:01.038 --> 00:54:02.005 align:middle line:84%
that we're taking
into our body--

00:54:02.005 --> 00:54:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Absolutely.

00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:03.740 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: Where the water
coming from.

00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:04.374 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yeah, baseline--

00:54:04.374 --> 00:54:05.642 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: The food.

00:54:05.642 --> 00:54:07.210 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: -- try to keep it as
pure as you're capable of.

00:54:07.210 --> 00:54:07.811 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Yeah, yeah.

00:54:07.811 --> 00:54:08.512 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:54:08.512 --> 00:54:09.346 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Now, beyond that.

00:54:09.346 --> 00:54:12.082 align:middle line:90%
>> WB: Now, beyond that though--

00:54:12.082 --> 00:54:18.121 align:middle line:84%
so, the way that I was kind of
even describing that generation

00:54:18.121 --> 00:54:23.460 align:middle line:84%
of creative thoughts to
images and imagination,

00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:27.297 align:middle line:84%
you almost get the idea that,
OK, there is these images,

00:54:27.297 --> 00:54:32.269 align:middle line:84%
that is light is coming onto
a physical, solid substance

00:54:32.269 --> 00:54:34.071 align:middle line:90%
and being transmitted.

00:54:34.071 --> 00:54:37.341 align:middle line:90%
It's light playing with light.

00:54:37.341 --> 00:54:43.180 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's-- the cell,
the molecules that make

00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:47.417 align:middle line:84%
up the cell are light,
you know, it's all light.

00:54:47.417 --> 00:54:48.752 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:54:48.752 --> 00:54:52.789 align:middle line:84%
If you were to look at it on
a pure level, atomic level,

00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:54.825 align:middle line:90%
it is just space and light.

00:54:54.825 --> 00:54:58.528 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: Yeah, but even
space is light.

00:54:58.528 --> 00:55:00.864 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Is light, yeah.

00:55:00.864 --> 00:55:01.965 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:55:01.965 --> 00:55:05.068 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: Yeah, and so--
and one of the things

00:55:05.068 --> 00:55:10.540 align:middle line:84%
about a holographic
image even is

00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:14.344 align:middle line:84%
that there's nothing
really preventing it

00:55:14.344 --> 00:55:19.316 align:middle line:84%
from changing instantaneously
in any way

00:55:19.316 --> 00:55:23.520 align:middle line:84%
that imaginative
substrate would deem--

00:55:24.488 --> 00:55:25.055 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Worthy.

00:55:25.055 --> 00:55:25.689 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Possible.

00:55:25.689 --> 00:55:26.390 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yeah, yeah.

00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:27.657 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Yeah, possible.

00:55:27.657 --> 00:55:28.925 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yeah.

00:55:28.925 --> 00:55:35.132 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: So there is no kind
of infliction, let's say,

00:55:35.132 --> 00:55:39.703 align:middle line:90%
that is necessarily permanent.

00:55:39.703 --> 00:55:44.207 align:middle line:84%
It would only be
so by our agreement

00:55:44.207 --> 00:55:47.177 align:middle line:90%
to keep it in that form.

00:55:47.177 --> 00:55:50.013 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: To reinforce that.

00:55:50.013 --> 00:55:51.047 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Yeah, yeah.

00:55:51.047 --> 00:55:52.049 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Thank you.

00:55:52.049 --> 00:55:55.886 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: Now, so it's
always permutable.

00:55:55.886 --> 00:56:00.857 align:middle line:84%
In fact, now when you look
though at even these mechanics,

00:56:00.857 --> 00:56:05.562 align:middle line:84%
the underlying mechanics
of select time,

00:56:05.562 --> 00:56:12.235 align:middle line:84%
so I've already said time
is not what we think it is.

00:56:12.235 --> 00:56:13.303 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Right.

00:56:13.303 --> 00:56:15.238 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: 'Cause what we
call past, present,

00:56:15.238 --> 00:56:18.742 align:middle line:84%
or future are all
occurring simultaneously,

00:56:18.742 --> 00:56:21.778 align:middle line:90%
instantaneously right now.

00:56:21.778 --> 00:56:26.550 align:middle line:84%
But then why do we
experience a passage

00:56:26.550 --> 00:56:28.718 align:middle line:90%
of time, linear progression?

00:56:28.718 --> 00:56:34.424 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you look at the
mechanics of what's occurring

00:56:34.424 --> 00:56:38.562 align:middle line:84%
that to have that kind of
experience, the universe,

00:56:38.562 --> 00:56:41.298 align:middle line:84%
there's a couple different
ways to conceive of this

00:56:41.298 --> 00:56:46.403 align:middle line:84%
but the universe is actually
recreating itself billions

00:56:46.403 --> 00:56:48.638 align:middle line:90%
of times in a second.

00:56:48.638 --> 00:56:50.440 align:middle line:90%
It has to.

00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:51.641 align:middle line:90%
That there is--

00:56:51.641 --> 00:56:55.245 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: It has to be
responding to the imagination.

00:56:55.245 --> 00:56:59.549 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: Well, what you
think of is everything--

00:56:59.549 --> 00:57:00.750 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:04.855 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: -- is coming into
like a singularity point.

00:57:04.855 --> 00:57:08.058 align:middle line:84%
Billions of times a
second, it's like coming

00:57:08.058 --> 00:57:12.028 align:middle line:84%
into a singularity point and
you get a big bang again,

00:57:12.028 --> 00:57:13.163 align:middle line:90%
and it's doing this.

00:57:13.163 --> 00:57:16.466 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: So the ability to
constantly recreate it,

00:57:16.466 --> 00:57:18.535 align:middle line:90%
all levels is always present?

00:57:18.535 --> 00:57:21.471 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: It's the intrinsic,

00:57:21.471 --> 00:57:24.608 align:middle line:84%
mechanistic function
of the universe.

00:57:24.608 --> 00:57:26.576 align:middle line:84%
It's how we experience
the passage of time.

00:57:26.576 --> 00:57:28.211 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Say, I want
to see your movie.

00:57:28.211 --> 00:57:32.315 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: Yeah, well,
so, the thing is--

00:57:32.315 --> 00:57:36.119 align:middle line:84%
so the universe is being,
let's say, recreated.

00:57:36.119 --> 00:57:39.789 align:middle line:84%
Now, this isn't technically
correct to say it that way,

00:57:39.789 --> 00:57:42.592 align:middle line:84%
but let's say that it is
being recreated billions

00:57:42.592 --> 00:57:44.528 align:middle line:90%
of times a second.

00:57:44.528 --> 00:57:48.565 align:middle line:84%
Each second, you're in a
completely new universe.

00:57:48.565 --> 00:57:52.402 align:middle line:84%
This is not the same universe
we were just a second ago.

00:57:52.402 --> 00:57:56.773 align:middle line:84%
Literally, nothing about
it is the same at all.

00:57:56.773 --> 00:58:05.482 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of like health,
any kind of health condition,

00:58:05.482 --> 00:58:11.354 align:middle line:84%
a physical damage to the cell or
tissue, you know, toxin that's

00:58:11.354 --> 00:58:14.224 align:middle line:90%
in there, it's only there

00:58:14.224 --> 00:58:18.228 align:middle line:84%
because we keep recreating
it each time the universe

00:58:18.228 --> 00:58:19.729 align:middle line:90%
is reborn.

00:58:19.729 --> 00:58:21.331 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Right and the thing is,

00:58:21.331 --> 00:58:23.934 align:middle line:84%
from what you were saying a
moment ago, I have seen this.

00:58:23.934 --> 00:58:25.936 align:middle line:84%
I have personally witnessed
this, we were talking

00:58:25.936 --> 00:58:27.971 align:middle line:90%
about instantaneous healings.

00:58:27.971 --> 00:58:28.772 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Instantaneous healings.

00:58:28.772 --> 00:58:29.906 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Because the--

00:58:29.906 --> 00:58:31.841 align:middle line:84%
it's possible because
it's recreating itself,

00:58:31.841 --> 00:58:32.909 align:middle line:90%
why not that potential?

00:58:32.909 --> 00:58:35.579 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: You just jumped
into a universe

00:58:35.579 --> 00:58:36.846 align:middle line:90%
where it was never there.

00:58:36.846 --> 00:58:38.481 align:middle line:90%
Do you see now?

00:58:38.481 --> 00:58:44.955 align:middle line:84%
Now, this kind of talk is
a little bit dangerous just

00:58:44.955 --> 00:58:49.426 align:middle line:84%
because you know we can hear
this and be like, "Oh, well,

00:58:49.426 --> 00:58:53.096 align:middle line:84%
you know, each second I'm in
a completely new universe,

00:58:53.096 --> 00:58:56.132 align:middle line:84%
why can't I just make
this disease go away?"

00:58:56.132 --> 00:58:57.500 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Right.

00:58:57.500 --> 00:59:01.504 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: There's a lot of factors
that come into that process.

00:59:01.504 --> 00:59:02.672 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Well, can you explain them

00:59:02.672 --> 00:59:05.075 align:middle line:84%
in one minute 'cause
that's what we have left?

00:59:05.075 --> 00:59:05.942 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: That's right, yeah.

00:59:05.942 --> 00:59:08.011 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: We're having so much fun.

00:59:08.011 --> 00:59:08.545 align:middle line:90%
Just--

00:59:08.545 --> 00:59:09.913 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Well--

00:59:09.913 --> 00:59:12.749 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Just briefly, kind of an
encapsulation of what that--

00:59:12.749 --> 00:59:14.250 align:middle line:84%
what you're saying
about the factors.

00:59:14.250 --> 00:59:16.686 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: That the most important
thing is to understand

00:59:16.686 --> 00:59:18.488 align:middle line:90%
that it's there for a reason.

00:59:18.488 --> 00:59:23.560 align:middle line:84%
Is it your soul being the
architect of how did that happen

00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:26.930 align:middle line:84%
for a reason, so it might
be something that you need

00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:28.331 align:middle line:90%
to experience, you know.

00:59:28.331 --> 00:59:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: And the people who have
instantaneous healings obviously

00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:31.334 align:middle line:90%
have worked through enough

00:59:31.334 --> 00:59:33.303 align:middle line:84%
that that being can let
go of whatever that is.

00:59:33.303 --> 00:59:38.675 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: Or, you know, even that
was the experience that was--

00:59:38.675 --> 00:59:39.509 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Desired.

00:59:39.509 --> 00:59:40.810 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Desired, yes, you know--

00:59:40.810 --> 00:59:42.212 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Oh my gosh.

00:59:42.212 --> 00:59:44.214 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, there are
other things we could talk

00:59:44.214 --> 00:59:48.218 align:middle line:84%
about having to do with
time travel, having to do

00:59:48.218 --> 00:59:52.322 align:middle line:84%
with teleportation, you
would say just in a nutshell,

00:59:52.322 --> 00:59:54.224 align:middle line:84%
all of these falls
within the same framework,

00:59:54.224 --> 00:59:57.861 align:middle line:84%
it's all our birthright, it's
our mind, our consciousness has

00:59:57.861 --> 01:00:01.031 align:middle line:84%
to expand to understanding
it is possible.

01:00:01.031 --> 01:00:04.534 align:middle line:84%
>>WB: I would say it's
what we're doing right now.

01:00:04.534 --> 01:00:09.072 align:middle line:84%
It's natural and inherent
to our very being.

01:00:09.072 --> 01:00:10.507 align:middle line:90%
How are we doing it?

01:00:10.507 --> 01:00:13.877 align:middle line:84%
We're obviously not doing
it fully consciously.

01:00:13.877 --> 01:00:14.678 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Consciously.

01:00:14.678 --> 01:00:15.645 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Right.

01:00:15.645 --> 01:00:16.179 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: But we're doing
it already.

01:00:16.179 --> 01:00:17.447 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Yeah.

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:18.815 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: So it's the consciousness
part that has to go in.

01:00:18.815 --> 01:00:21.484 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we'll have to continue
this into another discussion.

01:00:21.484 --> 01:00:24.421 align:middle line:84%
It's been absolutely
delightful sitting with you.

01:00:24.421 --> 01:00:26.723 align:middle line:84%
You're just like a
ray of light yourself,

01:00:26.723 --> 01:00:28.925 align:middle line:90%
transmitting information.

01:00:28.925 --> 01:00:29.726 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, William.

01:00:29.726 --> 01:00:30.226 align:middle line:90%
>>WB: Thank you.

01:00:30.226 --> 01:00:31.061 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:00:31.061 --> 01:00:32.429 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: William is clearly able

01:00:32.429 --> 01:00:35.398 align:middle line:84%
to see beyond any scientific
constraints of common physics.

01:00:35.398 --> 01:00:38.201 align:middle line:84%
His work is offering a
completely different view

01:00:38.201 --> 01:00:39.969 align:middle line:84%
of both our creation
as a species

01:00:39.969 --> 01:00:41.971 align:middle line:84%
but how our entire
being is in the state

01:00:41.971 --> 01:00:45.308 align:middle line:84%
of perpetual imagination
which is absolutely beautiful.

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:48.745 align:middle line:84%
