[ Music ]

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:24.157 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: It's
been brought to our attention

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:26.159 align:middle line:84%
that there is significance
in numbers.

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:28.628 align:middle line:84%
Such as when we see repeating
patterns when we look

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:30.163 align:middle line:90%
at our watch or clocks.

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:33.900 align:middle line:84%
That's generally as far as most
people get with this awareness.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.202 align:middle line:84%
Scott Onstott's brain
works differently,

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:37.871 align:middle line:90%
in patterns of numbers.

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:40.907 align:middle line:84%
As an architectural
designer, angles and ratios

00:00:40.907 --> 00:00:43.309 align:middle line:90%
and numbers began popping out.

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.146 align:middle line:84%
"Once you see them," he
says, "they are everywhere."

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:49.082 align:middle line:84%
The same sequences and patterns
play out around the world

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:51.918 align:middle line:84%
at most of the world's
sacred sites.

00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:54.187 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
a clip from his film

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:56.456 align:middle line:90%
"Secrets in Plain Sight."

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.525 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Onstott: As a teacher

00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:00.126 align:middle line:84%
of architects it
was the buildings

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:03.295 align:middle line:84%
in Dan Brown's  The DaVinci
Code ,  Angels and Demons ,

00:01:03.295 --> 00:01:05.198 align:middle line:84%
and  The Lost Symbol
that started me

00:01:05.198 --> 00:01:07.700 align:middle line:90%
on a journey of exploration.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.470 align:middle line:84%
What I found encoded in
these structures was stranger

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.606 align:middle line:84%
than fiction, and perhaps
even more compelling.

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:17.811 align:middle line:84%
Friends kept handing me
interesting non-fiction

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:20.246 align:middle line:84%
and after a while I felt
that each was a clue

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:23.550 align:middle line:84%
in some overarching and
interconnected mystery.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.287 align:middle line:84%
I felt I was seeing no more
than the tip of an iceberg.

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:31.157 align:middle line:84%
As I investigated further I
unwittingly began an initiation

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:35.027 align:middle line:84%
into the ancient mysteries as I
progressively uncovered a body

00:01:35.027 --> 00:01:38.997 align:middle line:84%
of knowledge cleverly hidden
in plain sight in the design

00:01:38.997 --> 00:01:42.402 align:middle line:84%
of important buildings,
famous works of art,

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:45.839 align:middle line:84%
and long distance alignments
between sacred sites,

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:48.308 align:middle line:84%
and in the streets and
public spaces of many

00:01:48.308 --> 00:01:50.643 align:middle line:90%
of the world's great cities.

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:52.846 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: The question
is, why are they here

00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:54.247 align:middle line:90%
and who embedded them?

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:56.082 align:middle line:90%
Is this dynamic augmenting

00:01:56.082 --> 00:01:58.284 align:middle line:84%
or hindering our
conscious awareness?

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:00.954 align:middle line:84%
Scott's with us to discuss
our innate connection

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:02.755 align:middle line:90%
with a numerical universe.

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:03.890 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Scott.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.091 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: Thank you.

00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:06.459 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It's wonderful
having you here, Scott.

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:09.295 align:middle line:84%
We had a fabulous conversation
off-camera last night.

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:11.965 align:middle line:84%
It just kind of sparked in a
thousand different directions.

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:14.534 align:middle line:84%
And here we are, we're going to
have to harness it all and try

00:02:14.534 --> 00:02:15.768 align:middle line:90%
to squeeze it into an hour.

00:02:15.768 --> 00:02:18.004 align:middle line:84%
Your video is almost
four hours long.

00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:18.771 align:middle line:90%
This one.

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:19.606 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: That's right.

00:02:19.606 --> 00:02:20.707 align:middle line:90%
Yes. It's quite a long viewing.

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:21.908 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And so
I want to say right

00:02:21.908 --> 00:02:24.577 align:middle line:84%
up front we're only
getting a smattering

00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:25.845 align:middle line:90%
of the information in.

00:02:25.845 --> 00:02:26.946 align:middle line:90%
Because I really want to look

00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:28.882 align:middle line:84%
at the deeper principals
behind it, as well.

00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:29.516 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:02:29.516 --> 00:02:29.948 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: Sure.

00:02:29.948 --> 00:02:31.150 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.385 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And so let's
start with you as a being.

00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:35.321 align:middle line:84%
You're a really unique
human being on many levels.

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:37.657 align:middle line:84%
You see things other
people don't see.

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:38.858 align:middle line:90%
And even though it came,

00:02:38.858 --> 00:02:40.927 align:middle line:84%
it is not like you started
out that way in life.

00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:42.362 align:middle line:90%
You did start out with kind

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:44.531 align:middle line:84%
of a unique imprint
as to who you were.

00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:47.433 align:middle line:84%
And so give us an example
or a little background

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:50.303 align:middle line:84%
on the experience of being
you, in your early life.

00:02:50.303 --> 00:02:53.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: Okay, I was born
without my right hand and both

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.241 align:middle line:90%
of my legs below the knee.

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:58.077 align:middle line:84%
And so from an early
age I realized

00:02:58.077 --> 00:03:00.914 align:middle line:84%
that I wasn't my body,
I was something else.

00:03:00.914 --> 00:03:05.618 align:middle line:84%
And that sort of gave me this
gift of a different perspective.

00:03:05.618 --> 00:03:07.520 align:middle line:90%
Also, being kind of an outsider.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.323 align:middle line:84%
It gave me a slightly
different perspective

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:11.624 align:middle line:90%
than most people have.

00:03:11.624 --> 00:03:13.393 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't start
seeing these patterns

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:15.395 align:middle line:90%
until I was about 33 years old.

00:03:15.395 --> 00:03:17.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: A significant
number as we shall see.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.799 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: Just so
happens [laughter].

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.167 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And so for you,

00:03:21.167 --> 00:03:23.503 align:middle line:84%
when you say you felt you were
a little bit of an outsider.

00:03:23.503 --> 00:03:25.438 align:middle line:84%
But what was it that
made you understand

00:03:25.438 --> 00:03:27.173 align:middle line:84%
because this is a
really big deal

00:03:27.173 --> 00:03:29.008 align:middle line:90%
that most people don't ever get.

00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:30.410 align:middle line:90%
That you were not your body.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.147 align:middle line:84%
How did that really come to take
seed in you, that understanding?

00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:35.515 align:middle line:90%
Because that's a deep awareness.

00:03:35.515 --> 00:03:36.749 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: It just
seemed so obvious

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:41.254 align:middle line:84%
that I was a whole being,
not a partial person.

00:03:41.254 --> 00:03:44.924 align:middle line:84%
And but my body has
specific limitations

00:03:44.924 --> 00:03:46.459 align:middle line:90%
that others don't have.

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.428 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, everybody
has limitations.

00:03:48.428 --> 00:03:50.964 align:middle line:84%
Their physical vehicle
is how it is.

00:03:50.964 --> 00:03:52.799 align:middle line:84%
And I was just fortunate
to be able

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.268 align:middle line:84%
to accept the way I was
right from the get-go.

00:03:55.268 --> 00:03:58.237 align:middle line:84%
So I never had a, I never
suffered a loss like you would

00:03:58.237 --> 00:04:00.673 align:middle line:84%
if you were, lost your
limbs in an accident.

00:04:00.673 --> 00:04:05.378 align:middle line:84%
And so that made it easy
for me to accept who I am.

00:04:05.378 --> 00:04:09.015 align:middle line:84%
But that gave me this
perspective of being different

00:04:09.015 --> 00:04:11.517 align:middle line:90%
and not my body but then

00:04:11.517 --> 00:04:14.186 align:middle line:84%
for a long time I
thought I was my mind.

00:04:14.186 --> 00:04:15.121 align:middle line:90%
Okay and so...

00:04:15.121 --> 00:04:16.422 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: The other
trap

00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:19.125 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: All through my
20's and 30's I was my mind.

00:04:19.125 --> 00:04:22.962 align:middle line:84%
And somehow or other
I was able to see

00:04:22.962 --> 00:04:25.198 align:middle line:90%
that that wasn't the case.

00:04:25.198 --> 00:04:26.966 align:middle line:90%
I'm something else again.

00:04:26.966 --> 00:04:28.701 align:middle line:90%
I'm awareness.

00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:30.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm aware of my mind.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.242 align:middle line:84%
Thoughts come and go and
they don't define who I am.

00:04:36.242 --> 00:04:40.613 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that was a great
liberation from, you know,

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:43.049 align:middle line:84%
identifying so strongly
with the mind.

00:04:43.049 --> 00:04:45.718 align:middle line:84%
But of course the mind can be
a wonderful tool and you need

00:04:45.718 --> 00:04:49.255 align:middle line:84%
to develop that to
whatever capacity you can.

00:04:49.255 --> 00:04:52.058 align:middle line:90%
And that can be useful

00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:54.861 align:middle line:84%
in pattern recognition,
for example.

00:04:54.861 --> 00:04:56.863 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Which is where
we're going to launch

00:04:56.863 --> 00:04:58.231 align:middle line:90%
in to this conversation.

00:04:58.231 --> 00:04:59.399 align:middle line:90%
Where did you first start?

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:01.334 align:middle line:90%
You said you were 33 years old.

00:05:01.334 --> 00:05:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And where did you start
seeing these patterns?

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.938 align:middle line:84%
Where did this come up
into your awareness?

00:05:05.938 --> 00:05:08.374 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: Well it wasn't like
one day I didn't see patterns

00:05:08.374 --> 00:05:09.575 align:middle line:90%
and the next day I did.

00:05:09.575 --> 00:05:12.278 align:middle line:84%
It was a gradual process,
if I look back on it.

00:05:12.278 --> 00:05:16.115 align:middle line:84%
And I think it started, I read
a book by Drunvalo Melchizedek,

00:05:16.115 --> 00:05:19.018 align:middle line:84%
The Ancient Secret of the
Flower of Life, Volumes 1 & 2 .

00:05:19.018 --> 00:05:21.621 align:middle line:84%
And that was kind of an
activator for me in a way.

00:05:21.621 --> 00:05:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
studying crop circles.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And working in architecture
I was used

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.762 align:middle line:84%
to drawing things
accurately in the computer.

00:05:29.762 --> 00:05:32.131 align:middle line:84%
And so I would -- just
as a kind of hobby,

00:05:32.131 --> 00:05:34.600 align:middle line:84%
I would draw the crop
circles in the computer.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that study
of sacred geometry kind

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.908 align:middle line:84%
of opened my mind or somehow,
I can't quite articulate it,

00:05:41.908 --> 00:05:44.243 align:middle line:90%
but it kind of activated me.

00:05:44.243 --> 00:05:49.916 align:middle line:84%
And allowed me to see patterns
where few others do perhaps.

00:05:49.916 --> 00:05:53.019 align:middle line:84%
There are quite a lot of
people that do see all kinds

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:58.191 align:middle line:84%
of patterns but I have this
ability to perceive patterns

00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:00.993 align:middle line:84%
in many disparate phenomena
and many different...

00:06:00.993 --> 00:06:02.328 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes, indeed.

00:06:02.328 --> 00:06:03.663 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: Like, I can see
the patterns in the cities,

00:06:03.663 --> 00:06:06.999 align:middle line:84%
and in the geometry, and in
the body, and in the cosmos,

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:09.068 align:middle line:90%
that as above so below us.

00:06:09.068 --> 00:06:11.370 align:middle line:90%
The same kind of geometry

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.606 align:middle line:84%
or numerical symbolism
that's operating

00:06:13.606 --> 00:06:15.374 align:middle line:90%
at all these different scales.

00:06:15.374 --> 00:06:16.476 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And you've
done a beautiful job

00:06:16.476 --> 00:06:18.778 align:middle line:84%
of demonstrating
that in the film.

00:06:18.778 --> 00:06:21.714 align:middle line:84%
The film, "Secrets
in Plain Sight."

00:06:21.714 --> 00:06:23.416 align:middle line:90%
You said -- you also said

00:06:23.416 --> 00:06:27.687 align:middle line:84%
that Dan Brown's work became
another inspiration for you.

00:06:27.687 --> 00:06:30.623 align:middle line:84%
As it did, I can't even fathom
what's happened to tourism

00:06:30.623 --> 00:06:33.059 align:middle line:84%
in Paris and Rome
and now Florence

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:35.995 align:middle line:84%
with the newest one  Inferno ,
because of what he's spiked

00:06:35.995 --> 00:06:38.197 align:middle line:84%
in our imagination
and curiosity.

00:06:38.197 --> 00:06:39.665 align:middle line:90%
What did it do for you?

00:06:39.665 --> 00:06:43.503 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: It drew my
attention to these places

00:06:43.503 --> 00:06:46.773 align:middle line:90%
and the Freemasons, also.

00:06:46.773 --> 00:06:49.642 align:middle line:90%
And thinking, he really tapped

00:06:49.642 --> 00:06:52.612 align:middle line:84%
into something very
important there.

00:06:52.612 --> 00:06:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's why
perhaps why his books were

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.116 align:middle line:84%
so successful, aside
from the storytelling,

00:06:57.116 --> 00:06:58.251 align:middle line:90%
which was quite gripping.

00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:01.521 align:middle line:84%
It's the subject matter
which was interesting.

00:07:01.521 --> 00:07:04.457 align:middle line:84%
And so I started looking
deeper into these venues

00:07:04.457 --> 00:07:07.727 align:middle line:84%
and these locations and I
found different patterns

00:07:07.727 --> 00:07:10.229 align:middle line:84%
that I think are
just as interesting.

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:12.565 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But that
sparked it initially.

00:07:12.565 --> 00:07:13.132 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: Yeah.

00:07:13.132 --> 00:07:14.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.869 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, the
whole notion of our kind

00:07:16.869 --> 00:07:18.471 align:middle line:90%
of mathematical relationship.

00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:21.941 align:middle line:84%
When we were all meeting
earlier before the show today,

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:23.276 align:middle line:84%
the whole production
team was there.

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:29.148 align:middle line:84%
And one of the people was
asking is this something that's

00:07:29.148 --> 00:07:33.619 align:middle line:84%
conspiracy or by a few or is
this something that's endemic

00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:38.624 align:middle line:84%
to what we are as human beings,
as life forms of all kinds?

00:07:38.624 --> 00:07:42.094 align:middle line:84%
Not just human beings, all life
forms, of ratios, of plants,

00:07:42.094 --> 00:07:46.165 align:middle line:84%
animals, the spirals and the
cosmos, all overlay each other.

00:07:46.165 --> 00:07:46.866 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: That's right.

00:07:46.866 --> 00:07:47.867 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is yes.

00:07:47.867 --> 00:07:48.367 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes [laughter].

00:07:48.367 --> 00:07:49.802 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:07:49.802 --> 00:07:51.003 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: They're
all operative.

00:07:51.003 --> 00:07:51.704 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:07:51.704 --> 00:07:52.505 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: You know.

00:07:52.505 --> 00:07:53.639 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: All of the above.

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:55.041 align:middle line:84%
And when we get to the
end of this conversation

00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:57.243 align:middle line:84%
after we start looking at all
the phenomena now, we are going

00:07:57.243 --> 00:08:01.848 align:middle line:84%
to talk about your perception
of who the architects

00:08:01.848 --> 00:08:05.518 align:middle line:84%
of these amazing
universal patterns,

00:08:05.518 --> 00:08:08.754 align:middle line:84%
from the macro to
the micro, are.

00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:10.857 align:middle line:90%
And what the purpose might be.

00:08:10.857 --> 00:08:11.991 align:middle line:90%
So we'll save that for later

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:15.161 align:middle line:84%
on because it's a larger
philosophical overlay

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:17.530 align:middle line:84%
to the data that
you have discovered.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:21.400 align:middle line:84%
So first let's start out, you
talk about the fact that a lot

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.238 align:middle line:84%
of this came as a result of
preserved hermetic knowledge.

00:08:25.238 --> 00:08:26.272 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: That's right.

00:08:26.272 --> 00:08:27.773 align:middle line:84%
It seemed like the
knowledge that came

00:08:27.773 --> 00:08:30.509 align:middle line:84%
from ancient Egypt was
rediscovered in the Renaissance

00:08:30.509 --> 00:08:32.677 align:middle line:84%
and it sort of fueled
the Renaissance.

00:08:32.677 --> 00:08:35.514 align:middle line:84%
And then there was a time when
that knowledge went underground

00:08:35.514 --> 00:08:38.684 align:middle line:84%
and it was kept by
secret societies.

00:08:38.684 --> 00:08:40.887 align:middle line:84%
Which is kind of
where it is today.

00:08:40.887 --> 00:08:44.257 align:middle line:84%
And yet we all have access to
these things and there sort of,

00:08:44.257 --> 00:08:46.058 align:middle line:84%
that's why I call it
Secrets in Plain Sight.

00:08:46.058 --> 00:08:48.961 align:middle line:84%
They're actually not
secrets, they're just there

00:08:48.961 --> 00:08:50.463 align:middle line:90%
for if you have eyes to see.

00:08:50.463 --> 00:08:51.831 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:08:51.831 --> 00:08:53.799 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about, though,
okay so when you're looking

00:08:53.799 --> 00:08:56.202 align:middle line:84%
at the hermetic philosophies
you're talking

00:08:56.202 --> 00:09:01.641 align:middle line:84%
about the entities that we've
known in mythology and history.

00:09:01.641 --> 00:09:06.045 align:middle line:84%
Such as Toth, and
Hermes, and Mercury.

00:09:06.045 --> 00:09:07.413 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: And Isis and Osiris.

00:09:07.413 --> 00:09:08.714 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And Isis and Osiris.

00:09:08.714 --> 00:09:12.418 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about a very
ancient lineage of knowledge

00:09:12.418 --> 00:09:14.287 align:middle line:84%
that goes beyond
what we understand

00:09:14.287 --> 00:09:15.988 align:middle line:90%
as Earth plane figures.

00:09:15.988 --> 00:09:17.323 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: That's right.

00:09:17.323 --> 00:09:18.591 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Now what is your
feeling on the whole notion

00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:21.560 align:middle line:84%
of secrecy of knowledge
in general?

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:25.698 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel that there
was perhaps a purpose

00:09:25.698 --> 00:09:30.036 align:middle line:84%
for maintaining certain
sacred truths

00:09:30.036 --> 00:09:34.840 align:middle line:84%
by whoever was maintaining them
over centuries, even millennia?

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.611 align:middle line:84%
Do you think there was some
good in retaining that secrecy?

00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:40.813 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: Definitely I think
that there was certainly a case

00:09:40.813 --> 00:09:43.049 align:middle line:84%
for that when you could
be burned at the stake

00:09:43.049 --> 00:09:44.717 align:middle line:90%
like Giordano Bruno was.

00:09:44.717 --> 00:09:45.851 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:09:45.851 --> 00:09:48.921 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: For talking
about hermetic beliefs.

00:09:48.921 --> 00:09:51.924 align:middle line:84%
And so there was certainly a
case where there was hundreds

00:09:51.924 --> 00:09:55.127 align:middle line:84%
of years there where you had
to keep that knowledge secret.

00:09:55.127 --> 00:09:58.497 align:middle line:84%
And -- but I think now we're
living in a different age

00:09:58.497 --> 00:10:01.033 align:middle line:84%
where this knowledge
can be revealed.

00:10:01.033 --> 00:10:03.736 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
I'm interested in...

00:10:03.736 --> 00:10:05.104 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: It does seem like it.

00:10:05.104 --> 00:10:07.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: ...in doing, is
trying to share that knowledge.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:11.344 align:middle line:84%
Wherever I can see it
I want to share it.

00:10:11.344 --> 00:10:14.947 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's the most
interesting thing is these

00:10:14.947 --> 00:10:16.649 align:middle line:90%
patterns and these numbers.

00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:20.853 align:middle line:84%
And that it gives me a lot
of confidence or inspiration,

00:10:20.853 --> 00:10:25.291 align:middle line:84%
that the universe is
harmonic with these numbers.

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:29.228 align:middle line:90%
And there seems to be a design

00:10:29.228 --> 00:10:32.865 align:middle line:84%
to the universe --
intentionality there.

00:10:32.865 --> 00:10:35.334 align:middle line:84%
And it really depends
on where you are

00:10:35.334 --> 00:10:39.972 align:middle line:84%
and how you describe that,
and the why behind that.

00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:42.141 align:middle line:84%
You could say its
God doing that.

00:10:42.141 --> 00:10:46.445 align:middle line:84%
You could say its angels
or demons or just the way

00:10:46.445 --> 00:10:48.881 align:middle line:84%
that the matrix is
that we're in.

00:10:48.881 --> 00:10:51.450 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of different
ways of explaining that.

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:54.220 align:middle line:84%
But my first job is just
to show the patterns.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:55.187 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:10:55.187 --> 00:10:57.723 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: And then
I leave it open.

00:10:57.723 --> 00:10:59.825 align:middle line:90%
I don't give you an answer.

00:10:59.825 --> 00:11:01.694 align:middle line:84%
I leave it open for
you to explore

00:11:01.694 --> 00:11:03.896 align:middle line:90%
and make of it what you will.

00:11:03.896 --> 00:11:06.565 align:middle line:84%
Because it really
is a co-creation,

00:11:06.565 --> 00:11:08.801 align:middle line:84%
it's really a collaborative
process.

00:11:08.801 --> 00:11:09.568 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:11:09.568 --> 00:11:10.636 align:middle line:90%
And I think you're right.

00:11:10.636 --> 00:11:12.671 align:middle line:90%
We have entered a period of time

00:11:12.671 --> 00:11:15.541 align:middle line:84%
where many people's awareness
has expanded to the point

00:11:15.541 --> 00:11:18.644 align:middle line:84%
where this hidden knowledge,
including hermetic knowledge.

00:11:18.644 --> 00:11:20.312 align:middle line:90%
Other ancient traditions

00:11:20.312 --> 00:11:22.615 align:middle line:84%
and tantra are being
released right now, too,

00:11:22.615 --> 00:11:25.718 align:middle line:84%
that have been secreted away
for hundreds if not thousands

00:11:25.718 --> 00:11:28.487 align:middle line:84%
of years, are being made
available to the public.

00:11:28.487 --> 00:11:32.291 align:middle line:84%
I mean not randomly but people
who are seeking knowledge

00:11:32.291 --> 00:11:34.460 align:middle line:84%
in those areas that
have been hidden away.

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:36.529 align:middle line:90%
So we've called that conspiracy,

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:40.299 align:middle line:84%
but the reality is maybe the
time wasn't present until now.

00:11:40.299 --> 00:11:43.202 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: Right and conspiracy
just means breathing together.

00:11:43.202 --> 00:11:44.336 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:11:44.336 --> 00:11:45.905 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: And so that
shouldn't be so unusual.

00:11:45.905 --> 00:11:50.476 align:middle line:84%
You know, people conspire and
plan together all the time.

00:11:50.476 --> 00:11:51.577 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Indeed.

00:11:51.577 --> 00:11:54.046 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about one
sacred relationship,

00:11:54.046 --> 00:11:55.548 align:middle line:84%
just to start off
the conversation.

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:58.250 align:middle line:84%
Because to me it's at
the crux of all of this.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:03.022 align:middle line:84%
And that is the unique
ratios, spatial ratios

00:12:03.022 --> 00:12:06.158 align:middle line:84%
between the Sun,
the Moon, the Earth.

00:12:06.158 --> 00:12:07.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: Yes.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:12.465 align:middle line:84%
I can give you an example of in
sacred geometry or with number.

00:12:12.465 --> 00:12:13.899 align:middle line:90%
Would you like to choose one?

00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:15.234 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I choose numbers.

00:12:15.234 --> 00:12:17.236 align:middle line:84%
Since we're doing a lot of
numbers let's do the numeric.

00:12:17.236 --> 00:12:19.972 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: Okay, so all of
these numbers that I'm going

00:12:19.972 --> 00:12:24.376 align:middle line:84%
to give you are about
between 98% and 100% accurate.

00:12:24.376 --> 00:12:28.080 align:middle line:84%
So if you look it up you'll see,
well, it's only 99% accurate.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.416 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's pretty
close isn't it?

00:12:30.416 --> 00:12:33.953 align:middle line:84%
So if we look at 108, this
number is so important.

00:12:33.953 --> 00:12:39.225 align:middle line:84%
108 Earth diameters fit
within the solar diameter.

00:12:39.225 --> 00:12:44.897 align:middle line:84%
The Earth is about 108 solar
diameters away from the sun.

00:12:44.897 --> 00:12:49.935 align:middle line:84%
The moon is 108 lunar
diameters from the Earth.

00:12:49.935 --> 00:12:52.271 align:middle line:84%
So it's amazing that
this number --

00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:55.574 align:middle line:84%
these phenomena converge
upon that.

00:12:55.574 --> 00:13:00.146 align:middle line:84%
Another thing is that if
you look up at the moon,

00:13:00.146 --> 00:13:03.549 align:middle line:84%
it's the same size as
the sun disk in our sky.

00:13:03.549 --> 00:13:06.519 align:middle line:84%
And we see that beautifully
in a solar eclipse.

00:13:06.519 --> 00:13:08.821 align:middle line:84%
When the moon perfectly
covers the sun disk.

00:13:08.821 --> 00:13:09.889 align:middle line:90%
Now think about that.

00:13:09.889 --> 00:13:10.589 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have to be so...

00:13:10.589 --> 00:13:11.790 align:middle line:90%
>> [Multiple speakers].

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:12.458 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Taking the
space [background talking]

00:13:12.458 --> 00:13:13.692 align:middle line:90%
into consideration.

00:13:13.692 --> 00:13:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: What if the
moon was larger or smaller?

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:15.494 align:middle line:90%
Or closer or farther away?

00:13:15.494 --> 00:13:16.729 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't work that way.

00:13:16.729 --> 00:13:17.563 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:13:17.563 --> 00:13:18.531 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: But it's perfect.

00:13:18.531 --> 00:13:19.131 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:13:19.131 --> 00:13:20.533 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:13:20.533 --> 00:13:22.268 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to take a look
at a clip in your film dealing

00:13:22.268 --> 00:13:24.637 align:middle line:84%
with the 108's a
little later on.

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:27.239 align:middle line:84%
But first you start
in Washington DC.

00:13:27.239 --> 00:13:28.507 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: That's right.

00:13:28.507 --> 00:13:31.744 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Which is, I've
interviewed William Henry

00:13:31.744 --> 00:13:33.712 align:middle line:84%
and we've discussed
some of this.

00:13:33.712 --> 00:13:36.682 align:middle line:84%
But you go into much greater
detail in terms of some

00:13:36.682 --> 00:13:38.984 align:middle line:84%
of the geometry and
the angles that you see

00:13:38.984 --> 00:13:40.319 align:middle line:90%
in the layout of the city.

00:13:40.319 --> 00:13:43.789 align:middle line:84%
But also I thought we would
start out on our first clip

00:13:43.789 --> 00:13:48.260 align:middle line:84%
by noting that Washington, DC,
is one of the centers if not,

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.997 align:middle line:84%
is it the primary center
for the Scottish Freemasons?

00:13:51.997 --> 00:13:52.932 align:middle line:90%
One of the primary...

00:13:52.932 --> 00:13:53.799 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: In the
United States?

00:13:53.799 --> 00:13:55.134 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:13:55.134 --> 00:13:59.271 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: The so-called
Mother Temple is there in DC,

00:13:59.271 --> 00:14:01.974 align:middle line:90%
the 33rd degree temple there.

00:14:01.974 --> 00:14:02.942 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:02.942 --> 00:14:05.644 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So, let's
talk about 33

00:14:05.644 --> 00:14:07.246 align:middle line:84%
after we look at
this video clip.

00:14:07.246 --> 00:14:11.684 align:middle line:84%
So our first video clip is on
the number 33, the Freemasons,

00:14:11.684 --> 00:14:14.920 align:middle line:84%
and the Presidents
of the United States.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:15.754 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: Great.

00:14:15.754 --> 00:14:16.989 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Let's take a look.

00:14:18.224 --> 00:14:21.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: [Film] Scottish
Freemasons are really

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.495 align:middle line:90%
into the number 33.

00:14:23.495 --> 00:14:26.198 align:middle line:84%
There are 33 columns in
the House of the Temple

00:14:26.198 --> 00:14:28.801 align:middle line:90%
that are 33 feet high.

00:14:28.801 --> 00:14:31.804 align:middle line:84%
This is the place where a
hardworking initiate can obtain

00:14:31.804 --> 00:14:35.574 align:middle line:84%
the highest 33rd degree
from the 33 members

00:14:35.574 --> 00:14:38.644 align:middle line:90%
of the Supreme Council.

00:14:38.644 --> 00:14:43.515 align:middle line:84%
33rd Degree Masons are often
found in positions of power.

00:14:43.515 --> 00:14:46.885 align:middle line:84%
Many presidents of the United
States were Freemasons.

00:14:46.885 --> 00:14:50.289 align:middle line:84%
The Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania
has a permanent exhibit

00:14:50.289 --> 00:14:52.891 align:middle line:84%
featuring the portrait
and signature of each

00:14:52.891 --> 00:14:57.129 align:middle line:84%
of these presidents with a
record of their masonic careers.

00:14:57.129 --> 00:15:01.133 align:middle line:84%
It is difficult to
verify Masonic membership

00:15:01.133 --> 00:15:04.036 align:middle line:84%
because some members do not
make their involvement a matter

00:15:04.036 --> 00:15:05.471 align:middle line:90%
of public record.

00:15:05.471 --> 00:15:09.742 align:middle line:84%
However, each lodge
keeps its own records.

00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:13.145 align:middle line:84%
I find it interesting that
George Washington, Harding,

00:15:13.145 --> 00:15:16.915 align:middle line:84%
Eisenhower, Carter, and
the younger Bush all chose

00:15:16.915 --> 00:15:20.152 align:middle line:84%
to be sworn into the office
of the President with the hand

00:15:20.152 --> 00:15:24.723 align:middle line:84%
on this Masonic Bible
dating from 1770.

00:15:24.723 --> 00:15:27.993 align:middle line:84%
One has to be male and
believe in a supreme being

00:15:27.993 --> 00:15:31.263 align:middle line:84%
to seek membership as
a Scottish Freemason.

00:15:31.263 --> 00:15:34.333 align:middle line:84%
They insist their
fraternity is not a religion,

00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:37.403 align:middle line:84%
although atheists are
ineligible for membership.

00:15:37.403 --> 00:15:41.073 align:middle line:84%
Freemasonry is not
a secret society

00:15:41.073 --> 00:15:43.475 align:middle line:84%
but members are strongly
admonished under pain

00:15:43.475 --> 00:15:47.212 align:middle line:84%
of death not to reveal
core secrets.

00:15:47.212 --> 00:15:48.981 align:middle line:84%
Much of what happens
inside the House

00:15:48.981 --> 00:15:51.183 align:middle line:84%
of the Temple has
pieced together

00:15:51.183 --> 00:15:54.320 align:middle line:84%
by outside researchers
in recent years.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.621 align:middle line:84%
And this has been
brought forward

00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:58.757 align:middle line:84%
in Dan Brown's book,
The Lost Symbol .

00:16:00.359 --> 00:16:02.361 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It is
interesting when you think.

00:16:02.361 --> 00:16:04.997 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I look at that one
of the first things that pops

00:16:04.997 --> 00:16:07.733 align:middle line:84%
into my mind is just
simply Bush, Junior.

00:16:07.733 --> 00:16:12.137 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not trying to be
facetious here but not every one

00:16:12.137 --> 00:16:15.374 align:middle line:84%
of those people that became
president actually took

00:16:15.374 --> 00:16:18.444 align:middle line:84%
on the body of that esoteric
knowledge is my guess.

00:16:18.444 --> 00:16:19.144 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: That's right.

00:16:19.144 --> 00:16:20.546 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:20.546 --> 00:16:23.916 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: They were gifted the
title but it has to have been

00:16:23.916 --> 00:16:25.117 align:middle line:90%
through what, bloodlines.

00:16:25.117 --> 00:16:26.685 align:middle line:84%
I mean the thought
is that there has

00:16:26.685 --> 00:16:30.255 align:middle line:84%
to be a bloodline affiliation,
something, that puts one

00:16:30.255 --> 00:16:34.893 align:middle line:84%
in a position to be able
to receive a 33rd Degree.

00:16:34.893 --> 00:16:37.696 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: Now I know that the
33rd Degree is only bestowed

00:16:37.696 --> 00:16:40.766 align:middle line:84%
on people that are selected
by the Supreme Council.

00:16:40.766 --> 00:16:42.134 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:16:42.134 --> 00:16:43.836 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: And I know, I've
met some 32nd Degree Freemasons

00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:45.904 align:middle line:84%
who'd like to be 33rd
Degree Freemasons

00:16:45.904 --> 00:16:48.974 align:middle line:84%
but there's no way
of getting that.

00:16:48.974 --> 00:16:52.111 align:middle line:84%
Because if you ask for it,
then you'll never get it.

00:16:52.111 --> 00:16:54.146 align:middle line:84%
So it's a mystery,
how does this occur?

00:16:54.146 --> 00:16:56.815 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you're right,
maybe it's a bloodline issue.

00:16:56.815 --> 00:16:58.050 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's connections.

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:00.119 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's your esoteric wisdom

00:17:00.119 --> 00:17:01.820 align:middle line:84%
and knowledge that
you've absorbed.

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:02.588 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:17:02.588 --> 00:17:03.589 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: It's possible.

00:17:03.589 --> 00:17:04.857 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: In some
cases, certainly.

00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:08.761 align:middle line:84%
And yet, this is something
that is really kind

00:17:08.761 --> 00:17:11.429 align:middle line:84%
of at the backbone of all
the conspiracy theories.

00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:14.666 align:middle line:84%
Is the Freemasons, the 33rd
Degree, I mean you can go

00:17:14.666 --> 00:17:17.870 align:middle line:84%
to thousands of sites talking
about 33rd Degree Masons

00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:19.871 align:middle line:84%
and all the horrors and
atrocities on the planet

00:17:19.871 --> 00:17:22.674 align:middle line:84%
but the reality is there
is sacredness in this.

00:17:22.674 --> 00:17:25.878 align:middle line:84%
And the truest sense of
Freemasonry has a lot

00:17:25.878 --> 00:17:28.981 align:middle line:84%
of beautiful sacred
energy around it.

00:17:28.981 --> 00:17:30.582 align:middle line:90%
I mean it is sacred knowledge.

00:17:30.582 --> 00:17:32.184 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about 33.

00:17:32.184 --> 00:17:35.087 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: So yeah, 33,
and all numbers are neutral.

00:17:35.087 --> 00:17:36.789 align:middle line:90%
They're not owned by anyone.

00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:39.525 align:middle line:84%
And it's part of the
architecture of the universe.

00:17:39.525 --> 00:17:45.364 align:middle line:84%
33 to me it means the full
range, the whole nine yards.

00:17:45.364 --> 00:17:47.766 align:middle line:84%
And, for example,
there are 33 bones

00:17:47.766 --> 00:17:51.503 align:middle line:84%
in the human spinal column,
if you count the fused bones

00:17:51.503 --> 00:17:54.006 align:middle line:90%
in the lower spine individually.

00:17:54.006 --> 00:17:59.144 align:middle line:84%
Another one is that the sun is
333 thousand times more massive

00:17:59.144 --> 00:18:01.046 align:middle line:90%
than the Earth.

00:18:01.046 --> 00:18:04.516 align:middle line:84%
Another great one is you
have to exceed Mach 33,

00:18:04.516 --> 00:18:08.787 align:middle line:84%
that's 33 times the speed of
sound to attain escape velocity

00:18:08.787 --> 00:18:12.224 align:middle line:84%
to leave the planet
Earth and go into space.

00:18:12.224 --> 00:18:16.128 align:middle line:84%
Another one is if you -- you
go 33 feet below the surface

00:18:16.128 --> 00:18:20.232 align:middle line:84%
of the ocean you increase the
pressure by one atmosphere.

00:18:20.232 --> 00:18:23.502 align:middle line:84%
That means that the weight of
our atmosphere is equivalent

00:18:23.502 --> 00:18:26.839 align:middle line:84%
to a column of water
33 feet high.

00:18:26.839 --> 00:18:32.744 align:middle line:84%
And we have all these
examples of in religion, also.

00:18:32.744 --> 00:18:37.249 align:middle line:84%
Jesus lived for 33 years, was
said to perform 33 miracles.

00:18:37.249 --> 00:18:41.720 align:middle line:84%
King David, father of Solomon,
enreigned for 33 years.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:45.591 align:middle line:90%
The U.N. emblem has 33 sectors.

00:18:45.591 --> 00:18:48.861 align:middle line:84%
The city of London is
surrounded by 32 boroughs,

00:18:48.861 --> 00:18:52.598 align:middle line:90%
making it the 33rd jurisdiction.

00:18:52.598 --> 00:18:55.467 align:middle line:84%
So it's very interesting
where this comes up.

00:18:55.467 --> 00:18:58.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It is and when you
were talking I was just seeing

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:00.806 align:middle line:84%
in my head a really
classic numerology.

00:19:00.806 --> 00:19:05.177 align:middle line:84%
Or just looking at maybe
simple mathematics, 3 times 3.

00:19:05.177 --> 00:19:06.311 align:middle line:90%
Right? Which is 9.

00:19:06.311 --> 00:19:08.447 align:middle line:84%
Which is completions,
which is transformation,

00:19:08.447 --> 00:19:09.681 align:middle line:90%
which is the all.

00:19:09.681 --> 00:19:12.784 align:middle line:84%
Right? Which is classically
thought of as the all.

00:19:12.784 --> 00:19:15.354 align:middle line:84%
And so just looking from
a very simplistic point

00:19:15.354 --> 00:19:18.857 align:middle line:84%
of view I can begin seeing
a few patterns there myself.

00:19:18.857 --> 00:19:20.425 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: It's
one-third after all.

00:19:20.425 --> 00:19:21.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.729 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: And actually
I see this significance

00:19:23.729 --> 00:19:26.698 align:middle line:84%
to any repeating
sequence of single digits.

00:19:26.698 --> 00:19:27.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Let's talk

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.902 align:middle line:84%
about something I hadn't
noticed before, honestly.

00:19:29.902 --> 00:19:32.738 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do
with Buzz Aldrin.

00:19:32.738 --> 00:19:33.739 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: Yes.

00:19:33.739 --> 00:19:35.574 align:middle line:84%
And how, are you
referring to the cover

00:19:35.574 --> 00:19:38.377 align:middle line:84%
of Richard Hoagland's book where
he's on the moon or the letter?

00:19:38.377 --> 00:19:39.711 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And he's
holding the flag.

00:19:39.711 --> 00:19:43.415 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: He's holding a
flag, actually, I'm not sure,

00:19:43.415 --> 00:19:44.783 align:middle line:84%
I think that might have
been photo-shopped.

00:19:44.783 --> 00:19:45.417 align:middle line:90%
But...

00:19:45.417 --> 00:19:46.785 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Was it?

00:19:46.785 --> 00:19:48.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: What really happened
was he did take the Masonic

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.789 align:middle line:84%
flag, the 33rd Degree
flag to the moon.

00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:52.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh he did?

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:54.126 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: At least that's
the story, if you believe

00:19:54.126 --> 00:19:55.227 align:middle line:90%
that we went to the moon.

00:19:55.227 --> 00:19:56.428 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Right, that's
a whole other story.

00:19:56.428 --> 00:19:57.729 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: That's
a different story.

00:19:57.729 --> 00:19:59.197 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Either way, to
bring the 33rd [laughter]...

00:19:59.197 --> 00:20:02.367 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: Yeah, he brought
that and I think a flag

00:20:02.367 --> 00:20:05.337 align:middle line:84%
of the Vatican there and
returned those to Earth.

00:20:05.337 --> 00:20:08.407 align:middle line:84%
And those are in
museums, I believe, now.

00:20:08.407 --> 00:20:09.474 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Highly symbolic.

00:20:09.474 --> 00:20:11.610 align:middle line:90%
How does Middle C fit into this?

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:13.579 align:middle line:84%
You wrote that, or in your
documentary you talked

00:20:13.579 --> 00:20:16.648 align:middle line:84%
about the fact that we
resonate at 33 octaves

00:20:16.648 --> 00:20:18.183 align:middle line:90%
above the base frequencies.

00:20:18.183 --> 00:20:20.018 align:middle line:84%
Are you talking Schumann
frequencies?

00:20:20.018 --> 00:20:22.254 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: The Schumann
frequency is like the resonance

00:20:22.254 --> 00:20:25.857 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth, that's from
lightning discharges.

00:20:25.857 --> 00:20:30.862 align:middle line:84%
And so I think its 33
harmonics or 32 overtones,

00:20:30.862 --> 00:20:32.764 align:middle line:90%
and I may have those backwards.

00:20:32.764 --> 00:20:37.536 align:middle line:84%
But Middle C is 33 harmonics
above the Schumann Resonance.

00:20:37.536 --> 00:20:39.137 align:middle line:90%
So it's like the full range.

00:20:39.137 --> 00:20:43.609 align:middle line:84%
The center of our hearing
is basically that full range

00:20:43.609 --> 00:20:47.346 align:middle line:84%
or that 33 octaves
above the Earth.

00:20:47.346 --> 00:20:50.882 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay, now another
very sacred symbol is the Tree

00:20:50.882 --> 00:20:53.585 align:middle line:84%
of Life and the Judaic
culture in particular.

00:20:53.585 --> 00:20:57.689 align:middle line:84%
And in the documentary you
talk about the fact that D.C.

00:20:57.689 --> 00:21:00.592 align:middle line:84%
and London have these,
essentially the same Tree

00:21:00.592 --> 00:21:02.794 align:middle line:90%
of Life templates over it.

00:21:02.794 --> 00:21:06.598 align:middle line:84%
And you also mention
that D.C. is considered

00:21:06.598 --> 00:21:10.569 align:middle line:84%
to be the new Jerusalem when
you look at it in context

00:21:10.569 --> 00:21:14.673 align:middle line:84%
of its layout, its geometric
layout and numerology.

00:21:14.673 --> 00:21:17.576 align:middle line:84%
I mean, not numerology,
but numeric values.

00:21:17.576 --> 00:21:20.912 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look at clip
number two which has to do

00:21:20.912 --> 00:21:27.386 align:middle line:84%
with Washington, D.C. and this
fact we've just spoken of.

00:21:27.386 --> 00:21:29.087 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: Did you
ever wonder why the U.S.

00:21:29.087 --> 00:21:32.557 align:middle line:84%
and Israel have such
a strong bond?

00:21:32.557 --> 00:21:35.560 align:middle line:90%
D.C. is the New Jerusalem.

00:21:36.928 --> 00:21:41.867 align:middle line:84%
Here's the 1992 Israeli Supreme
Court building in Jerusalem.

00:21:41.867 --> 00:21:42.968 align:middle line:90%
Does this pyramid

00:21:42.968 --> 00:21:45.804 align:middle line:84%
on top containing a
window look familiar?

00:21:45.804 --> 00:21:48.040 align:middle line:84%
It appears to be the
Eye of Providence,

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.876 align:middle line:84%
the same symbol found
in the streets of D.C.

00:21:50.876 --> 00:21:53.078 align:middle line:90%
and on the dollar bill.

00:21:54.279 --> 00:21:56.481 align:middle line:84%
Many researchers have
seen the Tree of Life

00:21:56.481 --> 00:21:58.617 align:middle line:90%
from Jewish Mysticism encoded

00:21:58.617 --> 00:22:01.687 align:middle line:84%
in D.C.'s traffic
circles and monuments.

00:22:01.687 --> 00:22:04.823 align:middle line:84%
However, DCSymbols.com
is the only place

00:22:04.823 --> 00:22:06.258 align:middle line:90%
that shows how the streets

00:22:06.258 --> 00:22:09.461 align:middle line:84%
and traffic circles match
this early depiction

00:22:09.461 --> 00:22:14.299 align:middle line:84%
of the Porta Lucis
Tree of Life from 1516.

00:22:14.299 --> 00:22:18.737 align:middle line:84%
The Portal of Light of version
if shaped like an actual tree.

00:22:18.737 --> 00:22:22.507 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's where the
Tree of Life got its name.

00:22:22.507 --> 00:22:25.777 align:middle line:84%
Scott Circle's gently curving
streets mimic the shape

00:22:25.777 --> 00:22:29.681 align:middle line:84%
of the Pythagorean Y. In
The Secret Architecture

00:22:29.681 --> 00:22:34.352 align:middle line:84%
of Our Nation's Capital
author David Ovason says,

00:22:34.352 --> 00:22:37.789 align:middle line:84%
"The Pythagorean Y is a
vestigial drawing of a path

00:22:37.789 --> 00:22:40.726 align:middle line:84%
through life in which one
is perpetually presented

00:22:40.726 --> 00:22:43.495 align:middle line:84%
with the choice of
symbolic directions.

00:22:43.495 --> 00:22:46.932 align:middle line:90%
Should one do good or bad?"

00:22:46.932 --> 00:22:49.968 align:middle line:84%
Scott Circle is in the position
in the Tree of Life known

00:22:49.968 --> 00:22:52.938 align:middle line:90%
as Doth, the hidden Sephirot.

00:22:52.938 --> 00:22:56.074 align:middle line:84%
According to the Kabbalah,
the reason Doth is depicted

00:22:56.074 --> 00:23:00.946 align:middle line:84%
as hidden is because humans who
remain selfish cannot see it.

00:23:00.946 --> 00:23:03.715 align:middle line:84%
Only those who orient
themselves in the service

00:23:03.715 --> 00:23:07.052 align:middle line:84%
of others are able to
see the light of Doth

00:23:07.052 --> 00:23:11.623 align:middle line:84%
in which all 10 Sephirot
are united as one.

00:23:11.623 --> 00:23:15.026 align:middle line:84%
I think Scott Circle exemplifies
the secret architecture

00:23:15.026 --> 00:23:19.131 align:middle line:84%
of D.C. It's plain to see
once you have the knowledge

00:23:19.131 --> 00:23:23.101 align:middle line:84%
but remains hidden to
the general public.

00:23:23.101 --> 00:23:26.204 align:middle line:84%
Most people who know the Tree
of Life are more familiar

00:23:26.204 --> 00:23:30.542 align:middle line:84%
with the Athanasius
Kircher version of 1652

00:23:30.542 --> 00:23:33.411 align:middle line:84%
which is arranged
in three columns.

00:23:33.411 --> 00:23:36.848 align:middle line:84%
The Kircher version is seen
here in John Evelyn's plan

00:23:36.848 --> 00:23:41.720 align:middle line:84%
to rebuild London after
the Great Fire of 1666.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.623 align:middle line:84%
Both he and Christopher
Wren submitted plans based

00:23:44.623 --> 00:23:46.224 align:middle line:90%
on the Tree of Life.

00:23:46.224 --> 00:23:49.694 align:middle line:84%
Although, Wren's wasn't as
in your face as Evelyn's.

00:23:49.694 --> 00:23:51.763 align:middle line:84%
Neither were actually
carried out.

00:23:51.763 --> 00:23:53.131 align:middle line:90%
But it shows you this kind

00:23:53.131 --> 00:23:57.369 align:middle line:84%
of esoteric symbolism wasn't
anything new when D.C. was laid

00:23:57.369 --> 00:24:01.473 align:middle line:84%
out a century after the
Great Fire of London.

00:24:01.473 --> 00:24:05.043 align:middle line:84%
As you've seen, there is a
deep connection to Judaism both

00:24:05.043 --> 00:24:07.879 align:middle line:84%
in the Tree of Life
and in the metrology

00:24:07.879 --> 00:24:12.384 align:middle line:84%
of Richard Heath's larger cube
that links Washington, D.C.,

00:24:12.384 --> 00:24:16.588 align:middle line:84%
with the mythical, new
Jerusalem in the Bible.

00:24:16.588 --> 00:24:17.923 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And can you speak

00:24:17.923 --> 00:24:21.393 align:middle line:84%
to the mythical New
Jerusalem, how is it portrayed?

00:24:21.393 --> 00:24:23.195 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: If I recall the
quote, it's something like,

00:24:23.195 --> 00:24:26.164 align:middle line:84%
"And he measured the
city with the reed."

00:24:26.164 --> 00:24:31.703 align:middle line:84%
And it was a cube, and it was
12,000 furlongs on each edge.

00:24:31.703 --> 00:24:34.039 align:middle line:90%
And if you multiply that,

00:24:34.039 --> 00:24:40.212 align:middle line:84%
if you cube 12,000 you get 1728
billion furlongs, or something.

00:24:40.212 --> 00:24:44.382 align:middle line:84%
So the number 1728 is used,
and that's very significant

00:24:44.382 --> 00:24:49.421 align:middle line:84%
in the doubling sequence which
we will probably talk about.

00:24:49.421 --> 00:24:50.655 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:24:50.655 --> 00:24:52.090 align:middle line:90%
Okay, now, I mean we could,

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:53.992 align:middle line:84%
I could ask you a lot more
questions about that one

00:24:53.992 --> 00:24:56.161 align:middle line:84%
but again, people are going
to have to take a look

00:24:56.161 --> 00:24:59.197 align:middle line:84%
at this video themselves
because the information prior

00:24:59.197 --> 00:25:01.900 align:middle line:84%
and after each of these
segments obviously gives a lot

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:03.101 align:middle line:90%
deeper explanation.

00:25:03.101 --> 00:25:05.537 align:middle line:84%
But I want to get on to
some of the other numbers.

00:25:05.537 --> 00:25:09.507 align:middle line:84%
Common one, 13, this goes
back into Templar tradition

00:25:09.507 --> 00:25:12.544 align:middle line:84%
and Friday the 13th, the day
of the slaughter, and so forth.

00:25:12.544 --> 00:25:13.345 align:middle line:90%
And bad luck.

00:25:13.345 --> 00:25:16.214 align:middle line:90%
And what is 13 in your mind?

00:25:16.214 --> 00:25:18.183 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: A lucky
number I guess.

00:25:18.183 --> 00:25:22.053 align:middle line:84%
I think of the Great Seal of
the United States with the Eagle

00:25:22.053 --> 00:25:25.423 align:middle line:84%
on the back of the dollar
bill that shows the 13 arrows

00:25:25.423 --> 00:25:29.961 align:middle line:84%
and the 13 leaves on the branch
-- olive branch and 13 olives

00:25:29.961 --> 00:25:32.464 align:middle line:84%
and there's tons
of 13's on there.

00:25:32.464 --> 00:25:33.431 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:25:33.431 --> 00:25:34.132 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: It's
really interesting.

00:25:34.132 --> 00:25:35.367 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:39.871 align:middle line:84%
It seems like the U.S.'s
symbols are laden with 13s.

00:25:39.871 --> 00:25:43.308 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: And you wonder were
13 colonies just an accident

00:25:43.308 --> 00:25:44.876 align:middle line:90%
or a design?

00:25:44.876 --> 00:25:47.245 align:middle line:90%
And who is the designer?

00:25:47.245 --> 00:25:50.916 align:middle line:84%
Was that a conspiracy or
did it just happen that way?

00:25:50.916 --> 00:25:53.318 align:middle line:84%
I don't answer that
it's just open.

00:25:53.318 --> 00:25:55.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Let's
talk about Gematria.

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:57.355 align:middle line:84%
Because here we can say we're
going to start looking at some

00:25:57.355 --> 00:26:00.025 align:middle line:84%
of the figures throughout
history that show up again

00:26:00.025 --> 00:26:02.127 align:middle line:84%
and again, under
perhaps different names

00:26:02.127 --> 00:26:03.428 align:middle line:90%
than their origins.

00:26:03.428 --> 00:26:05.997 align:middle line:84%
So, but before we do that
let's talk about the subject

00:26:05.997 --> 00:26:08.900 align:middle line:84%
of Gematria where
numbers and then words

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.002 align:middle line:90%
and letters start combining.

00:26:11.002 --> 00:26:15.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: So, in the Kabbalah
you can convert a letter

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:18.610 align:middle line:84%
to a number and then you
can calculate the number

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:19.744 align:middle line:90%
of the word.

00:26:19.744 --> 00:26:22.213 align:middle line:84%
And then you see
these correspondences.

00:26:22.213 --> 00:26:23.982 align:middle line:90%
I think John Michell showed

00:26:23.982 --> 00:26:28.820 align:middle line:84%
that the word Jerusalem
is 864 in Gematria.

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:30.956 align:middle line:90%
And 864 is such a key number.

00:26:30.956 --> 00:26:37.629 align:middle line:84%
I think of 864,000-mile
diameter of the sun.

00:26:37.629 --> 00:26:40.799 align:middle line:90%
And that's only 99.8% accurate.

00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:41.566 align:middle line:90%
So...

00:26:41.566 --> 00:26:42.801 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:26:42.801 --> 00:26:48.073 align:middle line:84%
You also speak about
Columbia, about Isis, Osiris.

00:26:48.073 --> 00:26:50.942 align:middle line:84%
These characters from
our deep history,

00:26:50.942 --> 00:26:55.347 align:middle line:84%
our deep planetary history,
keep showing up again and again.

00:26:55.347 --> 00:26:57.649 align:middle line:90%
Globally they're showing up.

00:26:57.649 --> 00:27:00.785 align:middle line:84%
Through numbers, through
numerical sequences,

00:27:00.785 --> 00:27:02.387 align:middle line:90%
through depictions.

00:27:02.387 --> 00:27:04.422 align:middle line:90%
Through artwork and so forth.

00:27:04.422 --> 00:27:08.793 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about how
Isis and Osiris factor

00:27:08.793 --> 00:27:11.363 align:middle line:84%
into this before we
get to the obelisks.

00:27:11.363 --> 00:27:17.936 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: Okay, in my view
Isis, her number is five.

00:27:17.936 --> 00:27:21.539 align:middle line:84%
Also there's a resonance with
seven, but five is the number

00:27:21.539 --> 00:27:25.176 align:middle line:84%
of life, it's the
number of the Pentagon.

00:27:25.176 --> 00:27:30.015 align:middle line:84%
The Golden Ratio five
is encoded within that.

00:27:30.015 --> 00:27:31.516 align:middle line:90%
Osiris is six.

00:27:31.516 --> 00:27:33.418 align:middle line:90%
Six if the number of structure.

00:27:33.418 --> 00:27:36.921 align:middle line:84%
And in my work I've found this
relationship is so important

00:27:36.921 --> 00:27:40.191 align:middle line:84%
between the living things and
the structure of the universe.

00:27:40.191 --> 00:27:44.129 align:middle line:84%
So the ratio six to five keeps
coming up in my research.

00:27:44.129 --> 00:27:48.933 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole way to get
from six over five to --

00:27:50.368 --> 00:27:53.304 align:middle line:84%
it has all these resonances
with the cosmos I should say.

00:27:53.304 --> 00:27:55.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Isn't it
embedded with masculine

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.409 align:middle line:84%
and feminine frequencies,
essentially?

00:27:57.409 --> 00:27:58.777 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: That's right.

00:27:58.777 --> 00:28:03.181 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Essentially we have Isis
and Osiris in us, all of us.

00:28:03.181 --> 00:28:05.483 align:middle line:84%
And so the key is
balancing those or forming

00:28:05.483 --> 00:28:09.988 align:middle line:84%
that sacred marriage between
those two forces in you.

00:28:09.988 --> 00:28:14.192 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And let's talk
about, as portrayed historically

00:28:14.192 --> 00:28:17.796 align:middle line:84%
or mythologically, just give us
a thumbnail sketch of the story

00:28:17.796 --> 00:28:20.765 align:middle line:84%
of Isis and Osiris so we can
then begin understanding the

00:28:20.765 --> 00:28:23.334 align:middle line:84%
basis for some of
these other structures.

00:28:23.334 --> 00:28:27.072 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: Okay, as
the story goes Isis

00:28:27.072 --> 00:28:28.306 align:middle line:90%
and Osiris were married.

00:28:28.306 --> 00:28:31.142 align:middle line:84%
Osiris is the king of Egypt,
you know, the Pharaoh.

00:28:31.142 --> 00:28:36.448 align:middle line:84%
And his brother, their brother
Set got jealous and decided

00:28:36.448 --> 00:28:40.852 align:middle line:84%
to kill Osiris, cut him into
14 pieces, throw his penis

00:28:40.852 --> 00:28:44.389 align:middle line:84%
in the Nile, put him in a coffin
and send him down the river.

00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:46.124 align:middle line:90%
Isis went searching for his body

00:28:46.124 --> 00:28:50.829 align:middle line:84%
because being a goddess she
could magically revive him.

00:28:50.829 --> 00:28:52.997 align:middle line:90%
So, she did find him.

00:28:52.997 --> 00:28:55.800 align:middle line:90%
Eventually she reanimated him.

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:59.938 align:middle line:84%
She had to use a golden phallus
because his penis was thrown

00:28:59.938 --> 00:29:01.706 align:middle line:84%
in the Nile, it had
gone missing.

00:29:01.706 --> 00:29:06.244 align:middle line:84%
And they conceived their child
Horus, the God of the sun.

00:29:06.244 --> 00:29:10.115 align:middle line:84%
And so there's -- this case has
been made by other researchers,

00:29:10.115 --> 00:29:13.618 align:middle line:84%
that Isis and Horus are
really the prototype

00:29:13.618 --> 00:29:15.386 align:middle line:90%
for Mary and Jesus.

00:29:15.386 --> 00:29:16.855 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yes, I was
going to bring that up.

00:29:16.855 --> 00:29:17.989 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: Yeah.

00:29:17.989 --> 00:29:21.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Historically,
I mean, the same story,

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:27.398 align:middle line:84%
once you get passed the chopping
up and then the reanimating...

00:29:27.398 --> 00:29:28.333 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: Re-membering.

00:29:28.333 --> 00:29:30.135 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Re-membering
of Osiris,

00:29:30.135 --> 00:29:33.271 align:middle line:84%
then the story starts
taking on the flavor

00:29:33.271 --> 00:29:35.540 align:middle line:84%
that we're all familiar with
in the world of Christianity.

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:37.075 align:middle line:90%
For example, same thing happened

00:29:37.075 --> 00:29:39.210 align:middle line:84%
in the Sumerian
story, as well.

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:44.849 align:middle line:84%
So this story of Mary, the
story of Jesus comes --

00:29:44.849 --> 00:29:46.951 align:middle line:84%
keeps coming through
and passed down right

00:29:46.951 --> 00:29:50.021 align:middle line:84%
through the Pagan ages in
terms of the time frames

00:29:50.021 --> 00:29:53.258 align:middle line:84%
in which births happened
and all of that.

00:29:53.258 --> 00:29:57.395 align:middle line:84%
So we'll say that for the sake
of most of the world religions

00:29:57.395 --> 00:30:00.131 align:middle line:90%
and that particular story Isis

00:30:00.131 --> 00:30:06.271 align:middle line:84%
and Horus are the
first pair in that way.

00:30:06.271 --> 00:30:07.105 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: The mother
and child.

00:30:07.105 --> 00:30:08.339 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: The mother and child.

00:30:08.339 --> 00:30:09.474 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: And there is
this sculpture outside of --

00:30:09.474 --> 00:30:11.876 align:middle line:84%
in D.C. in the Federal
Triangle, I think it's

00:30:11.876 --> 00:30:14.846 align:middle line:90%
of Virgo, the goddess Virgo.

00:30:14.846 --> 00:30:16.381 align:middle line:90%
And she has a child with her.

00:30:16.381 --> 00:30:17.482 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:30:17.482 --> 00:30:18.183 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: So in a
way it's like an Isis

00:30:18.183 --> 00:30:19.517 align:middle line:90%
and Horus right there.

00:30:19.517 --> 00:30:23.488 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And it's often
also an immaculate conception.

00:30:23.488 --> 00:30:24.122 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:30:24.122 --> 00:30:25.223 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: Yeah.

00:30:25.223 --> 00:30:26.624 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: The same
story as passed down.

00:30:26.624 --> 00:30:28.059 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: It really should be
called an unusual conception.

00:30:28.059 --> 00:30:29.694 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yes, an
unusual conception.

00:30:29.694 --> 00:30:31.696 align:middle line:90%
It's certainly not impossible.

00:30:31.696 --> 00:30:36.634 align:middle line:84%
And so as we're talking about
that, we go to the obelisks,

00:30:36.634 --> 00:30:38.770 align:middle line:84%
because the obelisks,
you're saying

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:43.174 align:middle line:84%
that obelisks represent
the phallus of Osiris.

00:30:43.174 --> 00:30:45.176 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: Let's take
the Washington Monument,

00:30:45.176 --> 00:30:46.211 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:30:46.211 --> 00:30:47.345 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:30:47.345 --> 00:30:48.713 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: It's not a
single piece of stone

00:30:48.713 --> 00:30:50.949 align:middle line:84%
but it's a monumental
work of masonry.

00:30:50.949 --> 00:30:53.017 align:middle line:90%
Separate blocks put together.

00:30:53.017 --> 00:30:54.719 align:middle line:90%
It's the phallus of Osiris

00:30:54.719 --> 00:30:57.522 align:middle line:84%
and surrounding it you have
the Vessica Pisces paths

00:30:57.522 --> 00:31:00.725 align:middle line:84%
in the landscaping which
represents the feminine.

00:31:00.725 --> 00:31:02.026 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:31:02.026 --> 00:31:04.562 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: And so you have
this act of coitus there,

00:31:04.562 --> 00:31:07.465 align:middle line:84%
or the sacred marriage
essentially happening.

00:31:07.465 --> 00:31:11.069 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that in the
metrology of the monument

00:31:11.069 --> 00:31:18.209 align:middle line:84%
because it's 555 feet 5
1/2 inches, approximately.

00:31:18.209 --> 00:31:20.111 align:middle line:84%
I think it's actually
three-eighths

00:31:20.111 --> 00:31:22.313 align:middle line:84%
of an inch less than
that in reality.

00:31:22.313 --> 00:31:25.016 align:middle line:84%
Because it probably settled
a little bit, you know?

00:31:25.016 --> 00:31:31.322 align:middle line:84%
But that just so happens
to equal 6,666 inches.

00:31:31.322 --> 00:31:36.160 align:middle line:84%
So we have the sixes and
the fives coming together

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.662 align:middle line:90%
in that measurement.

00:31:37.662 --> 00:31:40.098 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Though the sixes in
multiples have been demonized.

00:31:40.098 --> 00:31:43.301 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: 666 the number
of the beast and all that.

00:31:43.301 --> 00:31:44.135 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:31:44.135 --> 00:31:45.403 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: Yeah, that's right.

00:31:45.403 --> 00:31:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the church
would demonize something

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:54.545 align:middle line:84%
that was there before
to divert attention

00:31:54.545 --> 00:31:58.249 align:middle line:90%
to their liturgy and so on.

00:31:58.249 --> 00:31:59.584 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:31:59.584 --> 00:32:03.321 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: But I think that
if you read Revelations it's

00:32:03.321 --> 00:32:04.656 align:middle line:90%
actually the number a man.

00:32:04.656 --> 00:32:07.425 align:middle line:90%
666 is the number of a man.

00:32:07.425 --> 00:32:10.461 align:middle line:90%
And that man, who is that man?

00:32:10.461 --> 00:32:11.663 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps it's Osiris.

00:32:11.663 --> 00:32:16.034 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it's the masculine
element in everyone.

00:32:16.034 --> 00:32:17.468 align:middle line:90%
Or you can just say it's Satan.

00:32:17.468 --> 00:32:19.170 align:middle line:90%
That's also possible.

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:24.942 align:middle line:84%
But I tend to favor the more
-- yeah, more resonant version,

00:32:24.942 --> 00:32:28.212 align:middle line:84%
which connects with other things
and we don't just demonize it

00:32:28.212 --> 00:32:30.782 align:middle line:84%
and forget about
it, say it's bad.

00:32:30.782 --> 00:32:32.016 align:middle line:90%
It's just a number after all.

00:32:32.016 --> 00:32:34.085 align:middle line:84%
Right? Numbers aren't
bad, they're neutral.

00:32:34.085 --> 00:32:36.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:38.289 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at some of
the other forms of Isis

00:32:38.289 --> 00:32:41.659 align:middle line:84%
because this is a very important
figure throughout our modern

00:32:41.659 --> 00:32:42.627 align:middle line:90%
history, as well.

00:32:42.627 --> 00:32:43.528 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: She's
like the goddess

00:32:43.528 --> 00:32:45.596 align:middle line:90%
of 10,000 Eves, essentially.

00:32:45.596 --> 00:32:48.066 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yes, and one
within this Columbia.

00:32:48.066 --> 00:32:48.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: Yes.

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:49.901 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: This is a big one.

00:32:49.901 --> 00:32:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And the figure of
Columbia comes up,

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:53.338 align:middle line:84%
certainly through
American history,

00:32:53.338 --> 00:32:55.540 align:middle line:90%
but in other countries, as well.

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:58.543 align:middle line:84%
As in, what is Columbia
representing in a lot

00:32:58.543 --> 00:33:00.578 align:middle line:84%
of the artwork and
murals and such?

00:33:00.578 --> 00:33:02.413 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: She's a place
holder for Isis, really.

00:33:02.413 --> 00:33:07.051 align:middle line:84%
She's, the goddess Freedom
also is like Columbia and she's

00:33:07.051 --> 00:33:11.022 align:middle line:84%
on top of the U.S. Capital
building, as well, you know.

00:33:11.022 --> 00:33:13.524 align:middle line:84%
She's holding this
feminine energy,

00:33:13.524 --> 00:33:16.461 align:middle line:90%
this powerful feminine energy.

00:33:16.461 --> 00:33:17.595 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:17.595 --> 00:33:18.763 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: The symbolism
goes deep and let's talk

00:33:18.763 --> 00:33:20.998 align:middle line:84%
about Jaclyn Onassis
because you say

00:33:20.998 --> 00:33:23.534 align:middle line:84%
that it may be she
was representing

00:33:23.534 --> 00:33:26.104 align:middle line:84%
or an aspect of Isis
in her time.

00:33:26.104 --> 00:33:27.338 align:middle line:90%
Why do you say that?

00:33:27.338 --> 00:33:30.375 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: I say that
because I showed in Secrets

00:33:30.375 --> 00:33:33.111 align:middle line:84%
in Plain Sight Volume 1, and I
show this alignment that goes

00:33:33.111 --> 00:33:36.714 align:middle line:84%
through the Jaclyn
Kennedy Onassis Reservoir

00:33:36.714 --> 00:33:38.249 align:middle line:90%
in Central Park.

00:33:38.249 --> 00:33:41.386 align:middle line:90%
And in certain historical images

00:33:41.386 --> 00:33:42.854 align:middle line:84%
on Google Earth you
can see this,

00:33:42.854 --> 00:33:45.356 align:middle line:84%
there's a clear line
there, through the water.

00:33:45.356 --> 00:33:47.091 align:middle line:84%
It's an underground
-- underwater...

00:33:47.091 --> 00:33:47.892 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes you can see it.

00:33:47.892 --> 00:33:49.193 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: ...structure.

00:33:49.193 --> 00:33:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And it points right to the
Metropolitan Museum of Art.

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:54.799 align:middle line:84%
And it just so happens
to point directly

00:33:54.799 --> 00:33:57.568 align:middle line:84%
to this ancient Egyptian
Isis templer --

00:33:57.568 --> 00:34:00.371 align:middle line:90%
temple in the Sackler Wing.

00:34:00.371 --> 00:34:03.341 align:middle line:84%
And she was the one who
actually went to Egypt,

00:34:03.341 --> 00:34:06.477 align:middle line:84%
received this gift from
Egypt that was given

00:34:06.477 --> 00:34:10.481 align:middle line:84%
to the United States when they
built the Aswan Dam in the 60's.

00:34:10.481 --> 00:34:12.182 align:middle line:84%
They were flooding the
valley and they needed

00:34:12.182 --> 00:34:13.818 align:middle line:84%
to move these temples
out of there.

00:34:13.818 --> 00:34:15.219 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:16.954 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: And so the United
States received it and she was

00:34:16.954 --> 00:34:20.658 align:middle line:84%
like the symbolic
receiver of the temple.

00:34:20.658 --> 00:34:22.427 align:middle line:84%
So she was almost
playing this role

00:34:22.427 --> 00:34:25.430 align:middle line:90%
of Isis, receiving her temple.

00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:28.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yes, and she did
have a type of quality about her

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.369 align:middle line:84%
that set her apart from
mortals for the most part.

00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:34.271 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: Yeah, she was sort
of idolized and, you know,

00:34:34.271 --> 00:34:37.008 align:middle line:90%
as this strong woman figure.

00:34:37.008 --> 00:34:38.242 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:34:38.242 --> 00:34:40.778 align:middle line:84%
And here I have a couple
things we could hop through

00:34:40.778 --> 00:34:43.081 align:middle line:84%
but I think we probably
want to move on.

00:34:43.081 --> 00:34:46.383 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is the
alignment with Sirius.

00:34:46.383 --> 00:34:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not just from
the Great Pyramids in Egypt.

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:51.088 align:middle line:84%
It also has to do
with the White House

00:34:51.088 --> 00:34:52.490 align:middle line:90%
and the National Post Office.

00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:53.758 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: Yes.

00:34:53.758 --> 00:34:55.393 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: [Laughter] Are
also aligned with Sirius.

00:34:55.393 --> 00:34:56.828 align:middle line:84%
So what is the significance
there?

00:34:56.828 --> 00:34:58.095 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: We also
see that in Paris.

00:34:58.095 --> 00:34:58.796 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes and...

00:34:58.796 --> 00:34:59.630 align:middle line:90%
>> [Multiple speakers].

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:00.798 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: There's a phenomenon

00:35:00.798 --> 00:35:01.866 align:middle line:84%
that the ancient Egyptians
based their calendar

00:35:01.866 --> 00:35:04.669 align:middle line:84%
on called the Heliacal
Rising of Sirius.

00:35:04.669 --> 00:35:08.439 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see this in early
August at the latitude of D.C.

00:35:08.439 --> 00:35:11.509 align:middle line:84%
Where if you get up before dawn
you'll see the star, Sirius,

00:35:11.509 --> 00:35:14.545 align:middle line:84%
rise on the horizon
just before the dawn.

00:35:14.545 --> 00:35:17.215 align:middle line:84%
That's called the
Heliacal Rising.

00:35:17.215 --> 00:35:20.718 align:middle line:84%
And so that would be how they
synchronized their calendar.

00:35:20.718 --> 00:35:22.854 align:middle line:84%
And so if you look
where does that happen?

00:35:22.854 --> 00:35:25.323 align:middle line:84%
If you're in the White House
and you're able to look right

00:35:25.323 --> 00:35:27.625 align:middle line:84%
down Pennsylvania
Avenue, you would see

00:35:27.625 --> 00:35:30.094 align:middle line:84%
that the star would
appear just right next

00:35:30.094 --> 00:35:31.496 align:middle line:90%
to the capital building there.

00:35:31.496 --> 00:35:35.299 align:middle line:84%
And then when the sun
sets on that same day,

00:35:35.299 --> 00:35:40.538 align:middle line:84%
you look down the other way
and you see the Sirius setting

00:35:40.538 --> 00:35:41.806 align:middle line:90%
over the White House there.

00:35:41.806 --> 00:35:44.775 align:middle line:84%
So, seems like there were
some urban planners early

00:35:44.775 --> 00:35:49.714 align:middle line:84%
on who oriented Pennsylvania
Avenue just so to pay homage

00:35:49.714 --> 00:35:51.883 align:middle line:84%
to the Heliacal Rising
of Sirius.

00:35:51.883 --> 00:35:55.486 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, and then
speaking of those same planners,

00:35:55.486 --> 00:36:00.024 align:middle line:84%
you have overlays also of the
White House lawn and Stonehenge.

00:36:00.024 --> 00:36:02.727 align:middle line:84%
And Stonehenge plays
prominently in a few areas

00:36:02.727 --> 00:36:03.928 align:middle line:90%
of your film, as well.

00:36:03.928 --> 00:36:05.363 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: That's right
Stonehenge is at the heart

00:36:05.363 --> 00:36:06.364 align:middle line:90%
of the mystery, really.

00:36:06.364 --> 00:36:07.665 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:36:07.665 --> 00:36:09.433 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: And it sort of,
that connection, I made --

00:36:09.433 --> 00:36:12.837 align:middle line:84%
I drew a line from the tip of
the Federal Triangle in D.C.

00:36:12.837 --> 00:36:16.541 align:middle line:84%
to the center of Stonehenge
in the U.K. And the line,

00:36:16.541 --> 00:36:20.011 align:middle line:84%
amazingly, cuts right across
Central Park in New York City.

00:36:20.011 --> 00:36:22.013 align:middle line:90%
It actually bisects that park.

00:36:22.013 --> 00:36:23.114 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:36:23.114 --> 00:36:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: And that
lead me to go into all

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:27.919 align:middle line:84%
of the research I
did in New York City.

00:36:27.919 --> 00:36:29.720 align:middle line:84%
Because I felt that
this was significant,

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:32.156 align:middle line:90%
this was intentional.

00:36:32.156 --> 00:36:35.626 align:middle line:84%
And the proportion of
the station rectangle

00:36:35.626 --> 00:36:39.096 align:middle line:90%
at Stonehenge is 5 to 12.

00:36:39.096 --> 00:36:42.433 align:middle line:84%
And surrounding the White House
there's a rectangle embedded

00:36:42.433 --> 00:36:46.837 align:middle line:84%
in the secrete architecture
of the city that's 5 to 12.

00:36:46.837 --> 00:36:51.342 align:middle line:84%
And Central Park in New
York City is 5 to 24.

00:36:51.342 --> 00:36:54.278 align:middle line:90%
So it's two of these.

00:36:54.278 --> 00:36:56.581 align:middle line:84%
A fan of Secrets in
Plain Sight pointed

00:36:56.581 --> 00:37:02.587 align:middle line:84%
out that the U.S. dollar bill
is 5 to 12 in its proportion.

00:37:02.587 --> 00:37:06.190 align:middle line:90%
So, I think it's 99% right.

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:07.592 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:37:07.592 --> 00:37:09.727 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: So that's kind of an
amazing synchronicity, as well.

00:37:09.727 --> 00:37:10.795 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Indeed.

00:37:10.795 --> 00:37:13.598 align:middle line:84%
Now let's go to the
clip on the obelisk,

00:37:13.598 --> 00:37:16.167 align:middle line:84%
because you've placed us
in New York City already.

00:37:16.167 --> 00:37:18.936 align:middle line:90%
So this was a huge undertaking.

00:37:18.936 --> 00:37:24.675 align:middle line:84%
An obelisk this size
isn't just sent as a gift.

00:37:24.675 --> 00:37:26.277 align:middle line:90%
This is something beyond that.

00:37:26.277 --> 00:37:29.914 align:middle line:84%
Obviously there was
purpose, behind having a pair

00:37:29.914 --> 00:37:34.251 align:middle line:84%
of obelisks placed where
they were ultimately placed.

00:37:34.251 --> 00:37:38.022 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: They're
called Cleopatra's Needles.

00:37:38.022 --> 00:37:40.424 align:middle line:84%
There's one right
next to the Met.

00:37:40.424 --> 00:37:43.394 align:middle line:84%
And there's one on the
Victoria Embankment in London.

00:37:43.394 --> 00:37:44.362 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:37:44.362 --> 00:37:46.063 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: And the
greatest story

00:37:46.063 --> 00:37:49.767 align:middle line:84%
about that is Peter
Tompkins book  The Mystery

00:37:49.767 --> 00:37:51.936 align:middle line:84%
of the Obelisks , I
believe it's called.

00:37:51.936 --> 00:37:54.605 align:middle line:84%
And it goes into all
the drama behind that

00:37:54.605 --> 00:37:56.907 align:middle line:84%
and how it was a major
undertaking to move those.

00:37:56.907 --> 00:37:58.142 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Major.

00:37:58.142 --> 00:38:00.711 align:middle line:84%
And I think you demonstrated
that in this clip.

00:38:00.711 --> 00:38:01.379 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:38:01.379 --> 00:38:02.947 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: Okay.

00:38:05.716 --> 00:38:08.152 align:middle line:84%
In case you're thinking
I'm imagining connections

00:38:08.152 --> 00:38:11.188 align:middle line:84%
where none exist, right
outside this room is one

00:38:11.188 --> 00:38:13.991 align:middle line:84%
of the oldest artifacts
in North America.

00:38:13.991 --> 00:38:18.963 align:middle line:84%
A 3500-year-old Egyptian
obelisk from Heliopolis.

00:38:18.963 --> 00:38:23.267 align:middle line:84%
Note the octagon surrounding
yet another solar symbol.

00:38:23.267 --> 00:38:24.535 align:middle line:90%
There are only a handful

00:38:24.535 --> 00:38:27.505 align:middle line:84%
of ancient Egyptian
obelisks left in the world.

00:38:27.505 --> 00:38:30.074 align:middle line:84%
Even counting those
still in Egypt.

00:38:30.074 --> 00:38:33.811 align:middle line:84%
So when I see one I
sit up and take notice.

00:38:33.811 --> 00:38:37.982 align:middle line:84%
This obelisk is the twin of
Cleopatra's Needle in London.

00:38:37.982 --> 00:38:40.918 align:middle line:84%
Egyptian temples typically
had paired obelisks

00:38:40.918 --> 00:38:44.555 align:middle line:84%
at their entrances so the
obelisks now in New York

00:38:44.555 --> 00:38:47.391 align:middle line:84%
and London used to
together frame the entrance

00:38:47.391 --> 00:38:50.061 align:middle line:90%
to a temple in Heliopolis.

00:38:50.061 --> 00:38:52.530 align:middle line:84%
It was quite a difficult
and expensive project

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:55.399 align:middle line:84%
in the 19th century,
and even today,

00:38:55.399 --> 00:38:58.402 align:middle line:90%
to transport a 224-ton slab

00:38:58.402 --> 00:39:01.672 align:middle line:84%
of granite halfway
across the planet.

00:39:01.672 --> 00:39:05.609 align:middle line:84%
Connecting nations with ancient
Egypt was apparently a very

00:39:05.609 --> 00:39:07.845 align:middle line:84%
powerful motivator
to the Freemasons

00:39:07.845 --> 00:39:10.214 align:middle line:84%
who bothered moving
these obelisks.

00:39:10.214 --> 00:39:13.017 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I find
that just fascinating.

00:39:13.017 --> 00:39:14.518 align:middle line:90%
What an endeavor.

00:39:14.518 --> 00:39:16.787 align:middle line:84%
And these are found
all over the planet.

00:39:16.787 --> 00:39:21.525 align:middle line:84%
And so from what you've been
able to see, as you said,

00:39:21.525 --> 00:39:25.563 align:middle line:84%
the Vessica Pisces has been
surrounding them in the case

00:39:25.563 --> 00:39:26.931 align:middle line:90%
of the Washington Monument.

00:39:26.931 --> 00:39:30.801 align:middle line:84%
But in others as well, is there
any other common denominator

00:39:30.801 --> 00:39:33.637 align:middle line:84%
behind the placement of
these particular obelisks?

00:39:33.637 --> 00:39:35.005 align:middle line:90%
These massive obelisks?

00:39:35.005 --> 00:39:36.507 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: I can
think of in Rome.

00:39:36.507 --> 00:39:39.043 align:middle line:84%
Rome has the most Egyptian
obelisks of anywhere

00:39:39.043 --> 00:39:41.212 align:middle line:90%
in the world, including Egypt.

00:39:41.212 --> 00:39:44.615 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking ancient
Egyptian obelisks.

00:39:44.615 --> 00:39:50.121 align:middle line:84%
The obelisks that are set
up in Rome are oriented

00:39:50.121 --> 00:39:54.391 align:middle line:84%
to the summer solstice sunrise
and the winter solstice sunrise.

00:39:54.391 --> 00:39:58.496 align:middle line:84%
And I profile that research
in my Rome episode here.

00:39:58.496 --> 00:40:00.164 align:middle line:84%
And it was, I think
it was Jan Wicherink

00:40:00.164 --> 00:40:03.234 align:middle line:84%
and Aaron Parlier
who figured that out.

00:40:03.234 --> 00:40:05.870 align:middle line:90%
And so Sixtus V, this pope,

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:08.806 align:middle line:84%
the last Renaissance pope
was actually responsible

00:40:08.806 --> 00:40:12.943 align:middle line:84%
for positioning these
obelisks within Rome just so.

00:40:12.943 --> 00:40:15.913 align:middle line:84%
And his tomb is in Santa
Maria Maggiore at the end

00:40:15.913 --> 00:40:17.648 align:middle line:90%
of one of those alignments.

00:40:17.648 --> 00:40:22.887 align:middle line:84%
So I wonder if he actually
intentionally did that

00:40:22.887 --> 00:40:25.256 align:middle line:84%
or if he was inspired
to do that.

00:40:25.256 --> 00:40:28.225 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting that he
chose the name for himself.

00:40:28.225 --> 00:40:31.629 align:middle line:84%
When a person becomes
pope they choose the name.

00:40:31.629 --> 00:40:36.167 align:middle line:84%
So he chose Sixtus V,
which is like six and five.

00:40:36.167 --> 00:40:37.535 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:40:37.535 --> 00:40:39.069 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: So, what, did he
have hermetic knowledge or not?

00:40:39.069 --> 00:40:40.171 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It's certainly
possible.

00:40:40.171 --> 00:40:41.672 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: I think
it's certainly possible.

00:40:41.672 --> 00:40:44.542 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And interesting,
too, just when you're looking

00:40:44.542 --> 00:40:47.978 align:middle line:84%
at it symbolically, as
the Mason's did of course,

00:40:47.978 --> 00:40:49.914 align:middle line:90%
and the Hermetics as well.

00:40:49.914 --> 00:40:57.988 align:middle line:84%
That this would also bring in an
essence of a masculine frequency

00:40:57.988 --> 00:41:00.458 align:middle line:84%
into that region,
into that area.

00:41:00.458 --> 00:41:02.226 align:middle line:90%
Assuming, for some purpose.

00:41:02.226 --> 00:41:03.627 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: But it's
usually balance.

00:41:03.627 --> 00:41:06.530 align:middle line:84%
The obelisks are masculine
but they're balanced

00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:08.833 align:middle line:90%
by fountains surrounding them.

00:41:08.833 --> 00:41:09.900 align:middle line:90%
Or a Vessica Pisces.

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:10.701 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: That's
what I was wondering,

00:41:10.701 --> 00:41:12.036 align:middle line:90%
is that generally the case?

00:41:12.036 --> 00:41:13.204 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: In Rome, I think
every obelisk has fountains

00:41:13.204 --> 00:41:13.904 align:middle line:90%
around them.

00:41:13.904 --> 00:41:14.705 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Interesting.

00:41:14.705 --> 00:41:15.406 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: So it's this...

00:41:15.406 --> 00:41:16.106 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Balancing.

00:41:16.106 --> 00:41:16.941 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: Balancing.

00:41:16.941 --> 00:41:19.210 align:middle line:90%
There's a recognition of that.

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:21.178 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: As in
Indian temples as well.

00:41:21.178 --> 00:41:22.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: Yeah.

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.815 align:middle line:84%
So, it's not just masculine,
it's not, it's a balance.

00:41:24.815 --> 00:41:26.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It's a
balancing of the two.

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:26.951 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: Yeah.

00:41:26.951 --> 00:41:27.918 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Interesting.

00:41:27.918 --> 00:41:29.220 align:middle line:90%
Okay, now we're going to talk

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:30.621 align:middle line:84%
about something you
just discovered.

00:41:30.621 --> 00:41:32.289 align:middle line:84%
It's not in any of
your documentaries

00:41:32.289 --> 00:41:33.924 align:middle line:84%
yet because we're
in New York still.

00:41:33.924 --> 00:41:36.060 align:middle line:90%
Okay. And it's the number 432.

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:37.528 align:middle line:84%
And if you could talk
about this phenomena

00:41:37.528 --> 00:41:41.131 align:middle line:84%
and what you've discovered
there by way of a new structure.

00:41:41.131 --> 00:41:42.466 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: Okay, a
couple of weeks ago,

00:41:42.466 --> 00:41:45.035 align:middle line:84%
so this is very recent, someone
emailed me and they said,

00:41:45.035 --> 00:41:47.638 align:middle line:84%
"You should check
432 Park Avenue,

00:41:47.638 --> 00:41:48.973 align:middle line:90%
just because of the address."

00:41:48.973 --> 00:41:52.376 align:middle line:84%
432. It's one of these
numbers that's half of 864,

00:41:52.376 --> 00:41:54.378 align:middle line:90%
which is a solar number.

00:41:54.378 --> 00:41:58.015 align:middle line:84%
You can look at the
sun's radius is 432,000.

00:41:58.015 --> 00:41:59.183 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yeah and we're
going to go into that

00:41:59.183 --> 00:42:00.050 align:middle line:90%
in more depth in the clip.

00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:01.118 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: Yeah.

00:42:01.118 --> 00:42:02.319 align:middle line:84%
So anyways, that's a
significant number.

00:42:02.319 --> 00:42:07.958 align:middle line:84%
Actually 108, 216, 432,
864, all very significant.

00:42:07.958 --> 00:42:09.527 align:middle line:84%
They're all doubles
of each other.

00:42:09.527 --> 00:42:12.696 align:middle line:84%
So 432 Park Avenue
got my attention.

00:42:12.696 --> 00:42:16.367 align:middle line:84%
And then I was amazed
because it's a square building

00:42:16.367 --> 00:42:22.573 align:middle line:84%
and each square floor
plate is 8,640 square feet.

00:42:22.573 --> 00:42:25.309 align:middle line:84%
So it's using that same
number canon.

00:42:25.309 --> 00:42:27.811 align:middle line:84%
The height of the
building is 1398 feet.

00:42:27.811 --> 00:42:30.748 align:middle line:84%
Which I thought for a long time,
I was like, what does that mean?

00:42:30.748 --> 00:42:32.549 align:middle line:90%
There's no significance to that.

00:42:32.549 --> 00:42:35.085 align:middle line:84%
Then I pulled out my
calculator and I realized

00:42:35.085 --> 00:42:39.323 align:middle line:84%
that it's 864 times
Phi, the golden ratio.

00:42:39.323 --> 00:42:44.094 align:middle line:84%
So that's 864 times
1.618 equals 1398.

00:42:44.094 --> 00:42:46.997 align:middle line:84%
So there you have this
secondary encoding.

00:42:46.997 --> 00:42:51.802 align:middle line:84%
Also, the -- I think there are
2,016 windows in the building.

00:42:51.802 --> 00:42:54.171 align:middle line:90%
So that's 216.

00:42:54.171 --> 00:42:56.307 align:middle line:90%
You can, in my philosophy

00:42:56.307 --> 00:43:00.311 align:middle line:84%
of number zero can be
ignored, it's a placeholder.

00:43:00.311 --> 00:43:01.545 align:middle line:90%
So we're looking at the digits.

00:43:01.545 --> 00:43:06.550 align:middle line:90%
It's 21 -- 2016, is really 216.

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:11.188 align:middle line:84%
For its significance, for
its qualitative essence.

00:43:11.188 --> 00:43:13.324 align:middle line:84%
And then the total
square footage of all

00:43:13.324 --> 00:43:17.094 align:middle line:84%
of the glass is 201,600
square feet.

00:43:17.094 --> 00:43:18.729 align:middle line:90%
So again, 216.

00:43:18.729 --> 00:43:20.297 align:middle line:84%
So it's hitting me
on many levels

00:43:20.297 --> 00:43:23.434 align:middle line:84%
that this building has been
designed with this resonance.

00:43:23.434 --> 00:43:24.735 align:middle line:90%
And then one more thing.

00:43:24.735 --> 00:43:30.174 align:middle line:84%
Just this morning, someone
posted a comment on my blog

00:43:30.174 --> 00:43:35.846 align:middle line:84%
and they said the torch on the
statue of liberty, the distance

00:43:35.846 --> 00:43:41.585 align:middle line:84%
from the torch to where 432 Park
is being constructed right now

00:43:41.585 --> 00:43:44.922 align:middle line:90%
is 33,333 feet.

00:43:44.922 --> 00:43:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And I fired up Google
Earth this morning

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:49.093 align:middle line:84%
and I verified that
that's the case.

00:43:49.093 --> 00:43:50.060 align:middle line:90%
It's just mind-blowing.

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:51.395 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: It is mind-blowing.

00:43:51.395 --> 00:43:53.664 align:middle line:84%
But the back-story to that I
found equally as interesting

00:43:53.664 --> 00:43:55.566 align:middle line:90%
when we were talking off camera.

00:43:55.566 --> 00:43:57.568 align:middle line:84%
That building, that
wasn't the original address

00:43:57.568 --> 00:43:58.502 align:middle line:90%
of that building.

00:43:58.502 --> 00:43:59.203 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: That's right.

00:43:59.203 --> 00:44:00.204 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: The person

00:44:00.204 --> 00:44:01.605 align:middle line:84%
that bought this
building for a fortune.

00:44:01.605 --> 00:44:03.273 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: It was --

00:44:03.273 --> 00:44:06.510 align:middle line:84%
the developer bought
440 Park Avenue.

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:07.578 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:44:07.578 --> 00:44:08.879 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: It was
called the Drake Hotel.

00:44:08.879 --> 00:44:12.216 align:middle line:84%
It has lots of history
and rock music.

00:44:12.216 --> 00:44:13.317 align:middle line:90%
And he tore it down.

00:44:13.317 --> 00:44:16.086 align:middle line:84%
He paid $440 million
for this hotel.

00:44:16.086 --> 00:44:17.755 align:middle line:90%
Now that's pretty bold

00:44:17.755 --> 00:44:21.492 align:middle line:84%
to destroy a building
that's that valuable.

00:44:21.492 --> 00:44:26.830 align:middle line:84%
But then he -- they're building
a $1,250 billion building there.

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:30.367 align:middle line:84%
And they changed the
address to 432 Park.

00:44:30.367 --> 00:44:31.435 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And there's
a significance to that.

00:44:31.435 --> 00:44:32.369 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: There's
a significance.

00:44:32.369 --> 00:44:34.672 align:middle line:90%
Also, another person commented,

00:44:34.672 --> 00:44:36.073 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't catch
this right away.

00:44:36.073 --> 00:44:41.378 align:middle line:84%
But 432 is the -- there's a
movement amongst opera singers

00:44:41.378 --> 00:44:42.613 align:middle line:90%
and lots of people in music

00:44:42.613 --> 00:44:46.116 align:middle line:84%
to shift the standard
concert tuning to 432 Hertz.

00:44:46.116 --> 00:44:48.318 align:middle line:84%
That's the frequency
of the Middle C,

00:44:48.318 --> 00:44:51.655 align:middle line:84%
or sorry I think it's the
A above Middle C. Anyway,

00:44:51.655 --> 00:44:56.527 align:middle line:84%
it's 432 Hertz and standard
concert tuning is 440 Hertz.

00:44:56.527 --> 00:45:00.030 align:middle line:84%
So we have 440 and
432 expressed in music

00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:01.899 align:middle line:84%
and in the addresses
of the building.

00:45:01.899 --> 00:45:03.867 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And the
work of Lee Horowitz.

00:45:03.867 --> 00:45:05.335 align:middle line:84%
He talked about this
quite a bit.

00:45:05.335 --> 00:45:08.739 align:middle line:84%
There is a disharmonic
and then a truer harmonic.

00:45:08.739 --> 00:45:11.308 align:middle line:84%
And the 432 represents
the truer harmonic.

00:45:11.308 --> 00:45:12.376 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: That's right.

00:45:12.376 --> 00:45:13.744 align:middle line:84%
So we're moving into
a state of harmony.

00:45:13.744 --> 00:45:14.878 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So did the person
that changed this address know

00:45:14.878 --> 00:45:16.814 align:middle line:84%
that they were taking
it from a less harmonic

00:45:16.814 --> 00:45:18.348 align:middle line:90%
to a greater harmonic?

00:45:18.348 --> 00:45:19.717 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: It's
unlikely that I'll be able

00:45:19.717 --> 00:45:21.985 align:middle line:84%
to get an interview
with a developer.

00:45:21.985 --> 00:45:23.020 align:middle line:90%
I mean this person is...

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:25.589 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It would
be interesting.

00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:26.623 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: They're
selling the condos

00:45:26.623 --> 00:45:29.293 align:middle line:84%
in the building for
over $3 billion.

00:45:29.293 --> 00:45:30.694 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Wow.

00:45:30.694 --> 00:45:32.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: So it's going to be
the tallest residential tower

00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:34.364 align:middle line:90%
in the western hemisphere.

00:45:34.364 --> 00:45:36.834 align:middle line:84%
It'll be taller than the
Empire State Building.

00:45:36.834 --> 00:45:39.369 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: This is a statement
of some -- whatever it means,

00:45:39.369 --> 00:45:41.772 align:middle line:84%
with all of the, I don't
think it's a coincidence

00:45:41.772 --> 00:45:43.640 align:middle line:84%
that the math is
working out like it is,

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:45.375 align:middle line:90%
the numeric sequences are.

00:45:45.375 --> 00:45:47.978 align:middle line:84%
So this is a statement of
some kind yet to be revealed.

00:45:47.978 --> 00:45:50.414 align:middle line:84%
I guess we'll find out when we
see what plays out historically

00:45:50.414 --> 00:45:52.349 align:middle line:84%
around that building
in the future.

00:45:52.349 --> 00:45:54.151 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, let's go
back to the number 108.

00:45:54.151 --> 00:45:55.252 align:middle line:90%
You brought it up a moment ago.

00:45:55.252 --> 00:45:57.221 align:middle line:84%
You have, we have
another film clip.

00:45:57.221 --> 00:46:01.792 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with 108 and
sequencing around the moon

00:46:01.792 --> 00:46:05.062 align:middle line:84%
and silver, and some other
more religious symbols.

00:46:05.062 --> 00:46:06.630 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:46:08.065 --> 00:46:10.434 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: [Film]108 is
a number sacred to many

00:46:10.434 --> 00:46:12.269 align:middle line:90%
of the world's religions.

00:46:12.269 --> 00:46:17.241 align:middle line:84%
For example, there are 108
prayer beads in the Holy Rosary.

00:46:17.241 --> 00:46:19.810 align:middle line:84%
The Rosary is a key
devotional path

00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:22.713 align:middle line:84%
in the Catholic veneration
of Mary.

00:46:22.713 --> 00:46:25.149 align:middle line:84%
The worshippers fingers
keep track of the number

00:46:25.149 --> 00:46:27.484 align:middle line:90%
of Hail Mary prayers they recite

00:46:27.484 --> 00:46:31.155 align:middle line:84%
by moving along one
bead at a time.

00:46:31.155 --> 00:46:36.527 align:middle line:84%
Hindus, Buddhists and Jains all
use Jappa Mala prayer necklaces

00:46:36.527 --> 00:46:39.029 align:middle line:84%
in much the same
way as Catholics.

00:46:39.029 --> 00:46:42.199 align:middle line:84%
Incredibly Jappa Malas
are most commonly made

00:46:42.199 --> 00:46:45.369 align:middle line:90%
with exactly 108 beads.

00:46:45.369 --> 00:46:46.603 align:middle line:90%
These two are fingered

00:46:46.603 --> 00:46:51.241 align:middle line:84%
as the devotee chants
or repeats mantras.

00:46:51.241 --> 00:46:53.110 align:middle line:84%
Whether the worshipper
is conscious of it

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:56.647 align:middle line:84%
or not the moon is ultimately
behind what they are actually

00:46:56.647 --> 00:47:00.317 align:middle line:90%
venerating in 108 recitations.

00:47:00.317 --> 00:47:02.486 align:middle line:84%
As I already mentioned,
the mean radius

00:47:02.486 --> 00:47:06.023 align:middle line:90%
of the moon is 1,080 miles.

00:47:06.023 --> 00:47:07.824 align:middle line:90%
The connection between goddesses

00:47:07.824 --> 00:47:11.762 align:middle line:84%
and the moon is as
old as humanity.

00:47:11.762 --> 00:47:14.064 align:middle line:84%
Coincidentally, the
element silver,

00:47:14.064 --> 00:47:16.733 align:middle line:84%
which has always been
associated with the moon,

00:47:16.733 --> 00:47:20.904 align:middle line:84%
has an atomic weight
of 108 grams per mull.

00:47:20.904 --> 00:47:25.142 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And this is just
flashing on a little bit

00:47:25.142 --> 00:47:28.278 align:middle line:84%
of what you spoke about at the
earlier part of the interview.

00:47:28.278 --> 00:47:31.815 align:middle line:84%
Then the relationship
between that, and the sun.

00:47:31.815 --> 00:47:34.117 align:middle line:84%
And so just recap again on
what you said at the beginning

00:47:34.117 --> 00:47:37.354 align:middle line:84%
of the interview about
the ratios between the sun

00:47:37.354 --> 00:47:39.022 align:middle line:90%
and the Earth, and the moon.

00:47:39.022 --> 00:47:39.856 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: And the moon.

00:47:39.856 --> 00:47:40.924 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:47:40.924 --> 00:47:41.458 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: Got to
see if I can remember.

00:47:41.458 --> 00:47:42.793 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter].

00:47:42.793 --> 00:47:48.031 align:middle line:84%
I think the solar diameter
containers 108 Earth diameters.

00:47:48.031 --> 00:47:53.103 align:middle line:84%
The Earth is 108 solar diameters
from the sun on average.

00:47:53.103 --> 00:47:58.775 align:middle line:84%
The moon is 108 lunar diameters
from the Earth on average.

00:47:58.775 --> 00:48:03.647 align:middle line:84%
Another one is that the Earth
has a volume of 108 times 10

00:48:03.647 --> 00:48:07.684 align:middle line:84%
to the 10th power
cubic kilometers.

00:48:07.684 --> 00:48:12.089 align:middle line:84%
So, what we find is
that it's the number

00:48:12.089 --> 00:48:14.858 align:middle line:84%
that matters, it's
not the units.

00:48:14.858 --> 00:48:17.594 align:middle line:84%
It's not feet or inches,
or cubic kilometers.

00:48:17.594 --> 00:48:20.430 align:middle line:84%
It's the number that's
significant.

00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:24.534 align:middle line:84%
And so this is almost
a key to the matrix

00:48:24.534 --> 00:48:26.637 align:middle line:90%
that we live in to the universe.

00:48:26.637 --> 00:48:31.541 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be built with
an awareness of number.

00:48:31.541 --> 00:48:32.609 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:48:32.609 --> 00:48:35.279 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: It is
perhaps built on number.

00:48:35.279 --> 00:48:37.180 align:middle line:90%
And that's why I get so deeply

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:39.383 align:middle line:84%
into the philosophy
behind number.

00:48:39.383 --> 00:48:40.951 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a book called
Taking Measure ,

00:48:40.951 --> 00:48:44.755 align:middle line:84%
which goes into that
in great depth.

00:48:44.755 --> 00:48:48.492 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yes, and well this
knowledge has been preserved

00:48:48.492 --> 00:48:52.763 align:middle line:84%
really, the only reason we have
it today was, as you stated

00:48:52.763 --> 00:48:54.765 align:middle line:84%
in the documentary,
this particular body

00:48:54.765 --> 00:48:57.200 align:middle line:84%
of say hermetic knowledge,
was having to do

00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:00.804 align:middle line:84%
with the inside of
Cosimo de' Medici.

00:49:00.804 --> 00:49:04.241 align:middle line:84%
In that he was able
to -- he rescued --

00:49:04.241 --> 00:49:08.578 align:middle line:84%
well he had possession of a
rescued body of information

00:49:08.578 --> 00:49:11.148 align:middle line:84%
that ultimately made it back
in big fashion in France.

00:49:11.148 --> 00:49:13.717 align:middle line:84%
As you say in you documentary
of hermetic knowledge.

00:49:13.717 --> 00:49:16.687 align:middle line:84%
That had been all but,
everything else had been all

00:49:16.687 --> 00:49:20.157 align:middle line:84%
but lost in the Fire of
the Library Alexandria.

00:49:20.157 --> 00:49:21.792 align:middle line:84%
How did he come into
possession it this?

00:49:21.792 --> 00:49:24.094 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: It's like we
almost, almost lost the plot...

00:49:24.094 --> 00:49:24.928 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Almost lost it all.

00:49:24.928 --> 00:49:25.495 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: ...completely.

00:49:25.495 --> 00:49:26.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:29.066 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: But Cosimo
de' Medici hired people

00:49:29.066 --> 00:49:31.301 align:middle line:90%
to go find ancient manuscripts.

00:49:31.301 --> 00:49:34.504 align:middle line:84%
And at that time I think someone
went over somewhere in Turkey,

00:49:34.504 --> 00:49:36.573 align:middle line:84%
perhaps, and they found
the Corpus Hermetica.

00:49:36.573 --> 00:49:39.810 align:middle line:84%
This body of ancient wisdom
that was basically coming

00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:41.878 align:middle line:90%
down from ancient Egypt.

00:49:41.878 --> 00:49:44.848 align:middle line:84%
And that actually fueled
the Italian Renaissance.

00:49:44.848 --> 00:49:45.615 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:49:45.615 --> 00:49:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: It actually...

00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:47.417 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And the
French, in a sense.

00:49:47.417 --> 00:49:48.352 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: Later as well.

00:49:48.352 --> 00:49:50.187 align:middle line:84%
And Louis the son
came and seemed

00:49:50.187 --> 00:49:52.723 align:middle line:84%
to have all this
knowledge as well.

00:49:52.723 --> 00:49:58.362 align:middle line:84%
And so, it -- at a certain
point it went underground.

00:49:58.362 --> 00:50:00.998 align:middle line:84%
But at least we haven't
lost the plot today.

00:50:00.998 --> 00:50:03.633 align:middle line:84%
We have -- we're starting
to recover this information

00:50:03.633 --> 00:50:06.436 align:middle line:84%
and realize that we have
these resonant numbers,

00:50:06.436 --> 00:50:09.072 align:middle line:90%
that disparate phenomena,

00:50:09.072 --> 00:50:11.842 align:middle line:84%
sort of resonate
with and converge on.

00:50:11.842 --> 00:50:13.076 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:50:13.076 --> 00:50:15.779 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: As above, so
below is the Hermetic motto.

00:50:15.779 --> 00:50:17.414 align:middle line:90%
So it's basically this kind

00:50:17.414 --> 00:50:19.950 align:middle line:84%
of fractal structure
that we live in.

00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:21.651 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Let's take a look
at another example of it

00:50:21.651 --> 00:50:25.622 align:middle line:84%
because this is where you
come into the notion of speed,

00:50:25.622 --> 00:50:30.627 align:middle line:84%
or distance and time, and
numbers all converging.

00:50:30.627 --> 00:50:31.395 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:50:31.395 --> 00:50:32.496 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: Yes.

00:50:32.496 --> 00:50:33.897 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay, let's
take a look at this.

00:50:37.334 --> 00:50:38.568 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: John Charles Webb,

00:50:38.568 --> 00:50:41.505 align:middle line:84%
Jr. has made a profound
discovery about the location

00:50:41.505 --> 00:50:45.041 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Pyramid that is
unfortunately widely ignored

00:50:45.041 --> 00:50:47.844 align:middle line:84%
because of its utter
implausibility.

00:50:47.844 --> 00:50:50.947 align:middle line:84%
Using Google Earth we can
measure the exact latitude

00:50:50.947 --> 00:50:53.483 align:middle line:84%
of the center of the Grand
Gallery inside the pyramid.

00:50:53.483 --> 00:51:00.791 align:middle line:90%
It is 29.9792458-degrees north.

00:51:00.791 --> 00:51:07.631 align:middle line:84%
The speed of light in the
vacuum is 299,792,458-meters

00:51:07.631 --> 00:51:08.899 align:middle line:90%
per second.

00:51:08.899 --> 00:51:11.468 align:middle line:84%
Incredibly these are
the same numbers.

00:51:11.468 --> 00:51:13.003 align:middle line:90%
How can this be?

00:51:13.003 --> 00:51:16.740 align:middle line:84%
This correlation is either
pure coincidence or evidence

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:19.810 align:middle line:90%
of something very profound.

00:51:19.810 --> 00:51:23.346 align:middle line:84%
The meter as unit of length and
the practice of dividing time

00:51:23.346 --> 00:51:26.516 align:middle line:84%
into seconds would have to be
coordinated for the location

00:51:26.516 --> 00:51:29.886 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Pyramid to
encode the speed of light.

00:51:31.121 --> 00:51:33.323 align:middle line:84%
Nothing may sound
more improbable

00:51:33.323 --> 00:51:35.659 align:middle line:84%
but this is exactly the
sort of numbers game

00:51:35.659 --> 00:51:37.127 align:middle line:84%
that I think the
ancients played.

00:51:37.127 --> 00:51:42.098 align:middle line:84%
Consider the fact that one
second is one Earth rotation

00:51:42.098 --> 00:51:45.769 align:middle line:90%
and divide it into 86,400 parts,

00:51:45.769 --> 00:51:51.608 align:middle line:84%
because one day is
equal to 86,400 seconds.

00:51:51.608 --> 00:51:54.678 align:middle line:84%
Recall from the Stonehenge
in San Francisco episodes

00:51:54.678 --> 00:51:58.748 align:middle line:84%
that the sun's diameter
is 864,000 miles.

00:51:58.748 --> 00:52:02.052 align:middle line:84%
And 864 is the number
of the sun.

00:52:03.386 --> 00:52:06.256 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the second and the
mile were skillfully designed

00:52:06.256 --> 00:52:10.727 align:middle line:84%
to express this beautiful
harmony with the sun.

00:52:10.727 --> 00:52:14.297 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And again, it
doesn't really seem to matter

00:52:14.297 --> 00:52:18.301 align:middle line:84%
which culture we look to, in
terms of any sacred texts,

00:52:18.301 --> 00:52:21.705 align:middle line:84%
it seems that the sun is always
playing the central role.

00:52:21.705 --> 00:52:22.639 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: Yes.

00:52:22.639 --> 00:52:23.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: To our
experience here.

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:25.575 align:middle line:84%
And now we're even seeing
it laid our mathematically.

00:52:25.575 --> 00:52:27.711 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: It's the
heart center, the sun.

00:52:27.711 --> 00:52:28.378 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:52:28.378 --> 00:52:29.579 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: I think.

00:52:29.579 --> 00:52:32.148 align:middle line:84%
Well, we somehow often
lost the plot on that one,

00:52:32.148 --> 00:52:34.417 align:middle line:84%
but I think that's
what they're getting

00:52:34.417 --> 00:52:37.120 align:middle line:90%
at with this solar worship.

00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:38.021 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:52:38.021 --> 00:52:38.822 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: Yeah.

00:52:38.822 --> 00:52:39.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I think so, too.

00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:42.559 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
start looking at the,

00:52:42.559 --> 00:52:45.662 align:middle line:84%
some of the more
common lifestyle choices

00:52:45.662 --> 00:52:47.297 align:middle line:90%
of today, for example.

00:52:47.297 --> 00:52:49.966 align:middle line:84%
We look at spending all
of our time indoors rather

00:52:49.966 --> 00:52:52.302 align:middle line:90%
than being exposed to the sun.

00:52:52.302 --> 00:52:54.104 align:middle line:90%
We look at medical industry

00:52:54.104 --> 00:52:56.339 align:middle line:84%
which is telling us the
sun is actually dangerous

00:52:56.339 --> 00:52:57.774 align:middle line:84%
and we'll get cancer
from the sun.

00:52:57.774 --> 00:52:59.042 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: Have you
heard of these people

00:52:59.042 --> 00:53:00.844 align:middle line:84%
that actually take their
nourishment from the sun?

00:53:00.844 --> 00:53:01.878 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes, I have.

00:53:01.878 --> 00:53:02.646 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: There
are studies on that.

00:53:02.646 --> 00:53:03.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: The sun-gazers.

00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:04.848 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: It's
very interesting.

00:53:04.848 --> 00:53:08.018 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And these --
it seems that the ancients

00:53:08.018 --> 00:53:11.454 align:middle line:84%
with the sacred knowledge
that you have come upon

00:53:11.454 --> 00:53:15.358 align:middle line:84%
and have certainly demonstrated
well in this documentary,

00:53:15.358 --> 00:53:18.228 align:middle line:84%
understood that there
was than just light

00:53:18.228 --> 00:53:20.363 align:middle line:90%
and heat coming from the sun.

00:53:20.363 --> 00:53:24.734 align:middle line:84%
There's an intrinsic
numeric relationship,

00:53:24.734 --> 00:53:28.004 align:middle line:84%
information streaming
from the sun, it appears,

00:53:28.004 --> 00:53:31.074 align:middle line:84%
to all life forms
within the solar system.

00:53:31.074 --> 00:53:33.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: I kind of
speculate that if we go

00:53:33.310 --> 00:53:36.947 align:middle line:84%
through a great spiritual
evolution perhaps we will one

00:53:36.947 --> 00:53:38.882 align:middle line:90%
day become a sun.

00:53:38.882 --> 00:53:39.916 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:53:39.916 --> 00:53:41.451 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: That is
perhaps a destiny

00:53:41.451 --> 00:53:44.287 align:middle line:90%
of truly being enlightened.

00:53:44.287 --> 00:53:46.423 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And that's what
you see around the heads

00:53:46.423 --> 00:53:50.927 align:middle line:84%
of the enlightened, as depicted
historically, is a solar disk.

00:53:50.927 --> 00:53:52.562 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: That's right,
in fact, George Washington

00:53:52.562 --> 00:53:53.863 align:middle line:84%
at the top of the
capitol dome...

00:53:53.863 --> 00:53:54.831 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: That's right.

00:53:54.831 --> 00:53:56.399 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: Is before
a sun disk.

00:53:56.399 --> 00:53:57.567 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:53:57.567 --> 00:53:59.936 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: It's
a man become God.

00:53:59.936 --> 00:54:01.071 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:54:01.071 --> 00:54:02.539 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: It's human's
becoming enlightened,

00:54:02.539 --> 00:54:04.274 align:middle line:90%
that's what we're talking about.

00:54:04.274 --> 00:54:05.775 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yes and in
Williams Henry's work,

00:54:05.775 --> 00:54:07.277 align:middle line:84%
which we have mentioned
a couple of times,

00:54:07.277 --> 00:54:09.579 align:middle line:84%
he believes that is
our ultimate path.

00:54:09.579 --> 00:54:12.248 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: He does the best
research on the capital.

00:54:12.248 --> 00:54:13.049 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:54:13.049 --> 00:54:14.284 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: I remember he --

00:54:14.284 --> 00:54:16.586 align:middle line:84%
where the President gets
inaugurated there's 33 steps

00:54:16.586 --> 00:54:19.289 align:middle line:90%
up into the Capital Dome.

00:54:19.289 --> 00:54:20.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:21.458 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: None of these
things are accidents.

00:54:21.458 --> 00:54:22.726 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: They're
not accidents.

00:54:22.726 --> 00:54:24.327 align:middle line:84%
And now we've come to the
point in the conversation,

00:54:24.327 --> 00:54:25.895 align:middle line:90%
there's just so much more

00:54:25.895 --> 00:54:28.231 align:middle line:84%
and like I said we just
scratched the surface

00:54:28.231 --> 00:54:29.332 align:middle line:90%
with a few little clips.

00:54:29.332 --> 00:54:31.434 align:middle line:84%
Out of four hours we
did about seven minutes.

00:54:31.434 --> 00:54:32.435 align:middle line:90%
So...

00:54:32.435 --> 00:54:33.136 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: And that's
just Volume One,

00:54:33.136 --> 00:54:34.137 align:middle line:90%
there's also Volume Two.

00:54:34.137 --> 00:54:35.271 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And that's
just Volume One.

00:54:35.271 --> 00:54:37.774 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that, I haven't
even seen Volume Two.

00:54:37.774 --> 00:54:40.610 align:middle line:84%
This was a course
for me to study.

00:54:40.610 --> 00:54:44.080 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk more about the
philosophical overlay of, no,

00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:46.716 align:middle line:90%
this isn't by accident.

00:54:46.716 --> 00:54:49.319 align:middle line:84%
These numerical sequences
repeating

00:54:49.319 --> 00:54:52.155 align:middle line:84%
out the way they do
cannot be coincidences.

00:54:52.155 --> 00:54:54.124 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: I think when you
start to see enough of them,

00:54:54.124 --> 00:54:57.327 align:middle line:84%
and I try to present
that, you get the sense

00:54:57.327 --> 00:55:01.131 align:middle line:84%
that everything is
synchronized in this way.

00:55:01.131 --> 00:55:04.567 align:middle line:84%
And shall I talk about the
different possibilities

00:55:04.567 --> 00:55:05.902 align:middle line:90%
of encoders?

00:55:05.902 --> 00:55:07.303 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Absolutely, that's
what I wanted to ask you.

00:55:07.303 --> 00:55:08.371 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: So the first, in
my book  Taking Measure  I talk

00:55:08.371 --> 00:55:10.440 align:middle line:90%
about four types of encoders.

00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:14.310 align:middle line:84%
The first type would be people
engaged in some kind of plan.

00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:16.880 align:middle line:90%
Usually a conspiracy to --

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:19.015 align:middle line:84%
like an architect in
an architectural firm.

00:55:19.015 --> 00:55:20.917 align:middle line:84%
They might build a building
with all of these numbers

00:55:20.917 --> 00:55:23.153 align:middle line:90%
and not tell anyone, perhaps.

00:55:23.153 --> 00:55:24.220 align:middle line:90%
That's maybe the first thing

00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:26.656 align:middle line:84%
that would occur to
you that it's a...

00:55:26.656 --> 00:55:27.991 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: The most obvious.

00:55:27.991 --> 00:55:29.392 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: That
it's a conspiracy.

00:55:29.392 --> 00:55:33.163 align:middle line:84%
But when you start seeing the
cosmic correspondences then you,

00:55:33.163 --> 00:55:34.898 align:middle line:84%
they might give you
pause to think,

00:55:34.898 --> 00:55:37.233 align:middle line:84%
well this somehow
deeper than that.

00:55:37.233 --> 00:55:39.736 align:middle line:84%
Although, it doesn't
deny there are

00:55:39.736 --> 00:55:41.438 align:middle line:90%
like an illuminati conspiracy.

00:55:41.438 --> 00:55:43.406 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying there isn't.

00:55:43.406 --> 00:55:47.477 align:middle line:84%
But the second type of encoder
would be physical beings

00:55:47.477 --> 00:55:48.745 align:middle line:90%
who weren't born on Earth.

00:55:48.745 --> 00:55:50.580 align:middle line:90%
That is, aliens.

00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:53.616 align:middle line:84%
They could be more
technologically advanced,

00:55:53.616 --> 00:55:54.718 align:middle line:90%
perhaps.

00:55:54.718 --> 00:55:56.820 align:middle line:84%
They might be working
with certain elites

00:55:56.820 --> 00:56:00.724 align:middle line:84%
to encode certain things
for whatever motivation.

00:56:00.724 --> 00:56:04.427 align:middle line:84%
That's another whole
category of encoders.

00:56:04.427 --> 00:56:08.498 align:middle line:84%
The third kind of encoder
would be non-physical beings

00:56:08.498 --> 00:56:10.266 align:middle line:90%
that are influencing you.

00:56:10.266 --> 00:56:14.204 align:middle line:84%
And I think that this is
actually happening all the time,

00:56:14.204 --> 00:56:15.572 align:middle line:90%
in my view.

00:56:15.572 --> 00:56:18.742 align:middle line:84%
That actually, you're
getting guidance quite often

00:56:18.742 --> 00:56:21.311 align:middle line:84%
and you're just not aware of it
because you don't hear voices

00:56:21.311 --> 00:56:23.813 align:middle line:84%
in your head, you don't
see fantastical visions.

00:56:23.813 --> 00:56:27.550 align:middle line:84%
But you might have a hunch
that something is just so

00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:28.985 align:middle line:90%
or you should look at something.

00:56:28.985 --> 00:56:32.655 align:middle line:84%
And I find in my research that
that often is the way it works

00:56:32.655 --> 00:56:34.958 align:middle line:84%
for me personally is
I'll just get a hunch

00:56:34.958 --> 00:56:36.960 align:middle line:84%
that I need to measure
something.

00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:40.964 align:middle line:84%
The fourth kind of encoder
would be expanding the boundary

00:56:40.964 --> 00:56:44.000 align:middle line:84%
of self all the way
out to awareness.

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:49.072 align:middle line:84%
And realizing, that
another possibility is

00:56:49.072 --> 00:56:52.675 align:middle line:84%
that the universe
is in awareness.

00:56:52.675 --> 00:56:55.311 align:middle line:84%
Rather than the regular
possibility

00:56:55.311 --> 00:56:57.947 align:middle line:84%
that we normally think
of as your awareness,

00:56:57.947 --> 00:57:00.550 align:middle line:84%
your consciousness
comes out of your brain.

00:57:00.550 --> 00:57:03.586 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of the
opposite viewpoint,

00:57:03.586 --> 00:57:06.389 align:middle line:84%
the opposite philosophical
viewpoint or opposite.

00:57:06.389 --> 00:57:11.728 align:middle line:84%
The actual reality is that all
of the universe is in awareness.

00:57:11.728 --> 00:57:15.598 align:middle line:84%
Time and space and
matter are in awareness.

00:57:15.598 --> 00:57:21.437 align:middle line:84%
And that the universe
is a work of imagination

00:57:21.437 --> 00:57:26.876 align:middle line:84%
and that you are a fictional
character in that awareness.

00:57:26.876 --> 00:57:29.379 align:middle line:84%
In that, it's not real
because you come and go.

00:57:29.379 --> 00:57:31.681 align:middle line:90%
You will live, be born and die.

00:57:31.681 --> 00:57:33.683 align:middle line:90%
What is eternal is awareness.

00:57:33.683 --> 00:57:37.287 align:middle line:84%
And so it should be no surprise
that we see all of these things,

00:57:37.287 --> 00:57:38.555 align:middle line:90%
these numbers in the world

00:57:38.555 --> 00:57:41.758 align:middle line:84%
because that's the way we
imagined the whole matrix.

00:57:41.758 --> 00:57:43.326 align:middle line:90%
That's the way that it works.

00:57:43.326 --> 00:57:44.727 align:middle line:90%
It works with geometry.

00:57:44.727 --> 00:57:49.999 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in the Quadrivium there
is this concept of the four arts

00:57:49.999 --> 00:57:56.172 align:middle line:84%
of number, music -- number,
geometry, music and astronomy,

00:57:56.172 --> 00:57:59.042 align:middle line:84%
are the four subjects
in the Quadrivium.

00:57:59.042 --> 00:58:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And a more elegant
way of expressing

00:58:00.910 --> 00:58:04.948 align:middle line:84%
that is number in
itself, is math.

00:58:04.948 --> 00:58:07.317 align:middle line:90%
Number is space is geometry.

00:58:07.317 --> 00:58:11.621 align:middle line:84%
Number in time is music, and
number in space and time,

00:58:11.621 --> 00:58:14.324 align:middle line:84%
is actually the manifest
universe.

00:58:14.324 --> 00:58:15.658 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:58:15.658 --> 00:58:19.229 align:middle line:84%
And this, a few years ago I
had been looking for a piece

00:58:19.229 --> 00:58:23.299 align:middle line:84%
of information regarding,
of an esoteric nature

00:58:23.299 --> 00:58:25.168 align:middle line:84%
that I wasn't connecting
with on the outside.

00:58:25.168 --> 00:58:27.403 align:middle line:90%
Having to do with the function

00:58:27.403 --> 00:58:29.005 align:middle line:84%
of what we call the
upper chakras

00:58:29.005 --> 00:58:31.241 align:middle line:84%
that we don't really
acknowledge yet.

00:58:31.241 --> 00:58:34.277 align:middle line:84%
And in this particular
meditation that's exactly what I

00:58:34.277 --> 00:58:35.378 align:middle line:90%
was shown.

00:58:35.378 --> 00:58:37.914 align:middle line:84%
I was shown the various
regions, the chakras

00:58:37.914 --> 00:58:41.251 align:middle line:84%
and their correlation to exact
building blocks you're talking

00:58:41.251 --> 00:58:45.622 align:middle line:84%
about, but added in were
sound, light, and color.

00:58:45.622 --> 00:58:48.591 align:middle line:84%
And that these were all
the intrinsic frequencies,

00:58:48.591 --> 00:58:51.060 align:middle line:84%
with all the mathematical
ones you were talking about,

00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:52.395 align:middle line:90%
of creation.

00:58:52.395 --> 00:58:54.797 align:middle line:84%
And then you can look
at it from many ways

00:58:54.797 --> 00:58:56.866 align:middle line:90%
in terms of what coalesces it.

00:58:56.866 --> 00:58:59.369 align:middle line:90%
But is it possible, into form --

00:58:59.369 --> 00:59:01.804 align:middle line:84%
but is it possible that
throughout history rather

00:59:01.804 --> 00:59:05.942 align:middle line:84%
than a dark conspiracy there
have been individuals that are

00:59:05.942 --> 00:59:09.946 align:middle line:84%
so sensitively tuned
that their own feeling

00:59:09.946 --> 00:59:12.515 align:middle line:84%
and understanding would
automatically gravitate towards

00:59:12.515 --> 00:59:14.817 align:middle line:84%
those ratios when
building great structures?

00:59:14.817 --> 00:59:15.785 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: I think so.

00:59:15.785 --> 00:59:18.054 align:middle line:84%
I think that we know
truth, goodness,

00:59:18.054 --> 00:59:19.789 align:middle line:84%
and beauty when we
experience it.

00:59:19.789 --> 00:59:21.157 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:59:21.157 --> 00:59:23.026 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: And so we have an
innate power of discernment

00:59:23.026 --> 00:59:24.527 align:middle line:84%
that this is right,
this is true,

00:59:24.527 --> 00:59:26.529 align:middle line:90%
this is good, this is beautiful.

00:59:26.529 --> 00:59:29.999 align:middle line:84%
And so that's operative, and
it doesn't require the mind.

00:59:29.999 --> 00:59:35.905 align:middle line:84%
It sort of transcends
and includes the mind.

00:59:35.905 --> 00:59:38.374 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's what's
really happening there.

00:59:38.374 --> 00:59:44.647 align:middle line:84%
Is you can intuitively feel
that coincidences like this.

00:59:44.647 --> 00:59:46.482 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: That's what,
I agree with that.

00:59:46.482 --> 00:59:48.318 align:middle line:90%
We are in such a mental matrix.

00:59:48.318 --> 00:59:50.286 align:middle line:84%
As you said earlier in
your life, you were stuck

00:59:50.286 --> 00:59:53.022 align:middle line:84%
in first realizing I'm not my
body, then you had to discern

00:59:53.022 --> 00:59:54.057 align:middle line:90%
that you're not your mind.

00:59:54.057 --> 00:59:54.924 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: Well then what am I?

00:59:54.924 --> 00:59:56.259 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Then what am I.

00:59:56.259 --> 00:59:57.727 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: Well what it is,
it's a movement from feeling

00:59:57.727 --> 01:00:01.264 align:middle line:84%
like you're something,
somebody to not a thing.

01:00:01.264 --> 01:00:03.866 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a thing, I'm nothing.

01:00:03.866 --> 01:00:05.268 align:middle line:90%
The absolute.

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:08.004 align:middle line:84%
To the final I am
actually everything.

01:00:08.004 --> 01:00:10.039 align:middle line:90%
The universe is in me.

01:00:10.039 --> 01:00:10.773 align:middle line:90%
It's in you, too.

01:00:10.773 --> 01:00:12.842 align:middle line:90%
It's not a solecism.

01:00:12.842 --> 01:00:13.676 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

01:00:13.676 --> 01:00:15.044 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: It's an awareness.

01:00:15.044 --> 01:00:16.579 align:middle line:90%
It's a non-duality.

01:00:16.579 --> 01:00:18.047 align:middle line:90%
Is what I'm advocating here.

01:00:18.047 --> 01:00:23.186 align:middle line:84%
It's this possibility of
the whole universe existing

01:00:23.186 --> 01:00:26.255 align:middle line:84%
in you is one that is
worth contemplating.

01:00:26.255 --> 01:00:27.423 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Absolutely.

01:00:27.423 --> 01:00:30.159 align:middle line:84%
And I agree with you
also that we can feel it.

01:00:30.159 --> 01:00:32.562 align:middle line:84%
We know our whole
body is a sense organ

01:00:32.562 --> 01:00:33.896 align:middle line:90%
and we sense the truth.

01:00:33.896 --> 01:00:35.765 align:middle line:90%
We sense beauty, symmetry,

01:00:35.765 --> 01:00:39.035 align:middle line:84%
and what essentially
enhances consciousness,

01:00:39.035 --> 01:00:40.570 align:middle line:84%
if we pay attention
to those feelings.

01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:42.939 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: You know it by its
fruit, you've had that feeling.

01:00:42.939 --> 01:00:46.075 align:middle line:84%
What comes out of that is
love, beauty, kindness.

01:00:46.075 --> 01:00:47.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So, let's say
the whole architecture

01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:49.812 align:middle line:84%
of the universe is
built out of that.

01:00:49.812 --> 01:00:51.147 align:middle line:90%
>> Onstott: Yes.

01:00:51.147 --> 01:00:52.515 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Thank you so much
for all the work you've done

01:00:52.515 --> 01:00:54.050 align:middle line:90%
and just doing it for us.

01:00:54.050 --> 01:00:56.352 align:middle line:84%
>> Onstott: Thank
you for having me.

01:00:56.352 --> 01:00:57.787 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well we've
only scratched the surface

01:00:57.787 --> 01:01:00.423 align:middle line:84%
as I mentioned a couple of
times in this conversation.

01:01:00.423 --> 01:01:03.793 align:middle line:84%
To see the entire story you can
go to  Secrets in Plain Sight ,

01:01:03.793 --> 01:01:06.195 align:middle line:90%
that's secretsinplainsight.com.

01:01:06.195 --> 01:01:09.365 align:middle line:84%
And that's the whole double
episode that we've referred to.

01:01:09.365 --> 01:01:11.901 align:middle line:84%
You might want to consider
this a course of study.

01:01:11.901 --> 01:01:13.770 align:middle line:84%
It's definitely worth
taking your time

01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:17.173 align:middle line:84%
and contemplating the
implications of the information.

01:01:17.173 --> 01:01:18.374 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
