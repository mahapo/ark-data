who would like to
have cross-validation

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.410 align:middle line:10%
for our practices and
beliefs is exemplified

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.720 align:middle line:10%
in Cynthia Sue Larsen's work.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.640 align:middle line:84%
With a physics background
from UC Berkeley,

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.190 align:middle line:84%
Cynthia is taking solid
principles in physics

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.010 align:middle line:84%
and applying them to moving
beyond time and space

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.120 align:middle line:84%
to create changes in our lives,
even instantaneous changes.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.700 align:middle line:84%
Her work is called
"Quantum Jumping."

Everyone is going to love
this story because A,

00:00:53.965 --> 00:00:56.080 align:middle line:84%
they can see these
little anomalous things

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.450 align:middle line:84%
in their own lives
that have occurred

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.520 align:middle line:84%
and you're giving the
science behind it.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.869 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's what's
wonderful about what you do.

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And also, we're going
to go down the rabbit

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.030 align:middle line:84%
hole in some really intriguing
things a lot of people

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.450 align:middle line:90%
are taking notice of--

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA SUE LARSON: Thank you.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.582 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that
just ain't right.

00:01:10.582 --> 00:01:11.604 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: That's true.

00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:13.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So first,
give us a little bit

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.950 align:middle line:90%
of your own personal background.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, yes, you have
a passion for physics.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.080 align:middle line:90%
It was rigorous study.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.390 align:middle line:84%
But also theology,
let's talk about that.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.560 align:middle line:10%
>>LARSON: Right, I do have
a background in physics,

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.010 align:middle line:10%
and that goes back
to the '80s where I

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.110 align:middle line:10%
got my degree from UC Berkeley.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.990 align:middle line:10%
And subsequent to that,
I went through a number

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.360 align:middle line:10%
of spiritually
transformative experiences.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I
started noticing anomalies

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.110 align:middle line:84%
with reality,
shifting of reality.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And for me, personally,
that was the grand opening

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.150 align:middle line:84%
to a much deeper exploration
of spirit and, as you say,

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.740 align:middle line:90%
theological studies.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Because, for me
personally, when you

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.550 align:middle line:84%
start noticing that there is
a dynamic between our mind,

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.910 align:middle line:84%
our hearts, and what
we observe in reality,

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.700 align:middle line:84%
then it becomes part
of a spiritual practice

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.110 align:middle line:84%
for me to explore that, much
more than let's see how much

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.030 align:middle line:84%
money or power or whatever these
trappings of success might be.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.100 align:middle line:84%
Those are nice, but I
think the main thing

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.150 align:middle line:90%
needs to have meaning.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.820 align:middle line:84%
It needs to be a
matter of spirit.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.420 align:middle line:84%
So my path is very
much a spiritual path.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.930 align:middle line:90%
But it's not a pushy path.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.030 align:middle line:84%
So I don't push any kind
of spirituality on people,

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.280 align:middle line:84%
but instead, prefer
that they look

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.220 align:middle line:84%
within their hearts,
their souls and find

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.050 align:middle line:90%
the path that's right for them.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
why did you decide

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.530 align:middle line:84%
to, instead of just
kind of go with that,

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.730 align:middle line:84%
blend the physics back
in in your writings

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.920 align:middle line:84%
and give a scientific
basis for it?

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.560 align:middle line:84%
What were you trying
to appeal to in people?

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: For me, again,
it's our personal lives,

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.070 align:middle line:90%
our daily lives.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.320 align:middle line:84%
And especially
for people who are

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.960 align:middle line:84%
noticing that
things are changing,

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:56.940 align:middle line:90%
that's where it starts.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.580 align:middle line:84%
It's just noticing that
there are shifts in reality,

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.430 align:middle line:84%
that something might be
different than it used to be.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people will
notice these things

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.990 align:middle line:90%
but dismiss it or discount it.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.040 align:middle line:84%
Like if you lose your keys
or your purse or your coat,

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.630 align:middle line:84%
then you might think
you misplaced it,

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.610 align:middle line:84%
and even though
you're startled to see

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.410 align:middle line:84%
it's in a different
place entirely.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: I was starting to
pay more and more attention

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.300 align:middle line:90%
to these things.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.694 align:middle line:84%
So instead of ignoring it, I
was looking for what kind of--

00:03:24.694 --> 00:03:26.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --validation there
could be for it, which,

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.318 align:middle line:84%
of course, we can turn to kind
of what is now becoming kind

00:03:29.318 --> 00:03:30.790 align:middle line:90%
of classic quantum physics.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:31.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And for anybody watching
the show that wants to know,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.690 align:middle line:84%
hasn't really delved into
it, I have interviews

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:38.980 align:middle line:90%
with Dean Radin and others--

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:39.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Good.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --Stuart
Hameroff and so forth.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that you can
go into the Gaiam library

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.340 align:middle line:84%
and find some of
those interviews.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.230 align:middle line:84%
But for the purposes
of what we're doing,

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.390 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to have
to go too deeply into any

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.110 align:middle line:84%
of the quantum mechanics
of it all-- maybe just

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.230 align:middle line:84%
a basic overview of
what's been discovered

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.510 align:middle line:84%
and how it applies to
these anomalous events

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:59.750 align:middle line:90%
in our everyday lives.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: OK, so the
beginning of quantum physics

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.910 align:middle line:90%
started in around 1900.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.706 align:middle line:84%
So it's over 100
years later now,

00:04:07.706 --> 00:04:09.580 align:middle line:84%
and we might expect that
we would know what's

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.580 align:middle line:90%
going on with quantum physics.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.300 align:middle line:84%
But although we have mathematics
to describe what's happening,

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.250 align:middle line:84%
there's yet no
agreed upon paradigm

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.040 align:middle line:90%
to explain what does it mean.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.950 align:middle line:84%
Do we know-- are there
many worlds superposed

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.480 align:middle line:90%
against one another?

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.250 align:middle line:90%
Are we living in a hologram?

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.250 align:middle line:84%
We don't know which of
the paradigms to choose.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.830 align:middle line:84%
So in my books I
do touch on these--

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.300 align:middle line:90%
describe them a little bit.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.300 align:middle line:84%
So what does this whole quantum
thing mean in the first place?

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.760 align:middle line:84%
That gets into the
idea of a quanta.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.440 align:middle line:84%
It began when scientists wanted
to know what are the smallest

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.210 align:middle line:90%
building blocks of matter.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.430 align:middle line:84%
So of course, if you
remember from childhood,

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.900 align:middle line:84%
you hear about molecules,
and within the molecule

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:51.930 align:middle line:90%
there are atoms.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.030 align:middle line:84%
Get going smaller, eventually
you get to the electron

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.710 align:middle line:90%
or you get to a proton.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And we were told,
when I was growing up,

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.580 align:middle line:84%
that's about as
far as we can go.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.100 align:middle line:84%
But then particle smashers and
accelerators came into being.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.970 align:middle line:84%
So we go a little
farther and find

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.130 align:middle line:90%
more of the inner workings.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.910 align:middle line:84%
But the important
takeaway here is

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.920 align:middle line:84%
that when you go small
enough into the building

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.260 align:middle line:84%
blocks of reality,
you get to a point

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.580 align:middle line:84%
where the particle itself,
it's doing strange things--

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.000 align:middle line:84%
things that are not what
we would consider normal

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.770 align:middle line:90%
by our everyday standards.

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by that
is there can be tunneling.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.750 align:middle line:84%
A quantum particle can
go through a solid--

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:32.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Object.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Dividing.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:34.710 align:middle line:90%
It can go right through it.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.850 align:middle line:84%
It can sometimes be seen
as a quantum particle,

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.861 align:middle line:84%
and it can also teleport
itself to another place

00:05:40.861 --> 00:05:41.860 align:middle line:90%
in another energy state.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it blinks
in and out of existence--

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: That's right.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --from the
viewer's point of view.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And in 1980, this was
observed with a naked eye.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.630 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people say,
well, Cynthia, you

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.340 align:middle line:84%
can't apply these quantum
jumps to our daily lives.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.299 align:middle line:90%
And I say, yes, we can.

00:05:55.299 --> 00:05:57.423 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Those are the
building blocks of reality.

00:05:57.423 --> 00:05:58.890 align:middle line:84%
We're just a bigger
version of it.

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Exactly.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.720 align:middle line:90%
We can.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And so there's
also entanglement,

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.860 align:middle line:84%
which is where you've got
two quantum particles,

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.260 align:middle line:84%
and because they're
entangled with one another,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.380 align:middle line:84%
they move in connection
with each other.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.480 align:middle line:84%
So one is spin
up, one spin down.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.940 align:middle line:84%
You know what's going
on when you know what's

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.160 align:middle line:84%
happening with one of
them, you can easily

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.720 align:middle line:84%
tell what's happening
with the other.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.490 align:middle line:84%
So a great deal
of information can

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:26.070 align:middle line:84%
be contained within a group
of entangled particles.

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Also, I
mean, another area

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.010 align:middle line:84%
of study over the last couple of
decades-- our research has been

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.620 align:middle line:84%
into the notion that perhaps
the whole notion of dark

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.660 align:middle line:84%
matter itself, the
reason they're having

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.870 align:middle line:84%
such difficulty in
identifying with that might be

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.520 align:middle line:84%
is because it actually exists
within a field of consciousness

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.520 align:middle line:84%
as perhaps what is loosely
called spirit, or mind.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And I find that
interesting-- the mind

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.080 align:middle line:84%
that is behind the dark
matter, anti-matter, and matter

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.020 align:middle line:84%
behind the creation
of the physical.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.361 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
you get right back

00:06:59.361 --> 00:07:02.130 align:middle line:84%
to philosophical and even
religious debates on that.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: That's right.

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.390 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of questions and
not too many answers right now.

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:08.760 align:middle line:84%
But what I like to do,
even with the uncertainty

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.070 align:middle line:84%
that we're dealing
with, is to start

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:14.210 align:middle line:84%
bridging the gap between the
very small in our daily lives

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.190 align:middle line:84%
and then the cosmos,
the very large.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
that's very practical.

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.330 align:middle line:90%
I loved the way you did it.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And also, I think if we can
just kind of get the model

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:29.500 align:middle line:84%
in our head, even if we just go
down to the atomic level rather

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:30.300 align:middle line:90%
than the quanta.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.286 align:middle line:84%
People have, at least,
have seen models, well,

00:07:32.286 --> 00:07:33.660 align:middle line:84%
working models--
not that they're

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.930 align:middle line:84%
correct of what
the atom is like--

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.230 align:middle line:84%
and realize that everything
we're looking at is space.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:42.390 align:middle line:84%
There's almost no
matter in anything.

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:45.061 align:middle line:84%
And we're just,
somehow, as you say,

00:07:45.061 --> 00:07:46.560 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a
holographic rendering

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.900 align:middle line:84%
or whatever of reality,
we exist, and we

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.590 align:middle line:84%
have to be bound to these very
same principles they observe

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:55.270 align:middle line:84%
in these colliders, for
example, in the atomic world.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:56.070 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:57.028 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: That's right.

00:07:57.028 --> 00:07:58.950 align:middle line:84%
So some people say
everything is vibration.

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:01.470 align:middle line:84%
Others say everything
is consciousness.

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:04.290 align:middle line:90%
So these are possibly true.

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:06.550 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness does
seem to be primary.

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:09.150 align:middle line:84%
It does seem like the
foundation of everything.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:12.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It does, and also
the famous, now very famous,

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:14.310 align:middle line:84%
old experiments that
observation changes

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:15.670 align:middle line:90%
the outcome of an experiment.

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:16.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Exactly.

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:19.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what about when
we're making these kinds

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.440 align:middle line:84%
of observations in own lives or
others', what's happening all

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.450 align:middle line:90%
the time in this dynamic world.

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:27.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And that, I believe,
is the key to understanding

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:28.380 align:middle line:90%
reality as we know it.

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.747 align:middle line:84%
And when you see a
discontinuous event,

00:08:31.747 --> 00:08:33.330 align:middle line:84%
you see something
that's just shifted.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.030 align:middle line:84%
It could be a spontaneous
remission of disease.

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:37.080 align:middle line:90%
Some people witness that.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.220 align:middle line:84%
They don't know
why that happened.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:42.450 align:middle line:84%
It could be something appearing
or disappearing or transforming

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:43.830 align:middle line:90%
or transporting.

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:47.780 align:middle line:84%
This is the subject of my
previous book "Reality Shifts."

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.400 align:middle line:84%
These kind of things can
happen in our daily lives.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'm asking people
to pay attention--

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:55.260 align:middle line:84%
instead of saying, well, I must
have forgotten that, or wow, I

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.320 align:middle line:84%
can't believe how that
changed-- to be more mindful,

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.380 align:middle line:84%
to be more aware, and more
embracing of the possibility

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.750 align:middle line:90%
that we can get these changes.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:07.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what I'd like to
do in this conversation is talk

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.240 align:middle line:84%
about how this phenomena
shows itself, give

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:15.210 align:middle line:84%
some anecdotal kinds of
examples of that, and then

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:18.900 align:middle line:84%
a little later on, go into the
actual techniques of what you

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.310 align:middle line:84%
do to start working with
it on a personal level

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:23.310 align:middle line:84%
because I think it's
really important to provide

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:25.980 align:middle line:84%
some kind of proofs,
you know, something

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:29.470 align:middle line:84%
relatable when you're talking
about a quantum world.

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:30.270 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:31.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And the thing
is, we're swimming in it.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.020 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of us don't notice
that we're already in it.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:34.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.171 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And so that's
part of the problem

00:09:36.171 --> 00:09:38.520 align:middle line:84%
that people have, getting
their minds wrapped around it.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:39.300 align:middle line:90%
We're already in it.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're already in it.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.510 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the "it" part of it

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:45.060 align:middle line:84%
that you're saying we
have parallel timelines

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.910 align:middle line:84%
and infinite possibilities
that we play out

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.740 align:middle line:90%
by choice all the time.

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:52.630 align:middle line:84%
Let's just start at that
place in the conversation.

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: OK, so
starting there, it's

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.980 align:middle line:84%
good to realize when you
first wake up in the morning,

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:59.850 align:middle line:84%
for example, maybe you
know that you didn't quite

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:02.250 align:middle line:84%
get enough sleep and maybe
you should have gotten more.

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:03.810 align:middle line:90%
You went to bed too late.

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:06.420 align:middle line:84%
But it can make a
difference to tell yourself,

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.480 align:middle line:84%
I got enough sleep, even
if you don't think you did.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.370 align:middle line:84%
And this has been
scientifically proven,

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:14.130 align:middle line:84%
so it's basically just the
power of what you might call

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.090 align:middle line:90%
"will" to make that choice.

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And it can completely
change everything

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:19.755 align:middle line:90%
that happens subsequently.

00:10:19.755 --> 00:10:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't believe
me, try it yourself.

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:24.562 align:middle line:84%
Just try one day where you
wake up and you don't do that.

00:10:24.562 --> 00:10:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And then you can feel like,
wow, I didn't get enough sleep.

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.820 align:middle line:84%
It becomes sort of
an ongoing excuse.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.160 align:middle line:90%
So that can definitely happen.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.900 align:middle line:84%
This is what I mean
by it's subtle.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.820 align:middle line:90%
These are subtle things.

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:37.190 align:middle line:84%
But when I tell you scientists
have been experimenting

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:40.790 align:middle line:84%
with it, they've been looking
at people who intentionally

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:41.960 align:middle line:90%
are not given enough sleep.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.532 align:middle line:84%
And that group is told there
is a control group and then

00:10:45.532 --> 00:10:46.490 align:middle line:90%
the experimental group.

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:47.520 align:middle line:90%
And the control group--

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.855 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it like sleep
lab so they don't really know

00:10:49.855 --> 00:10:51.222 align:middle line:90%
how many hours they've slept?

00:10:51.222 --> 00:10:53.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: So they can track
how many hours the person

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:54.470 align:middle line:90%
has slept.

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:56.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then they'll lie
to the person and say, well,

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:57.500 align:middle line:84%
you got a good
night's sleep, or--

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: The person is lying
to themselves basically.

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:00.800 align:middle line:84%
They're being instructed,
you know, tell

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.410 align:middle line:84%
yourself I'm going to get a good
night's sleep even though it's

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:04.868 align:middle line:84%
going to be
interrupted constantly.

00:11:04.868 --> 00:11:06.530 align:middle line:84%
It's only going to
be four hours long.

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:08.930 align:middle line:84%
It will be just as good
as if it was eight hours

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:11.060 align:middle line:90%
of wonderful, perfect sleep.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:14.420 align:middle line:84%
So this kind of experiment can
prove to people, like, wow,

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:15.390 align:middle line:90%
how does that happen?

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:17.330 align:middle line:84%
How can you just tell
yourself something?

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And I love that experiment
because we can try it at home.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.917 align:middle line:84%
You can see what a
difference it makes.

00:11:22.917 --> 00:11:24.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, in
talking about this,

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:27.770 align:middle line:84%
how does this get into the
notion of parallel timelines?

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:30.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: OK, so the
idea of the multiverse

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:32.930 align:middle line:84%
and parallel timelines
and all these-- I

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:34.930 align:middle line:84%
like to think of a
holographic multiverse,

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:37.550 align:middle line:84%
so just like fingers on your
hand, it's all connected.

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And each one of them could be
a possible parallel reality,

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:41.330 align:middle line:90%
but they're all one.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And so just like pages in a
book or fingers on your hand,

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:47.120 align:middle line:84%
you can feel like, OK,
these are the choices.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.269 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine,
for example, what

00:11:49.269 --> 00:11:50.810 align:middle line:84%
it feels like if
you wake up, and you

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:52.250 align:middle line:90%
didn't have enough sleep.

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:55.910 align:middle line:84%
It could be a cascading effect
of problems throughout the day.

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:58.670 align:middle line:84%
I just keep going back to that
one because it's so practical.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Viewers can try it tonight,
you know, or whatever.

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:02.120 align:middle line:90%
You can try it soon.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.102 align:middle line:90%
See what happens.

00:12:03.102 --> 00:12:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And then if you choose
one where you say, OK, I

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:07.280 align:middle line:84%
did get enough sleep,
then how does that

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.360 align:middle line:90%
affect your entire day?

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.890 align:middle line:90%


00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:13.760 align:middle line:84%
It's the concept that these
parallel realities are already

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.510 align:middle line:84%
out there, and we are the ones
through our consciousness,

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:20.600 align:middle line:84%
our spirit, our free
choice deciding which

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.490 align:middle line:90%
path we're going to be on.

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
free will comes in

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:28.940 align:middle line:84%
is recognizing, even after
you've done something that

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:32.247 align:middle line:84%
seems like a disaster-- maybe
eaten something that should be

00:12:32.247 --> 00:12:34.580 align:middle line:84%
poisonous or that you might
have a bad reaction to-- you

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.350 align:middle line:84%
can instantly tell
yourself I'm fine.

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:38.840 align:middle line:84%
It's the same
thing as the sleep.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm not recommending
people try that one.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:41.810 align:middle line:90%
Stick with the sleep one.

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, don't poison
yourself just as an experiment.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:45.130 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: But if it happens,
a great opportunity.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.010 align:middle line:90%
Tell yourself, I'm fine.

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:50.720 align:middle line:90%
What I drank or ate was fine.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to be affected.

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.360 align:middle line:90%
Everything's fine.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.680 align:middle line:90%
Really believe it.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And this is where people who
are more easily hypnotized

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.020 align:middle line:90%
have an advantage.

00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:58.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: People who meditate
more have an advantage.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:01.550 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: People who
are rationalists?

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.120 align:middle line:90%
Difficult?

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: It's harder.

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:08.210 align:middle line:84%
So it can be harder, but I
don't think it's impossible.

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:10.550 align:middle line:84%
I think anybody can
learn to do this,

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:14.446 align:middle line:84%
to make that jump to recognize
all these things are out there.

00:13:14.446 --> 00:13:16.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's
going from the notion

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:18.560 align:middle line:84%
that it's not just a
possibility, that it's

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.330 align:middle line:90%
a path that already exists.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.970 align:middle line:90%
You simply choose that path.

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:25.907 align:middle line:84%
So possibility is almost
an incorrect word then?

00:13:25.907 --> 00:13:26.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: I like the word.

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:29.160 align:middle line:84%
We have a problem with the
language right now, and--

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:29.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
I can understand.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.423 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: It's all tied up in--
we don't even have the quantum

00:13:32.423 --> 00:13:35.440 align:middle line:84%
paradigm yet, so there's
no agreed upon language,

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.440 align:middle line:90%
unfortunately.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.920 align:middle line:84%
I think "possibility" is a
great word because it basically

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.700 align:middle line:84%
is showing that all these
possible realities are there

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:43.500 align:middle line:90%
already.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:44.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They exist already.

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: In the
realm of possibility.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Which is very
similar to the superposed state

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:52.182 align:middle line:84%
of a quantum particle, where it
could be one thing or another.

00:13:52.182 --> 00:13:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And so you're just saying,
OK, all these things

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.630 align:middle line:90%
are equally, possibly true.

00:13:56.630 --> 00:14:00.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what you're
doing with your particular set

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.720 align:middle line:84%
of protocols, you
know, this process,

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:05.390 align:middle line:84%
is that you're
saying generally we

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:10.010 align:middle line:90%
see change as it's tied to time.

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:13.760 align:middle line:84%
So change is generally
gradual, sometimes

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:18.740 align:middle line:84%
can be excruciatingly slow
because we believe that change

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:20.701 align:middle line:90%
is tied to time, right?

00:14:20.701 --> 00:14:22.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: I think
that's a big part of it.

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:23.908 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
and you're saying,

00:14:23.908 --> 00:14:25.580 align:middle line:84%
no, it's not tied
to time at all.

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:27.370 align:middle line:90%
And talk about that for a bit.

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:32.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: OK, well, time and
space do generally go together,

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:36.222 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes there can be
anomalies between the two.

00:14:36.222 --> 00:14:38.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know where
to start with this one.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:39.638 align:middle line:84%
Do you have something
in mind or--?

00:14:39.638 --> 00:14:41.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, to just
help people understand

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:46.085 align:middle line:84%
that it's not tied to time,
and maybe give some examples

00:14:46.085 --> 00:14:47.960 align:middle line:84%
and what you talk about
in your book in terms

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.670 align:middle line:90%
of instantaneous change.

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:52.635 align:middle line:84%
And I'll share a couple
of examples myself.

00:14:52.635 --> 00:14:53.435 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:14:53.435 --> 00:14:54.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
this is important.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.405 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: It's very important.

00:14:55.405 --> 00:14:57.613 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it's
breaking paradigmatic thinking

00:14:57.613 --> 00:14:58.689 align:middle line:90%
on a really basic level.

00:14:58.689 --> 00:15:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: In my book
"Quantum Jumps",

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:02.090 align:middle line:84%
I share an experience
that my friend went

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:03.410 align:middle line:90%
through when she was camping.

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And she was jumping
from boulder to boulder

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:08.700 align:middle line:90%
in an outdoor environment.

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.310 align:middle line:90%
She'd had a few drinks, I think.

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:11.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure, but I think so.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In that reality, she'd
chosen to have a few too many.

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:15.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:17.960 align:middle line:84%
So she's jumping from
boulder to boulder

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.850 align:middle line:84%
and unfortunately
made a misstep.

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:22.520 align:middle line:84%
So she broke one
of her legs, which

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.120 align:middle line:84%
meant the trip was pretty
much stopped right there.

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.035 align:middle line:84%
She had to go home and
had to see a doctor.

00:15:28.035 --> 00:15:29.410 align:middle line:84%
So in the book
"Quantum Jumps", I

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:30.784 align:middle line:84%
describe what
happens next, which

00:15:30.784 --> 00:15:35.050 align:middle line:84%
is quite remarkable because
she saw doctors-- some of them

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:38.870 align:middle line:84%
were trainee's, students who
were learning to be doctors.

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.300 align:middle line:84%
But in any case,
they took x-rays.

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:44.050 align:middle line:84%
They got photographs that showed
this is a definite broken leg

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:47.710 align:middle line:84%
and sent her home to
just get some rest, which

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:48.850 align:middle line:90%
is where she phoned me.

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:50.842 align:middle line:84%
And she called and
said, oh my gosh,

00:15:50.842 --> 00:15:53.050 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe what just
happened and described what

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:53.850 align:middle line:90%
the events.

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And what I told her was--
because she had earlier seen

00:15:56.830 --> 00:16:00.940 align:middle line:84%
me put my hand over an
injury on my own body,

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:04.750 align:middle line:84%
and it had been bleeding but
then the blood went away.

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:06.970 align:middle line:84%
So I hadn't meant
to demonstrate.

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:10.870 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to be sneaky,
but she had seen me do it.

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:14.350 align:middle line:84%
So I said, remember that when
we had lunch and you saw that.

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:15.170 align:middle line:90%
And she said, yes.

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:17.830 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you don't
have to believe this.

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:19.330 align:middle line:84%
It's enough that I
believe it, but I

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:21.670 align:middle line:84%
believe it's possible
for your broken leg

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:24.940 align:middle line:84%
to heal instantly
or never really

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.200 align:middle line:90%
have actually been broken.

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.240 align:middle line:84%
You know, we can do that
right now if you want.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.580 align:middle line:84%
She said, oh, yes, because
I'm starting a new job,

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.930 align:middle line:84%
and I don't even have
any vacation time,

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:35.170 align:middle line:84%
let alone this is a
terrible way to start.

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:36.460 align:middle line:90%
This is terrible.

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:37.530 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK, let's do it.

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:41.470 align:middle line:84%
So we just, on the phone,
quickly went through a change

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:44.770 align:middle line:84%
in state of mind, just getting
into a blissful state of being,

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:46.930 align:middle line:84%
feeling love,
really getting into,

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:50.500 align:middle line:84%
if you know sort of a theta
wave state, which feels great.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.030 align:middle line:84%
If you don't know
what that is, it's

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:55.030 align:middle line:84%
like when you're falling asleep
or waking up and just feeling

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:56.200 align:middle line:90%
blissed out.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.170 align:middle line:84%
Then during that session
on the phone, she said,

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:00.920 align:middle line:90%
I feel itching inside my leg.

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.610 align:middle line:84%
I said, that's good
because that usually

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:05.200 align:middle line:90%
means things are healing.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.069 align:middle line:84%
So the next time she
went into the hospital

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:12.400 align:middle line:84%
they examined her leg, and long
story short, her leg was not

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.470 align:middle line:84%
broken at all, no
break whatsoever.

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:17.980 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
example of something

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.349 align:middle line:84%
you can do that
seems to have changed

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:21.964 align:middle line:90%
what happened previously.

00:17:21.964 --> 00:17:23.589 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
essentially jumping

00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:26.650 align:middle line:84%
on the timeline or possibility
where the leg was never

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:27.819 align:middle line:90%
broken to begin with.

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:29.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: That's one
way to look at it.

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And was
that the suggestion

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:32.120 align:middle line:84%
that you gave when you
were talking with her?

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: The suggestion was
would you like it to be healed?

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Like, I did a complete-- I
went from a gash in my arm

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:40.727 align:middle line:84%
to no blood at all--
no wound, no injury.

00:17:40.727 --> 00:17:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And I said, why don't we
just do that for your leg

00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:44.230 align:middle line:90%
so there's no break?

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:45.370 align:middle line:90%
And she said fine.

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:47.770 align:middle line:84%
But then it became difficult
because she had taken,

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:50.114 align:middle line:84%
at that point, a day or two
off work of the new job.

00:17:50.114 --> 00:17:52.030 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know why she
was getting treatment

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:53.620 align:middle line:84%
for a condition
that didn't exist.

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:54.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Didn't exist, yeah.

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: But that was a much
easier problem to deal with.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:56.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Than a broken leg.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:57.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Than a broken leg.

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:58.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Truly.

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:01.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, does this
work retroactively,

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.720 align:middle line:84%
say, on something that
happened long ago?

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Sometimes
I've heard from people

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:10.150 align:middle line:84%
who have had success with
that, and it is possible.

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:12.599 align:middle line:84%
And for example,
lost items can return

00:18:12.599 --> 00:18:14.640 align:middle line:84%
to you that might have
been lost a long time ago.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:16.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And it's like
they've never been gone at all.

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:18.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about
healing though?

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:20.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Healing, I believe
that's possible as well.

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:22.780 align:middle line:84%
It seems like there's
definitely a kind

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:25.540 align:middle line:84%
of a handshake between
the future and the past.

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, and it's really
unpredictable as how that's

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:30.850 align:middle line:90%
going to play out, right?

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:32.122 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Well, it can be.

00:18:32.122 --> 00:18:33.580 align:middle line:84%
When you think of
the entanglements

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.650 align:middle line:84%
and think of all the
connections we have to one

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:38.650 align:middle line:84%
another, to this
consensus reality, then

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:40.990 align:middle line:84%
it really matters who
your core group is,

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:43.540 align:middle line:84%
and the people
who really believe

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:46.210 align:middle line:84%
that things can be as good as
they can get and really wish

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:47.210 align:middle line:90%
that for you.

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:49.114 align:middle line:84%
This is where it's
that spiritual journey.

00:18:49.114 --> 00:18:50.530 align:middle line:84%
Rather than me
first and I'm going

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:53.020 align:middle line:84%
to claw my way to the
top, much better if it's

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:54.550 align:middle line:90%
a win-win attitude.

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.430 align:middle line:90%
And and if you have a group of--

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:57.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And support,
mutual support.

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.308 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Yes, if you have
an inner circle of friends

00:18:59.308 --> 00:19:01.450 align:middle line:84%
who love you, who
genuinely care for you, who

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:03.910 align:middle line:84%
want the best for you,
makes a huge difference.

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:04.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just thinking more
on maybe consciousness

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:11.460 align:middle line:84%
level in terms of, for
example, something that's

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:14.290 align:middle line:84%
happened long-- because
everybody listening or watching

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:17.110 align:middle line:84%
can think, jeez, I wonder if I
could finally heal that thing.

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:17.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes, yes.

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:22.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But, that thing as
opposed to a newly broken leg,

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:23.710 align:middle line:84%
there's not much
attached to that yet.

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:25.870 align:middle line:84%
There's not much of a story
that's been built around it.

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:26.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Good point.

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:28.493 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where the thing
that you want to get rid

00:19:28.493 --> 00:19:32.350 align:middle line:84%
of that's been around forever
may have a decade or two

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:33.940 align:middle line:90%
decades of stories--

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:35.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Emotional
stuff piled on top.

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:38.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --re-entrenched
that time line.

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.625 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: It's still
not impossible.

00:19:39.625 --> 00:19:42.250 align:middle line:84%
It's still not
impossible, I believe,

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:44.590 align:middle line:84%
because it's just a
matter of shaking loose

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:49.960 align:middle line:84%
from all of that accumulation
of belief that this is a thing

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.840 align:middle line:84%
and I'm stuck with
it, whatever that is.

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:52.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:55.467 align:middle line:84%
No, yeah, I find
that fascinating.

00:19:55.467 --> 00:19:57.550 align:middle line:84%
I was going to say there
are a couple of anecdotes

00:19:57.550 --> 00:19:58.350 align:middle line:90%
that I'd toss in.

00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And one of them was a man I
know whom I've interviewed

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:03.640 align:middle line:90%
a few times as well.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:06.067 align:middle line:84%
It taught me this
particular-- he just

00:20:06.067 --> 00:20:07.900 align:middle line:84%
got this head, you know,
because he's always

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:10.600 align:middle line:84%
listening to his guidance that
he needed to share with me

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.150 align:middle line:84%
right away, this particular
form of healing that's

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:14.090 align:middle line:90%
instantaneous, right?

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:14.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yeah.

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:17.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I thought,
sure, I'd be happy to learn.

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And I got this urgency--
I need to learn it now.

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:21.610 align:middle line:90%
It was two days later.

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:23.009 align:middle line:90%
I need to learn it now.

00:20:23.009 --> 00:20:24.050 align:middle line:90%
And he said come on over.

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And he showed me nothing but
a paragraph on a paper that

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:29.460 align:middle line:90%
was the protocol.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And the next day, a very,
very close friend of mine

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.900 align:middle line:84%
called me and was in the
middle of having a stroke.

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And I found that on repeated
occasions, by applying this,

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:44.040 align:middle line:84%
not only did the stroke go way,
everything reversed itself.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.840 align:middle line:84%
There weren't even
blood markers on it

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:49.920 align:middle line:84%
once, you know, she was in
the hospital-- to the point

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.730 align:middle line:84%
where it's, again, are
you making this up?

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Did something really
happen to you?

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:56.672 align:middle line:84%
And her son said, yeah,
I just picked her up.

00:20:56.672 --> 00:20:57.630 align:middle line:90%
Her leg wasn't working.

00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:58.722 align:middle line:90%
Her speech was slurred.

00:20:58.722 --> 00:21:00.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: There
was no trace of it.

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:02.096 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There was no
trace, no trace at all.

00:21:02.096 --> 00:21:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And this has happened with
a few different people--

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:07.650 align:middle line:84%
usually something that dramatic
and in the moment where

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:09.100 align:middle line:90%
there's no story at all yet.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:09.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:13.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, and
so I've seen first hand

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:16.390 align:middle line:84%
how it jumps into a timeline
where it never even happened.

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:17.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Exactly.

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:18.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because there
should be blood markers--

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:19.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:20.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --if
you've had a stroke.

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:21.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right, there should.

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:22.440 align:middle line:90%
Or you'd expect them.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:25.100 align:middle line:84%
But we're telling people you
don't need to expect that.

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:26.865 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, no,
you don't need to.

00:21:26.865 --> 00:21:28.730 align:middle line:84%
You know what's
interesting, I want

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:30.980 align:middle line:84%
to get into a couple
of-- we're going

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:34.050 align:middle line:84%
to go down a really fun, juicy
rabbit hole in a minute, OK?

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:39.620 align:middle line:84%
But before that I wanted to just
point out that it's believed--

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:42.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, certain people I've
interviewed who certainly

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:46.050 align:middle line:84%
shared this information--
that the government, the more

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:49.310 align:middle line:84%
shadowy aspects of the
government, are fully aware

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:50.110 align:middle line:90%
of this.

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And they're fully aware of
this ability to jump timelines.

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And even blink a person
in and out of reality

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:01.470 align:middle line:84%
just like happens
with particles, right?

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:02.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:05.239 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I mean, are
you aware of some of this?

00:22:05.239 --> 00:22:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: I'm aware
that that must be true.

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And when I look for research
articles to write my books,

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:13.200 align:middle line:84%
I notice certain kinds of
government funding being

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.870 align:middle line:90%
recognized on the article.

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:17.229 align:middle line:84%
And then when it
gets really juicy,

00:22:17.229 --> 00:22:18.270 align:middle line:90%
you don't see it anymore.

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You start seeing
DOD, DARPA, and beyond.

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:22.357 align:middle line:84%
And then you wonder,
this is interesting.

00:22:22.357 --> 00:22:23.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And then
it vanishes, right?

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How's
that being applied?

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:26.520 align:middle line:90%
The money's following that.

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Yes, they
absolutely know,

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:32.310 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to rely upon
this exact kind of information

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:35.580 align:middle line:84%
with artificial intelligence
and quantum computers.

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:38.842 align:middle line:84%
So things that
we're talking about,

00:22:38.842 --> 00:22:40.800 align:middle line:84%
to get the kind of effects
we're talking about,

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.650 align:middle line:84%
will be part of artificial
intelligence and quantum

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:44.560 align:middle line:90%
computing.

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.680 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that this
information should

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.000 align:middle line:90%
be available to everyone.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.050 align:middle line:90%
That's why I'm grateful--

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:49.925 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:22:49.925 --> 00:22:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: I'm so glad Elon
Musk started the OpenAI

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:56.300 align:middle line:84%
project that he announced
just recently this last year.

00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:59.100 align:middle line:84%
That's excellent
because this is not

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:02.740 align:middle line:84%
something that should belong to
a government or a corporation.

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:03.680 align:middle line:90%
It's too dangerous.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
the information

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:09.990 align:middle line:84%
is being sequestered for
things like military advantage,

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:14.910 align:middle line:84%
you know, strategic control
over resources, and so forth.

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:16.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:18.960 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm talking
about specifically

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:22.620 align:middle line:84%
is things where devices
and artificial intelligence

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:25.617 align:middle line:84%
can use things like
the quantum Zeno effect

00:23:25.617 --> 00:23:27.450 align:middle line:84%
to you just keep check,
check, check, check,

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:31.110 align:middle line:84%
checking like you're OCD
to get the answer you want,

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:33.510 align:middle line:84%
and you can kind
of lock a reality,

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:35.220 align:middle line:90%
like a timeline in place.

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And you can use EPR steering to
affect someone's consciousness

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:39.789 align:middle line:90%
outside of your own.

00:23:39.789 --> 00:23:41.580 align:middle line:84%
These are the things
I'm talking about that

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:43.190 align:middle line:90%
should be public domain.

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:45.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So Elon Musk
is trying to take it

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.850 align:middle line:90%
more into public domain?

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:50.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: He is responding
to the same concern

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:53.440 align:middle line:84%
that Stephen Hawking and
Bill Gates have voiced--

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:56.880 align:middle line:84%
that artificial
intelligence is, perhaps,

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.580 align:middle line:84%
our biggest threat to humanity,
much more than anything

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:00.880 align:middle line:90%
we've ever seen.

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:02.670 align:middle line:10%
And these are
gentlemen who should

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:05.370 align:middle line:10%
know the difference
between something that's

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:06.930 align:middle line:10%
just, ah, forget about it.

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:11.490 align:middle line:84%
You're blowing up-- making a
mountain out of a mole hill.

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:14.790 align:middle line:84%
But no, they're accurately
assessing the situation.

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:16.984 align:middle line:84%
These are experts
in their fields,

00:24:16.984 --> 00:24:18.150 align:middle line:90%
and I would agree with them.

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And so I think by opening
it up to let people

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:24.900 align:middle line:84%
know what's out there, yes,
there's a risk of terrorism,

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:29.100 align:middle line:84%
but I think I believe in the
inner good of all people.

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And I think when we get
back to that spiritual basis

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:34.590 align:middle line:84%
and it's not about
consumerism, it's not

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:38.490 align:middle line:84%
about one country
has to be the 1%

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:40.410 align:middle line:90%
and everyone else has to suffer.

00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:42.690 align:middle line:84%
This is where it
becomes spiritual again.

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:44.300 align:middle line:90%
We need to care for one another.

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:47.310 align:middle line:84%
It needs to be bigger
than any country,

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:51.030 align:middle line:90%
any government, any business.

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I agree with you
because the only conversations

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:57.090 align:middle line:84%
I've had around it have all
been for military advantage

00:24:57.090 --> 00:25:00.750 align:middle line:84%
and economic advantage-- jumping
timelines, placing people

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:03.980 align:middle line:84%
in future realities, bringing
back-- In one case of Andrew

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:06.990 align:middle line:84%
Basiago-- and I know he's a
controversial figure-- but when

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:11.400 align:middle line:84%
I sat with him, I certainly
got that he has either

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.940 align:middle line:84%
had these experiences or
in an alternate reality

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:17.340 align:middle line:84%
he's had these
experiences for sure.

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And talking about how in these
programs-- a lot of them out

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:23.980 align:middle line:84%
of New Mexico and
such, some of them out

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:27.340 align:middle line:84%
of southern California, a
place on Sepulveda Boulevard--

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.500 align:middle line:84%
they take these candidates,
these people that

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:32.290 align:middle line:84%
have been groomed for this,
and they jump them in time,

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:37.810 align:middle line:84%
gather article headlines
in newspapers and such,

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:39.790 align:middle line:84%
and bring them back
into this reality

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:44.140 align:middle line:84%
to see how something played out
10 years hence, for example,

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:48.250 align:middle line:84%
or five years or three months,
what is being reflected back

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:49.840 align:middle line:84%
via the media so
they can see how

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.330 align:middle line:84%
a particular strategy that
they're going to implement

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:53.950 align:middle line:84%
did or didn't work
and then adjust

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:55.690 align:middle line:90%
the strategy before the effect.

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:58.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: What I'd rather do
is wake people up so that we

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:02.450 align:middle line:84%
the people around the world,
every country, every nation,

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:03.860 align:middle line:90%
every religious group--

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:04.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:05.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: --basically
understands

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:08.470 align:middle line:84%
that we together are wishing
for the best for all concerned.

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:10.050 align:middle line:84%
To me, that's the
way out of this.

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:10.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I totally agree.

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:12.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Everything else
is going to be a dead end.

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:13.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And the power of that many
people having an agreed upon

00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:23.350 align:middle line:84%
outcome can trump even the
most sophisticated technology

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:25.180 align:middle line:84%
that's been sequestered
away in the dark.

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:26.415 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Absolutely.

00:26:26.415 --> 00:26:28.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, I think
that's, on a large scale,

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:30.870 align:middle line:84%
what's in it for us
as a civilization.

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:32.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And what it
requires individually

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:37.060 align:middle line:84%
is that each one of us has
to give up our own pet things

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:38.065 align:middle line:90%
that we love.

00:26:38.065 --> 00:26:38.865 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:38.865 --> 00:26:39.910 align:middle line:90%
And like to bitch about.

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:40.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And like
to bitch about.

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:42.550 align:middle line:84%
We have to give
up our complaints.

00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:45.280 align:middle line:84%
We need to give up what we
feel, like, downtrodden, how

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:48.215 align:middle line:84%
we've been abused, how we've
been subjected to things.

00:26:48.215 --> 00:26:49.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:51.850 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's go back, besides
the military implications,

00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:55.260 align:middle line:84%
this is kind of a fun
one, interesting one.

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:58.400 align:middle line:84%
You wrote about a woman named
Linda in the pub in London.

00:26:58.400 --> 00:26:59.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Oh yes.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
sign on the doors,

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:03.340 align:middle line:84%
and tell us about her
experience and then

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:05.717 align:middle line:84%
what happened when she went
back and then the revelation.

00:27:05.717 --> 00:27:07.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: I'm trying
to remember that.

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:09.010 align:middle line:90%
I get thousands of stories.

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:11.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, I can give you
a-- I'll jog your memory.

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:13.870 align:middle line:84%
She was sitting in front of
a particular pub in London,

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:15.400 align:middle line:90%
and it had a screaming red door.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And she thought, wait, this is
a historical preservation area.

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:20.830 align:middle line:84%
That is totally out of
sync with what should be

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:21.850 align:middle line:90%
allowed in this neighborhood.

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:23.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Which is
why she noticed it.

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:23.605 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why she noticed it.

00:27:23.605 --> 00:27:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Otherwise it
wouldn't have stood out.

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And she
really examined it.

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:27.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And then when she came
back, having thought like,

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.880 align:middle line:84%
wow, that was just
all wrong, then

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:33.819 align:middle line:84%
it's as if the colors had
always been this other color.

00:27:33.819 --> 00:27:35.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They were the
original historical color

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:36.610 align:middle line:90%
which was green.

00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:37.615 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: So she
went in and looked--

00:27:37.615 --> 00:27:37.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Muted.

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And talked to the
proprietor, thinking, wow,

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.040 align:middle line:84%
they must have changed
it back so quickly.

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.545 align:middle line:84%
How did they even
do that so fast?

00:27:43.545 --> 00:27:44.920 align:middle line:84%
Because it wasn't
that much time.

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:45.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Cause it looked worn.

00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:45.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yeah.

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:46.760 align:middle line:90%
It looked old.

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:48.220 align:middle line:90%
It didn't look fresh.

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:51.290 align:middle line:84%
She spoke to them, and they
had not changed anything.

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:53.335 align:middle line:84%
They hadn't painted
it recently so--

00:27:53.335 --> 00:27:56.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they said
it had a different name.

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:57.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:58.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The pub had a
different name than the week

00:27:58.390 --> 00:27:59.920 align:middle line:90%
or so before with the red door.

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:00.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:01.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it was
the same location.

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:02.230 align:middle line:90%
It was the same pub.

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:02.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: It's the same spot.

00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:04.060 align:middle line:90%
The same location.

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:09.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And she said, how
long has the pub had this name?

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:12.180 align:middle line:90%
And he said, 350 years.

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:13.904 align:middle line:90%
And she's-- go ahead.

00:28:13.904 --> 00:28:15.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Well,
this is an example

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.403 align:middle line:84%
of this when you talk about
timelines, if you want

00:28:17.403 --> 00:28:20.140 align:middle line:84%
to call it space timelines,
possible reality lines,

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:23.410 align:middle line:84%
then she obviously jumped to
one which was very similar.

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:25.960 align:middle line:84%
She didn't notice other
differences in that reality

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.424 align:middle line:90%
aside from the pub changing.

00:28:27.424 --> 00:28:29.590 align:middle line:84%
But the way it changed, it
looked like it had always

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:30.390 align:middle line:90%
been that way.

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen
similar things also.

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.394 align:middle line:84%
So I believe her
story because it's

00:28:34.394 --> 00:28:36.310 align:middle line:84%
so similar to things
that have happened to me.

00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:37.934 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've had
that experience too.

00:28:37.934 --> 00:28:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:41.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what is
actually happening?

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:45.160 align:middle line:84%
Why would there have
been a timeline where

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.840 align:middle line:84%
they change the color of
the door, which seemed

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:51.290 align:middle line:90%
such an insignificant thing.

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:55.760 align:middle line:84%
There has to be thought,
individually or collectively,

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:59.240 align:middle line:84%
that would create that
alternate timeline, right?

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:02.230 align:middle line:84%
So could it be simply the fancy
of the owner or previous owner

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:04.730 align:middle line:84%
saying, you know, I think we'll
paint that door red one day,

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:05.930 align:middle line:90%
and I'd like to change the name.

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:07.305 align:middle line:84%
And they debate
it, and boom, you

00:29:07.305 --> 00:29:09.750 align:middle line:84%
have now a potential
alternate timeline that's

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:11.575 align:middle line:90%
been popped into existence.

00:29:11.575 --> 00:29:13.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Well, when you
look at the traveler, that

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:14.900 align:middle line:90%
would be her consciousness.

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:17.510 align:middle line:84%
So her consciousness
made that jump.

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:21.320 align:middle line:84%
So she's the one who had that
thought-- this color is really

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:22.890 align:middle line:90%
off.

00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:24.830 align:middle line:84%
It can be just such
a simple thought

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:27.800 align:middle line:84%
when you're running enough
energy, you meditate enough,

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.350 align:middle line:84%
and you're in that
lucid state of living

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:32.780 align:middle line:84%
that you can have these
kind of experiences

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:35.660 align:middle line:84%
because the higher vibration
you get, the more likely

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:37.190 align:middle line:84%
it is that you're
going to notice

00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:38.570 align:middle line:90%
that a simple random thought--

00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So she created
the alternate timeline

00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:43.520 align:middle line:84%
because she was objecting to the
color of the original door she

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:44.320 align:middle line:90%
saw?

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: That's what I would
guess that that would be true.

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:49.300 align:middle line:84%
When I get these
reports from people

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:52.070 align:middle line:84%
and they share their
anecdotal evidence

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:54.110 align:middle line:84%
of some sort of
reality shift, I like

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:57.019 align:middle line:84%
to find out what were they
thinking at that time.

00:29:57.019 --> 00:29:58.310 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes there's a connection.

00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:00.420 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it seems random.

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:01.970 align:middle line:84%
But it later prompts
a whole series

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:04.792 align:middle line:84%
of events that wouldn't
have happened otherwise.

00:30:04.792 --> 00:30:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It certainly
prompts the notion

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:08.330 align:middle line:84%
that there is some
component of this being

00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:11.900 align:middle line:84%
a holographic reality,
and we're somehow--

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:15.890 align:middle line:84%
we're the orchestrator
of it, the creator of it.

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:18.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: We can be active
operators within it.

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:20.930 align:middle line:84%
We can be agents of
change when we recognize

00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:24.260 align:middle line:84%
that we have that ability
and keep ourselves powered up

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:26.570 align:middle line:84%
by eating good food
and getting enough rest

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:29.030 align:middle line:84%
and really understanding
it's the consciousness that

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:30.930 align:middle line:90%
can make the change.

00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:33.797 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I mean,
I find that fascinating.

00:30:33.797 --> 00:30:34.880 align:middle line:90%
Really beyond fascinating.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.830 align:middle line:84%
It's mind-boggling
because that would

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:40.130 align:middle line:84%
mean there are billions
of potential realities

00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:43.042 align:middle line:84%
at any given time that are
available to all of us.

00:30:43.042 --> 00:30:44.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: That's right.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.541 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
only thing standing

00:30:45.541 --> 00:30:47.162 align:middle line:84%
in our way of
those participating

00:30:47.162 --> 00:30:48.620 align:middle line:84%
in one of those
alternate timelines

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:49.880 align:middle line:90%
is our belief systems.

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:52.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And it runs totally
counter to advertising

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:55.100 align:middle line:84%
and what you see when they
push products and things

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:56.720 align:middle line:90%
because it's very different.

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:57.761 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very different.

00:30:57.761 --> 00:31:03.350 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's talk about
the Mandela Effect

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:09.710 align:middle line:84%
and also other living, dead,
dead, living, Schrodinger's cat

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:14.040 align:middle line:84%
realities and what has
come to your awareness,

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:16.940 align:middle line:84%
other people's awareness, what
is more well-known in terms

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:18.380 align:middle line:90%
of media and such.

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And let's go down
that rabbit hole.

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:22.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: OK, this
Mandela Effect

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:24.620 align:middle line:84%
is getting a lot
of media attention

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:27.500 align:middle line:84%
just in the last few
years, and it's taking off

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:30.680 align:middle line:90%
in 2015 especially, 2016.

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:35.500 align:middle line:84%
Because what's happening is
a lot of people back in 2010

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:40.250 align:middle line:84%
were talking about how they had
noticed that Nelson Mandela had

00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:45.200 align:middle line:84%
been-- he was alive at that
time in 2010, but most of them

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:47.810 align:middle line:84%
remembered that he
had died in the 1980s

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:50.540 align:middle line:84%
at some point, when
he was incarcerated.

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And this is a
discussion that came

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:55.010 align:middle line:84%
to the attention of a
blogger named Fiona Broome.

00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And then she made a
public blog post about it

00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:02.210 align:middle line:84%
and started a website about it,
which is how the term Mandela

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:04.580 align:middle line:90%
Effect was coined.

00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:08.450 align:middle line:84%
This exact same phenomenon
had been reported by me

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:11.670 align:middle line:84%
in my book "Reality
Shifts" in 1999

00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:13.940 align:middle line:84%
where I was talking
about Larry Hagman.

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:17.120 align:middle line:84%
Because at the time the book
was published, he was alive,

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:19.700 align:middle line:90%
but he had died previously.

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people,
myself included,

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.280 align:middle line:90%
remember that he had died.

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:26.910 align:middle line:84%
A surgery hadn't worked out
properly, and he'd passed away.

00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:28.800 align:middle line:90%
He was the actor from "Dallas."

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:30.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And I got fascinated
by this whole phenomenon.

00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:36.620 align:middle line:84%
I'd started doing
surveys with subscribers

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:39.650 align:middle line:84%
to my "RealityShifters"
newsletter

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:43.730 align:middle line:84%
and asked them which people
they remembered having died

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:45.170 align:middle line:90%
and then were alive again.

00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And we got lots of people
mentioned including

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:50.690 align:middle line:84%
Captain Kangaroo
from TV-- if you

00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:53.810 align:middle line:84%
remember that
children's character--

00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:55.730 align:middle line:84%
Larry Hagman, a
lot of people also

00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:57.530 align:middle line:84%
remembered Jane
Goodall who I hope

00:32:57.530 --> 00:32:59.187 align:middle line:90%
is still alive as we broadcast.

00:32:59.187 --> 00:33:00.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's
talk about that.

00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:02.311 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
what happened there.

00:33:02.311 --> 00:33:04.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: OK, so
with Jane Goodall,

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:08.390 align:middle line:84%
I remember-- and a lot of people
remember and saw books and TV

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:11.030 align:middle line:84%
announcements, front
page news coverage--

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:15.689 align:middle line:84%
that she had died right after,
if you remember, Dian Fossey

00:33:15.689 --> 00:33:16.855 align:middle line:90%
with "Gorillas in the Mist."

00:33:16.855 --> 00:33:17.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:18.713 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Just boom, boom.

00:33:18.713 --> 00:33:21.260 align:middle line:84%
Within about a one- or
two-month period, both of them

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:23.750 align:middle line:90%
had died violent deaths.

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:26.940 align:middle line:90%
And that got my attention.

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:29.250 align:middle line:90%
And it also made me feel angry.

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:31.730 align:middle line:84%
I felt like, who is killing
the world's great primate

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:33.230 align:middle line:90%
researchers?

00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:34.040 align:middle line:90%
It really upset me.

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:35.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which gets into
conspiracy theory then.

00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:37.638 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Yeah, I was
concerned about it.

00:33:37.638 --> 00:33:40.460 align:middle line:84%
But then I didn't think a lot
more about it for a long time.

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And then sometime,
I don't know when,

00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:45.530 align:middle line:84%
maybe the '90s or so, I
noticed, wow, she's alive again.

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:46.580 align:middle line:90%
Thank goodness.

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:48.694 align:middle line:90%
I'm so grateful.

00:33:48.694 --> 00:33:50.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Most people
wouldn't accept it

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.110 align:middle line:84%
that way to say, oh,
she's alive again.

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:52.310 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:53.504 align:middle line:90%
We got on a new timeline.

00:33:53.504 --> 00:33:55.420 align:middle line:84%
For most people, what
do you mean she's alive.

00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:56.870 align:middle line:90%
She's dead.

00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:58.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:59.450 align:middle line:90%
But she's very much alive.

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And this is a great example
of, it's not just me,

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:06.590 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of people love
some of our celebrities so much

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:08.929 align:middle line:84%
that it's possible that
we need them, and it's--

00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:10.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kind of love
them back into that

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:11.480 align:middle line:90%
timeline where they still exist.

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:12.139 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: You can't go.

00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:13.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Love them
back into reality.

00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: As if
they've never gone.

00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:16.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:20.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And with
the Mandela effect,

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:24.280 align:middle line:84%
when you think of Nelson
Mandela, one way to look at it

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:28.060 align:middle line:84%
could be-- you know, a very
obvious way someone might say,

00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:31.239 align:middle line:84%
especially if they are
into conspiracy-- is that,

00:34:31.239 --> 00:34:33.730 align:middle line:84%
well, they just reported
that he was dead.

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:34.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:35.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:36.646 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: But that
doesn't explain

00:34:36.646 --> 00:34:39.469 align:middle line:84%
why people remember seeing
it in their textbooks--

00:34:39.469 --> 00:34:41.850 align:middle line:84%
that they'd go to school and
they'd see it right there.

00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:42.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:43.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: They remember that.

00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:45.358 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't just
remember the news reports,

00:34:45.358 --> 00:34:48.250 align:middle line:84%
they remember all this other
stuff too, and that's changed.

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:51.880 align:middle line:84%
They remember details
about the estate problems

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:53.920 align:middle line:90%
about him having died in jail.

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And then there was a scuffle
with his estate and his widow

00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:01.270 align:middle line:84%
and getting involved
with the government.

00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And people, of course, their
hearts went out to the widow

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:07.690 align:middle line:84%
so it became an international
kind of a thing.

00:35:07.690 --> 00:35:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And now, that's not any part
of today's history at all.

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:14.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's only in our
memories, those of us

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:16.030 align:middle line:84%
who did remember that
there was something

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:18.167 align:middle line:90%
different in that case.

00:35:18.167 --> 00:35:20.000 align:middle line:84%
&Gt;>REGINA: So if you
were-- and I know you

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.040 align:middle line:84%
can't-- but if you were going
to try to explain that--

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:27.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --why that happened
in that way, for example,

00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:29.380 align:middle line:84%
and I know you can't, but
if you were going to give it

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:32.770 align:middle line:84%
the good ole' college try,
what would you say is happening

00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:35.230 align:middle line:90%
in, say, a scenario like that?

00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:39.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Well, I think a
large part of the realization

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:41.260 align:middle line:84%
that this is happening
is to wake us up,

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:44.140 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that
consciousness is who we are.

00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:46.270 align:middle line:84%
I think that is the
biggest takeaway.

00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:47.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with you.

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And I think that if
we skip that part and think, oh,

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to harness
this and use it

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:52.840 align:middle line:84%
for my own short-term
interests, then

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.340 align:middle line:90%
you've missed the whole point.

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Because the whole point is
that we are consciousness,

00:35:57.130 --> 00:36:01.040 align:middle line:84%
and we are having a human
physical experience.

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.619 align:middle line:84%
And when we care
enough to know what

00:36:02.619 --> 00:36:04.660 align:middle line:84%
is the true nature of
reality, which is something

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:06.880 align:middle line:84%
I care about, then
we get what you

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:09.880 align:middle line:84%
might call weird experiences
that don't necessarily

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:10.836 align:middle line:90%
explain themselves.

00:36:10.836 --> 00:36:12.460 align:middle line:84%
But they're like
puzzle pieces, and you

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:15.430 align:middle line:84%
can start putting it together
and start recognizing that if

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:17.590 align:middle line:84%
someone who was
clearly dead that I

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:20.270 align:middle line:84%
know for sure that it was
reported through reputable news

00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:21.070 align:middle line:90%
media.

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:23.387 align:middle line:84%
We're talking CNN,
"New York Times."

00:36:23.387 --> 00:36:24.220 align:middle line:90%
This is not fly-by--

00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:24.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He has died.

00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:25.230 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:26.105 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Definitely.

00:36:26.105 --> 00:36:27.070 align:middle line:90%
It was on TV.

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:28.070 align:middle line:90%
I believe it.

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And there's all the fallout
that happened subsequently.

00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:34.040 align:middle line:84%
And now suddenly, that's
not the way he died at all.

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:38.260 align:middle line:84%
He actually walked
out of jail, went on

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:39.310 align:middle line:90%
to become the president.

00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:39.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: None of that
had happened before,

00:36:41.290 --> 00:36:42.540 align:middle line:90%
and now this is what happened.

00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:45.730 align:middle line:84%
So to me, it's a huge wake-up
call for all of us who are

00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:48.190 align:middle line:84%
experiencing changes
in movie dialogue--

00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:50.380 align:middle line:84%
that's another part
of the Mandela effect,

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:53.674 align:middle line:84%
or reality shifts-- where if
you're watching the movie "Snow

00:36:53.674 --> 00:36:55.840 align:middle line:84%
White" and you remember the
scene in the movie where

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:58.370 align:middle line:84%
the queen looks in the
mirror, she says something--

00:36:58.370 --> 00:37:00.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I remember her
saying, mirror, mirror,

00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:02.140 align:middle line:84%
on the wall, who's the
fairest of them all?

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:03.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: That's
what I remember.

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:05.400 align:middle line:84%
But if you watch any
version of the movie that's

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:10.120 align:middle line:84%
official right now, it says,
magic mirror on the wall.

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:12.700 align:middle line:84%
And also with the movie
"Field of Dreams,"

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:15.390 align:middle line:84%
we were talking about
that, if you build it--

00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:17.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you build
it, they will come.

00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:18.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: They will come.

00:37:18.250 --> 00:37:20.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you watch the
movie, if you build it,

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:22.512 align:middle line:84%
he will come, which doesn't
even make as much sense.

00:37:22.512 --> 00:37:24.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Whoa, I got
chills on that one.

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:25.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:29.750 align:middle line:84%
So these are indicators to us
to think about what is going on.

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And rather than look
at a conspiracy, which

00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:33.730 align:middle line:84%
is where a lot of
people go with this,

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:36.700 align:middle line:84%
I would rather take
it to consciousness.

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And also look to the
indigenous first nations

00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:43.070 align:middle line:84%
people who also actually
talk about this as well.

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:46.180 align:middle line:84%
So you can look at science,
you can look at ancient history

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:48.850 align:middle line:84%
with indigenous peoples,
and start seeing, OK, it

00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:53.060 align:middle line:84%
makes more sense for this to
be a quantum kind of a world

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:53.860 align:middle line:90%
that we live in.

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:57.260 align:middle line:84%
Quantum reality-- that
things can change suddenly.

00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:58.060 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And when you
experienced it, instead

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:02.262 align:middle line:84%
of dismissing it
or discounting it,

00:38:02.262 --> 00:38:03.720 align:middle line:84%
and children
experience this a lot,

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:05.906 align:middle line:84%
so if you're a
parent or a teacher,

00:38:05.906 --> 00:38:07.530 align:middle line:84%
listen to what the
children are saying.

00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:09.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, mommy, I
really did do my homework.

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:10.475 align:middle line:84%
It was sitting
right on the desk.

00:38:10.475 --> 00:38:13.660 align:middle line:90%
I can't find it.

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:16.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: I'm talking about,
how come our hot water handle

00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:17.850 align:middle line:90%
turns the other way now?

00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And you're like,
oh, don't be silly.

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:20.560 align:middle line:90%
It didn't change.

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:22.600 align:middle line:84%
Why is that picture in
the hallway different?

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:24.308 align:middle line:84%
Daddy used to be on
the other side of me.

00:38:24.308 --> 00:38:25.570 align:middle line:90%
Now, we've switched places.

00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:26.230 align:middle line:90%
Listen to them.

00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:26.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:27.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: I'm talking
about that stuff.

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:28.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, yeah,
I was teasing.

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:29.390 align:middle line:90%
Yes, of course.

00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:31.887 align:middle line:84%
Well, and you mentioned
earlier in the show,

00:38:31.887 --> 00:38:34.220 align:middle line:84%
finding lost things, things
that disappear and so forth.

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And it reminded me
when I read that, I

00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:37.960 align:middle line:84%
thought I have to bring
this up because it

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:39.730 align:middle line:90%
happened at Gaiam twice.

00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:42.130 align:middle line:84%
I used to have a little office
here in the main building.

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:43.240 align:middle line:90%
And so I'd come in.

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:44.210 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't mine.

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:46.120 align:middle line:84%
It was a guest office,
so whoever was here

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:48.370 align:middle line:84%
would be able to use the
desk and the telephone

00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:49.704 align:middle line:90%
and kind of take their stuff in.

00:38:49.704 --> 00:38:51.744 align:middle line:84%
And then when they leave,
somebody else comes in.

00:38:51.744 --> 00:38:53.590 align:middle line:84%
So it had a lot of
traffic going through it.

00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And one day, I got
home from work,

00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:00.670 align:middle line:84%
and I thought I knew I had
pulled something over my head,

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:02.460 align:middle line:84%
and I was missing one
of my gold earrings.

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh,
it's in the office.

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:07.210 align:middle line:84%
I lost it at Gaiam
in the office.

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:09.310 align:middle line:90%
And it has to be there.

00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:10.110 align:middle line:90%
And so I went back.

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:11.660 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not anywhere, right?

00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:12.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yeah.

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:15.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so a few
months later-- now,

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:17.290 align:middle line:84%
it was also vacuumed
every night.

00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:18.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:21.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A few months later,
I come in to work one day,

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:25.870 align:middle line:84%
and right in the middle of the
floor was the gold earring.

00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:27.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:28.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I
went to the janitor,

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:33.210 align:middle line:84%
and I said, Robert,
you do vacuum.

00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:35.450 align:middle line:84%
Did you, I mean, did you
find my gold earring?

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:36.892 align:middle line:84%
I was totally
flummoxed, you know.

00:39:36.892 --> 00:39:38.350 align:middle line:84%
He said, I haven't
seen an earring.

00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:39.970 align:middle line:84%
He said, yeah, I
vacuum it every day.

00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:41.500 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, it was just
lying there in the middle.

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:42.958 align:middle line:84%
It happened with
another object too

00:39:42.958 --> 00:39:46.270 align:middle line:84%
on my desk that had disappeared
and ended up right back there,

00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:47.470 align:middle line:90%
you know, again weeks later.

00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:48.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:50.044 align:middle line:84%
And these reports
are extremely common.

00:39:50.044 --> 00:39:51.460 align:middle line:84%
Lots of people
over the years have

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:54.310 align:middle line:84%
been giving me these anecdotal
stories which I believe.

00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:55.720 align:middle line:90%
It's happened to me too.

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And when it happens,
again, you're

00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:59.782 align:middle line:90%
thinking, what is going on here.

00:39:59.782 --> 00:40:00.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:03.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: But if the takeaway
for me is it is consciousness.

00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:06.250 align:middle line:84%
You just recognize there are
lots of possible realities.

00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:08.050 align:middle line:90%
Things are not necessarily gone.

00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:09.880 align:middle line:90%
History is not the final say.

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:12.730 align:middle line:84%
You know, facts can and
sometimes do change.

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of this
goes a long way

00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:17.470 align:middle line:84%
to explaining how we live in
such a fine-tuned universe.

00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:20.315 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And on that
note, what has finally

00:40:20.315 --> 00:40:21.940 align:middle line:84%
happened with me is--
I mean, sometimes

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:24.130 align:middle line:84%
you just misplace things,
and we all do that.

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:26.300 align:middle line:84%
But I don't even worry
about it anymore.

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:28.270 align:middle line:84%
It's just like it
doesn't matter.

00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:29.280 align:middle line:90%
It'll show up.

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, especially when
you go looking for something,

00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:33.070 align:middle line:84%
and you've looked
repeatedly in the same place

00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:33.890 align:middle line:90%
and it's not there.

00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And then three days later,
it's in that exact place

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.960 align:middle line:90%
you've gone through repeatedly.

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:39.700 align:middle line:84%
So we know now,
don't worry about it.

00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:41.440 align:middle line:84%
For whatever reason,
it jumped timelines.

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:42.950 align:middle line:90%
It's back, and OK, thank you.

00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:43.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:45.875 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, I just
look at it as thank you.

00:40:45.875 --> 00:40:48.430 align:middle line:84%
OK, and we need to go now
into the actual methodology

00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:51.070 align:middle line:84%
you use because there are
some certain basic tenets that

00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:52.140 align:middle line:90%
need to be in place.

00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:54.057 align:middle line:84%
And one of them, people
will find interesting.

00:40:54.057 --> 00:40:54.856 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: OK.

00:40:54.856 --> 00:40:56.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
start with the process.

00:40:56.650 --> 00:40:59.025 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: OK, well, for getting
into this quantum jumping

00:40:59.025 --> 00:41:01.720 align:middle line:84%
mindset, the people who are
really good at it would be

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:03.970 align:middle line:84%
meditators, people
who meditate, they

00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:05.680 align:middle line:84%
have an edge,
people who have gone

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:08.740 align:middle line:84%
through a near-death experience,
definitely very good at this,

00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:10.120 align:middle line:90%
really good at it.

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And in addition to
that, lucid dreamers.

00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:16.600 align:middle line:84%
So if you're following
what's in common

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:18.850 align:middle line:84%
with these groups of people,
to me that's interesting.

00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:20.016 align:middle line:90%
What do they have in common?

00:41:20.016 --> 00:41:22.430 align:middle line:84%
What are they doing
that's so similar?

00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And we've been talking
about it already.

00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:27.370 align:middle line:84%
What starts happening,
as you meditate,

00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:30.277 align:middle line:84%
you start becoming aware that
you are not your problems.

00:41:30.277 --> 00:41:31.360 align:middle line:90%
You are not your thoughts.

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:32.401 align:middle line:90%
You're not your feelings.

00:41:32.401 --> 00:41:33.730 align:middle line:90%
You're an observer.

00:41:33.730 --> 00:41:36.580 align:middle line:84%
You get a feeling of
that consciousness level.

00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:38.800 align:middle line:84%
This is also what
near-death experiencers

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:42.670 align:middle line:84%
get when they go through their
experience and lucid dreamers

00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:43.600 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:45.433 align:middle line:84%
And so it gives you a
different relationship

00:41:45.433 --> 00:41:47.200 align:middle line:90%
with physical reality.

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:49.240 align:middle line:84%
So the way to get to
that state of mind

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:53.140 align:middle line:84%
is to really relax, to just
get into a state of awareness

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:55.330 align:middle line:90%
that you are consciousness.

00:41:55.330 --> 00:41:56.689 align:middle line:90%
It may be hard to believe.

00:41:56.689 --> 00:41:59.230 align:middle line:84%
So for someone who's watching
and they think I don't know how

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:02.170 align:middle line:84%
to even go there, then
start a meditation practice

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:03.850 align:middle line:90%
is a good way to get started.

00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:05.660 align:middle line:84%
Because you really
need to detach.

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:09.340 align:middle line:84%
You need to not be so
certain that you are simply

00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:11.150 align:middle line:90%
in only your physical body.

00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:13.672 align:middle line:84%
Because to the degree you
cling onto that is a lot harder

00:42:13.672 --> 00:42:14.755 align:middle line:90%
to get the kind of effect.

00:42:14.755 --> 00:42:16.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, when this
is just an expression

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:18.190 align:middle line:90%
of the other aspect of self.

00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:19.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Exactly.

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:20.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:23.950 align:middle line:84%
So that's really important--
to really get detached

00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:26.650 align:middle line:84%
and then to get to
really a happy place.

00:42:26.650 --> 00:42:28.870 align:middle line:84%
That's where also
the meditators,

00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:32.080 align:middle line:84%
near-death experiencers,
usually, and lucid dreamers

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:35.276 align:middle line:84%
often tend to go, which
is that place of feeling.

00:42:35.276 --> 00:42:37.400 align:middle line:84%
If you've had it, then you
know what it feels like.

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:40.300 align:middle line:90%
It's just this rush of bliss.

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:41.410 align:middle line:90%
It feels radiant.

00:42:41.410 --> 00:42:43.240 align:middle line:90%
It feels all-encompassing.

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:47.420 align:middle line:84%
It Feels like you are a state
of awareness that is timeless.

00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:48.250 align:middle line:90%
It's just eternal.

00:42:48.250 --> 00:42:49.495 align:middle line:90%
It's infinite.

00:42:49.495 --> 00:42:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And from that place,
there's nothing to fear.

00:42:51.370 --> 00:42:55.630 align:middle line:84%
There's a sense of well-being,
and it is naturally a byproduct

00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:57.280 align:middle line:90%
of certain kinds of meditation.

00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:00.340 align:middle line:90%


00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:01.450 align:middle line:90%
A gateway is meditation.

00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:02.900 align:middle line:90%
It's a good one.

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:04.150 align:middle line:90%
It's a good way to get there.

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And then from there, from
that place of all-being,

00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:09.430 align:middle line:84%
then you can realize,
OK, I'm all one,

00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:12.100 align:middle line:84%
but all these different
choices are out there.

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And have faith that
whatever may seem

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:18.130 align:middle line:84%
like it's unfolding around you,
may seem crazy or challenging,

00:43:18.130 --> 00:43:20.350 align:middle line:84%
that you can either
choose specifically.

00:43:20.350 --> 00:43:22.390 align:middle line:84%
You can ask what's
the best choice?

00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:24.370 align:middle line:90%
What should I best do right now?

00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:25.870 align:middle line:90%
How can I best live my life?

00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:27.700 align:middle line:90%
And you will be guided.

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:29.890 align:middle line:84%
By aiming high for
what's best, what's

00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:32.567 align:middle line:84%
optimal for all
concerned, because you

00:43:32.567 --> 00:43:34.480 align:middle line:90%
know in your heart what's good.

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:37.450 align:middle line:84%
This is the way I prefer
people to actually choose

00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:39.910 align:middle line:84%
which path to take
rather than OK, here's

00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:42.220 align:middle line:84%
the shortcut to millions
of dollars tomorrow.

00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:43.430 align:middle line:90%
That could be a mistake.

00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:45.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm not
saying it is, but I

00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:48.017 align:middle line:84%
would prefer that people
aim even higher than what's

00:43:48.017 --> 00:43:48.850 align:middle line:90%
in their short-term.

00:43:48.850 --> 00:43:50.350 align:middle line:84%
&Gt;>REGINA: Yes, what am
I here to do to contribute?

00:43:50.350 --> 00:43:52.682 align:middle line:84%
What am I uniquely
qualified to contribute?

00:43:52.682 --> 00:43:54.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: How can I be
in service to the world?

00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:56.530 align:middle line:90%
How can I help everyone?

00:43:56.530 --> 00:43:57.340 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:43:57.340 --> 00:43:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
happiness comes from.

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:02.395 align:middle line:84%
So the steps again would
be take a deep breath.

00:44:02.395 --> 00:44:04.940 align:middle line:84%
You know, do some kind
of meditative practice.

00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:05.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Breathe.

00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:06.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yeah, breathe.

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:08.320 align:middle line:90%
That can be a meditation.

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:10.130 align:middle line:90%
Start observing your thoughts.

00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:11.820 align:middle line:90%
Just watch your thoughts come.

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:12.820 align:middle line:90%
Watch them go.

00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:14.600 align:middle line:84%
Just get into that
breathing pattern.

00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:15.400 align:middle line:90%
Deeper.

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:18.230 align:middle line:84%
You want to breathe
to your lower abdomen.

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:19.250 align:middle line:90%
Deep, full breaths.

00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:20.390 align:middle line:90%
Slow it down.

00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And just become
aware increasingly

00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:25.190 align:middle line:84%
that you can watch these
thoughts come and go.

00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And then hopefully--
this is a practice

00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:32.630 align:middle line:84%
that you should do for a week or
two to get the feeling for it.

00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:35.240 align:middle line:84%
And then after you've gotten
to that place of feeling like,

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:37.100 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm getting
into that state that

00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:40.170 align:middle line:84%
feels like between
dreaming and waking up.

00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:40.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:42.053 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: That's the goal.

00:44:42.053 --> 00:44:44.085 align:middle line:84%
You want to get into
that theta state.

00:44:44.085 --> 00:44:47.560 align:middle line:84%
And when you can live your life
like a waking dream, you know,

00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:50.330 align:middle line:84%
that's where you start seeing
reality shifts every day,

00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:51.287 align:middle line:90%
lots of them.

00:44:51.287 --> 00:44:52.370 align:middle line:90%
And they can be quite fun.

00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:53.240 align:middle line:90%
They can be good.

00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:55.360 align:middle line:90%
And it makes it playful.

00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:58.840 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to explain, but it
really does feel terrific.

00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:01.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yes.

00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, you put
your very clear, a very clear,

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:08.874 align:middle line:84%
picture image, feeling, of
what it is you wish to jump to.

00:45:08.874 --> 00:45:10.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: When you get that.

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:11.210 align:middle line:90%
And so it might come to you.

00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:13.130 align:middle line:90%
You might have already had one.

00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:15.710 align:middle line:84%
So they come from-- you might
think like, that was my image.

00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:17.460 align:middle line:90%
I've been storyboarding it.

00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:18.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:19.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: You know, created it.

00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:19.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:20.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: OK, that's fine.

00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:22.280 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe it came to
you because you're

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:24.140 align:middle line:84%
doing-- I prefer
to actually work

00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:27.730 align:middle line:84%
with the participatory style
where you say, OK, show me

00:45:27.730 --> 00:45:28.530 align:middle line:90%
what's best for me.

00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:29.690 align:middle line:90%
Let's bring that to me.

00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:31.065 align:middle line:84%
Let me be in the
highest service.

00:45:31.065 --> 00:45:32.689 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
what that looks like,

00:45:32.689 --> 00:45:33.620 align:middle line:90%
but I'm going there.

00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:35.340 align:middle line:90%
You know, I want to do it.

00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:36.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:38.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: I like that
kind of excitement.

00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:39.700 align:middle line:90%
But it's whatever.

00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:41.660 align:middle line:84%
So either clear
picture, either way.

00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And then, yes, you
say, that is it,

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.460 align:middle line:84%
and you act as if,
which is the advice

00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:48.422 align:middle line:84%
from American psychologist
William James.

00:45:48.422 --> 00:45:49.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Fake it
till you make it.

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:50.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yeah.

00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:52.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Once you decide that,
that's how you start living.

00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:53.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: That's right.

00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:54.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it
becomes your reality.

00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:55.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: It does.

00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:57.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and one
of the things you also

00:45:57.350 --> 00:45:59.690 align:middle line:84%
put in the book was that
in that feeling of bliss

00:45:59.690 --> 00:46:01.850 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about
that that fueled,

00:46:01.850 --> 00:46:03.480 align:middle line:84%
feels that you also
use the word love.

00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:04.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so for people
whose lives have become

00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:08.600 align:middle line:84%
very dim-- you know,
their own lights

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:10.190 align:middle line:84%
become dim to
themselves, they're

00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:12.470 align:middle line:84%
cut off from
themselves-- that even

00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:14.780 align:middle line:84%
to be able to go
back into a moment

00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:19.700 align:middle line:84%
where you felt love for someone
or an experience or a pet

00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:25.640 align:middle line:84%
even that you need to conjure
up that love inside yourself

00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:27.770 align:middle line:84%
again and let that
be that bliss.

00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:28.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:30.800 align:middle line:84%
You need to kind of
seed it, if you will,

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:32.210 align:middle line:90%
kind of get it started again.

00:46:32.210 --> 00:46:33.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Cause that's the fuel.

00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:34.651 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Because
often when you need

00:46:34.651 --> 00:46:37.160 align:middle line:84%
these quantum jumps so much,
you're not in a good place.

00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:39.530 align:middle line:84%
It might be a very dark
moment, and maybe you

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:41.454 align:middle line:84%
don't have the
friends or the family

00:46:41.454 --> 00:46:42.620 align:middle line:90%
to help pull you through it.

00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:43.970 align:middle line:90%
Some people don't.

00:46:43.970 --> 00:46:47.120 align:middle line:84%
So that's when you can
absolutely trust and have faith

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:50.060 align:middle line:84%
that you can make that
time travel journey back

00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:55.220 align:middle line:84%
to a favorite moment that you
remember and really feel it.

00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:56.270 align:middle line:90%
The key is feeling it.

00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:57.145 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Feeling it.

00:46:57.145 --> 00:46:58.070 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:46:58.070 --> 00:47:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And then the desire that has
to fuel as well that love

00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:08.000 align:middle line:84%
and that bliss or joy with
the companionship of desire

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.380 align:middle line:90%
for that outcome.

00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:12.230 align:middle line:84%
Because desire in a
lot of different-- most

00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:15.320 align:middle line:84%
religious traditions-- desire
really gets knocked about.

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And yet there's nothing in
the universe that creates,

00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:20.550 align:middle line:90%
that exists, without desire.

00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:21.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:47:21.350 --> 00:47:25.010 align:middle line:84%
Desire can get a bad rap
from the lower chakra issues

00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:26.720 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of
people have with it.

00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:29.900 align:middle line:84%
Again, just short-sighted
me, me, me thinking.

00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:32.720 align:middle line:84%
But if that's not the
problem-- if your desire is

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:38.990 align:middle line:84%
for world peace, if your desire
is to see the environment come

00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:41.480 align:middle line:84%
back into balance,
and people get along

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:44.430 align:middle line:84%
with love and integrity,
if that's your desire,

00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:46.190 align:middle line:90%
that's good.

00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:49.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that will give
it some rocket fuel behind it.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:49.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: It gives it a lot.

00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:51.083 align:middle line:84%
And so the more of
us that really feel

00:47:51.083 --> 00:47:53.360 align:middle line:84%
that kind of passion-- and
there are young people that

00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:54.160 align:middle line:90%
feel that passion.

00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:55.790 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about
politics earlier.

00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:58.670 align:middle line:84%
We've seen a lot of people with
that kind of burning passion.

00:47:58.670 --> 00:48:00.800 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to see
them continue that.

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:03.680 align:middle line:84%
You know, to keep
envisioning a better world

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:06.410 align:middle line:84%
because we absolutely
can create it,

00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:07.700 align:middle line:90%
and it comes from that desire.

00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are you
feeling that shift

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:11.300 align:middle line:84%
among the millennials
in particular right now?

00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:12.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: I am, yes.

00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:14.120 align:middle line:84%
There's a great deal
of wisdom there.

00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And we may look at it
from our generation

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:18.430 align:middle line:90%
as, well, they seem flighty.

00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:19.597 align:middle line:90%
But I don't see it that way.

00:48:19.597 --> 00:48:20.805 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I don't either.

00:48:20.805 --> 00:48:23.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: I see that they're
more on track with what

00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:26.360 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual core
values are than many

00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:29.130 align:middle line:84%
of their materialistic
parents and prior generations.

00:48:29.130 --> 00:48:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah,
I see that as well.

00:48:31.250 --> 00:48:34.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, every generation
has its challenges.

00:48:34.050 --> 00:48:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And everyone, no
matter where you are,

00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:39.710 align:middle line:84%
has it's kind of slackers
and, you know, naysayers.

00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:41.787 align:middle line:84%
But in general, I think
that tone is there.

00:48:41.787 --> 00:48:42.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Very much.

00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:42.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet,
at the same time,

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.650 align:middle line:84%
when we're talking
about this process,

00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:48.470 align:middle line:84%
most processes do have
certain little pitfalls.

00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:51.530 align:middle line:84%
You know, there are little areas
that must be kind of at least

00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:53.750 align:middle line:90%
mulled over and overcome.

00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And talk about that
and what can stand

00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:57.920 align:middle line:90%
in the way of this happening.

00:48:57.920 --> 00:48:58.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: OK.

00:48:58.820 --> 00:48:59.420 align:middle line:90%
Lots of things.

00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:00.740 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about
some of them already.

00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:02.406 align:middle line:84%
So I'll review the
ones we've brought up

00:49:02.406 --> 00:49:05.210 align:middle line:84%
which have to do
with making a mistake

00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:08.300 align:middle line:84%
or assuming that we are
just the physical body

00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:11.300 align:middle line:84%
and that something that
has happened is done

00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:13.700 align:middle line:90%
and that's now a fact.

00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:15.860 align:middle line:84%
To overcome that,
you can get current

00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:18.160 align:middle line:84%
on what's happening
with quantum computing

00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:19.570 align:middle line:84%
or read the book
"Quantum Jumps."

00:49:19.570 --> 00:49:21.730 align:middle line:84%
You need to educate
yourself and see

00:49:21.730 --> 00:49:23.920 align:middle line:84%
this is not the way
this new quantum age is

00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:25.600 align:middle line:90%
going to be operating at all.

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:28.600 align:middle line:84%
So we need to change our
assumptions and our thinking.

00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:30.640 align:middle line:84%
And our children
are learning-- we

00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:34.030 align:middle line:84%
talked about the new generation
coming up, the millennials.

00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:36.420 align:middle line:84%
They're playing the
game "Minecraft,"

00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:40.800 align:middle line:84%
which has a qCraft
component, which is free.

00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:42.250 align:middle line:90%
And it's for all ages.

00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:43.990 align:middle line:84%
So you can get on
that "Minecraft" game,

00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:45.440 align:middle line:90%
get the free qCraft.

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:46.240 align:middle line:90%
Play with it.

00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Start noticing that you can have
entangled building blocks that

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:51.040 align:middle line:90%
are working together.

00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:53.292 align:middle line:90%
You can have teleportation.

00:49:53.292 --> 00:49:55.750 align:middle line:84%
You can have superposition of
states, all these things I've

00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:58.227 align:middle line:84%
talked about, but you can start
feeling it within the game.

00:49:58.227 --> 00:49:59.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm writing this down.

00:49:59.560 --> 00:49:59.920 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And that game was
designed by a programmer

00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:05.320 align:middle line:84%
so that they can build the next
generation of quantum computers

00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:07.450 align:middle line:84%
because we still
are working-- we're

00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:09.640 align:middle line:84%
looking for that holy
grail of the quantum

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:13.330 align:middle line:84%
paradigm, the holy grail
of how we can get quantum

00:50:13.330 --> 00:50:15.250 align:middle line:90%
logic to make sense to us.

00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:17.890 align:middle line:84%
It's so different than
Boolean binary logic.

00:50:17.890 --> 00:50:20.530 align:middle line:84%
We no longer have a
world of true and false.

00:50:20.530 --> 00:50:21.730 align:middle line:90%
That's gone.

00:50:21.730 --> 00:50:25.990 align:middle line:84%
As the quantum age begins, we're
moving into true and false,

00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:27.520 align:middle line:90%
and not true/not false.

00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:30.550 align:middle line:84%
It's what you might think
of as fourfold logic.

00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:32.990 align:middle line:90%
It's what they know it in Asia.

00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:34.470 align:middle line:90%
So it's very different.

00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:36.910 align:middle line:84%
It's recognizing that there
are many possibilities that

00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:38.620 align:middle line:90%
are already there.

00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And things are not black
and white, cut and dry.

00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:43.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's look
at that for a moment.

00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:44.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm curious.

00:50:44.590 --> 00:50:48.100 align:middle line:84%
You just triggered a curiosity
in me about "Minecraft."

00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of this goes
into conspiracy too,

00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:52.690 align:middle line:84%
but it also has useful
purposes, I suppose.

00:50:52.690 --> 00:50:56.740 align:middle line:84%
When we look at phenomena
such as Google and Facebook

00:50:56.740 --> 00:50:59.260 align:middle line:84%
and such where you have a
lot of data mining going on,

00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:03.970 align:middle line:84%
to be able to appeal to whatever
it seems to be the emerging

00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:06.660 align:middle line:84%
human consensus in
any given nanosecond,

00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:08.290 align:middle line:84%
and then you can
directly appeal to it

00:51:08.290 --> 00:51:09.940 align:middle line:90%
or change it or manipulate it.

00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:14.470 align:middle line:84%
That's a dark side of what this
kind of technology and data

00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:15.610 align:middle line:90%
gathering can do.

00:51:15.610 --> 00:51:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And you just brought
up "Minecraft,"

00:51:17.110 --> 00:51:20.090 align:middle line:84%
which is highly creative
and involving children.

00:51:20.090 --> 00:51:24.430 align:middle line:84%
What do you see
as that potential,

00:51:24.430 --> 00:51:26.694 align:middle line:84%
and what do you know
about the creator of that?

00:51:26.694 --> 00:51:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: I don't
know too much about it

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:32.560 align:middle line:84%
except that those were people
who needed quantum programmers

00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:35.830 align:middle line:84%
for the DUA of computers
that NASA and Google had

00:51:35.830 --> 00:51:37.604 align:middle line:90%
spent millions of dollars on.

00:51:37.604 --> 00:51:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't have
people who understood how

00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:41.260 align:middle line:90%
to program quantum computers.

00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:43.155 align:middle line:84%
I've programmed
classical computers.

00:51:43.155 --> 00:51:45.280 align:middle line:84%
That's a whole different
thing because there you've

00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:47.120 align:middle line:90%
got logic gates.

00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:49.450 align:middle line:84%
You also have logic gates
in quantum computers,

00:51:49.450 --> 00:51:50.690 align:middle line:90%
but it's different.

00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:52.630 align:middle line:90%
There's more stuff going on.

00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:54.820 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like
classical reality

00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:58.270 align:middle line:84%
is a very, very special
case of the bigger quantum

00:51:58.270 --> 00:52:01.060 align:middle line:84%
reality, which is how
I see quantum logic.

00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:02.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's like we've
been preparing

00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:05.080 align:middle line:84%
to work in a very
special case environment

00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:06.870 align:middle line:90%
when we program computers.

00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:08.680 align:middle line:84%
But what do we do
when the computer

00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:10.805 align:middle line:84%
can imagine all these
possibilities simultaneously?

00:52:10.805 --> 00:52:13.179 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you have all
these little young minds that

00:52:13.179 --> 00:52:15.130 align:middle line:84%
are creating-- they're
interfacing with it

00:52:15.130 --> 00:52:16.540 align:middle line:84%
and making their own
choice points within that.

00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: They're
going to learn.

00:52:17.290 --> 00:52:19.210 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like
playing with Lincoln Logs

00:52:19.210 --> 00:52:21.460 align:middle line:84%
like you might have
played with or LEGOs

00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:23.000 align:middle line:90%
like our kids played with.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And now they've got this
whole "Minecraft" with qCraft.

00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:28.492 align:middle line:84%
They can start thinking
in a quantum way.

00:52:28.492 --> 00:52:29.450 align:middle line:90%
It's a whole new world.

00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:30.949 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this
starts taking them

00:52:30.949 --> 00:52:33.830 align:middle line:84%
beyond the limitations
of time and space.

00:52:33.830 --> 00:52:36.969 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Well, I think you
could say it that way, but--

00:52:36.969 --> 00:52:38.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it's
become-- right now

00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:40.950 align:middle line:84%
it looks like a virtual
reality, so to speak.

00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And most people have a
divide between reality

00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:44.420 align:middle line:90%
and virtual reality.

00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:46.460 align:middle line:84%
But because they're so
young, is it possible

00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:49.250 align:middle line:84%
that their own psyche
is crossing over

00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:52.580 align:middle line:84%
to these virtual realities
or it's all the same now.

00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:53.460 align:middle line:90%
Create what you wish.

00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:54.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: I think
what's happening

00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:56.840 align:middle line:84%
is they understand that the
possibilities are there.

00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And that in a
quantum environment,

00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:01.670 align:middle line:84%
you can entertain all the
possibilities until you

00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:03.146 align:middle line:90%
select the optimal choice.

00:53:03.146 --> 00:53:04.520 align:middle line:84%
That's what quantum
computers do.

00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:06.320 align:middle line:90%
That's what nature does.

00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:08.090 align:middle line:84%
We didn't get into
photosynthesis and all.

00:53:08.090 --> 00:53:09.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Go ahead
and talk about that.

00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:10.400 align:middle line:90%
We have a few minutes.

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:10.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Oh, good.

00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:11.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:12.626 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: So in
"Quantum Jumps," I

00:53:12.626 --> 00:53:14.420 align:middle line:84%
describe something
we know for sure--

00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:17.060 align:middle line:84%
that plants are
absolutely using a quantum

00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:19.520 align:middle line:90%
process to photosynthesize.

00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And they attain
efficiencies of operation

00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:26.150 align:middle line:90%
in the 90%, which is remarkable.

00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:28.190 align:middle line:84%
Because when we work
with photovoltaic cells,

00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:32.240 align:middle line:84%
we don't get something
like 95% or 96% efficiency.

00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:33.860 align:middle line:84%
Even if you have
solar power, there's

00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:36.090 align:middle line:90%
a lot of loss along the way.

00:53:36.090 --> 00:53:37.396 align:middle line:90%
So what are plants doing?

00:53:37.396 --> 00:53:39.770 align:middle line:84%
It looks like what they're
doing when you look at the way

00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:42.800 align:middle line:84%
they take a ray of
sunshine that hits the leaf

00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:46.160 align:middle line:84%
and they transport
that ray of sunshine,

00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:49.340 align:middle line:90%
it's conveyed through a network.

00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And you can think
of it as, like,

00:53:51.110 --> 00:53:54.890 align:middle line:84%
the freeway systems or
maybe downtown New York

00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:57.140 align:middle line:90%
City, a traffic jam situation.

00:53:57.140 --> 00:54:00.410 align:middle line:84%
How do you take that
little bit of energy

00:54:00.410 --> 00:54:01.970 align:middle line:84%
and transport it
to where it needs

00:54:01.970 --> 00:54:03.710 align:middle line:90%
to be stored within the plant?

00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:05.390 align:middle line:90%
That's the efficiency.

00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And the way they solve that--
because it is like solving

00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:09.359 align:middle line:90%
a rush hour traffic problem.

00:54:09.359 --> 00:54:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And you can imagine
being in New York City.

00:54:11.150 --> 00:54:12.410 align:middle line:90%
You call a taxi.

00:54:12.410 --> 00:54:14.540 align:middle line:90%
You need to get across town.

00:54:14.540 --> 00:54:16.910 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that that
taxi driver could always

00:54:16.910 --> 00:54:20.399 align:middle line:84%
just pick the best path and
get you there that's just

00:54:20.399 --> 00:54:21.440 align:middle line:90%
like the blink of an eye?

00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:22.340 align:middle line:90%
Probably not.

00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And we've had experiences
with taxis in New York City,

00:54:24.590 --> 00:54:25.881 align:middle line:90%
and that's not going to happen.

00:54:25.881 --> 00:54:26.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:27.320 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:28.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: We know that's
not going to happen.

00:54:28.530 --> 00:54:29.870 align:middle line:90%
So what are the plants doing?

00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And they're
absolutely doing what

00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:38.430 align:middle line:84%
MIT researchers confirmed is
known as a quantum random walk.

00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:40.400 align:middle line:84%
So just in a couple
of short movies,

00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:43.550 align:middle line:84%
they go as far as possible
toward their destination.

00:54:43.550 --> 00:54:45.230 align:middle line:84%
It's like they're
almost already there.

00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:47.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it seems
that the X factor there

00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:50.790 align:middle line:84%
is another timeline
of consciousness

00:54:50.790 --> 00:54:54.090 align:middle line:84%
that they're kind of popping
between in the photosynthesis

00:54:54.090 --> 00:54:54.890 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:54:54.890 --> 00:54:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And the intelligence
is always taking them

00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:58.045 align:middle line:90%
to the most efficient place.

00:54:58.045 --> 00:55:00.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Yeah, it's kind
of like they can feel it,

00:55:00.170 --> 00:55:01.461 align:middle line:90%
if you want to put it that way.

00:55:01.461 --> 00:55:04.307 align:middle line:84%
Like a plant just kind of
knows the way it does things.

00:55:04.307 --> 00:55:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's not it's not
thinking in the way we

00:55:06.140 --> 00:55:07.010 align:middle line:90%
would call it "thinking."

00:55:07.010 --> 00:55:09.010 align:middle line:84%
Yet, it's doing something
none of our computers--

00:55:09.010 --> 00:55:10.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's being impressed
by a level of consciousness

00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:11.330 align:middle line:90%
beyond them.

00:55:11.330 --> 00:55:12.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:55:12.130 --> 00:55:14.990 align:middle line:84%
So we have a new field of
quantum biology springing up

00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:19.250 align:middle line:84%
that it contains things
like this and also organisms

00:55:19.250 --> 00:55:21.930 align:middle line:84%
that can genetically
mutate instantaneously--

00:55:21.930 --> 00:55:22.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:55:22.730 --> 00:55:24.605 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: --almost
impossibly to exactly what

00:55:24.605 --> 00:55:25.550 align:middle line:90%
they needed to mutate.

00:55:25.550 --> 00:55:27.710 align:middle line:84%
How did they know which
one, and how did they

00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:28.910 align:middle line:90%
do that so quickly?

00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:29.750 align:middle line:90%
These are mysteries.

00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:31.850 align:middle line:84%
But our children
playing qCraft are

00:55:31.850 --> 00:55:34.250 align:middle line:84%
going to start getting
a feeling for it.

00:55:34.250 --> 00:55:35.520 align:middle line:90%
And that is the greatest gift.

00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:37.520 align:middle line:84%
They're going to start
understanding, like, this

00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:39.590 align:middle line:90%
is the way the world works.

00:55:39.590 --> 00:55:41.795 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so since
we're down that rabbit hole,

00:55:41.795 --> 00:55:43.910 align:middle line:84%
and we have a few
minutes left, what

00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:46.820 align:middle line:84%
about the notion of
disappearing species

00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:50.180 align:middle line:84%
because I personally believe
they're kind of blinking out

00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:51.527 align:middle line:90%
into another field perhaps.

00:55:51.527 --> 00:55:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: That's possible.

00:55:52.610 --> 00:55:55.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not necessarily just
dying out because of pollutants

00:55:55.250 --> 00:55:56.050 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:55:56.050 --> 00:55:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And they
might come back.

00:55:57.050 --> 00:55:57.570 align:middle line:90%
I talked about--

00:55:57.570 --> 00:55:57.985 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:55:57.985 --> 00:56:00.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: --indigenous--
I touched on this earlier.

00:56:00.210 --> 00:56:02.600 align:middle line:84%
I researched the
Hopi Indians who

00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:05.650 align:middle line:84%
have a word "tunatya" or
"tunatyava," which means

00:56:05.650 --> 00:56:07.460 align:middle line:90%
"comes true, being hoped for."

00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And they believe that each time
we get to one of these epical

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.880 align:middle line:84%
points-- we know we're
in it right now--

00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:13.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: --then we will see
animals come back to life

00:56:17.330 --> 00:56:19.070 align:middle line:84%
that might have
been dead before.

00:56:19.070 --> 00:56:20.180 align:middle line:90%
You know, that can happen.

00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:22.490 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they are
aware that this sort of thing

00:56:22.490 --> 00:56:23.930 align:middle line:90%
can happen.

00:56:23.930 --> 00:56:26.270 align:middle line:84%
Just because something is
dead, like the Mandela effect,

00:56:26.270 --> 00:56:27.590 align:middle line:90%
can a whole species come back?

00:56:27.590 --> 00:56:28.430 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:29.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think so.

00:56:29.180 --> 00:56:29.495 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Absolutely.

00:56:29.495 --> 00:56:31.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or they can blink out,
go somewhere else for a while,

00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:33.004 align:middle line:90%
and they can blink back in.

00:56:33.004 --> 00:56:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Absolutely.

00:56:34.070 --> 00:56:34.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Depending
on whether it's

00:56:34.970 --> 00:56:37.480 align:middle line:84%
to their desire or advantage
to be here at any given time.

00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:38.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:40.320 align:middle line:84%
I think we need the
diversity of species,

00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:42.374 align:middle line:84%
so I would vote for some
of them coming back.

00:56:42.374 --> 00:56:43.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But can't
new species be

00:56:43.790 --> 00:56:44.990 align:middle line:90%
blinking in at the same time?

00:56:44.990 --> 00:56:45.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: They do.

00:56:45.290 --> 00:56:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They do
discover new species.

00:56:46.790 --> 00:56:48.956 align:middle line:84%
&Gt;>LARSON: And when you
look at the archaeological

00:56:48.956 --> 00:56:52.520 align:middle line:84%
paleontological records, you'll
see that Darwin proposed a very

00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:53.975 align:middle line:90%
gradual evolution.

00:56:53.975 --> 00:56:55.100 align:middle line:90%
That's not what we observe.

00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:55.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's not true.

00:56:55.610 --> 00:56:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: We observe
huge quantum jumps--

00:56:57.050 --> 00:56:57.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly

00:56:57.740 --> 00:56:59.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: --again, just like
what we're talking about.

00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:02.480 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere you look in nature,
you'll see these quantum jumps.

00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:03.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:05.180 align:middle line:84%
One final question
because people say,

00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:07.376 align:middle line:84%
oh, I've tried to change
my reality many times,

00:57:07.376 --> 00:57:08.750 align:middle line:84%
and I read the
law of attraction.

00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And I even watched
the video, too.

00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't work out
for me necessarily.

00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And so what would
you say to that?

00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:17.750 align:middle line:84%
How would you differentiate
out the processes

00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:19.580 align:middle line:84%
of law of attraction,
and you don't

00:57:19.580 --> 00:57:21.890 align:middle line:84%
have to worry about
bashing anything or anyone,

00:57:21.890 --> 00:57:24.050 align:middle line:90%
just staying with principles.

00:57:24.050 --> 00:57:24.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: OK.

00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:26.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, I haven't explored
the law of attraction

00:57:26.930 --> 00:57:29.670 align:middle line:84%
per se that much myself,
so when I work with people,

00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:31.950 align:middle line:84%
I do coaching, and I
usually work one on one.

00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:33.780 align:middle line:84%
What I'll observe
is they might have

00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:36.810 align:middle line:84%
some kind of a stuck
belief area or some issue

00:57:36.810 --> 00:57:39.460 align:middle line:84%
in their environment, and I'll
work specifically with them.

00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:43.980 align:middle line:84%
So there can be wildly different
problems for different people.

00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:57:44.790 --> 00:57:45.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, your own
stumbling blocks

00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:47.340 align:middle line:84%
of worries about the
future, for example.

00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:49.260 align:middle line:84%
That will kind of shut down
the process and it's stress.

00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:50.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Yeah, you don't
want to be worrying.

00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:51.436 align:middle line:90%
You've got to give up worry.

00:57:51.436 --> 00:57:52.510 align:middle line:90%
Worry has no place.

00:57:52.510 --> 00:57:53.310 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:57:53.310 --> 00:57:53.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:57:53.730 --> 00:57:54.150 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:55.858 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: You need to
focus on gratitude.

00:57:55.858 --> 00:57:58.770 align:middle line:84%
I'd rather focus on what people
should be doing because that's

00:57:58.770 --> 00:58:01.800 align:middle line:84%
so important is to get
into that grateful state--

00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:04.980 align:middle line:84%
look back on your previous
day, week, month, year.

00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:08.640 align:middle line:84%
Be grateful for what you did
that has made you so happy now,

00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:11.940 align:middle line:84%
that's helping you feel more
in service, more on task,

00:58:11.940 --> 00:58:13.404 align:middle line:90%
more with a sense of meaning.

00:58:13.404 --> 00:58:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And you may think that
nothing, I haven't done that.

00:58:15.570 --> 00:58:17.400 align:middle line:90%
But I invite you to look closer.

00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:19.294 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Any final thoughts?

00:58:19.294 --> 00:58:21.210 align:middle line:10%
>>LARSON: Well, I like
to invite people to ask

00:58:21.210 --> 00:58:23.250 align:middle line:10%
how good can it
get because then it

00:58:23.250 --> 00:58:25.170 align:middle line:10%
gets the imagination fired up.

00:58:25.170 --> 00:58:27.640 align:middle line:10%
And that's true
in any situation,

00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:32.040 align:middle line:10%
whether it's good, bad, or sort
of middling, just invite to see

00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:33.810 align:middle line:10%
how good can this get.

00:58:33.810 --> 00:58:35.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why not?

00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:36.930 align:middle line:84%
The potential is
there just as much

00:58:36.930 --> 00:58:38.292 align:middle line:90%
as how bad can it get, right?

00:58:38.292 --> 00:58:39.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: That's right.

00:58:39.250 --> 00:58:43.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So on this I agree
with you 100%, totally.

00:58:43.590 --> 00:58:44.744 align:middle line:90%
Cynthia, I love your work.

00:58:44.744 --> 00:58:47.160 align:middle line:84%
I love what you do, and you
have just a lovely countenance

00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:49.350 align:middle line:84%
about you, a very kind
of angelic presence

00:58:49.350 --> 00:58:51.790 align:middle line:84%

into how good can it get.
