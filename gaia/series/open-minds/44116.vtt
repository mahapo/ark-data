00:00:27.832 --> 00:00:29.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: If
you've been reading

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.000 align:middle line:84%
metaphysical and science
books to gather knowledge

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.530 align:middle line:84%
for decades as I have,
there are times when I just

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.810 align:middle line:84%
want to have it handed
to me unvarnished,

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.380 align:middle line:84%
no references, no
politically-correct language,

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.850 align:middle line:90%
just tell me what you know.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.730 align:middle line:84%
Not surprisingly,
some of the authors

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.510 align:middle line:84%
of these heavyweight
books themselves

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.220 align:middle line:84%
want wider expression such a
scientist and shaman Barbara

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.160 align:middle line:90%
Hand Clow.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Toward that end,
she and others have

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.060 align:middle line:84%
turned to fiction, which adds
fun and excitement to the read

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.510 align:middle line:84%
while getting to the deep
and controversial information

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.360 align:middle line:84%
quickly, and there is a lot
of controversial information

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.560 align:middle line:90%
in "The Ruby Crystal."

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And first of all, I want
to say I feel so honored.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.870 align:middle line:84%
This is your very first public
discussion about this book.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.182 align:middle line:90%
The ink is barely dry.

00:01:09.182 --> 00:01:09.890 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yes.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:10.590 align:middle line:90%
That's true, Regina.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.215 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how it's going
to go for me because I've never

00:01:13.215 --> 00:01:15.370 align:middle line:84%
talked about it before,
but we'll give it a try.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.859 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, And
these are subjects

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:19.400 align:middle line:84%
that are near and
dear to your heart,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.620 align:middle line:84%
and we talked a little bit about
it at the end a conversation

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.220 align:middle line:84%
a while back about
why turn to fiction,

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.100 align:middle line:90%
And there's a reason for that.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.017 align:middle line:84%
So give us your reason
for turning to fiction.

00:01:30.017 --> 00:01:32.683 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Well, in my case, I
always wanted to write fiction.

00:01:32.683 --> 00:01:33.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.988 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: But when
I started my career

00:01:34.988 --> 00:01:37.570 align:middle line:84%
as a writer 35 years ago,
all I could have done

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.225 align:middle line:84%
was write novels about
violence, crime, and lust,

00:01:40.225 --> 00:01:43.370 align:middle line:84%
and hideous subjects as
far as I'm concerned.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And so I went into nonfiction
and became successful.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And then when I finally
became successful enough,

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.140 align:middle line:84%
I decided it's time to
do what I want to do.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.220 align:middle line:84%
And so I turned back
to writing fiction.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.970 align:middle line:90%
I opened up that gate.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And the way it worked was
just utterly fascinating.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.600 align:middle line:84%
Once I made an
agreement with myself

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.190 align:middle line:84%
that I could write fiction
and I would write fiction,

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.990 align:middle line:84%
then what happened is,
one day two years ago,

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.680 align:middle line:84%
May of 2011, all of the
characters except for one just

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.100 align:middle line:90%
showed up one day.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And I took out a yellow
tablet and I wrote down

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.160 align:middle line:84%
their names, their ages,
and their backgrounds,

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.030 align:middle line:84%
and where they lived, and
they all became a group,

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.670 align:middle line:90%
and they all created the novel.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.220 align:middle line:90%
I never plotted it.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.410 align:middle line:84%
I simply sat down every
day from 9:00 to 12:00

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.850 align:middle line:84%
and got my characters together,
and they wrote the novel.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And now that I'm
finished with it,

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.697 align:middle line:84%
I realized that they're
all fragments of myself.

00:02:36.697 --> 00:02:37.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.710 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.800 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And I realized
that what was really going on

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.930 align:middle line:84%
with me-- I'm still
working on the same issues.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm still working on
multi-dimensionality.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.049 align:middle line:84%
I'm still working on the
fourth dimensional control

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:47.590 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm still working
on the same stuff.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.470 align:middle line:84%
But I realized that
I wanted to have

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.090 align:middle line:84%
a whole bunch of
characters who had

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.580 align:middle line:90%
different kinds of backgrounds.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.552 align:middle line:84%
Like one guy is a really
good-looking, Jewish guy

00:02:58.552 --> 00:03:00.760 align:middle line:84%
from New York who's working
for "The New York Times,"

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.480 align:middle line:84%
and he's in the Vatican
doing a reporter patrol

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.190 align:middle line:90%
on priestly sexual abuse.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Another character is a
very attractive young woman

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.040 align:middle line:84%
who's getting her PhD
in patristics, which

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.640 align:middle line:84%
is study of the
early church fathers.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.680 align:middle line:84%
She's in Rome on
assignment, and they

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.580 align:middle line:84%
run into each
other accidentally.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.954 align:middle line:84%
And that was the best part
of it was the way they met

00:03:20.954 --> 00:03:22.620 align:middle line:84%
and the way they got
to know each other.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.800 align:middle line:90%
It was so much fun.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:23.830 align:middle line:90%
And I know that place.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:24.830 align:middle line:90%
I've been there in Rome.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.110 align:middle line:84%
It's nice because you're
using some familiar areas

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.960 align:middle line:84%
and landmarks within Rome
that many of us have seen

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.970 align:middle line:84%
and you kind of anchor
us into your story too.

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:33.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And I had a lot of fun doing
that, because I love Italy.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.090 align:middle line:84%
I particularly love
Tuscany, and I love Rome.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And so then what I had
to do with that was,

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.030 align:middle line:84%
I didn't necessarily
have everything

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.420 align:middle line:84%
I needed so most of the
locations in the novel

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.970 align:middle line:84%
are actual places
such as the Vatican

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.110 align:middle line:84%
or such as various places
in Tuscany and Siena,

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.320 align:middle line:84%
but many other
places are fictional.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.750 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
this young reporter

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.480 align:middle line:84%
runs into the young
woman near a site, which

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.240 align:middle line:84%
was once-- it's an
archaeological site, which

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.610 align:middle line:90%
was the House of Cumuli.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.450 align:middle line:90%
That's all fictional.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.466 align:middle line:90%
But if you go to Rome--

00:04:06.466 --> 00:04:08.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But archaeological
site with all the cats

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.360 align:middle line:90%
is not fictional.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.745 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: No.

00:04:09.745 --> 00:04:10.360 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.280 align:middle line:90%
No, it actually is.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, but
it exists in real life.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:13.290 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: No.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.915 align:middle line:90%
No, it doesn't.

00:04:13.915 --> 00:04:14.810 align:middle line:90%
It's fictional.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:15.518 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:04:15.518 --> 00:04:18.045 align:middle line:84%
What about that site with
all those wild, stray cats?

00:04:18.045 --> 00:04:18.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: No.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.743 align:middle line:84%
First of all, what
you're thinking of,

00:04:19.743 --> 00:04:22.330 align:middle line:84%
and it's where it came from is
that when you go around Rome,

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.312 align:middle line:84%
you see these walls
and you see these digs.

00:04:24.312 --> 00:04:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And if you look down in
them, there's a plaque,

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.486 align:middle line:90%
and it tells you what it is.

00:04:27.486 --> 00:04:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And then there's cats
running around usually.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.705 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:04:29.705 --> 00:04:31.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: But in this
case, as far as I know,

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.930 align:middle line:84%
there is no archeol-- Now,
I'm going to Italy in May

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.680 align:middle line:84%
to fact check, because
I haven't been back

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.860 align:middle line:90%
in about 10 or 15 years.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:38.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, good.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.560 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.660 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And maybe there
is a site for the House of--

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.935 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, no.

00:04:40.935 --> 00:04:42.410 align:middle line:84%
I was probably just jumbling
what you were speaking about.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.760 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: No.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.880 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.630 align:middle line:84%
But maybe I made it so real
that you thought it was real.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have an
afterward in the book,

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.080 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
delineate what's fictional

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.790 align:middle line:84%
and what's not fictional,
because I think

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.700 align:middle line:84%
that, for instance, I
also was able to write

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.160 align:middle line:84%
this book because I was lucky
enough to know an aristocratic

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.720 align:middle line:84%
family in Tuscany and
visit their castle

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.720 align:middle line:90%
and visit their home.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I wondered about
that when I was reading it.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.330 align:middle line:84%
It seemed as though that
was an actual experience

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.620 align:middle line:90%
that you were basing it on.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.370 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.040 align:middle line:84%
So I had a wonderful,
deep experience

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.470 align:middle line:84%
that went over a
number of years.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How rich.

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: But I'm not
giving the correct name

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.005 align:middle line:84%
of their castle
and their family--

00:05:13.005 --> 00:05:13.076 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:05:13.076 --> 00:05:13.585 align:middle line:90%
Of course not.

00:05:13.585 --> 00:05:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: --just because I
just think it would be better.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.550 align:middle line:90%
It's not necessary.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then you have
the gorgeous, handsome artist,

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.750 align:middle line:84%
Armando, that, of
course, at first blush,

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.480 align:middle line:90%
all women fall in love with.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.940 align:middle line:90%
We can't help ourselves.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:25.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.707 align:middle line:90%
Armando Carolioni, right?

00:05:27.707 --> 00:05:28.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.789 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.820 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the
subject itself is really

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.490 align:middle line:84%
something that has disturbed
you for a long time

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.940 align:middle line:84%
and intrigued you
for a long time.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:37.225 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yes.

00:05:37.225 --> 00:05:38.974 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
something that I really

00:05:38.974 --> 00:05:41.170 align:middle line:84%
think needs to be
gotten out on the table.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And before we get
into it, I want

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.450 align:middle line:84%
to say what I appreciated
about this, even though it's

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:51.400 align:middle line:84%
a beautiful, fun, sexy
story that's carrying it,

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.510 align:middle line:84%
when you get into this, you're
talking multi-dimensionality.

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.690 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about
a condition that

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.700 align:middle line:84%
has been perpetrated by the
Roman Catholic Church that

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.070 align:middle line:84%
is just devastating to our
psyche that is actually being

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.015 align:middle line:84%
driven from other
dimensional forces.

00:06:06.015 --> 00:06:06.380 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
the part you don't ever

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:09.340 align:middle line:90%
hear come into the question.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.550 align:middle line:84%
It's certainly not going to make
"The New York Times." right?

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:12.225 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:06:12.225 --> 00:06:13.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it's important.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.855 align:middle line:84%
So tell us a little bit--
before we get deeply into it.

00:06:16.855 --> 00:06:18.480 align:middle line:84%
Right at the very
beginning of the book

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.520 align:middle line:84%
you talk about the
Church of Marcion

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.330 align:middle line:90%
and this figure, Marcion.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.810 align:middle line:84%
I found that really intriguing
because I knew nothing

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.530 align:middle line:84%
about this figure in
religious history.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.400 align:middle line:84%
So take some time
to explain to us who

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.020 align:middle line:84%
this was, when they
were, what they attempted

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.615 align:middle line:84%
to do to uplift and preserve
Christianity and why.

00:06:37.615 --> 00:06:40.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: So this
is Marcion of Pontus,

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:45.890 align:middle line:84%
and he was alive in the east
like in the region of Turkey,

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:47.390 align:middle line:90%
basic region of the Middle East.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And he was on the planet
from about 70 AD probably

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.950 align:middle line:90%
to about 150 AD.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.900 align:middle line:84%
What we know about
him historically

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.330 align:middle line:84%
was that he was
excommunicated in 144 AD.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.900 align:middle line:90%
We do have one exact date.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.150 align:middle line:84%
But what we do know about him
besides his excommunication

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.670 align:middle line:84%
by the Roman church
is that he was

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:11.070 align:middle line:84%
a bishop, an early
Christian bishop.

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And of course, most
people who were Christians

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.180 align:middle line:84%
were Jewish converts,
so of course, he

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.730 align:middle line:90%
has a Jewish background.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And then his father was also
an early Christian bishop.

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:21.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is
extremely interesting

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.276 align:middle line:84%
because his father
would have been

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:25.390 align:middle line:90%
the same age as Paul of Tarsus.

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And so Paul had a very
big influence on Marcion,

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.950 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not going to get into
New Testament and biblical

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.840 align:middle line:84%
things and I didn't
in the book either

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.230 align:middle line:90%
because it's pretty boring.

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.400 align:middle line:84%
But what's important
about Marcion is,

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.320 align:middle line:84%
he was an early
Christian bishop.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.800 align:middle line:84%
He had bishoprics or diocese
all over the Middle East

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.810 align:middle line:84%
and all over parts of Southern
Europe, and his church--

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:49.390 align:middle line:84%
the number of churches he
had, the number of bishops--

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:54.360 align:middle line:84%
was larger much, much larger
than the Church of Peter

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:59.800 align:middle line:84%
in Rome around 100 AD, and he
was a major, major influence.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.660 align:middle line:84%
For example, for
one thing, Marcion

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:07.340 align:middle line:84%
invented the whole system of
having dioceses and bishoprics

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.600 align:middle line:84%
in the church
itself, and he also

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.240 align:middle line:84%
wrote the first New
Testament canon.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.150 align:middle line:84%
He actually is the
person who came up

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:19.060 align:middle line:84%
with the idea of bringing
the scriptures into a canon,

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.000 align:middle line:84%
and then later on, once
he was excommunicated,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.370 align:middle line:84%
then the Roman church took
over the whole process

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:25.840 align:middle line:84%
of putting the
scriptures together.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
completely obscured his name.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.883 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, not only
obscured his name,

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.030 align:middle line:84%
this is a major
historical figure,

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:34.559 align:middle line:84%
and if you use your computer,
he always comes up in red.

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:36.109 align:middle line:84%
He even is one of
those-- you know

00:08:36.109 --> 00:08:38.400 align:middle line:84%
how when you try to use sexual
terms with your computer

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.000 align:middle line:84%
and it's red because
it's not allowed?

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:40.099 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:40.099 --> 00:08:41.299 align:middle line:90%
He comes up in red?

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:41.340 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:42.298 align:middle line:90%
Marcion is not allowed.

00:08:42.298 --> 00:08:43.919 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: M-A-R-C-I-O-N,
by the way.

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:44.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Right.

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:45.600 align:middle line:90%
Marcion of Pontus.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:50.750 align:middle line:84%
So Marcion of Pontus had the
biggest early church system,

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:53.310 align:middle line:84%
and he was the one who
put the canon together,

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.260 align:middle line:90%
and then he was excommunicated.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, what does
excommunication mean?

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.930 align:middle line:84%
It means, that he was taken
out of the line of succession

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:02.160 align:middle line:90%
of the bishops.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And then this means that
all of the people who

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.220 align:middle line:84%
were Marcionite bishops,
which was hundreds

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.800 align:middle line:84%
at the time, their
powers of succession

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.310 align:middle line:84%
were taken away, which
means that they then

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:15.960 align:middle line:84%
had no direct linkage
to Christ or to Jesus.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.420 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is really fascinating.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.890 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it amazing you
haven't heard of him?

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:18.998 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:09:18.998 --> 00:09:19.270 align:middle line:90%
I've never heard of him.

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: I've talked
to lots of people, even

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.565 align:middle line:84%
priests who haven't
heard of this person.

00:09:24.565 --> 00:09:26.330 align:middle line:90%
It's just absolutely incredible.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And so the reason the book
came for me was 30 years ago

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:33.300 align:middle line:84%
after I finished getting
a master's in theology

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:37.020 align:middle line:84%
with Matthew Fox, I wanted
to get a Ph.D. in patristics,

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.390 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to
base it on Marcion.

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:41.190 align:middle line:90%
So here we are 30 years later--

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have
this character.

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.470 align:middle line:84%
My character and
her name is Sarah.

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And Sarah is very much me in
the book in terms of her work,

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.020 align:middle line:84%
and Sarah is
working on this PhD.

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And this is what's of
critical importance:

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:57.310 align:middle line:84%
Marcion believed that the early
Christian church should not

00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:59.040 align:middle line:84%
attach itself to the
Hebrew scriptures.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is called
the Old Testament otherwise.

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:05.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Now,
the Christians--

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:09.570 align:middle line:84%
what I want to call it?-- took
pieces of the Hebrew scriptures

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:11.106 align:middle line:90%
and called it the Old Testament.

00:10:11.106 --> 00:10:13.480 align:middle line:84%
And there's lots of Hebrew
scripture they didn't include.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.630 align:middle line:84%
They just took the stuff
that backs up Christianity.

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And then they attached the
Acts and the books of the Bible

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:24.210 align:middle line:90%
to the Hebrew scriptures.

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:27.435 align:middle line:84%
So if you take your Bible
out, 1,000 pages of it

00:10:27.435 --> 00:10:30.470 align:middle line:84%
are Hebrew scriptures now
called the Old Testament

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:33.980 align:middle line:84%
and 200 pages of it are the
early Christian scriptures.

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:35.250 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that amazing?

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:36.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.430 align:middle line:84%
Even as a little kid, I
found that interesting.

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:40.409 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand
the need for that.

00:10:40.409 --> 00:10:41.200 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Right.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.420 align:middle line:84%
So Marcion believed-- this
is the critical thing--

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.360 align:middle line:84%
that the Jewish
God-- now, there's

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.550 align:middle line:84%
nothing anti-Semitic or
pejorative in Marcion's

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:50.520 align:middle line:90%
attitude at all.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.810 align:middle line:84%
Some of the Gnostics are pretty
anti-Semitic, not Marcion.

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:58.270 align:middle line:84%
Marcion believed that Yahweh
or Jehovah was the God of law,

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:01.560 align:middle line:84%
and the God of creating
like human structure

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.242 align:middle line:90%
and the God of human rulership.

00:11:04.242 --> 00:11:05.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Almost
kind of Saturnian.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:06.658 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Well, yes.

00:11:06.658 --> 00:11:09.610 align:middle line:84%
Saturnian and also the period
of time we're talking about

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:12.970 align:middle line:84%
is like 2000 BC up
to 0 AD in terms

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:15.800 align:middle line:84%
of the development of
the Hebrew scriptures,

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.444 align:middle line:90%
and this is the Age of Aries.

00:11:17.444 --> 00:11:19.110 align:middle line:84%
The other thing we
have to throw in here

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:20.690 align:middle line:84%
is the issue of precession
of the equinoxes.

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:21.273 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:21.273 --> 00:11:26.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: So the Age of
Aries is 2200 BC to like 0 AD.

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:30.287 align:middle line:84%
And then the Age of Pisces is
like 0 AD up to about 2100 AD.

00:11:30.287 --> 00:11:30.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Now.

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:30.990 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:31.820 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:35.930 align:middle line:84%
So now that we're shifting
into the Age of Aquarius,

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:37.930 align:middle line:84%
and people may wonder
what does it go backwards?

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:39.590 align:middle line:90%
Well, precession works that way.

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:43.670 align:middle line:84%
It goes towards Taurus,
Aries, Pisces, Aquarius.

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:45.920 align:middle line:84%
So now that we're going
to the Age of Aquarius,

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.430 align:middle line:84%
and I'm an Aquarian,
I really believe

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:51.600 align:middle line:84%
that we need to
reevaluate, and I also

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.140 align:middle line:84%
consider myself
to be a Christian.

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.560 align:middle line:84%
I can't handle
being in the church

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:55.684 align:middle line:90%
because of what's going on.

00:11:55.684 --> 00:11:58.740 align:middle line:84%
I am a Catholic, but
I've left the church.

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:01.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're doing the
journey, this young woman--

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:02.010 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:03.212 align:middle line:90%
In the novel, she goes--

00:12:03.212 --> 00:12:03.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is your journey.

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: --through
her journey and she

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:06.310 align:middle line:90%
leaves the church.

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And not a lot of it's
autobiographical really,

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.820 align:middle line:90%
but the process is.

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:13.100 align:middle line:84%
So I think and she
thinks that now

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:16.160 align:middle line:84%
that we've come into going
into the Age of Aquarius, which

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.330 align:middle line:84%
is going to be much more
of an Age of Enlightenment.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:21.800 align:middle line:84%
The Age of Pisces has been an
age of emotional processing

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:26.070 align:middle line:84%
because of the nature of Pisces
as a water sign and the nature

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:28.510 align:middle line:90%
of Neptune and spirituality.

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And so Marcion believed that
the God that Jesus was talking

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:36.780 align:middle line:84%
about was a God of love
and a God of compassion.

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And he simply was saying
Jesus came to this planet

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.230 align:middle line:84%
and he's a very, very
high being, by the way.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:46.060 align:middle line:84%
This is the first
book in a trilogy,

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.730 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to be exploring
who Jesus is much more

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:50.610 align:middle line:84%
deeply in the second
and the third book,

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:53.390 align:middle line:84%
but I wanted to set up a
foundation in the first book

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:55.560 align:middle line:84%
because I believe
that Jesus is a very

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.230 align:middle line:84%
highly, multi-dimensional
being who's actually

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:01.810 align:middle line:84%
an integrator of the
whole universe itself.

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:05.300 align:middle line:84%
So he came down and had an
incarnation on this planet

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:08.530 align:middle line:84%
in order to help people
let go of the God of law,

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:11.420 align:middle line:84%
and the need for control,
and the need for everything

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.870 align:middle line:84%
to have to be specifically
a certain way,

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:17.730 align:middle line:84%
and to bring in a
God, his father,

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:19.970 align:middle line:90%
a God of love and compassion.

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:24.170 align:middle line:84%
So Marcion had a whole teaching
program, and he went to Rome.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:26.130 align:middle line:84%
He went to Rome,
finally, in 140 AD

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:29.310 align:middle line:84%
because he was so frustrated
by what was going on

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.850 align:middle line:84%
and to plead his
case that we must not

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:35.320 align:middle line:84%
attach the Christian scriptures
to the Hebrew scriptures.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.052 align:middle line:84%
And the novel even
explores the fact

00:13:37.052 --> 00:13:38.760 align:middle line:84%
that the Jews didn't
really appreciate it

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.310 align:middle line:84%
very much, because
the Christians--

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:41.132 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They felt co-opted.

00:13:41.132 --> 00:13:41.510 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:44.093 align:middle line:84%
They picked and chose what they
liked, and then they said, oh,

00:13:44.093 --> 00:13:47.410 align:middle line:84%
and Isaiah said blah,
blah, blah back in 700 BC,

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:49.090 align:middle line:84%
he was talking
about Jesus coming.

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:52.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you're a group
of spiritual beings,

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.430 align:middle line:84%
a group of Jewish
people and you don't

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:56.325 align:middle line:84%
believe that Christ
is the messiah, what

00:13:56.325 --> 00:13:58.450 align:middle line:84%
is this reinterpreting what
Isaiah-- you know that.

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:00.260 align:middle line:84%
We could go on
and on about this.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:04.070 align:middle line:84%
But I really think Marcion
was right and so does Sarah.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And I'm bringing the issue into
a novelistic form, hopefully,

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.860 align:middle line:84%
that it will reach a wider
audience than nonfiction

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.150 align:middle line:84%
books generally can
reach because I think

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:14.750 align:middle line:84%
we need to start
thinking about this.

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:15.583 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, yes.

00:14:15.583 --> 00:14:18.255 align:middle line:84%
And then you start getting into
even the much more dark side

00:14:18.255 --> 00:14:20.340 align:middle line:84%
it, which we're
talking about, and this

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:22.690 align:middle line:84%
runs throughout it,
the priestly abuse.

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:24.150 align:middle line:84%
But before we go
there, one thing

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:26.700 align:middle line:84%
that you brought up-- it was
just a little bit in the book--

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.650 align:middle line:84%
was that the time
frame on it was

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:32.160 align:middle line:84%
that there were Magdalenite
worshipers as far

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.120 align:middle line:90%
back as 15,000 years.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:34.870 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:36.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tell us about that.

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.832 align:middle line:84%
I stumbled on that
and thought, OK.

00:14:38.832 --> 00:14:39.540 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:40.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed that you didn't
really understand that.

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:42.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I didn't.

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:44.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: I know,
and so I'm actually--

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:46.650 align:middle line:84%
this is wonderful to have an
interview because anything

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:47.790 align:middle line:84%
that you don't
understand I'm going

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:49.380 align:middle line:84%
to take a good,
close look at it.

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.410 align:middle line:84%
What happens in
the novel is Sarah

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:55.400 align:middle line:84%
becomes-- once she falls in
love with the reporter, Simon,

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.920 align:middle line:90%
she starts getting very psychic.

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And by the way,
this is very common

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:01.300 align:middle line:84%
because Sarah is a virgin,
and she's playing the role

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:04.370 align:middle line:84%
actually, of a Vestal
virgin of the Roman culture,

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:05.920 align:middle line:90%
which is kind of interesting.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And so she's awakening
sexually rather late

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:11.140 align:middle line:90%
because she's 25 years old.

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And so once she starts awakening
sexually, kundalini rising,

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:19.025 align:middle line:84%
she starts becoming extremely
psychic and also he gives her

00:15:19.025 --> 00:15:21.534 align:middle line:84%
an engagement ring, a ruby
crystal engagement ring,

00:15:21.534 --> 00:15:23.450 align:middle line:84%
which is part-- here it
is-- which is partly--

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is
your ruby crystal,

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:26.140 align:middle line:84%
which I have my own
version of it now.

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:26.640 align:middle line:90%
It's wild.

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:27.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Basically,
it's wonderful.

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:28.620 align:middle line:84%
It's been writing
the whole book.

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:29.680 align:middle line:84%
I just sit back
and enjoy myself.

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:30.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:31.250 align:middle line:90%
I felt the energy in that.

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:31.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:31.570 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:32.890 align:middle line:90%
It's really been very helpful.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:34.139 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So she
becomes very psychic--

00:15:34.139 --> 00:15:34.188 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:15:34.188 --> 00:15:34.580 align:middle line:90%
She becomes very psychic.

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:36.746 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and I was talking
about my misperception

00:15:36.746 --> 00:15:38.020 align:middle line:90%
about this Magdalenite thing.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:38.811 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Right.

00:15:38.811 --> 00:15:41.960 align:middle line:84%
So she becomes very psychic,
and she and Simon are already

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.960 align:middle line:84%
doing some kind of remote
viewing under the Vatican,

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.800 align:middle line:84%
and they're already
exploring things

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.707 align:middle line:84%
like black masses going
on under the Vatican,

00:15:48.707 --> 00:15:50.790 align:middle line:84%
and those are some of
themes that are in the book.

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:52.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're going
to talk about that in a sec

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:52.920 align:middle line:90%
after this.

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:53.383 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: We'll talk
about that in a minute.

00:15:53.383 --> 00:15:53.883 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:53.883 --> 00:15:56.860 align:middle line:84%
But when she goes down into
the lower part of the Vatican

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:59.770 align:middle line:84%
herself, she sees a
timeline playing itself out.

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:02.520 align:middle line:84%
Timeline starts and 50,000
BC, and these are just

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:05.330 align:middle line:84%
visions on her part, and
we're going to definitely want

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.210 align:middle line:84%
to discuss like are they
real or are there visionary.

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:09.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What was
she tapping into?

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: The core thing
I'm exploring in this book

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:15.120 align:middle line:84%
is the how visions actually
come from another dimension

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.320 align:middle line:84%
but they affect us
here, which explains

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.170 align:middle line:84%
a lot about these
abuse patterns.

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:20.800 align:middle line:84%
But what happens
for Sarah is she

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.140 align:middle line:84%
sees a visionary timeline
under the Vatican going back

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:25.200 align:middle line:90%
50,000 years.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.570 align:middle line:84%
The first group of people are
Neanderthal at that point.

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's another
sub theme in this book

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.230 align:middle line:84%
because the Neanderthal
culture was destroyed,

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:37.280 align:middle line:84%
and it has a lot to do with
some of the themes in the book.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.415 align:middle line:84%
But then the next time
line is Magdalenian.

00:16:39.415 --> 00:16:40.115 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:40.115 --> 00:16:41.073 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: All right.

00:16:41.073 --> 00:16:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And so the Magdalenian
people were

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.757 align:middle line:84%
a group of very
spiritual people.

00:16:45.757 --> 00:16:46.840 align:middle line:90%
They weren't Neanderthals.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:51.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's Cro-magnon, and
they're about 20,000 BC

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:52.747 align:middle line:90%
to about 10,000 BC.

00:16:52.747 --> 00:16:54.580 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't have to
do with the Magdalene,

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:57.330 align:middle line:90%
it's the Magdalenian culture.

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:00.640 align:middle line:84%
However, who says
Mary Magdalene has not

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:04.609 align:middle line:84%
been named because of
the Magdalenian culture.

00:17:04.609 --> 00:17:09.300 align:middle line:84%
Because the Magdalenian culture
in southern France, and Spain,

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.180 align:middle line:84%
and southern
Germany, was probably

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:14.300 align:middle line:84%
one of the most
spiritually-advanced goddess

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.420 align:middle line:90%
cultures on the planet.

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:16.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going to say
it was matriarchal in nature.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:17.839 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW:
Matriarchal and also

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:20.119 align:middle line:84%
a very, highly-spiritual
goddess culture,

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:22.449 align:middle line:84%
very, very beautiful
culture as far

00:17:22.449 --> 00:17:24.220 align:middle line:90%
as we can see from the cave art.

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And then there was a cataclysm
around 9,000-- 10,000 BC,

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:30.300 align:middle line:84%
and that was the end of
the Magdalenian culture.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.360 align:middle line:84%
Then the Neolithic
culture came in

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.860 align:middle line:84%
and there's another vision that
she has of Neolithic people.

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, she
comes up to a vision

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:40.150 align:middle line:84%
of what was going on
under the Vatican right

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:43.590 align:middle line:84%
around the time of the building
of the Vatican Basilica.

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:44.500 align:middle line:90%
So that's what it is.

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So thank
you for sharing that,

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:49.200 align:middle line:84%
and it does add that
nuance to it that maybe she

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.882 align:middle line:90%
is of that energetic force.

00:17:50.882 --> 00:17:51.632 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:17:51.632 --> 00:17:54.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so you
alluded to a moment

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:57.610 align:middle line:84%
ago, where we're talking
about black mass, and let's

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:01.161 align:middle line:84%
talk about the Vatican and
what they stumbled upon

00:18:01.161 --> 00:18:03.410 align:middle line:84%
or what they came to understand
through their research

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:06.905 align:middle line:84%
about what's under the
Vatican, and about black mass,

00:18:06.905 --> 00:18:07.940 align:middle line:90%
and about 24/7.

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.124 align:middle line:90%
So what is all this?

00:18:09.124 --> 00:18:09.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: OK.

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:11.220 align:middle line:84%
This is the part
of the book that

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:13.200 align:middle line:84%
starting to work with
the issue of the fourth

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.810 align:middle line:90%
and the third dimension.

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And so the book is playing
with both dimensions

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:22.320 align:middle line:84%
and it's not being specific
exactly about what's going on.

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.052 align:middle line:84%
The different characters are
having different experiences.

00:18:25.052 --> 00:18:27.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --in different
timelines and dimensions.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:28.843 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Some
of their experiences

00:18:28.843 --> 00:18:31.557 align:middle line:84%
are third dimensional where
Sarah's abilities have

00:18:31.557 --> 00:18:33.640 align:middle line:84%
to do with being able to
read the forth dimension.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.179 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which you
were able to do.

00:18:35.179 --> 00:18:36.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Which I can.

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:36.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:36.853 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course.

00:18:36.853 --> 00:18:39.227 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: So what's going
on with the fourth dimension

00:18:39.227 --> 00:18:41.140 align:middle line:84%
is that the fourth
dimension has the ability

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:46.010 align:middle line:84%
to create holograms and idea
forms that actually imprint

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:47.920 align:middle line:90%
and change the third dimension.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And a good example of this would
be a very violent Hollywood

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:54.560 align:middle line:84%
movie that gets created and
then four for five people

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.860 align:middle line:84%
go out and commit the
same crime the same way.

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.060 align:middle line:84%
Because they have
been instigated

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:02.580 align:middle line:84%
in the third dimension to
carry out a thought form

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:05.380 align:middle line:84%
that has actually been created
in the fourth dimension.

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:07.670 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I work
on this issue so hard

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:11.260 align:middle line:84%
is I believe that this is
what's behind the priestly abuse

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:12.280 align:middle line:90%
issue.

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.730 align:middle line:84%
I believe that
what's happening is

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:18.560 align:middle line:84%
that priests are being incited
by fourth-dimensional control

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.540 align:middle line:84%
patterns to carry out
actions, and I'm not even sure

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:24.020 align:middle line:84%
that they always even
remember what they were doing.

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:27.500 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that goes
on with abusive patterns that

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.350 align:middle line:84%
are carried out in
the third dimension

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:33.660 align:middle line:84%
is they're so strongly driven
by this fourth-dimensional,

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:37.180 align:middle line:84%
holographic thought form reality
that sometimes the participants

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.130 align:middle line:84%
don't even know
what they're doing.

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:41.715 align:middle line:84%
But the issue is, who's
creating the program?

00:19:41.715 --> 00:19:43.530 align:middle line:84%
What I'm much more
interested in is

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:45.832 align:middle line:84%
the issue, the fourth
dimensional program--

00:19:45.832 --> 00:19:47.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what I
want to find out about.

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:49.289 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: --that
causes thousands

00:19:49.289 --> 00:19:53.100 align:middle line:84%
and even millions of people to
suffer in the third dimension

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:56.030 align:middle line:84%
is a bigger deal than the
person who actually carries out

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:56.530 align:middle line:90%
an action.

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:58.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's go
back into "The Alchemy

00:19:58.430 --> 00:19:59.470 align:middle line:90%
of Nine Dimensions."

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:00.928 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at the
fourth dimension.

00:20:00.928 --> 00:20:02.465 align:middle line:84%
The rulers of the
fourth dimension.

00:20:02.465 --> 00:20:04.130 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Right Yeah.

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:04.730 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:07.320 align:middle line:84%
According to the
Pleiadians, now "The Alchemy

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.600 align:middle line:84%
of Nine Dimensions" originally
comes from "The Pleiadian

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Agenda," which I
channeled back in 1995.

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And what I did with
"The Pleiadian Agenda"

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:20.920 align:middle line:84%
was I brought through
whatever I was told.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.122 align:middle line:84%
I didn't change anything
that came through,

00:20:23.122 --> 00:20:25.080 align:middle line:84%
and the most disturbing
thing that came through

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:28.270 align:middle line:84%
in "The Pleiadian Agenda"
was that the Annunaki are

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:30.260 align:middle line:84%
the control of the
fourth dimension.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And that was a huge
struggle for me.

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:35.630 align:middle line:84%
I've been basically suffering
with that struggle of what

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:38.180 align:middle line:84%
does that mean, how does it
work, for at least 20 years

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:38.770 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:41.590 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, I wrote "Alchemy
of Nine Dimensions," which

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:45.150 align:middle line:84%
is a scientific exploration
of "The Pleiadian Agenda"

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:46.160 align:middle line:90%
material.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.500 align:middle line:90%
So I've been able to advance.

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.230 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a
left-brain analysis

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:51.037 align:middle line:90%
of a right-brain channeled book.

00:20:51.037 --> 00:20:52.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you know
what was interesting?

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:55.950 align:middle line:84%
After we finished those
two interviews on that,

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:58.950 align:middle line:84%
I realized we
barely even touched

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:00.790 align:middle line:84%
into the Annunaki and
the fourth dimension.

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:04.357 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, why was that
just missing from the interview?

00:21:04.357 --> 00:21:05.440 align:middle line:90%
I even had it in my notes.

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.630 align:middle line:90%
It's didn't come out.

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:07.255 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Isn't
that interesting?

00:21:07.255 --> 00:21:08.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I don't
know why didn't.

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:09.933 align:middle line:84%
So I thought it's
appropriate for what

00:21:09.933 --> 00:21:11.350 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
now that now--

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:13.099 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Well,
maybe it's because I've

00:21:13.099 --> 00:21:14.530 align:middle line:90%
written whole novel about it.

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:17.280 align:middle line:84%
Because the way it worked
historically speaking,

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:21.640 align:middle line:84%
we know that the Annunaki
were a Sumerian culture back

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:25.320 align:middle line:84%
around 3500 BC, which is
the beginning of-- we could

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.047 align:middle line:84%
go into the Carl
Calleman material.

00:21:27.047 --> 00:21:29.130 align:middle line:84%
This is the beginning of
the whole Mayan calendar,

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:33.170 align:middle line:84%
patriarchal phase, so that
timing is an important issue.

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:37.040 align:middle line:84%
Then what happens is, the
Sumerians became the Akkadians,

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.230 align:middle line:84%
and then they became
the Babylonians,

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:42.300 align:middle line:84%
and then, finally, the Hebrew
people came along around 1800

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:44.930 align:middle line:90%
to 2000 BC, Abraham.

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was when the
Hebrew people pulled together

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:53.480 align:middle line:84%
their scriptures, they
picked from all the creation.

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:56.150 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they took
the creation legends

00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:59.540 align:middle line:84%
and all the myths and stories
of the people throughout time.

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:03.930 align:middle line:84%
So what has happened is the
Annunaki religious hologram--

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:06.200 align:middle line:84%
and what it is is
really complicated.

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.980 align:middle line:84%
Like I don't agree
with Zecharia Sitchin,

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:10.460 align:middle line:84%
by the way, who isn't
with us anymore--

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:13.500 align:middle line:84%
about how it's necessarily
an extraterrestrial program.

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't agree with that,
but it could be true.

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:18.820 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think you have
to hold that in order to--

00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:19.695 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Regardless.

00:22:19.695 --> 00:22:22.300 align:middle line:84%
The implications of Annunaki
in the fourth-dimensional,

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:23.622 align:middle line:90%
field-projected thought forms--

00:22:23.622 --> 00:22:24.705 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:22:24.705 --> 00:22:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that's still having
the same effect regardless.

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:27.275 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Right.

00:22:27.275 --> 00:22:29.730 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that--
this is the thing that's

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:31.660 align:middle line:84%
kind of difficult to
say, but I believe

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:35.170 align:middle line:84%
that God that has
transformed through time

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:37.190 align:middle line:90%
transformed into Yahweh.

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:39.800 align:middle line:84%
In other words, like
the Annunaki's phase

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:44.010 align:middle line:84%
here and the Akkadian phase
is really the Age of Taurus.

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Then we go to the Age of Aries
where the deity transforms

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:51.310 align:middle line:84%
into Yahweh, and this is a
deity of power and control,

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:54.030 align:middle line:84%
and this is a master
of the patriarchy.

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And so the whole struggle
the last 5,000 years

00:22:57.010 --> 00:22:59.050 align:middle line:84%
has been the mastery
of the human race

00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:02.240 align:middle line:84%
by means of the patriarchy,
which is very destructive.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.450 align:middle line:84%
We're losing the
powers of the woman,

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:06.680 align:middle line:84%
and we're losing the
powers of the matriarchy.

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And I really think that we're
on the verge of a complete flip

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:11.100 align:middle line:84%
at this point,
except that I think

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:12.890 align:middle line:90%
now it'll be a mixture of both.

00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:14.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we're
going to suddenly have

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:15.100 align:middle line:90%
a full bore matriarchy.

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:15.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:15.790 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't think so.

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:16.710 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't happen like that.

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:17.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: I don't
think any of us

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:19.220 align:middle line:90%
want a full bore matriarchy.

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:19.935 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We want balance.

00:23:19.935 --> 00:23:20.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:20.910 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:21.576 align:middle line:90%
We want balance.

00:23:21.576 --> 00:23:24.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now taking
that back story-- which

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:26.550 align:middle line:84%
is really important--
into consideration,

00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:30.800 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about the black mass
and what happens at the Vatican

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.830 align:middle line:84%
and what you in the book
depict as happening 24/7.

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:36.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: So notice
what happened here.

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:40.100 align:middle line:84%
By the Christians adopting
the Hebrew scriptures

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:43.740 align:middle line:84%
as the Old Testament, they
brought in that whole hologram

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:45.360 align:middle line:90%
that I just described.

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.640 align:middle line:84%
So what they did
was they ingested

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:52.070 align:middle line:84%
this whole abusive patriarchal
God program originally coming

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:54.560 align:middle line:84%
from the Annunaki,
and then they started

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.020 align:middle line:84%
to build the Roman
Catholic religion.

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
Roman Catholic religion,

00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:02.570 align:middle line:84%
the location is Rome, and
there's no accidents there

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:04.420 align:middle line:84%
as you can see in the
novel because Rome

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:06.450 align:middle line:90%
is an important power point.

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And so the Roman Catholic
Church at that point,

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:14.320 align:middle line:84%
began building the
church in order,

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:17.660 align:middle line:84%
like the Annunaki and,
Akkadian, and Sumerians,

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.610 align:middle line:84%
that's the Middle
East, but now we're

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:21.300 align:middle line:90%
talking about a global program.

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And so the Vatican
has slowly but surely

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:27.950 align:middle line:84%
been building a global control
program based on banking

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:30.710 align:middle line:84%
and based on the
priesthood carrying

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:34.140 align:middle line:90%
on the succession of Christ.

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:36.525 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But also carrying
on a succession of abuse.

00:24:36.525 --> 00:24:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Well, yeah.

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:39.920 align:middle line:84%
Because then you're
carrying on the succession

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:43.510 align:middle line:84%
of Christ, but what if the
succession is not legitimate?

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the things that I
had a wonderful time exploring

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:49.310 align:middle line:84%
is really getting deep
through the characters.

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:52.150 align:middle line:84%
What's great is, each one, one
guy is an Italian aristocrat,

00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:54.010 align:middle line:90%
another character is a reporter.

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:55.570 align:middle line:84%
They all have
different backgrounds,

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:57.300 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, they're
all able to look

00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:00.580 align:middle line:84%
at this from a
different point of view.

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're
really looking at here

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:06.920 align:middle line:84%
is the way this Vatic
control process has come up

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.570 align:middle line:84%
to this moment, and I think
it's about to explode.

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:13.480 align:middle line:84%
And so when I was 2/3 of
the way through the novel,

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:14.707 align:middle line:90%
Ratzinger Benedict resigns.

00:25:14.707 --> 00:25:17.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you speak of
him quite a bit in this book.

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.040 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Well, yeah.

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:19.955 align:middle line:84%
Ratzinger is a major
character in this book.

00:25:19.955 --> 00:25:22.507 align:middle line:84%
He was anyway, but
when he resigned,

00:25:22.507 --> 00:25:24.465 align:middle line:84%
I marched into the
breakfast room at that point

00:25:24.465 --> 00:25:26.810 align:middle line:84%
and said to my
husband, I got a novel

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:29.830 align:middle line:84%
because I wrote myself
right into the resignation.

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And the whole issue of papal
succession because the story

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:37.450 align:middle line:84%
is, Regina, the
papal succession,

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:41.020 align:middle line:84%
if there was any legitimacy
whatsoever in that whole story

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:46.460 align:middle line:84%
of the succession of the
bishops originally from Peter,

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:49.670 align:middle line:84%
it's been broken by what's
going on in the Vatican.

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:54.212 align:middle line:84%
And right now, we have
Ratzinger living in the Vatican.

00:25:54.212 --> 00:25:55.545 align:middle line:90%
Why is he living in the Vatican?

00:25:55.545 --> 00:25:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He's immune
from any justice, for one.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:58.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Nobody
can arrest him.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:00.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Because
he was served with--

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:01.817 align:middle line:90%
and this is all covered.

00:26:01.817 --> 00:26:03.400 align:middle line:84%
What I did in this
novel and I'm going

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.940 align:middle line:84%
to have an explanation
at the end.

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:10.210 align:middle line:84%
All of the discussions about
the priestly sexual abuse

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:13.930 align:middle line:84%
cases, all of the information
about the Vatican, everything

00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:16.400 align:middle line:90%
is factual and air tight.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.150 align:middle line:84%
What the characters
do with their lives

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:19.904 align:middle line:84%
and where they go
travel is all fictional.

00:26:19.904 --> 00:26:20.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: But the background
material is all factual.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the percentage
you use in the book is somewhere

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.300 align:middle line:90%
between 25% and 30%.

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:27.050 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:31.152 align:middle line:84%
And that's coming from one of
the best Catholic investigators

00:26:31.152 --> 00:26:32.860 align:middle line:84%
into priestly sexual
abuse, Thomas Doyle.

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:33.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
the percentage

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:35.924 align:middle line:84%
of the priests who have
indulged in sexual abuse.

00:26:35.924 --> 00:26:37.090 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Since the '60s.

00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:37.590 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:41.802 align:middle line:84%
And his solid estimates are
20% to 25% of Catholic priests

00:26:41.802 --> 00:26:42.510 align:middle line:90%
have been abused.

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:45.600 align:middle line:84%
So that may be a person
who just slipped up once.

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:46.100 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:46.933 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But still.

00:26:46.933 --> 00:26:47.872 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: But no.

00:26:47.872 --> 00:26:49.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know
a number of people

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:52.020 align:middle line:84%
myself who I've bumped into
throughout my life thinking,

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:53.010 align:middle line:90%
really?

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:55.667 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of shocking for,
if I know that many people--

00:26:55.667 --> 00:26:56.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --then those
numbers certainly just

00:26:58.780 --> 00:26:59.820 align:middle line:90%
feel to be correct.

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And we left
the church initially

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.930 align:middle line:84%
because our children
were in danger.

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:06.607 align:middle line:84%
We got them out before
it was too late.

00:27:06.607 --> 00:27:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately, nothing
happened to our children,

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:10.565 align:middle line:84%
but some of the other
children were abused.

00:27:10.565 --> 00:27:11.148 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:11.148 --> 00:27:13.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And many, many
my friends, my Catholic mother

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:15.831 align:middle line:90%
friends can say the same thing.

00:27:15.831 --> 00:27:16.330 align:middle line:90%
It's huge.

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:16.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's huge.

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:18.073 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: This is huge.

00:27:18.073 --> 00:27:20.035 align:middle line:84%
It's so much bigger than
people realize it is.

00:27:20.035 --> 00:27:21.660 align:middle line:84%
And then another
thing you have to look

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:23.750 align:middle line:84%
at, which the novel
gets into, it's

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:27.760 align:middle line:84%
collapsing the church
internally because, for example,

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:30.420 align:middle line:84%
in the United States, the
parishes are being forced

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:33.230 align:middle line:84%
to sell their schools and
their churches in order

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:34.890 align:middle line:90%
to pay for these lawsuits.

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And Catholicism has
been a central fabric

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.520 align:middle line:90%
of American culture.

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the
characters is from Boston,

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:44.500 align:middle line:84%
because Boston Catholicism
is such a deep root,

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.552 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to follow
all the way through.

00:27:46.552 --> 00:27:48.010 align:middle line:84%
I think this trilogy
is going to be

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:49.697 align:middle line:90%
tracing the fall of the church.

00:27:49.697 --> 00:27:51.905 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and he's
having his cathartic process.

00:27:51.905 --> 00:27:52.450 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
he's dyed in the wool.

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:54.700 align:middle line:84%
He's deeply involved
with Boston.

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:54.920 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:55.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:57.177 align:middle line:90%
Sarah's father is Opus Day.

00:27:57.177 --> 00:27:57.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:58.420 align:middle line:90%
Opus Day.

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:00.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: He also --
he was abused as a child

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:01.910 align:middle line:90%
and can't remember.

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:04.400 align:middle line:84%
So the different characters
have different relationships

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:04.920 align:middle line:90%
with this.

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:06.711 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I asked
you a couple of times.

00:28:06.711 --> 00:28:08.392 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
the black mass?

00:28:08.392 --> 00:28:09.350 align:middle line:90%
What is the black mass?

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:10.016 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: OK.

00:28:10.016 --> 00:28:13.760 align:middle line:84%
The black mass is
a reputed thing

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.930 align:middle line:84%
that has been going on
since the Middle Ages

00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:19.040 align:middle line:84%
as far as I can tell, maybe
back as far as 500 BC,

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:23.060 align:middle line:84%
where the old system, goddess
system of hirogamos, which

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:26.870 align:middle line:84%
is the sexual intercourse
between the priest or the corn

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:28.530 align:middle line:84%
God or whatever
with the goddess.

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:30.430 align:middle line:84%
A woman plays the
role of the goddess.

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:32.320 align:middle line:90%
It's what creates fertility.

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.900 align:middle line:84%
It's what creates the
functioning of the climate

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:35.540 align:middle line:90%
cycles.

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:39.670 align:middle line:84%
It's what creates healthy
birthing and healthy sense

00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:40.810 align:middle line:90%
of genetics.

00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened
with the black mass was,

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:47.880 align:middle line:84%
there were rumors like
crazy, very credible rumors

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:50.520 align:middle line:84%
that people took
the Catholic mass

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:53.110 align:middle line:90%
and did a black mass ceremony.

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And basically, this
involves a woman

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:57.750 align:middle line:84%
being on the altar, sexual
intercourse on the altar,

00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:00.960 align:middle line:84%
so it's a reversal
of the Catholic mass.

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And I really think
it's clear that this

00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:05.900 align:middle line:84%
has been going on for
hundreds of years,

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:06.920 align:middle line:90%
but it's so under the cover.

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.056 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you say
there's a purpose in terms

00:29:08.056 --> 00:29:10.974 align:middle line:84%
of the multi-dimensionality
and the use of this energy.

00:29:10.974 --> 00:29:13.390 align:middle line:84%
Explain that part, because I
thought that was interesting.

00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:14.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And
so that's where I'm

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:16.040 align:middle line:84%
exploring it through
my characters.

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And so Claudia,
Armando's old girlfriend,

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:21.894 align:middle line:84%
is one of the people who
is one of the participants

00:29:21.894 --> 00:29:23.310 align:middle line:84%
in the black mass,
so I'm actually

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:25.880 align:middle line:84%
exploring it through
their experience.

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And all I've been
able to do with that

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:29.830 align:middle line:84%
since this is really
undercover stuff,

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:32.240 align:middle line:84%
but I really believe
this has been going on

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:34.630 align:middle line:90%
and is still going on.

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And I don't see it necessarily
as a negative thing.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.096 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be a reaction
to the control issues.

00:29:40.096 --> 00:29:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, is
it a transmutation--

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:42.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: It is
a transmutation.

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:44.179 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --of the
energies that are

00:29:44.179 --> 00:29:47.520 align:middle line:84%
being perpetuated kind of
above ground at the Vatican

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:51.420 align:middle line:84%
by the church by grounding it
into the old goddess energy

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:51.920 align:middle line:90%
fields?

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: I don't that people
in the church are doing it,

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:54.890 align:middle line:90%
primarily.

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:57.140 align:middle line:84%
I think it's people who
are very anti-church who

00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:58.140 align:middle line:90%
are participating in it.

00:29:58.140 --> 00:29:59.556 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I
mean they're doing

00:29:59.556 --> 00:30:01.860 align:middle line:84%
it to counter-effect
those energies in a sense.

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:02.610 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:03.930 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:08.350 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, I'd rather let
people experience this.

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:11.150 align:middle line:84%
But I'm dealing with
all of these issues

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:14.020 align:middle line:84%
like Sarah's visions,
the black mass,

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:16.410 align:middle line:84%
the issue of masses going
on under the Vatican.

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:19.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm dealing with all of them
from a fictional perspective

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:20.980 align:middle line:84%
and a multi-dimensional
perspective

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:22.490 align:middle line:84%
because I actually
think they can't

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:24.650 align:middle line:90%
be understood any other way.

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And regarding, for instance,
the issue of masses,

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:31.190 align:middle line:84%
there's a description in the
book of caves under the Vatican

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:34.180 align:middle line:84%
to the four directions
under the basilica where

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:36.480 align:middle line:90%
masses are going on 24/7.

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:39.470 align:middle line:84%
This was something that was
told to me by a Catholic priest,

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:42.680 align:middle line:84%
and of course, I can't
reveal the source on this.

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And so I -- years and years
ago, this was told to me like 30

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:46.730 align:middle line:90%
years ago.

00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And so I've been thinking
about that ever since,

00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:53.016 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know how third
dimensional it actually is,

00:30:53.016 --> 00:30:54.890 align:middle line:84%
but I think there's
something going on there.

00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the things I
went after deeply in this novel

00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:01.640 align:middle line:84%
is what is really going on
with the power of the mass.

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:04.850 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's not going on
24/7 under the Vatican,

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:07.580 align:middle line:90%
it's going on globally 24/7.

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:09.980 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really using the
Vatican just like a vortex,

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:13.480 align:middle line:84%
like a grand square vortex,
and that's so interesting

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.280 align:middle line:84%
because we're coming
up to a grand square

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:18.290 align:middle line:84%
in April, a major
astrological grand square.

00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Because grand
squares bring things

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.120 align:middle line:84%
into manifestation, and
so the Catholic church

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:29.220 align:middle line:84%
has literally manifested
itself as a global power entity

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:33.070 align:middle line:84%
by going all over the world
and taking over sacred sights.

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:35.670 align:middle line:84%
All of the Catholic churches,
especially the oldest ones,

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:40.610 align:middle line:84%
are all built on the top
of original power spots,

00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:43.387 align:middle line:84%
especially in the area of
the Magdalenian culture.

00:31:43.387 --> 00:31:43.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And Notre-Dame, for
example, and others, yes.

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:46.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:47.223 align:middle line:90%
All of the churches.

00:31:47.223 --> 00:31:49.740 align:middle line:90%


00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And we have letters
from Augustine of Hippo

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:56.560 align:middle line:84%
back in 600 AD
instructing the priests

00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:58.430 align:middle line:84%
as they went up
north into Germany

00:31:58.430 --> 00:32:00.100 align:middle line:84%
and went into
England and Scotland,

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:03.320 align:middle line:84%
and all that, to find the
power spots of the people,

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:06.210 align:middle line:84%
and get the land, and build
the church right there.

00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:10.060 align:middle line:84%
So what they've done is, they've
created this system of building

00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:13.100 align:middle line:84%
churches on power places,
and the churches usually

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:14.100 align:middle line:90%
are fairly tall.

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:17.490 align:middle line:84%
There's always a goal to have
a church be fairly tall so you

00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:20.790 align:middle line:84%
can activate the
power spot, which

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:23.780 align:middle line:84%
is under the earth-- the
first and second dimension--

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:28.430 align:middle line:84%
and then you can use the mass
to control this activation.

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:30.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you think
about it with churches,

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:33.060 align:middle line:84%
churches are like a
multi-dimensional cap

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:34.520 align:middle line:90%
over Earth force.

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:37.420 align:middle line:84%
So my issue is, what is
going on with the mass?

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And the book is
working with the idea

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:42.200 align:middle line:84%
that the mass was a
carry over of the Hebrew

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:44.740 align:middle line:84%
sacrificial rituals,
which are coming

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:48.460 align:middle line:84%
from the Canaanite sacrificial
rituals all the way back,

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:50.065 align:middle line:84%
and I think it's
time to stop it.

00:32:50.065 --> 00:32:52.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, what
better way to stop it

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:59.010 align:middle line:84%
than to have revealed these
distorted and dark practices

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:01.320 align:middle line:84%
at a time when, as you
say astrologically,

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:04.200 align:middle line:84%
the planet has this
square descending

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:07.497 align:middle line:84%
upon it for wholesale
change on a systemic level.

00:33:07.497 --> 00:33:08.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:11.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it seems to
me that it's perfect time.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.980 align:middle line:84%
Your book is perfect timing,
and to speak about this openly,

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:17.230 align:middle line:84%
it's the correct
time to do that.

00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
Ratzinger himself.

00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:23.510 align:middle line:84%
Ratzinger had a bit of a
shadow in his past as well.

00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:28.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was the one
incident I think in Poland,

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:30.642 align:middle line:84%
satanic rituals more
than 20 years ago.

00:33:30.642 --> 00:33:31.392 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:33:31.392 --> 00:33:32.156 align:middle line:90%
In Holland.

00:33:32.156 --> 00:33:33.235 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What?

00:33:33.235 --> 00:33:33.735 align:middle line:90%
Holland.

00:33:33.735 --> 00:33:33.820 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:36.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: I'm not covering
satanic rituals in the book.

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:36.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, you're not.

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:37.270 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:39.600 align:middle line:84%
Simply because I have not
had any experience with it.

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm only going after
stuff I really know.

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:43.580 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, there's
very credible evidence

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:46.000 align:middle line:84%
that Ratzinger and some
high church officials

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.270 align:middle line:84%
and high politicians in
Holland were involved

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:53.460 align:middle line:84%
in a satanic ritual
of a little girl.

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:55.506 align:middle line:84%
One witness came
forth and people

00:33:55.506 --> 00:33:56.630 align:middle line:90%
started listening turn her.

00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:59.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, a second one has come
forth who were actually there,

00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:00.670 align:middle line:90%
and this is building.

00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:03.460 align:middle line:84%
Here is the critical
thing, Regina.

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:08.310 align:middle line:90%
This occurred August 16, 1987.

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:13.239 align:middle line:84%
Now, anybody who knows anything
about harmonic convergence,

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:15.830 align:middle line:84%
remember harmonic
convergence, August 16

00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:22.880 align:middle line:84%
and August 17, 1987, which was
a directed time of ascension

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:26.679 align:middle line:84%
and the connection into
the universal realm

00:34:26.679 --> 00:34:28.800 align:middle line:84%
delineated the Mayan
calendar, and it

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:32.820 align:middle line:84%
would appear that this ritual
was conducted to shut it down.

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:33.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:35.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is the day
before, people gathering,

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:39.309 align:middle line:84%
I was at Mount Shasta,
all over the world.

00:34:39.309 --> 00:34:41.434 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: All we know
about the satanic rituals,

00:34:41.434 --> 00:34:43.107 align:middle line:90%
it occurred in mid-August.

00:34:43.107 --> 00:34:43.940 align:middle line:90%
That's close enough.

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:44.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:45.170 align:middle line:90%
That's close enough.

00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:45.914 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:34:45.914 --> 00:34:46.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:47.080 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:53.455 align:middle line:84%
So that's a sidebar in the book,
but Ratzinger is definitely a--

00:34:53.455 --> 00:34:54.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:54.699 align:middle line:90%
A shadowy figure.

00:34:54.699 --> 00:34:56.276 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: I can't
even call him Benedict,

00:34:56.276 --> 00:34:57.880 align:middle line:84%
because I love Saint
Benedict so much.

00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:58.460 align:middle line:90%
I can't stand it.

00:34:58.460 --> 00:34:58.553 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:58.553 --> 00:34:59.080 align:middle line:90%
We get that.

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:01.680 align:middle line:84%
So he's exactly, I guess, he's
hiding out where he needs to.

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:03.445 align:middle line:84%
He's a prisoner of
his own device now.

00:35:03.445 --> 00:35:06.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Well, there's
a nunnery in the Vatican

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:09.570 align:middle line:84%
that was built so
that nuns, women

00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:12.000 align:middle line:84%
could go to pray for the
pope and pray for the church.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.670 align:middle line:84%
They kicked all the women
out and Ratzinger's in there.

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:16.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What a rat.

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:18.860 align:middle line:90%
No. but anyway, OK.

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:20.661 align:middle line:84%
What about -- this
isn't in the book,

00:35:20.661 --> 00:35:22.910 align:middle line:84%
but I want to know if it's
anything that you've looked

00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:25.075 align:middle line:84%
into or studied, the
notion of the black pope.

00:35:25.075 --> 00:35:25.975 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: The black pope?

00:35:25.975 --> 00:35:26.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The black pope.

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:27.030 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:28.290 align:middle line:90%
This actually is in the book.

00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:29.831 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I don't
remember that part.

00:35:29.831 --> 00:35:30.680 align:middle line:90%
Could you tell us?

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: I'm touching on the
issue in the book of the Fatima

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:37.900 align:middle line:84%
prophecies and the prophecies
of Malachi and the issue

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:39.417 align:middle line:84%
of the black pope,
Petrus Romanus--

00:35:39.417 --> 00:35:40.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:40.320 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: --and the
issue of the last pope.

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.724 align:middle line:84%
And I'm leaving Pope
Francis, I don't

00:35:44.724 --> 00:35:46.140 align:middle line:84%
mind him being
called Pope Francis

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:47.790 align:middle line:84%
because I think he may
really be a good guy.

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:48.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It seems like it.

00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And so I'm leaving
him on the fence in the novel

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:53.685 align:middle line:84%
because it -- because basically
the novel ends a couple

00:35:53.685 --> 00:35:54.950 align:middle line:90%
of months after he came in.

00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are you going
to get into Francis?

00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:56.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yes.

00:35:56.570 --> 00:35:57.590 align:middle line:90%
In the second book.

00:35:57.590 --> 00:35:59.800 align:middle line:84%
But I realized there's
no way, in this book,

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:01.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have
the information.

00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:03.500 align:middle line:90%
We'll see what happens.

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, when he went
after the world of finance

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:08.299 align:middle line:90%
within two weeks.

00:36:08.299 --> 00:36:09.381 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:36:09.381 --> 00:36:11.040 align:middle line:84%
He went after some
key fin-- he got rid

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:16.120 align:middle line:84%
of Tarcisio Bertone, a
very, very black cardinal.

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:18.689 align:middle line:84%
So he's been cleaning
out some people.

00:36:18.689 --> 00:36:21.230 align:middle line:84%
You know, he's lucky he's still
alive at this point with what

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.570 align:middle line:90%
he's doing.

00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:21.855 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:21.855 --> 00:36:22.660 align:middle line:90%
That he hasn't been poisoned.

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:24.409 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: So to me,
the judgment's out.

00:36:24.409 --> 00:36:28.130 align:middle line:84%
There's issues of his
background in Argentina

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:32.077 align:middle line:84%
when he was running one
of the Jesuit facilities.

00:36:32.077 --> 00:36:33.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's the accusation?

00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:35.701 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: I forget the
title that you have for that,

00:36:35.701 --> 00:36:39.400 align:middle line:84%
but he was running a major group
of the Jesuits in Argentina.

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:41.740 align:middle line:84%
But this was the time
of the revolution

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:44.114 align:middle line:84%
and this was a time
of the struggle.

00:36:44.114 --> 00:36:45.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh,
against the Perones?

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:47.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Anybody who's
ever been in a situation

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:49.168 align:middle line:84%
like that and you're
playing a role

00:36:49.168 --> 00:36:52.025 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying to do
something to save people,

00:36:52.025 --> 00:36:53.900 align:middle line:84%
sometimes you do this,
sometimes you do that.

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:54.950 align:middle line:90%
I just don't know.

00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:56.850 align:middle line:84%
I would say that the
number of complaints

00:36:56.850 --> 00:37:00.790 align:middle line:84%
against his behavior during
that time are not considerable,

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:03.210 align:middle line:84%
so I'm just going to
keep my eye on him.

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:06.420 align:middle line:84%
But it's pretty clear
to me who Ratzinger is.

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:07.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:10.114 align:middle line:84%
So at least he's
out of the picture.

00:37:10.114 --> 00:37:11.280 align:middle line:90%
What about the whole notion.

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:15.780 align:middle line:84%
You talk about these sacred
spots and the 12 degrees

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:16.429 align:middle line:90%
longitudinally.

00:37:16.429 --> 00:37:17.220 align:middle line:90%
What is that about?

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:17.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:23.130 align:middle line:84%
This is bringing in the work
of Carl Johan Calleman who

00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:26.320 align:middle line:84%
wrote about the whole issue of
nine underworlds, the creation

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:30.230 align:middle line:84%
of the Mayan calendar going
back 16.4 billion years.

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most
interesting concepts and ideas

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:36.020 align:middle line:84%
that Calleman has
explored is the issue

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:39.410 align:middle line:84%
of a midline at 12
degrees east longitude.

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And this midline, if
you look at a map,

00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:45.340 align:middle line:84%
would run into Africa right
about where Gabon is located,

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:47.520 align:middle line:84%
then it comes up
through Tunisia,

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:49.010 align:middle line:84%
and then it comes
up through Italy,

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:50.770 align:middle line:84%
and then it goes
up through Germany,

00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:53.400 align:middle line:84%
and up through Gothenburg,
and keeps going north.

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And Calleman developed the
idea that on the eastern side

00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:00.280 align:middle line:84%
of this midline, there
were certain forces

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:03.580 align:middle line:84%
playing on the Western side,
certain forces where at play,

00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:05.820 align:middle line:84%
and that there's
huge conflict that

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:07.850 align:middle line:90%
gets activated at the midline.

00:38:07.850 --> 00:38:11.920 align:middle line:84%
So I got into this idea
because the Vatican is located

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:17.120 align:middle line:84%
on the midline, and the
third Fatima prophecy says

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:19.770 align:middle line:84%
that what's going to
happen is, the East is

00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:21.104 align:middle line:90%
going to conquer the West.

00:38:21.104 --> 00:38:22.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know
whether the East

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:23.728 align:middle line:90%
is going to conquer the West.

00:38:23.728 --> 00:38:25.670 align:middle line:84%
If they do, it will be
the end of the planet,

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:27.130 align:middle line:84%
and if the West
conquers the East,

00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:28.240 align:middle line:84%
it will be the
end of the planet.

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're
going to continually go

00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:31.610 align:middle line:90%
back and forth like this.

00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:33.860 align:middle line:84%
But it shows that
tremendous conflict

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:36.060 align:middle line:84%
that's operative
right at the midline.

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of the ways
the Vatican has developed

00:38:38.970 --> 00:38:42.520 align:middle line:84%
global power is to play
with that polarity.

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.700 align:middle line:84%
So then I'm dealing
with the issue

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:47.330 align:middle line:84%
of under the Vatican and
the lower dimensions,

00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:49.810 align:middle line:84%
and the book is getting
into the underworld,

00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:51.910 align:middle line:84%
the issue of the
demons, all that.

00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:53.480 align:middle line:90%
So I'm playing with all of it.

00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And my main issue
with all of it is

00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:57.660 align:middle line:84%
trying to look at
it from a third

00:38:57.660 --> 00:38:59.880 align:middle line:84%
and a fourth dimensional
point of view,

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:01.970 align:middle line:84%
because people get really
confused about this.

00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:04.520 align:middle line:84%
One example would be,
for, me David Icke

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:05.920 align:middle line:84%
doesn't understand
the difference

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:08.128 align:middle line:84%
between the third and the
fourth dimension very well.

00:39:08.128 --> 00:39:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He's tapping
into the Annunaki, perhaps

00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:12.220 align:middle line:90%
motives, agendas, and so forth.

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:13.450 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying that
other dimension is missing.

00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:15.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And I
love David Icke's work.

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:15.768 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I do too.

00:39:15.768 --> 00:39:16.393 align:middle line:90%
He's a brother.

00:39:16.393 --> 00:39:19.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: But I think
he feels like the reptilian

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.654 align:middle line:84%
agenda is more 3D
than it actually is.

00:39:21.654 --> 00:39:22.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:25.730 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: So I'm using
Armando who is possessed

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:28.890 align:middle line:84%
by dark forces
until he actually--

00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:30.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Part of this
elite Italian family.

00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:33.380 align:middle line:84%
Very beautiful, very artistic,
very seductive character.

00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:34.713 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Classic blue blood.

00:39:34.713 --> 00:39:36.230 align:middle line:84%
Classic blue blood,
reptilian line.

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:38.400 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not denying
the existence of this.

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:40.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm attempting to
flesh it out more

00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:42.850 align:middle line:84%
in terms of helping
us understand

00:39:42.850 --> 00:39:45.135 align:middle line:84%
what kind of integrity
do you have in 3D?

00:39:45.135 --> 00:39:47.230 align:middle line:90%
Do you really have free will?

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:51.450 align:middle line:84%
Can demons and reptiles and all
that destroy your free will?

00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:54.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't think so when
people have clear integrity.

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:55.900 align:middle line:84%
So the characters are
playing with that,

00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:58.270 align:middle line:84%
like what does it take
to be a person who

00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:02.500 align:middle line:84%
is beyond being impacted by
fourth-dimensional forces.

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:05.060 align:middle line:90%
So Simon's father is a Magus.

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:09.320 align:middle line:84%
He's a Magus in a Jewish
line coming from Isaac Luria,

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:11.445 align:middle line:84%
or Luria is how
you pronounce that.

00:40:11.445 --> 00:40:13.320 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just playing with
all of those things.

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:15.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And each one
going through their own self

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:19.530 align:middle line:84%
examination and going through
their own transformations

00:40:19.530 --> 00:40:22.020 align:middle line:84%
partially or fully depending
on the character, which

00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:24.580 align:middle line:84%
leaves you a lot to play with
in your next couple of books.

00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:27.073 align:middle line:84%
One thing, you weren't
talking about it

00:40:27.073 --> 00:40:29.770 align:middle line:84%
in the book that I
recall, that I look at

00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:34.200 align:middle line:84%
is, the commonality of the
behavior between the Vatican

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:36.700 align:middle line:84%
and the Catholic
church and their darker

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:37.695 align:middle line:90%
practices in Hollywood.

00:40:37.695 --> 00:40:38.811 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:40:38.811 --> 00:40:40.727 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very similar
energy between the two.

00:40:40.727 --> 00:40:40.758 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:40:40.758 --> 00:40:42.770 align:middle line:84%
Fourth dimensional,
third dimensional energy.

00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:44.820 align:middle line:90%
And this is important.

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:46.500 align:middle line:84%
The other thing
this novel is doing

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:50.190 align:middle line:84%
is it's really playing with the
timeline at the Mayan calendar.

00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:54.750 align:middle line:84%
So everything in the novel
builds up to December 21, 2012,

00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:57.200 align:middle line:84%
and so everything's moving
toward one point and then

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.880 align:middle line:90%
suddenly everything shifts.

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:00.380 align:middle line:90%
That's what happened to us.

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:03.160 align:middle line:84%
If people go back
and think about what

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:06.610 align:middle line:84%
was going on in January,
February, March, April, May

00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:08.650 align:middle line:84%
2013, which is when
the novel ends,

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:10.560 align:middle line:90%
everything shifted profoundly.

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:12.770 align:middle line:84%
So what I was doing
was, I was looking

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:16.760 align:middle line:84%
at the way people were shifting
after the calendar ended

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:18.530 align:middle line:84%
because the next
book is going to get

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:21.430 align:middle line:84%
into the actual
transformational process that's

00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:22.640 align:middle line:90%
coming up after the calendar.

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:24.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what's so amazing
is that we're sitting here

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:26.480 align:middle line:84%
having this conversation
that's going

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:29.400 align:middle line:84%
to be shared with many
thousands of people.

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And another time, a
few hundred years ago,

00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:33.770 align:middle line:84%
we would be experiencing
fire at our feet

00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:35.180 align:middle line:90%
for even talking about it.

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:38.730 align:middle line:84%
So we can just take,
I think, great heart

00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:40.845 align:middle line:84%
in how far we've come
as a species already.

00:41:40.845 --> 00:41:41.595 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:41:41.595 --> 00:41:44.400 align:middle line:84%
We really have, like the
main Italian journalist,

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:46.120 align:middle line:90%
a guy named something Nuzzi.

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:49.690 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember his first
name-- Gianluigi Nuzzi.

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:51.476 align:middle line:84%
He's the one who
really exposed what

00:41:51.476 --> 00:41:52.600 align:middle line:90%
was going on with Benedict.

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And he just said
in an interview,

00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:56.790 align:middle line:84%
he said that we're
getting someplace

00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:58.290 align:middle line:84%
because this book
would have never

00:41:58.290 --> 00:41:59.675 align:middle line:90%
been published 10 years ago--

00:41:59.675 --> 00:41:59.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:01.514 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: --but
now, now it's out.

00:42:01.514 --> 00:42:02.430 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's interesting.

00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:04.420 align:middle line:84%
It was published
in Italian, but it

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:05.910 align:middle line:84%
hasn't been translated
into English

00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:08.230 align:middle line:84%
even though people
are screaming for it.

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:10.950 align:middle line:84%
So people are keeping that lid
on it, so I blew the lid off.

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:11.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:12.820 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:14.300 align:middle line:90%
One thing.

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:18.290 align:middle line:84%
In part of the stop, they go out
on a tour of the city of Siena.

00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And the Duomo in Siena, I fell
so in love with the first time

00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:25.930 align:middle line:84%
I went there, I'd never
experienced any kind of edifice

00:42:25.930 --> 00:42:26.690 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:29.400 align:middle line:84%
For everyone else watching who
has been to the Duomo in Siena,

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:31.330 align:middle line:90%
what is it about that structure?

00:42:31.330 --> 00:42:33.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Well, think of
the black and white travertine

00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:35.220 align:middle line:90%
marble.

00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:40.375 align:middle line:84%
The cathedral in Siena is
the ultimate sort of yin

00:42:40.375 --> 00:42:43.520 align:middle line:84%
and yang and playing of
the dark and the light,

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:46.510 align:middle line:84%
and it goes back to the days
of the medieval synthesis.

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:50.110 align:middle line:84%
It was built between
about 1150 and 1300 AD

00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:52.420 align:middle line:84%
when the synthesis
was still powerful.

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:54.320 align:middle line:90%
What's the medieval synthesis?

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, back in the
Middle Ages, the church

00:42:56.870 --> 00:43:00.580 align:middle line:84%
had still not stomped
out the earlier cultures,

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:03.210 align:middle line:84%
and Siena has the
strongest imprint

00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:06.280 align:middle line:84%
at this point in time of
the medieval synthesis

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:08.350 align:middle line:84%
of any place on
the planet Earth.

00:43:08.350 --> 00:43:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And the way you can see this is
the town has these 17 contrade,

00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:16.430 align:middle line:84%
and the 17 contrade have
this medieval thing they do,

00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:20.050 align:middle line:84%
which is they have this
race called the Palio, which

00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:21.400 align:middle line:90%
is a horseback race.

00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And each one of the contrade
is a different animal,

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:28.180 align:middle line:84%
and if it goes back to
the saving of the species.

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:32.500 align:middle line:84%
The medieval synthesis
was profoundly ecological,

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:34.756 align:middle line:84%
and those codes are
being protected by Siena.

00:43:34.756 --> 00:43:36.422 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
interesting because you

00:43:36.422 --> 00:43:36.615 align:middle line:90%
can feel it when you go there.

00:43:36.615 --> 00:43:38.781 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And when you
go there, you can feel it.

00:43:38.781 --> 00:43:39.720 align:middle line:90%
You can feel it.

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:40.557 align:middle line:90%
I love Siena.

00:43:40.557 --> 00:43:42.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So for anyone
going to Italy soon,

00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:44.300 align:middle line:84%
you've got to go to
the Duomo in Siena.

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And then finally,
the story ends up,

00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:48.120 align:middle line:84%
which I assume you're
going to pick it up

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:53.477 align:middle line:84%
in Barcelona with
Gaudi's amazing work.

00:43:53.477 --> 00:43:55.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: So the book
ends with Simon and Sarah

00:43:55.560 --> 00:44:00.810 align:middle line:84%
going to La Sagrada Familia,
and it's obvious, at this point,

00:44:00.810 --> 00:44:02.440 align:middle line:90%
you want the sequel.

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:04.816 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, I'm going to
start writing it this summer,

00:44:04.816 --> 00:44:05.523 align:middle line:90%
and it will come.

00:44:05.523 --> 00:44:07.120 align:middle line:84%
It won't take as
long the second time.

00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:09.089 align:middle line:90%
The first one was hard.

00:44:09.089 --> 00:44:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Barbara,
thank you so much.

00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:12.620 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell how
honored I feel--

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Well, thank you.

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:15.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that you have
chosen to speak prematurely--

00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:17.870 align:middle line:84%
because the book is not out
just yet-- with us about this.

00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:18.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Thank you, Regina.

00:44:18.810 --> 00:44:20.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a fun
ride, and you're right.

00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:21.255 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready for the sequel.

00:44:21.255 --> 00:44:22.004 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:44:22.004 --> 00:44:22.970 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:23.720 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:25.210 align:middle line:90%
You're ready for Armando.

00:44:25.210 --> 00:44:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, a
transformed Armando.

00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:27.862 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:44:27.862 --> 00:44:30.460 align:middle line:90%


00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:33.520 align:middle line:84%
"The Ruby Crystal" is a
sexy, fun, and sometimes very

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:35.800 align:middle line:84%
adult ride chock full
of the hidden secrets

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:38.310 align:middle line:84%
of the elite power
structures and the Vatican

00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:40.280 align:middle line:84%
as you've gathered
from our conversation.

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:43.240 align:middle line:84%
The book will be
available in late 2014.

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:47.360 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.

00:44:47.360 --> 00:45:06.100 align:middle line:90%
