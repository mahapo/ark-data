>>REGINA MEREDITH:
It seems inevitable

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.600 align:middle line:10%
that when Westerners are feeling
disconnected from their spirit,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.690 align:middle line:10%
they head to the East or
South America for answers.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.720 align:middle line:84%
Ancient practices continue to
feed these isolated cultures,

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.730 align:middle line:84%
some of which we can learn from,
such as the notion of gratitude

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.940 align:middle line:90%
and humility.

Jeffrey Wium went to the
Andes to find his truth

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.040 align:middle line:84%

00:00:55.401 --> 00:00:56.202 align:middle line:90%
but you really--

00:00:56.202 --> 00:00:57.367 align:middle line:90%
>>JEFFREY: I did everything.

everything yourself?

>>JEFFREY: Thanks I had walked
away from that world in 2002.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.260 align:middle line:10%
I was in Hollywood.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.060 align:middle line:10%
I started directing, and I
just didn't find the content

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.917 align:middle line:10%
I wanted, and I left.

00:01:10.917 --> 00:01:13.500 align:middle line:10%
I actually was injured myself--
kind of that accidental waking

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.360 align:middle line:10%
up, that on purpose.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.401 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:01:15.401 --> 00:01:18.270 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: I went out into
small towns and high mountains

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.450 align:middle line:84%
and thought I was
done with that.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And then in 2008 I
received a vision

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.142 align:middle line:84%
to make the film while
I was in the Andes.

00:01:24.142 --> 00:01:25.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you
already had experience.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.350 align:middle line:84%
You said you were
directing before.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.439 align:middle line:84%
But you obviously knew
cinematography as well.

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:31.230 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: I started
out as a photographer.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, good.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.040 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: And then I went
into video and a cameraman

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.922 align:middle line:90%
and then producer.

00:01:34.922 --> 00:01:36.130 align:middle line:90%
I'd never made a film before.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.440 align:middle line:90%
I'd done TV.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.050 align:middle line:84%

doing something like this.

What I realized I had to
learn how not to direct

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.770 align:middle line:84%
and not how to produce and
how to get out of the way

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.020 align:middle line:90%
and receive this whole things.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah a whole
different deal with this film.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:48.730 align:middle line:90%
>>JEFFREY: Completely different.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:49.770 align:middle line:84%

take a quick peek at it

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.990 align:middle line:84%

further into your story?

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.390 align:middle line:90%

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.723 align:middle line:90%

And we're going to have
a couple more clips.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.444 align:middle line:84%
But we were talking
off camera, and you

00:03:13.444 --> 00:03:15.280 align:middle line:84%
said, shaman isn't
really the right word,

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.970 align:middle line:84%
which is what I've
applied to them.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.384 align:middle line:90%
So explain what it is.

00:03:18.384 --> 00:03:20.550 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: Well "shaman"
comes from an understanding

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.674 align:middle line:84%
in the North of anybody
working in medicine or ways

00:03:22.674 --> 00:03:25.090 align:middle line:90%
that we don't understand.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.820 align:middle line:84%
In the Andes, there's a
specific term called "paqo,"

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.720 align:middle line:90%
which means gate or gatekeeper.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.140 align:middle line:84%
It also means master
of the living energy.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.050 align:middle line:84%
So they have a
complete understanding

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.280 align:middle line:90%
of animistic consciousness.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.080 align:middle line:84%
For example, they know
how to make it rain.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.876 align:middle line:84%
They can cure cancer
through prayers.

00:03:38.876 --> 00:03:40.750 align:middle line:84%
They have a lot of things
that we have simply

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.350 align:middle line:90%
forgotten in the North.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And the difference between
a shaman and say a paqo

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.520 align:middle line:84%
would be a horizontal
versus a vertical tradition.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.160 align:middle line:84%
The shamanic will take
something and a perception

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.210 align:middle line:84%
of being out of harmony and
then bring balance to that.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.080 align:middle line:84%
Where as a paqo will
see that it's a swing,

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.910 align:middle line:84%
like health happens, a
homeostasis of movement.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And we don't want to
correct or change it.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.410 align:middle line:84%
But we want to help bring in
a pure energy to support it.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.815 align:middle line:84%
So the vertical aspect the paqo
uses is going into the eternal

00:04:08.815 --> 00:04:13.810 align:middle line:84%
or into the etheric realm and
then bringing that to earth

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.012 align:middle line:90%
and creating matter with it.

00:04:15.012 --> 00:04:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's done
through prayers and

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.070 align:middle line:90%
through different techniques.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.494 align:middle line:84%
Good, well, thank
you for correcting me

00:04:20.494 --> 00:04:22.700 align:middle line:84%

it to us so we

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.150 align:middle line:84%

we're dealing with.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.606 align:middle line:84%
But let's go into the
conversation about you.

00:04:28.606 --> 00:04:30.610 align:middle line:84%
You were leading
what a lot of people

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.330 align:middle line:84%
feel would be a very
kind of glamorous life,

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.740 align:middle line:84%
and you're in Paris,
and you're working

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.440 align:middle line:84%
for some kind of
high-end magazines.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Just tell us how you got
there from the suburbs,

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.720 align:middle line:84%
through that story,
and to where you felt

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.490 align:middle line:90%
you needed to leave it behind.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.764 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: Well, I grew up
in Northern California out

00:04:48.764 --> 00:04:51.430 align:middle line:84%
in nature, so I had a connection
to nature that was very strong.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:52.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Where was that?

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:53.110 align:middle line:90%
>>JEFFREY: In Redding.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Uh-huh.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.730 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: And interesting
enough, Mount Shasta,

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.146 align:middle line:84%
which is a very
powerful mountain,

00:04:57.146 --> 00:04:59.070 align:middle line:84%
was always kind
of on the horizon.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.480 align:middle line:84%
But I had no idea what that
was until I went back in my 30s

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.050 align:middle line:84%
and realized the power
of what Mount Shasta is.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.010 align:middle line:84%
And so in Redding and then on
to the suburbs of Sacramento

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.860 align:middle line:84%
I found that there
was a deeper calling

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.139 align:middle line:90%
that I didn't understand.

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:15.680 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have a reference point
in my immediate surroundings,

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.990 align:middle line:84%
whether it be school or going
to the mall or anything that

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.790 align:middle line:90%
was in media at that time.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:25.310 align:middle line:84%
So I put off going to university
and went out into the world.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And as I was going
out into the world

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.140 align:middle line:84%
and in different
cultures, I realized

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.910 align:middle line:84%
that I found myself
on my time off sitting

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.020 align:middle line:84%
in temples or caves
or monasteries

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.540 align:middle line:90%
in a really tranquil place.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And as I look back, there
was this deeper calling

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:38.960 align:middle line:90%
that was pulling me.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.970 align:middle line:84%
But I was completely
oblivious to it at the time.

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.760 align:middle line:84%
I worked in the
fashion industry.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.110 align:middle line:90%
I worked in television.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.200 align:middle line:90%
I worked in media.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.792 align:middle line:84%
And that had taken me to
many places around the world.

00:05:49.792 --> 00:05:51.250 align:middle line:84%
And then ultimately
I got to Paris.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: People love
hearing about that.

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.964 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that part too.

00:05:53.964 --> 00:05:56.750 align:middle line:90%


00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.130 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit
about your resume.

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:05.190 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: Well, I explored
the aesthetic in photography.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And I was in front of
camera for three years.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized
that you kind of

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.330 align:middle line:84%
come to the end of a program,
if you will, or a time.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And then you realize it's
not really feeling something

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.700 align:middle line:84%
deeper, even though I didn't
know what that deeper was.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.440 align:middle line:84%
So I went behind the
camera, and then I

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.030 align:middle line:90%
get to learn all the technical.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And I worked my way up
through the realms in New York

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.930 align:middle line:84%
and London and Paris
and Tokyo and Sydney

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.550 align:middle line:90%
and really got out in the world.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.465 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As a
fashion photographer?

00:06:29.465 --> 00:06:30.590 align:middle line:90%
>>JEFFREY: As an assistant.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:31.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: An assistant, OK.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.790 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: An assistant
to photographers

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:36.430 align:middle line:84%
or doing interviews of people--
artists and writers, things

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.190 align:middle line:90%
like that, government officials.

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:45.207 align:middle line:84%
And I kept finding myself drawn
to kind of the intangible,

00:06:45.207 --> 00:06:47.040 align:middle line:84%
and it was something
that was strange for me

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.330 align:middle line:84%
because I couldn't put my
finger on it because it

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:50.410 align:middle line:90%
was intangible.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.420 align:middle line:84%
But there was a
feeling here that I

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.690 align:middle line:84%
had that was so strong that
it wouldn't let me sleep.

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And so every time
I got to a place

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.930 align:middle line:84%
where I needed a break because
I'd work so hard and was tired,

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.230 align:middle line:84%
I would go on retreat, and
I'd find myself again out

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:05.110 align:middle line:90%
in nature.

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:06.735 align:middle line:84%
I would have these
mystical experiences

00:07:06.735 --> 00:07:08.790 align:middle line:90%
that I couldn't explain.

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:13.760 align:middle line:84%
For example, animals-- I was
at a monkey temple in Nepal.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.740 align:middle line:84%
And a couple hundred monkeys
came and sat around me

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.230 align:middle line:90%
and just stared at me.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And I really didn't know
what to do with that.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And other times I'd
have experiences

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.987 align:middle line:84%
where energetic beings
would show up in light form,

00:07:27.987 --> 00:07:29.070 align:middle line:90%
and they would talk to me.

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And again, I had no reference
growing up for any of this.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And so I desperately
started to seek out

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.540 align:middle line:84%
people that could explain
these mystical experiences that

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:37.640 align:middle line:90%
were happening.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.699 align:middle line:84%
And little by little
I came into contact

00:07:39.699 --> 00:07:41.240 align:middle line:84%
with elders and
different people that

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.940 align:middle line:90%
started to explain this to me.

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And as I developed
that aspect of my life,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.030 align:middle line:84%
I started to see that I
wasn't being fulfilled

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:54.362 align:middle line:84%
in the what I would call
superficial aspect of finding

00:07:54.362 --> 00:07:55.820 align:middle line:84%
your happiness by
buying something,

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.540 align:middle line:84%
by trying to fulfill
yourself outwardly.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:00.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were really at
the epicenter of the material

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:00.510 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:01.530 align:middle line:90%
>>JEFFREY: I was.

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:03.600 align:middle line:84%
I went into the heart
of darkness-- my own.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>>JEFFREY: Yeah.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And being
as sensitive as you

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:11.830 align:middle line:84%
are, how was that
showing itself to you,

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:13.430 align:middle line:84%
and what were you
observing in others

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:15.260 align:middle line:90%
who were in the game with you?

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: I saw a lack of
decency and a lack of respect,

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.380 align:middle line:84%
a lack of kindness,
an agenda of people

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:27.137 align:middle line:84%
trying to climb the ladder
and step over everybody else.

00:08:27.137 --> 00:08:28.970 align:middle line:84%
They would say one thing
to you to your face

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:31.140 align:middle line:84%
and then stab you in
the back the next day.

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And I just didn't feel
a cohesion in my body,

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:38.910 align:middle line:84%
and I felt my body
starting to break down.

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:39.710 align:middle line:90%
I was stressed out.

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:40.870 align:middle line:90%
I was working too much.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:42.710 align:middle line:84%
We'd have 16 to
20-hour production

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:46.400 align:middle line:84%
days for a month on end and
traveling to five continents.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.710 align:middle line:90%
And it just was wearing me down.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:49.510 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:50.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well-- go ahead.

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:52.628 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: I want to say no
matter how much perks they give

00:08:52.628 --> 00:08:54.870 align:middle line:84%
you and no matter how
nice the hotel was

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:57.690 align:middle line:84%
or first class this
or whatever, there

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:00.420 align:middle line:84%
was something that it couldn't
touch and it didn't provide.

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:02.550 align:middle line:84%
So I have a very
deep gratitude that I

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:07.160 align:middle line:84%
get to experience that and see
that I couldn't find what I

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.040 align:middle line:90%
was looking for outside myself.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.860 align:middle line:84%
But yet I didn't know
how to look inside.

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:14.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and what age
were you when all of this

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:15.300 align:middle line:90%
was playing out?

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.210 align:middle line:90%
>>JEFFREY: 21, 22, 23, 24.

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:19.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, yeah,
it's interesting.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:22.410 align:middle line:84%
That's a really
big dividing time.

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:25.880 align:middle line:84%
I had a similar experience
at the age of 26.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.320 align:middle line:84%
By this time, I was
first class flights

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:34.020 align:middle line:84%
to New York, to Rockefeller
Center, anchoring sports,

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:38.430 align:middle line:84%
and network sports, and, again,
the beautiful hotels, loads

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:40.510 align:middle line:84%
of people there to take
care of you and all.

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And I remember this
one defining day.

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:43.400 align:middle line:90%
It didn't feel good.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.610 align:middle line:84%
For some reason, it
just didn't feel good.

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:48.540 align:middle line:90%
And there was this one day.

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.300 align:middle line:90%
It was the Christmas season.

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:51.940 align:middle line:84%
I was going to
another playoff game

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.780 align:middle line:84%
to interview the head coach
before our weekend coverage.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And I saw a little
family of three or four

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:01.070 align:middle line:84%
of them-- I think
they had two children.

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:03.840 align:middle line:84%
So it must have been four
people-- getting on the plane,

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:04.680 align:middle line:90%
walking past me.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm in first class.

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And they had little bags of
presents for their family,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.900 align:middle line:90%
and they were so excited.

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.360 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, that's living.

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.770 align:middle line:84%
What I'm doing is something
totally different than that.

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:19.240 align:middle line:84%
And there was no
amount of anything

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.520 align:middle line:90%
that could make it feel good.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.920 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: Yeah,
I believe firmly

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.520 align:middle line:84%
that we have whatever
experience we

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.230 align:middle line:84%
want to have until we have
these turning point moments,

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:31.600 align:middle line:84%
where we recognize,
oh, it's not this.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.735 align:middle line:90%
It's about something else.

00:10:32.735 --> 00:10:32.952 align:middle line:90%


00:10:32.952 --> 00:10:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm--
love, connection,

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.690 align:middle line:84%
kindness, as you say
all of these things.

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:37.910 align:middle line:90%
But you went further.

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: Yeah, I found
that out in the high plateau

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:45.450 align:middle line:84%
of Tibet or up in the high Andes
or even with the Aboriginals

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:48.890 align:middle line:84%
that are way in the Outback
or the Inuits in the Arctic,

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:53.601 align:middle line:84%
there's a sparseness to their
life that is so profound,

00:10:53.601 --> 00:10:54.850 align:middle line:90%
and there's such a simplicity.

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:56.980 align:middle line:84%
But there's such
a sophistication

00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:00.467 align:middle line:84%
in their emotionality and in
their weave in their villages

00:11:00.467 --> 00:11:01.300 align:middle line:90%
and in their family.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:03.850 align:middle line:84%
There's something there
that, in large part,

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:05.970 align:middle line:84%
we've lost in the West
and we've tried to replace

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:07.420 align:middle line:90%
with these other things.

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And so for so many
of us, we go, and we

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.720 align:middle line:84%
try to fill that
space, only to find

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.840 align:middle line:84%
that when we get there,
like your experience,

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.980 align:middle line:90%
we're not actually there.

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.979 align:middle line:84%
But we've achieved what
we've wanted to achieve.

00:11:18.979 --> 00:11:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And so knowing that
there's no mistakes,

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:23.360 align:middle line:84%
we simply just turn the
boat and go somewhere else.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And so for me I came
up against a place,

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:28.840 align:middle line:84%
for example, in Los Angeles,
where I started directing.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And halfway through my first job
I was sitting at the monitor,

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.940 align:middle line:84%
and I realized I
don't do this anymore.

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And it just all
came crashing down.

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:38.211 align:middle line:84%
But I still had the
whole shoot to do.

00:11:38.211 --> 00:11:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And I just worked
my way through it,

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:43.060 align:middle line:84%
and then I immediately moved out
of Los Angeles up into Topanga

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.910 align:middle line:84%
a little further, and
then six months later

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:47.380 align:middle line:90%
up to Eugene, Oregon.

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.420 align:middle line:84%
And that took me
to China and Tibet,

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.380 align:middle line:84%
and that journey
started to unfold.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And the more I found the courage
to question what I thought

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:01.400 align:middle line:84%
was the answer, it was
like the doors opened.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.721 align:middle line:84%
And the little old
man in Asia literally

00:12:03.721 --> 00:12:06.220 align:middle line:84%
came up to me in a temple and
said, what are you doing here?

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.100 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I'm meditating.

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And he said, no, what
are you doing here?

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:14.560 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, I think I'm
trying to figure this out.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And he said, no, no,
what are you doing here?

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:17.770 align:middle line:90%
Go home.

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:18.854 align:middle line:90%
You incarnated over there.

00:12:18.854 --> 00:12:20.103 align:middle line:90%
That's where your answers are.

00:12:20.103 --> 00:12:22.450 align:middle line:84%
You can't run away from
yourself and come over here.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:23.510 align:middle line:90%
That's a step.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:26.190 align:middle line:84%
But your solution
and your answers

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:28.980 align:middle line:84%
lie back in the
places you're leaving.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.560 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that
was the last place

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.870 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to go
because it was so--

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:35.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that was a
profound and very true answer

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.636 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: Yeah, and I
didn't want to go there

00:12:37.636 --> 00:12:39.170 align:middle line:90%
because that's what I had left.

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:40.260 align:middle line:90%
And I had no way, no map.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You left your
version of it anyway, right?

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: Right, I had
no map to figure out

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:44.868 align:middle line:84%
how to get back
into it, understand

00:12:44.868 --> 00:12:46.650 align:middle line:84%
what was left
there-- the gold that

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:48.580 align:middle line:84%
was hidden underneath
the lid, so to speak,

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.680 align:middle line:84%
and how to bring that
experience forward.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And I came back, and I
studied with Native Americans,

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and I studied with
Amazonian shaman.

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And they started to help me put
a reference point for myself

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.810 align:middle line:90%
in the bigger picture together.

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And then, as I mentioned,
I injured myself,

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:12.170 align:middle line:84%
and I was really that
the stopping point.

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:15.500 align:middle line:84%
And then as I went to healing,
I realized that I couldn't just

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.000 align:middle line:84%
deal with the physical, because
the physical was bringing up

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.010 align:middle line:90%
the emotional.

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't just deal
with the physical-emotional,

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:22.390 align:middle line:84%
because the emotional
was starting

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:24.390 align:middle line:84%
to bring up the paradigms
I was operating under.

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:26.690 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly, this whole
holistic idea of I

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:28.380 align:middle line:84%
have to look at
it all and I have

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:30.160 align:middle line:84%
to die back to
everything that I think I

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.430 align:middle line:90%
am to find out who I really am.

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And that process
is still going on.

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:36.160 align:middle line:90%
I hope it continues to go on.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, OK, so
you first started East

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:40.970 align:middle line:90%
to China and Tibet.

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:44.840 align:middle line:84%
So tell us a bit about
what would happen in Tibet.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.940 align:middle line:84%
What was that part of
your adventure about?

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.910 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: Tibet, I
went to study Qigong.

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And I was studying
in Portland, Oregon

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:56.064 align:middle line:84%
with a Chinese master, who then
we went to China and studied.

00:13:56.064 --> 00:13:57.230 align:middle line:90%
And then I went on to Tibet.

00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:59.271 align:middle line:84%
And while we were there--
actually flying there--

00:13:59.271 --> 00:14:02.640 align:middle line:84%
I met a woman who was doing some
work at the university there,

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.500 align:middle line:84%
and she invited me to stay to
do some translation work, which

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.074 align:middle line:90%
was kind of the landing point.

00:14:08.074 --> 00:14:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And so I stayed on
after the group left,

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:11.790 align:middle line:84%
and I found myself
in the temples.

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And one day I was walking
around one of the temples,

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:18.320 align:middle line:84%
and there was about 100 monks,
lamas, and a rinpoche chanting.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And I stood there
observing them,

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:22.550 align:middle line:84%
and the next thing I know
they're pointing at me

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:25.250 align:middle line:84%
and asking me to come
and sit with them.

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And I was embarrassed, and
they just said, no, go ahead.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:28.940 align:middle line:90%
And I sat.

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:31.460 align:middle line:84%
They put the cape on
me-- the big yellow hat.

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And here's this
young Western guy

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:36.460 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of
Tibet, way, way out

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:40.040 align:middle line:84%
in Gyantse and in the
middle of 100 monks.

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And they all just looked at
me and said, do you remember?

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:46.155 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't.

00:14:46.155 --> 00:14:48.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I was going to ask you.

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:49.650 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: As soon as
I started chanting,

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:50.941 align:middle line:90%
I realized I knew how to chant.

00:14:50.941 --> 00:14:53.000 align:middle line:84%
I knew how to do
the guttural chants.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And I decided things like that,
where you're put in situations,

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.950 align:middle line:84%
when you allow yourself to not
stop yourself from something

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:03.590 align:middle line:84%
you don't know or you're unsure
of, but just to go with it.

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And that led me to work
with the Dalai Lama

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:10.490 align:middle line:84%
and receive an initiation and
then go up into a Dharamsala

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:12.690 align:middle line:84%
and have really
mystical experiences up

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:13.620 align:middle line:90%
in the Himalayas.

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:15.781 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What kind of
mystical experiences?

00:15:15.781 --> 00:15:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: Oh, I haven't
really talk about them,

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:19.050 align:middle line:90%
but I guess I will.

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:19.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Would you?

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:20.740 align:middle line:90%
>>JEFFREY: Yeah.

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:25.720 align:middle line:84%
I would have
experiences with beings

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.960 align:middle line:84%
that would manifest in
their light bodies right

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.650 align:middle line:90%
in front of me and talk to me.

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:32.342 align:middle line:84%
And it seemed as real
as talking to you.

00:15:32.342 --> 00:15:33.800 align:middle line:84%
But when I was out
of that context,

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.720 align:middle line:90%
I had no context for it.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.590 align:middle line:84%
Another time I was walking
at night in the forest,

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:42.480 align:middle line:84%
and the photons in my body lit
up and lit up the whole forest,

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.660 align:middle line:90%
30 or 40 feet around me.

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:46.970 align:middle line:90%
And I just started crying.

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:51.580 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea what that
was or how, what, who.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:53.490 align:middle line:84%
And so I sought that
information out.

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And as I went to the ancient
tribes and the elders

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:01.430 align:middle line:84%
and I would tell my story, and
they would just smile and say,

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:03.230 align:middle line:84%
good, now we can
begin our training.

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:05.646 align:middle line:84%
And there was something about
the mystical experience that

00:16:05.646 --> 00:16:07.370 align:middle line:84%
happened, which was
the key that opened

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:08.600 align:middle line:90%
the door to the next step.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.960 align:middle line:84%
So again, it's about going into
that place where you don't know

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.100 align:middle line:84%
and learning to be comfortable
enough and courageous enough

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:18.940 align:middle line:84%
to just allow yourself to
be used as an instrument

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:21.220 align:middle line:84%
and eventually come to
a place of consciousness

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:24.150 align:middle line:84%
of how that instrument works
in the whole structure.

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.450 align:middle line:84%
So with those old,
ancient traditions

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:32.590 align:middle line:84%
in India and China and Tibet,
Korea, Japan, South America,

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:34.100 align:middle line:84%
Australia-- anywhere
in the world--

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:36.170 align:middle line:84%
the wisdom keepers
are the ones that

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:37.860 align:middle line:84%
are holding this
until this time,

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:41.190 align:middle line:84%
until we come forward
and say we're ready.

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:43.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm not interested in power.

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:45.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm interested in truth.

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And one of the steps is getting
past a cumulative safety,

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:53.500 align:middle line:84%
like you're talking about,
your experience in the aircraft

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:54.820 align:middle line:90%
things like that.

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:57.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm, Let's talk
for just a moment about

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:00.730 align:middle line:84%
"do you remember--" the
comment, "do you remember."

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:03.660 align:middle line:84%
So shall we take away
from that this was not

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:06.730 align:middle line:84%
an unfamiliar experience
to you in times past,

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:10.130 align:middle line:84%
that you have likely
incarnated among them before?

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And then did you ever come
to learn why you decided

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:18.310 align:middle line:84%
to incarnate in the
West and do life the way

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:20.099 align:middle line:90%
you did it this time?

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:23.390 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: A Lipan
Apache elder said to me,

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:26.730 align:middle line:84%
you know, the best camouflage
for you is a three-piece suit,

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:29.190 align:middle line:84%
because you can go inside
of any environment,

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:31.479 align:middle line:84%
and no one will
know who you are.

00:17:31.479 --> 00:17:33.020 align:middle line:84%
They'll just appear
in a certain way.

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:36.010 align:middle line:84%
So it's one thing to
protest on the outside,

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:38.405 align:middle line:84%
but it's another thing
to work from within

00:17:38.405 --> 00:17:39.280 align:middle line:90%
and move it that way.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.620 align:middle line:84%
So as far as a
question of memory,

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:44.634 align:middle line:84%
I think all of
these realms are not

00:17:44.634 --> 00:17:45.800 align:middle line:90%
about learning anything new.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:49.370 align:middle line:84%
I think they're about-- I know
they're about remembering.

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:52.090 align:middle line:84%
So as I went through
the memories,

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:54.730 align:middle line:84%
for example, when I got to the
Andes, it was like coming home.

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:55.750 align:middle line:90%
I didn't speak Quechua.

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:57.740 align:middle line:84%
I didn't speak
Spanish at the time.

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:00.820 align:middle line:84%
But there was something about
the resonance around me,

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:02.740 align:middle line:84%
where I felt completely
held in a way

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:05.090 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't feel
held in the North.

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:08.260 align:middle line:84%
I was never trained, or it
was never a model for me

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.887 align:middle line:84%
how to be an
emotionally strong man.

00:18:10.887 --> 00:18:12.220 align:middle line:90%
It was always about competition.

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:16.180 align:middle line:84%
It was always, always about
bigger, better, faster, more.

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:18.340 align:middle line:84%
And here, in these
cultures, it's

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:21.170 align:middle line:84%
about getting rid of
everything that you're not

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:24.130 align:middle line:84%
so you can know creator
and that creator within.

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:27.570 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's known in these
wisdom keeping traditions

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:29.870 align:middle line:84%
and even out in the
realms that there's

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:32.260 align:middle line:90%
nothing outside of within.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:35.480 align:middle line:84%
No god exists outside of the
within because it's simply

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:39.170 align:middle line:84%
our projection into time space
that creates this reality.

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:43.380 align:middle line:84%
So as you start to remember who
you are and what you've done

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:45.980 align:middle line:84%
and those memories
start waking up,

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:50.240 align:middle line:84%
then it becomes a lot
easier because you're not

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.610 align:middle line:90%
in a place where you don't know.

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:54.520 align:middle line:84%
You're just simply in a place
where you're remembering.

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And that takes a
certain aspect of what

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.330 align:middle line:90%
femininity is-- receptivity.

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:02.437 align:middle line:84%
So in the Andes it's
the sacred feminine,

00:19:02.437 --> 00:19:04.770 align:middle line:84%
and that's the mystery school
there as opposed to Egypt,

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:06.311 align:middle line:84%
which is the masculine
or Tibet which

00:19:06.311 --> 00:19:07.990 align:middle line:90%
is the neutral, the holy child.

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:11.390 align:middle line:84%
In the Andes, it's about
this organic growth

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:12.840 align:middle line:90%
up and ascending.

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And in that, you come
to embody yourself

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.560 align:middle line:90%
in an emptiness of the mind.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.850 align:middle line:84%
So you can meditate
to quiet your mind.

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
get to that stage,

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.050 align:middle line:84%
then you plug into
all the conversations

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:24.450 align:middle line:90%
that are going on.

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of people will
think yoga and meditation

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.500 align:middle line:90%
will take me completely there.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.170 align:middle line:84%
And I found that yoga and
meditation and all of those

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:34.700 align:middle line:84%
are vessels that take
you across the ocean,

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:37.777 align:middle line:84%
only somewhere there you
realize you are the ocean.

00:19:37.777 --> 00:19:39.110 align:middle line:90%
And I don't mean that egoically.

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:43.140 align:middle line:84%
I just mean that there's the
aspect of "I am" or Gaiam.

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:46.350 align:middle line:84%
That when you sit
in that experience,

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:49.180 align:middle line:84%
there's a depth to
it where you don't

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:51.800 align:middle line:90%
have to engage from the mind.

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.959 align:middle line:84%
You can do the hollow reed,
but you're not hollow.

00:19:54.959 --> 00:19:56.250 align:middle line:90%
You're actually in co-creation.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:58.300 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if that
answered your question.

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:00.560 align:middle line:84%
But it certainly has
been my experience

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.840 align:middle line:84%
to learn to get out of
the way over and over

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:07.019 align:middle line:84%
and over enough, and strip down
enough, enough, enough, even

00:20:07.019 --> 00:20:09.310 align:middle line:84%
letting go of all traditions
and lineage and techniques

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:12.690 align:middle line:84%
that I've have learned, to get
to a sense of the bare metal

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:14.202 align:middle line:90%
or the bare carbon.

00:20:14.202 --> 00:20:15.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
an interesting point

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:19.310 align:middle line:84%
that I wanted to go into
a bit as well-- to move

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:23.390 align:middle line:84%
past ritual, which is
often very anchored

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:27.730 align:middle line:84%
into very specific ways of
having been, ways of the past.

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And so just a quick
detour-- Qigong.

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:33.490 align:middle line:90%
What about the value of Qigong?

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems that this
is practiced a fair amount,

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:38.430 align:middle line:84%
certainly in the
East, as a means

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:39.627 align:middle line:90%
of their spiritual practice.

00:20:39.627 --> 00:20:41.210 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: Yeah, I
think all of them--

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:42.751 align:middle line:84%
we talked about yoga
and meditation--

00:20:42.751 --> 00:20:47.000 align:middle line:84%
but Qigong, or Reiki,
is a way to become aware

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.090 align:middle line:84%
of your energy, not only
what is creating through you,

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:53.920 align:middle line:84%
but what is around you, and then
moving that and exchanging it--

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.620 align:middle line:84%
exchanging chi
with the universe,

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:59.970 align:middle line:84%
working with a conifer,
a tree, in order

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:02.640 align:middle line:84%
to engage a symbiotic
relationship,

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.090 align:middle line:84%
where you're giving the
carbon monoxide to the tree,

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:07.170 align:middle line:84%
and it's giving you
oxygen in return.

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's a way to become a
master of your own universe

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.320 align:middle line:84%
really, not to sound
like Marvel comics,

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:15.110 align:middle line:84%
but a way of coming
to understand

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:17.680 align:middle line:84%
the power of the creative
force that we each have that

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.210 align:middle line:84%
has simply been
programmed out of us.

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:22.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I mean, I
practiced it very briefly,

00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:24.160 align:middle line:90%
quite a few years ago.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And I found it beautiful, but
the teacher I had at the time

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:30.350 align:middle line:90%
stopped or left actually.

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:31.680 align:middle line:90%
And so I was let go of it.

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.930 align:middle line:84%
But I've been intrigued with
it through the years since then

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:37.030 align:middle line:84%
because it has a little
different quality.

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:39.500 align:middle line:84%
Yoga, all of these things,
have beautiful elements,

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.000 align:middle line:84%
but there was
something about Qigong

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.410 align:middle line:84%
that was extraordinary
and different.

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:47.620 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: Yeah, it's a way of
mastery, where you are actually

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:49.000 align:middle line:90%
moving the energy.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And there's stages-- even
yoga, at its highest stage,

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:54.830 align:middle line:90%
is an automatic response.

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:57.060 align:middle line:90%
You're not going through asanas.

00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:59.550 align:middle line:84%
You're moving authentically,
spontaneously.

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And Qigong starts very
much in that space.

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:04.920 align:middle line:84%
There's routines that
you do, but it really

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.490 align:middle line:84%
helps you to become a
master of that working.

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:09.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
loved the energy part.

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:11.400 align:middle line:84%
That that's what I think
what I was attracted to.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to take
another look at a clip, OK?

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And this one, I'll bring
that question to you

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:19.500 align:middle line:90%
after we watch it.

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:20.450 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:24.170 align:middle line:10%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:31.962 align:middle line:10%
>>[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:22:31.962 --> 00:23:05.690 align:middle line:90%


00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:08.140 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:09.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Again, beautiful.

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:11.460 align:middle line:84%
What were they
referring to when they

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:14.420 align:middle line:84%
spoke of the second,
third, and fourth levels

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:17.650 align:middle line:84%
in asking for assistance in
the spiritual renaissance

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:18.450 align:middle line:90%
of the planet?

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:21.189 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
planes of reality there.

00:23:21.189 --> 00:23:23.230 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: Yeah, and those
plans exist within us.

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:27.510 align:middle line:84%
So in the Andes, they have an
overlay to the chakra system

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:30.170 align:middle line:84%
that we know as seven or nine
chakras, which are actually

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:31.400 align:middle line:90%
moving to 13 right now.

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:32.790 align:middle line:84%
But they have
three main centers,

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:34.410 align:middle line:84%
and they are known
as [NON-ENGLISH],

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:37.220 align:middle line:84%
which is the intuitive,
intelligence married with

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:38.970 align:middle line:90%
the knowledge from experience.

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:41.500 align:middle line:84%
There's [NON-ENGLISH], which
is the love presence and that

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:42.300 align:middle line:90%
wisdom.

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And then there's [NON-ENGLISH],
which is a combination of, say,

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:46.630 align:middle line:90%
second and third chakras.

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:49.890 align:middle line:84%
So you have the womb of
creation married with the will

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:50.955 align:middle line:90%
to bring it forth.

00:23:50.955 --> 00:23:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And so when you talk
about the second, third,

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:54.500 align:middle line:84%
and fourth levels,
you're talking

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:58.600 align:middle line:84%
about wisdom aspects within
ourselves for us to embody.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.540 align:middle line:84%
Instead of just being
done at our base,

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:02.330 align:middle line:84%
in our first level
of consciousness,

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:05.440 align:middle line:84%
they're asking to embody the
intelligences in these ways.

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:09.010 align:middle line:84%
And in outer spatial
reality, you're

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:12.500 align:middle line:84%
talking about occupying levels
of energy or consciousness

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:15.440 align:middle line:84%
that exist, say, for
example, from 3D to 4D,

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:18.520 align:middle line:84%
5D, and up to the
13th dimension.

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:21.610 align:middle line:84%
And they're really calling
upon that higher aspects

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:24.970 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves and the
unseen in the internal

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:27.470 align:middle line:84%
to come and be
with us to help us

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:30.140 align:middle line:84%
come back together, because
we've simply just separated.

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And we live in the
most violent of times

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.900 align:middle line:84%
because we're in the
violence of separation.

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:37.520 align:middle line:84%
We've forgotten how
to be with each other.

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:40.300 align:middle line:84%
We've forgotten the
intimacy of living together.

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.090 align:middle line:84%
Everything is confused
with sexuality.

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:45.490 align:middle line:84%
Everything is defending and
protecting and competing.

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And in these cultures, that
don't have any of that.

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.940 align:middle line:84%
They don't even have the word
"to have" in their culture.

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:51.940 align:middle line:90%
They have no possession.

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:54.148 align:middle line:84%
So when you have no possession,
you have no scarcity,

00:24:54.148 --> 00:24:55.375 align:middle line:90%
you have no competition.

00:24:55.375 --> 00:24:59.127 align:middle line:84%
You simply have everybody
weaving cloth for each other

00:24:59.127 --> 00:25:00.210 align:middle line:90%
and bringing in the realm.

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:03.540 align:middle line:84%
So the work of the paqo is to
reach up and, through prayer,

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:07.846 align:middle line:84%
bring those energies down and
then really impregnate them--

00:25:07.846 --> 00:25:08.970 align:middle line:90%
kind of an odd term to use.

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:09.928 align:middle line:90%
But it's what they use.

00:25:09.928 --> 00:25:11.180 align:middle line:90%
And lightning is that.

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:13.530 align:middle line:84%
So you bring that force
in and that coding down,

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:15.020 align:middle line:90%
and you impregnate the field.

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:16.910 align:middle line:90%
And then you have a bounty.

00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:19.050 align:middle line:84%
So the work of the Paqo
is to work in these ways

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:22.310 align:middle line:84%
to maintain and increase
harmonies in places where,

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:24.650 align:middle line:84%
in our forgetfulness,
we've simply brought it out

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:27.240 align:middle line:90%
of harmony.

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There are a few things
I find interesting in this.

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And you used the word
"will" a moment ago.

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:34.290 align:middle line:84%
As I'm watching
the film and also

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:40.470 align:middle line:84%
throughout other traditions, it
appears from the outside view

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:46.790 align:middle line:84%
that the Paqo or the
shaman in another world

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:52.820 align:middle line:84%
are asking for assistance or
permission from the beings

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:59.900 align:middle line:84%
that they're invoking
rather than making

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:02.660 align:middle line:90%
life more of a choice.

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:06.220 align:middle line:84%
This is where New Age an
ancient start clashing.

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is somewhere
in between of course.

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:12.590 align:middle line:84%
But rather than choosing
as an impetus coming

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:14.970 align:middle line:84%
from within your
own being and using

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:18.430 align:middle line:84%
will to carry forward
with that, there either

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:22.090 align:middle line:84%
was a lack or an absence
of what appeared to be will

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:23.570 align:middle line:90%
in all of these ceremonies.

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:25.880 align:middle line:90%
It was more please help us.

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:28.230 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: Yeah, it's
an aspect of humility,

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:31.490 align:middle line:84%
which is a lot of
times can get confused

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:33.050 align:middle line:90%
with having inner strength.

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:38.140 align:middle line:84%
It's the will has to come
forward to do the ceremony.

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, like
if we came to do work,

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.640 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't just
impose my will on you.

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.570 align:middle line:84%
I would ask of you
where we meet in harmony

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:47.822 align:middle line:90%
so that we can do the work.

00:26:47.822 --> 00:26:49.280 align:middle line:84%
So what you experience
in the film,

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:54.080 align:middle line:84%
for example, is that reference
to a higher perspective,

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:57.307 align:middle line:84%
and it's a humility that I
have had the same questions

00:26:57.307 --> 00:26:58.140 align:middle line:90%
about that you have.

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:01.480 align:middle line:84%
Because how do we be
co-creative and yet

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:02.520 align:middle line:90%
differ at the same time?

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:03.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:04.735 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: And it
seems like a paradox.

00:27:04.735 --> 00:27:05.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does.

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:07.581 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: But I find that when
you're in those intersections

00:27:07.581 --> 00:27:10.300 align:middle line:84%
of paradox, that's when
you're the most real,

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:11.810 align:middle line:84%
because that's where
the unknown is,

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:14.630 align:middle line:84%
where the mind is trying to
figure it out, and it can't.

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's what heart
intelligence is about.

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:21.310 align:middle line:10%
The mind is simply a tool of the
heart, but we've put it on top.

00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And we rely on it so
heavily that we've

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:24.680 align:middle line:90%
become out of balance.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:27.390 align:middle line:84%
In the ancient cultures, they're
still in their heart wisdom

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:28.473 align:middle line:90%
and in their intelligence.

00:27:28.473 --> 00:27:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And the mind is a tool that
creates from that place.

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:37.270 align:middle line:84%
So the extension of will is
a way to bring it forward

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:39.540 align:middle line:84%
but, at the same time,
have the humility.

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:42.940 align:middle line:84%
So that if there's any filtering
or oversight or something

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:45.180 align:middle line:84%
you're unaware of, that
you're not stepping on toes,

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:47.450 align:middle line:84%
you're not creating
something lower

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:50.280 align:middle line:84%
than what's possible
from another perspective.

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:52.210 align:middle line:84%
For example, the higher
you climb the mountain

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:53.793 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness,
the more perspective

00:27:53.793 --> 00:27:56.150 align:middle line:90%
you have down into the valleys.

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:57.690 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of times
in the Andes you

00:27:57.690 --> 00:28:02.990 align:middle line:84%
see in the paqos deferring
to a higher source.

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:05.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, it seemed like
that was the primary practice

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:07.800 align:middle line:90%
or ritual anyway.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: And that is
a historical aspect that

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:12.480 align:middle line:84%
has come from the
humility of going

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:15.060 align:middle line:84%
through the dark time with
this last 13,000 years,

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:17.730 align:middle line:84%
where we've become very
distant from spirit,

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:21.029 align:middle line:84%
and they really
regulated access to us.

00:28:21.029 --> 00:28:22.820 align:middle line:84%
But now that we've come
through that cycle,

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:25.360 align:middle line:84%
and now we're in a
different cycle now,

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.790 align:middle line:90%
that willingness is right here.

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:32.430 align:middle line:84%
So every time we pray and ask
for assistance, it shows up.

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:35.669 align:middle line:84%
Now, the key that I found is
are we praying from my needs,

00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:37.960 align:middle line:84%
or am I asking the question,
what's best for the people

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:39.200 align:middle line:90%
sitting in front of me?

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And when you ask at
the collective level,

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.920 align:middle line:84%
the response is much
different than you're just

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:47.130 align:middle line:90%
asking from the personal level.

00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:52.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes and, again,
this is a complex subject.

00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And the way I've come to view it
as individuated consciousness.

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And then, again, here, that's
another subject entirely.

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:03.640 align:middle line:84%
Individuated
consciousness is when

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:06.860 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about waiting
for these higher realms

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:08.880 align:middle line:90%
to be able to give guidance.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.510 align:middle line:90%
I view that in different ways.

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:14.030 align:middle line:84%
Part of the higher realm is
myself too-- my own aspect

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:18.140 align:middle line:84%
that moves beyond time and
space and has access to all

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:20.080 align:middle line:90%
and is part of all.

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And so if we're looking
at it as a practice,

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:26.480 align:middle line:84%
the notion of the
Kingdom of God is within,

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:29.980 align:middle line:84%
so this is where
more the Western view

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:36.080 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual integration
seems to go than the Eastern

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:38.610 align:middle line:90%
and South American view.

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:41.840 align:middle line:84%
It's more
individuated, vertical,

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.110 align:middle line:84%
bringing the higher
aspects of self

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:47.160 align:middle line:84%
with perhaps some
guidance with you through.

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:51.485 align:middle line:84%
And it seems there
it's more collective.

00:29:51.485 --> 00:29:52.360 align:middle line:90%
>>JEFFREY: It's both.

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.490 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's a paradox,
because we are working

00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:56.950 align:middle line:90%
not just as an individual.

00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:59.620 align:middle line:84%
We, in the West, are
working as a collective,

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:01.750 align:middle line:84%
but we don't remember
that aspect of it.

00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:03.080 align:middle line:90%
We just think of it as--

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:04.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's an
unconscious aspect.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.743 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: It's an
unconscious aspect.

00:30:05.743 --> 00:30:07.552 align:middle line:84%
And I see the two
as complementary.

00:30:07.552 --> 00:30:10.010 align:middle line:84%
There's that saying, we're the
ones we've been waiting for.

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:11.718 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're the ones
they've been waiting

00:30:11.718 --> 00:30:15.000 align:middle line:84%
for too, because it was lost
13,000 years ago-- the fall

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.312 align:middle line:90%
of man, you might say.

00:30:16.312 --> 00:30:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And they've held these
in the wisdom traditions

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:21.390 align:middle line:84%
for a very long time,
waiting for this day, where

00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:23.825 align:middle line:84%
we woke up enough to
come back together

00:30:23.825 --> 00:30:25.700 align:middle line:84%
so the prophecy of the
eagle and the condor--

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:28.180 align:middle line:84%
the intelligence of the mind
married with the intelligence

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:30.070 align:middle line:90%
of their emotion.

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:32.050 align:middle line:84%
the deference of a
higher power being

00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:35.950 align:middle line:84%
without to our knowing that
the higher powers within.

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:38.590 align:middle line:84%
So what I have found,
as a celestial paqo

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:40.880 align:middle line:84%
in the tradition, is
that I bring something

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.700 align:middle line:84%
that is different
to the tradition,

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:45.640 align:middle line:84%
but yet they called
me into the tradition

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:46.710 align:middle line:90%
for that very purpose.

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:49.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, so you're
integrating these conversations

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:50.530 align:middle line:90%
we're having.

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:52.570 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: Absolutely, I've
had these same conversations

00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:53.940 align:middle line:90%
to say but from my perspective.

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:56.210 align:middle line:90%
And they say, yes, absolutely.

00:30:56.210 --> 00:31:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the West has
specialized their minds,

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:02.220 align:middle line:84%
has come to this
understanding that's within,

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:05.960 align:middle line:84%
so that you can take this
knowledge and these ways

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:10.530 align:middle line:84%
and integrate it into what you
know to self realize as God

00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:12.810 align:middle line:84%
itself, whatever God
means to an individual.

00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And they have been
stewards of consciousness

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.615 align:middle line:84%
for a very long time, where
their job has been holding

00:31:17.615 --> 00:31:18.740 align:middle line:90%
it, holding it, holding it.

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:20.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right to perpetuate
the ways they know.

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: Uh-huh, and as
they integrate with us,

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:25.172 align:middle line:90%
they then ascend as well.

00:31:25.172 --> 00:31:27.630 align:middle line:84%
It's not that they're there,
and we're trying to get there.

00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:29.350 align:middle line:84%
It's we're coming
together, and we're all

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:30.700 align:middle line:90%
going at the same time.

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:34.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK let's talk
about 13,000 years ago.

00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:37.970 align:middle line:84%
Do their mythologies
or their understandings

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:40.884 align:middle line:84%
historically line up
with global inundation?

00:31:40.884 --> 00:31:41.800 align:middle line:90%
>>JEFFREY: Absolutely.

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, because this seems
to be coming to the surface

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:46.020 align:middle line:90%
more and more.

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:48.637 align:middle line:84%
I just met with Graham
Hancock last week,

00:31:48.637 --> 00:31:51.220 align:middle line:84%
just privately for a little bit
before he was doing a lecture,

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:54.180 align:middle line:84%
and I stayed for that
part of the lecture

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:58.110 align:middle line:84%
of the archaeologists are
going out on a limb saying,

00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:00.070 align:middle line:90%
this is fully indicated.

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:04.380 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting to me in all
that, and has been for decades,

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:09.850 align:middle line:84%
is that that knowledge that
existed in those ancient more

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:13.600 align:middle line:84%
sophisticated cultures,
at least aspects of them

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.350 align:middle line:84%
at different times
were more sophisticated

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:19.460 align:middle line:84%
in their understandings,
is that didn't die.

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:20.340 align:middle line:90%
That didn't die.

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:24.000 align:middle line:84%
That was kind of exported
around the planet.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.650 align:middle line:84%
There were those who were
placed around the planet

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:28.680 align:middle line:90%
to uphold the knowledge.

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell how
they tell how, say,

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:34.410 align:middle line:84%
the Andeans tell the
story of inundation

00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:36.421 align:middle line:84%
and preserve knowledge
and lineages?

00:32:36.421 --> 00:32:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: Well, yeah,
they are very aware

00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:41.060 align:middle line:84%
of the Mayan calendars
and in the 25,920 year

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:42.680 align:middle line:90%
procession of the equinoxes.

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And half of that galactic spin
of the Milky Way is shadow,

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:49.960 align:middle line:84%
and half is light, and that's,
as we understand, is duality.

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:51.970 align:middle line:84%
So they're very aware
of all the inundations.

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the [INAUDIBLE]
priests of the [INAUDIBLE],

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:57.490 align:middle line:84%
one of the places they went,
as well as the Lumerians,

00:32:57.490 --> 00:33:01.570 align:middle line:84%
was to the Andes to secure this
wisdom and to keep it safe,

00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:02.870 align:middle line:90%
and it's been put underground.

00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:04.920 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's why
the conquistadors came

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.620 align:middle line:90%
was trying to snuff that out.

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:09.980 align:middle line:84%
But one of these unbroken
lineages in the Andes

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:10.780 align:middle line:90%
was never found.

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:12.490 align:middle line:84%
They retreated high
up into the mountains

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:15.130 align:middle line:84%
and went into
secrecy since 1532.

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And only in the 1950s
were they discovered

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:18.110 align:middle line:90%
by an anthropologist.

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And in that, as
they came back down,

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:22.340 align:middle line:84%
they started to reveal that
they have the same birth

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:25.720 align:middle line:84%
legends as the people in
Mali and the Dogon tribes.

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.810 align:middle line:84%
They have extraterrestrial
understanding

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:29.050 align:middle line:90%
that is starting to come out.

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:31.320 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the programming
that's on this network

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:33.300 align:middle line:84%
is starting to speak
of these things.

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:36.250 align:middle line:84%
They're very well
aware of all of this

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:38.020 align:middle line:90%
in all of their cosmology.

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:39.880 align:middle line:84%
They've just kept it
inside, and they've

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:44.200 align:middle line:84%
hid, like being a little peasant
farmer, so they weren't killed.

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And they realize
that at this time

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:48.170 align:middle line:84%
the world is changing
in such a degree.

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:51.080 align:middle line:84%
They called a [NON-ENGLISH],
and it's a time between eras,

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:52.376 align:middle line:90%
where all hell breaks loose.

00:33:52.376 --> 00:33:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And all the
institutions crumble.

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:54.681 align:middle line:90%
Nothing works anymore.

00:33:54.681 --> 00:33:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And if we look around
ourselves right now,

00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:57.763 align:middle line:90%
that's exactly what's happening.

00:33:57.763 --> 00:33:58.020 align:middle line:90%


00:33:58.020 --> 00:33:58.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: And so they say
that in this 25-year period

00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:04.780 align:middle line:84%
is when we transition from one,
like the Hopi will call it,

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:06.850 align:middle line:90%
the fourth sun to the fifth sun.

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And in their understanding,
we went through a deluge

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:12.270 align:middle line:84%
13,000 years ago
because we started

00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:14.195 align:middle line:84%
tinkering with
different energetics

00:34:14.195 --> 00:34:15.570 align:middle line:84%
and working with
pyramids in ways

00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:18.412 align:middle line:84%
that were not constructive,
and we erased all our memories.

00:34:18.412 --> 00:34:20.120 align:middle line:84%
So you look at all
these different people

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:22.940 align:middle line:84%
who you're speaking about,
and everybody, collectively,

00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:26.949 align:middle line:84%
is starting to come together
to recognize it's all the same.

00:34:26.949 --> 00:34:29.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
interestingly it's

00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:30.900 align:middle line:90%
shown up in different ways.

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:33.130 align:middle line:84%
Some of it looks like it's
indigenous and ancient

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:34.370 align:middle line:90%
and spare.

00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:37.580 align:middle line:84%
In other ways they have
discovered, for example,

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:41.750 align:middle line:84%
Gobekli Tepe, which appears
to be a sophisticated culture

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:46.170 align:middle line:84%
from 11,600 years ago,
not long after the deluge.

00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:49.239 align:middle line:84%
So the assumption now,
according to Graham and some

00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:52.440 align:middle line:84%
of his associates, is that that
was an area that was simply

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:57.420 align:middle line:84%
seeded with the known
technologies and the knowledge

00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:00.060 align:middle line:84%
base of the day, the
lifestyle of the day.

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And so same thing in
the areas in the British

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:06.980 align:middle line:90%
Isles-- all over the planet.

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:11.490 align:middle line:84%
It's as though it didn't
happen in a quick way,

00:35:11.490 --> 00:35:15.140 align:middle line:84%
that before the
inundation it was

00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:16.700 align:middle line:90%
known for quite a long time.

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:17.500 align:middle line:90%
>>JEFFREY: It was.

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:18.650 align:middle line:90%
And preparations were made.

00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:20.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Preparations
were made.

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:22.540 align:middle line:90%
People were taken out.

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:24.610 align:middle line:84%
If we look at it from
another point of view,

00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:28.120 align:middle line:84%
there has always
been air travel.

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:31.130 align:middle line:84%
That's why the depictions
in caves, so people

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:33.360 align:middle line:84%
were taken and placed
around the planet.

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:34.610 align:middle line:90%
And that's your understanding.

00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:36.660 align:middle line:84%
That's their understanding
in all of these cultures

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:37.410 align:middle line:90%
as well, right?

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:38.370 align:middle line:90%
>>JEFFREY: Absolutely.

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:41.470 align:middle line:84%
Even though they're, whether
it be the paqos or the Kogi

00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:44.910 align:middle line:84%
in Colombia, they're not
isolated in their caves at all.

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:47.077 align:middle line:84%
They're completely connected
through the web of life

00:35:47.077 --> 00:35:48.034 align:middle line:90%
to everything going on.

00:35:48.034 --> 00:35:49.875 align:middle line:84%
And I'm always surprised
when I'm down there

00:35:49.875 --> 00:35:52.390 align:middle line:84%
and I'm talking about a
geopolitical situation

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:55.720 align:middle line:84%
or some aspect that seems
more Western in its mind,

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:58.640 align:middle line:84%
they're very aware of what's
going because they're in tune.

00:35:58.640 --> 00:35:59.910 align:middle line:90%
They're sensing everything.

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:02.020 align:middle line:84%
They have like the
ultimate cable.

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:03.510 align:middle line:84%
They have all the
networks playing.

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:06.070 align:middle line:84%
But it's not just on this
dimension in the middle earth.

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:08.764 align:middle line:84%
They're also connected
to all of this.

00:36:08.764 --> 00:36:10.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, they didn't
lose their sensitivities.

00:36:10.930 --> 00:36:13.030 align:middle line:84%
They've maintained
their sensitivities.

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:18.190 align:middle line:84%
OK, so why has the West become
such a focal point then?

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:19.960 align:middle line:84%
The notion-- I
mean, here we are,

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:25.360 align:middle line:84%
living the ultimate in
the material existence,

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:29.610 align:middle line:84%
and also great
creative abilities.

00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:31.150 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
the material world

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:34.160 align:middle line:84%
and what has been created out
of our either remembrances

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:37.260 align:middle line:84%
or imaginations, it's
actually phenomenal.

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:38.060 align:middle line:90%
We've created.

00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:39.630 align:middle line:90%
Beauty we've created ugliness.

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:40.800 align:middle line:90%
We've created all of it.

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:44.650 align:middle line:84%
But we have been very active
in creation here, which

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:47.470 align:middle line:84%
has manifested in
the physical world.

00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:51.470 align:middle line:84%
So when you take their spare
and sensitive existence,

00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:56.210 align:middle line:84%
and you take our seemingly
overindulgent and wildly

00:36:56.210 --> 00:37:00.120 align:middle line:84%
creative individualistic
existence,

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:02.780 align:middle line:84%
at the expense, again, of
being redundant at all,

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:07.620 align:middle line:84%
why is it that these various
cultures want to engage us?

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:09.760 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: Because,
not to be cliche,

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.900 align:middle line:84%
they're the ones we've
they've been waiting for.

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:13.670 align:middle line:84%
We're the ones we've
been waiting for.

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:18.610 align:middle line:84%
We have this very specialized
capacity to produce and create.

00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And they're holding a very
deep emotional knowledge.

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:25.520 align:middle line:84%
So go back to the
condor and the eagle

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:27.720 align:middle line:84%
what they bring in
their intelligence, what

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:30.990 align:middle line:84%
we bring in our intelligence
is the perfect mesh,

00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:33.100 align:middle line:84%
like a teeter totter
at the balance point.

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:37.440 align:middle line:84%
So my colleagues there use cell
phones and their technical,

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:39.010 align:middle line:90%
not to the extent we are.

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And we do meditation and yoga,
but not to the extent they do.

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And as we come
together as a whole,

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:48.410 align:middle line:84%
as we remember ourselves as
a family, a human family,

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:53.830 align:middle line:84%
we start to recognize that
like any symphony, the violin

00:37:53.830 --> 00:37:56.100 align:middle line:84%
and the cello and the
French horn and all

00:37:56.100 --> 00:38:01.430 align:middle line:84%
these come together to
create beautiful music.

00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:04.030 align:middle line:84%
But one can't exist in a
vacuum without the other.

00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
what's happened

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:09.180 align:middle line:84%
is that polarization of these
lifestyles and practices.

00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And at the expense of
sounding New Age and cliche,

00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:15.510 align:middle line:84%
but having, as I said,
mucked around in these areas

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:18.310 align:middle line:84%
and been in other
times and such,

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:20.760 align:middle line:84%
it seems as though
we're going back

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:25.350 align:middle line:84%
to bringing about the best
of what those early Atlantean

00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:28.620 align:middle line:84%
communities offered,
which was that reverence

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:31.560 align:middle line:84%
and that introspection
and total access

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:35.727 align:middle line:84%
to that integrated self and
a beautiful external world.

00:38:35.727 --> 00:38:37.310 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: Right and
even further back

00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:38.860 align:middle line:84%
into the Pacific
of Mu and Lumeria,

00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:42.530 align:middle line:84%
if you back into those
highly technical advanced

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:44.870 align:middle line:84%
civilizations, they were
actually existing in 5D

00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:47.020 align:middle line:90%
in perfect fluid dynamics.

00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And then we lost it, and
that was because of control.

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And that was because of certain
aspects that dumbed us down

00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:54.450 align:middle line:90%
and genetic manipulation.

00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:56.740 align:middle line:84%
All the ancient tribes are
very aware of all this.

00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:59.750 align:middle line:84%
They're holding a
purity of heart form

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:03.600 align:middle line:84%
for us to engage with at that
intersection when we get there,

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:06.030 align:middle line:84%
when we've finally
said enough is enough.

00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:09.500 align:middle line:84%
When you had that experience
on the plane that day and said,

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:12.400 align:middle line:84%
wow, look at the beauty
with that simplicity, right?

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:14.560 align:middle line:84%
Same with about
Tibet-- Tibet asked

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:17.460 align:middle line:90%
China to reabsorb it in 1949.

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:21.190 align:middle line:84%
But by 1959, they didn't like
the way it was happening,

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:23.810 align:middle line:90%
and then they decided to leave.

00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:27.110 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to
understand that the Tibetans

00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:32.340 align:middle line:84%
and the Andeans understand
that sophistication

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:33.189 align:middle line:90%
can be very simple.

00:39:33.189 --> 00:39:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think we fully
understand that in the West.

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I don't
think we do either.

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:39.120 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: So there's
this coming together,

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:43.400 align:middle line:84%
where we go out to the
edge and we realize,

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:46.520 align:middle line:84%
well, this is beautiful, but
I'm really not connected.

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really afraid, and
I'm really in competition,

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:51.220 align:middle line:84%
and I'm hoarding
resources, right?

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:55.429 align:middle line:84%
The disparity of incomes
in the West is ridiculous.

00:39:55.429 --> 00:39:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And you see the
change happening now.

00:39:56.970 --> 00:39:59.330 align:middle line:84%
You see CEOs dropping
their pay down and raising

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:00.484 align:middle line:90%
all the employees up.

00:40:00.484 --> 00:40:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And you see that, and that's
an example of this happening.

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's exactly what has been
prophesied by these people

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:09.390 align:middle line:84%
because they realize in order
to come into balance and move

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:11.100 align:middle line:84%
to the next level
awareness, we have

00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:12.607 align:middle line:90%
to address we're out of balance.

00:40:12.607 --> 00:40:14.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We do, and
we have to engage

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:16.070 align:middle line:84%
with the physical
and material world

00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:18.580 align:middle line:84%
because we're here
incarnated into one.

00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not to demonize
a spare way of existence,

00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:24.250 align:middle line:84%
which if it's reflected
throughout their culture,

00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:26.130 align:middle line:90%
it's extreme poverty.

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of
extreme poverty,

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.890 align:middle line:84%
if you're looking
around Peru at large,

00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:32.750 align:middle line:84%
get out of some of
the cool little spots

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:37.330 align:middle line:84%
in Cusco or whatever,
people are barely making it,

00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:39.760 align:middle line:84%
and they don't have
necessarily ingrained in them

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.710 align:middle line:84%
the wisdom of the
people in the high Andes

00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:42.950 align:middle line:90%
that you were seeing.

00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:45.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's not to
demonize the poverty,

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:48.470 align:middle line:84%
because that's an extension
of that spare way of being.

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:51.150 align:middle line:84%
It's not to demonize the
material world either,

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:52.820 align:middle line:90%
from what I'm hearing you say.

00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:53.660 align:middle line:90%
It's supposed to.

00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:55.304 align:middle line:84%
Now come into this
beautiful marriage.

00:40:55.304 --> 00:40:56.720 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: Yeah,
when I first went

00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:01.160 align:middle line:84%
to India, when I was in my
early 20s, I sat in Delhi

00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:03.290 align:middle line:90%
just aghast.

00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:05.262 align:middle line:90%
I had no words for--

00:41:05.262 --> 00:41:06.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I understand.

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:07.020 align:middle line:90%
I went to India.

00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:07.260 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:08.426 align:middle line:90%
>>JEFFREY: --for what I saw.

00:41:08.426 --> 00:41:10.220 align:middle line:84%
Because growing
up in the suburbs

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:13.360 align:middle line:84%
with going to Macy's as
a replacement for church

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:16.860 align:middle line:84%
on Sunday, it just-- I had
no reference point for that.

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And that suddenly thrust
me into this place of,

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:22.660 align:middle line:84%
wow, things are really
out of balance here.

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:24.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a
shocker the first time.

00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:25.784 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: And so
when I realized

00:41:25.784 --> 00:41:28.680 align:middle line:84%
I have to look where am I
out of balance in myself,

00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:29.880 align:middle line:90%
and then heal it there.

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:31.463 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized
I don't need this.

00:41:31.463 --> 00:41:33.090 align:middle line:84%
I need this because
I'm feeling alone

00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:37.647 align:middle line:84%
or I'm feeling something that
I see as a negative emotion.

00:41:37.647 --> 00:41:39.230 align:middle line:84%
So I try to replace
it with something,

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:42.660 align:middle line:84%
and that's kind of promoted
in the materialistic way.

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:46.920 align:middle line:84%
But really what I found is as
I get rid of all the things

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:50.300 align:middle line:84%
that I identify myself as,
even my name, something

00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:53.250 align:middle line:84%
my parents gave me, then
I start to get closer

00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:55.700 align:middle line:84%
to an energetic truth
of who I really am.

00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And then I simply lean into
the paqos or the shaman

00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:03.620 align:middle line:84%
or the rinpoche or whomever
it is to say, help me.

00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:06.000 align:middle line:90%
Help me remember who it is.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And then their
wisdom is such, it's

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:12.160 align:middle line:84%
like the sustenance of that is
something that money can't buy.

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:14.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
yet, in the West,

00:42:14.730 --> 00:42:17.290 align:middle line:84%
we generally have
enough sustenance

00:42:17.290 --> 00:42:20.380 align:middle line:84%
in terms of monetary gain
that we can even take time

00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:22.250 align:middle line:90%
to ask these questions.

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:26.120 align:middle line:84%
Where oftentimes in India,
for example, there's

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:28.020 align:middle line:84%
no time and energy
to ask that question

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:31.760 align:middle line:84%
when you're just trying to feed
yourself something above mud.

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:33.100 align:middle line:90%
>>JEFFREY: Exactly.

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:35.117 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there's no
beauty in that either.

00:42:35.117 --> 00:42:37.450 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: Yeah, I think
spirituality, for a large part,

00:42:37.450 --> 00:42:39.170 align:middle line:90%
is a luxury.

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:41.040 align:middle line:90%
But I find it's a necessity.

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And so if I'm going and spending
money to entertain myself,

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:48.585 align:middle line:84%
why can't I use that same to
address why I'm uncomfortable

00:42:48.585 --> 00:42:51.140 align:middle line:84%
and why I'm looking for
the stimulation outside,

00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:54.360 align:middle line:90%
or help others to bring it up.

00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:57.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, one of the
things that Westerners

00:42:57.070 --> 00:42:59.200 align:middle line:84%
have who are seeking to
fill that empty space

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:02.800 align:middle line:84%
or that disconnected spirit
is retreats of all kinds

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:04.980 align:middle line:84%
all over the world,
whether we head for Bali

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:06.280 align:middle line:90%
or wherever we head.

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:09.414 align:middle line:84%
And you offer these
Wisdom-Keeper Retreats, right?

00:43:09.414 --> 00:43:10.330 align:middle line:90%
>>JEFFREY: I do, yeah.

00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:13.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about those
and where you go, who you take,

00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:16.700 align:middle line:84%
how long they last, some
of the stranger experiences

00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:19.030 align:middle line:90%
that happen during these.

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:21.460 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: We recognized
really quickly that what

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:25.040 align:middle line:84%
was most important as an
offering was to give people

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.910 align:middle line:84%
an opportunity to go
into these cultures,

00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:28.710 align:middle line:90%
to go into these landscapes.

00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And the landscape there
is completely connected

00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:34.550 align:middle line:84%
and alive-- the term animistic,
the anim or the light force

00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:35.960 align:middle line:90%
in all things is flowing.

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:40.100 align:middle line:84%
So when you experience
the immediacy

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:43.010 align:middle line:84%
of how the landscape, the
elementals, the spirits

00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:47.160 align:middle line:84%
respond, it's something
that, again, we

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:49.640 align:middle line:84%
don't have a reference for
that much in the North.

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:51.940 align:middle line:84%
It's the equivalent of
going on a vision quest

00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:53.982 align:middle line:90%
or something like this.

00:43:53.982 --> 00:43:55.690 align:middle line:84%
But instead of being
alone in that quest,

00:43:55.690 --> 00:43:58.150 align:middle line:84%
you are guided and
held in the space,

00:43:58.150 --> 00:44:00.486 align:middle line:84%
much like you see in the
film, where we go deep

00:44:00.486 --> 00:44:01.360 align:middle line:90%
into these mountains.

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:03.240 align:middle line:90%
We camp at 15,000 feet.

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And just that atmosphere
alone has a profound effect

00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:09.680 align:middle line:84%
on the body to receive that
much star light at night.

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:10.844 align:middle line:90%
And we simply set up--

00:44:10.844 --> 00:44:13.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that little
oxygen during the day and night.

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:14.061 align:middle line:90%
(LAUGHING)

00:44:14.061 --> 00:44:16.143 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: Exactly, well,
it actually aids ourself

00:44:16.143 --> 00:44:18.850 align:middle line:84%
and it shows-- any type of
altitude sickness, that's just

00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:20.740 align:middle line:84%
a blockage of
energy that's coming

00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:22.377 align:middle line:84%
from a blockage
in consciousness.

00:44:22.377 --> 00:44:23.960 align:middle line:84%
So it actually
accelerates the healing

00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:27.310 align:middle line:84%
by bringing that disparity
or that imbalance up.

00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And we found that taking people
from the West or the North

00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:34.960 align:middle line:84%
and giving them a 9 or 15
day experience, where they're

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:38.892 align:middle line:84%
completely merged
into it, is completely

00:44:38.892 --> 00:44:40.350 align:middle line:84%
different than at
a retreat center.

00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:42.370 align:middle line:84%
Because even when we
rent retreat centers,

00:44:42.370 --> 00:44:44.290 align:middle line:84%
we found that it's
a distraction.

00:44:44.290 --> 00:44:46.690 align:middle line:84%
So now we just simply
camp, because everybody

00:44:46.690 --> 00:44:50.280 align:middle line:84%
comes together as a whole
and relies on each other.

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:54.100 align:middle line:84%
So those ways we separate
ourselves and go into our rooms

00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:56.300 align:middle line:84%
and look in the mirror
and check ourselves

00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:58.310 align:middle line:90%
are taken out of the equation.

00:44:58.310 --> 00:45:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And what's left is you
and your pure relationship

00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:03.760 align:middle line:84%
with the landscape
and each other.

00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:05.855 align:middle line:84%
And after five days of
camping without a shower,

00:45:05.855 --> 00:45:07.230 align:middle line:84%
there's really no
hiding anymore.

00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:08.366 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:08.366 --> 00:45:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: So it gives
people the opportunity

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:13.060 align:middle line:84%
to get past a lot of I would
say the pathologies that we've

00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:16.832 align:middle line:84%
created in the violence
of our separation.

00:45:16.832 --> 00:45:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean
that judgmentally.

00:45:18.290 --> 00:45:21.800 align:middle line:84%
I just mean that we've learned
to be afraid of each other.

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And there, when you embrace
that culture that is completely

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:28.240 align:middle line:84%
woven together and the fabric
of the family is there,

00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:30.400 align:middle line:84%
the weave of the
landscape is there,

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:32.650 align:middle line:84%
the immediate connection
with the celestial realms

00:45:32.650 --> 00:45:35.090 align:middle line:84%
there, it puts you in
an environment that

00:45:35.090 --> 00:45:37.230 align:middle line:84%
is completely
different than anything

00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:39.750 align:middle line:84%
that I ever
experienced in my life.

00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And it puts me in contact with
a-- it's like a fish swimming

00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:44.800 align:middle line:90%
upstream to where it spawned.

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:45.335 align:middle line:90%
There's no dams.

00:45:45.335 --> 00:45:46.135 align:middle line:90%
There's no river.

00:45:46.135 --> 00:45:47.130 align:middle line:90%
It's unbroken.

00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:49.200 align:middle line:90%
It's a complete pathway.

00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And that provides a
clarity that I really

00:45:53.570 --> 00:45:56.040 align:middle line:84%
didn't find in a lot
of different places.

00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:58.159 align:middle line:84%
I found aspects but
not that fullness.

00:45:58.159 --> 00:45:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
and I can understand

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:02.220 align:middle line:84%
why you'd want to get people
away from retreat centers that

00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:04.470 align:middle line:84%
are embedded in the very
culture that they're actually

00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:07.405 align:middle line:84%
trying to get away from
for a moment or two.

00:46:07.405 --> 00:46:09.860 align:middle line:84%
You said there are some
kind of strange experiences

00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:12.500 align:middle line:84%
also that people
find rather mind

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:15.020 align:middle line:84%
blowing when they get
out into that kind

00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:19.150 align:middle line:90%
of raw animistic environment.

00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:21.150 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: I think
the relationship

00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:24.960 align:middle line:84%
with the elementals is always
the most shocking for people.

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:27.670 align:middle line:84%
So as paqos, we'll
go into prayer,

00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:29.150 align:middle line:90%
like you see in the film.

00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And there's a call and
response from nature.

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:34.760 align:middle line:90%
So maybe a perfectly blue sky.

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And as you say your
prayer, lightning

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:38.390 align:middle line:90%
clashes right above your head.

00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And your mind says
it's not possible

00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:43.230 align:middle line:84%
because I know from science this
has to happen to create this,

00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:46.790 align:middle line:90%
and it's just not the way it is.

00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Rain storms come through and
then part and go around you.

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Shafts of light coming
down and healings--

00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:55.310 align:middle line:90%
any number of things.

00:46:55.310 --> 00:46:59.060 align:middle line:84%
It's fantastical to
the Western mind.

00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:01.520 align:middle line:84%
But if it's not there,
then something's

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:03.400 align:middle line:90%
wrong to the ancient mind.

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:05.910 align:middle line:84%
It understands that's
the communication.

00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:08.240 align:middle line:90%
As I call, it responds.

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:12.620 align:middle line:84%
As I step into myself and
bring something to reality,

00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:15.445 align:middle line:84%
the energy from that comes
from those other places.

00:47:15.445 --> 00:47:16.320 align:middle line:90%
So it's a collective.

00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:19.960 align:middle line:84%
It's you and I coming together
to do work here today.

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:23.220 align:middle line:84%
It's ourselves and thunder
or lightning or rain

00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:25.950 align:middle line:84%
or all of these things or
angels, as the Christians would

00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:29.100 align:middle line:84%
call it, coming together
to realize something.

00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:33.190 align:middle line:84%
And for Westerners
to see that response

00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:36.669 align:middle line:84%
is as real as this table,
it takes a their mind--

00:47:36.669 --> 00:47:37.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Alters their reality.

00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:39.570 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: And just gives a
whole different space to them.

00:47:39.570 --> 00:47:40.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:42.760 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to take a look at
one more clip of the film.

00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
explain afterward

00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:46.992 align:middle line:90%
what was going on here.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:48:32.457 --> 00:48:33.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So what was happening?

00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:37.500 align:middle line:84%
Who was this person that was
experiencing this blessing,

00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:39.540 align:middle line:90%
almost like a baptism of sorts?

00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:42.140 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: This was a
man from the Midwest that

00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:43.640 align:middle line:90%
came on one of our retreats.

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And he was having a
cathartic emotional event,

00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:52.840 align:middle line:84%
where he brought himself kind of
fully loaded to the mountains.

00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And through the process of
harmonization and purification

00:48:55.470 --> 00:48:58.630 align:middle line:84%
and calling these energies,
the energies rise up,

00:48:58.630 --> 00:49:01.080 align:middle line:90%
and it causes the body to lift.

00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And all that emotional
sediment, so to speak, comes up

00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:08.460 align:middle line:84%
and then comes out, as
you saw him experience.

00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:10.592 align:middle line:84%
He didn't really
have words for it.

00:49:10.592 --> 00:49:11.800 align:middle line:90%
He didn't know it was coming.

00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:13.633 align:middle line:84%
He just knew he needed
to address something,

00:49:13.633 --> 00:49:15.260 align:middle line:90%
and he had no way to do it.

00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:18.710 align:middle line:84%
Other forms of therapy that
he was working didn't work.

00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:20.330 align:middle line:84%
And so we just put
him in the event

00:49:20.330 --> 00:49:22.240 align:middle line:84%
in front of one of
the holy mountains

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:24.190 align:middle line:90%
and turned up the volume.

00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:26.870 align:middle line:90%
And you saw him emote.

00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:30.074 align:middle line:84%
And also there's a
woman there that's

00:49:30.074 --> 00:49:31.240 align:middle line:90%
having a similar experience.

00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And when man and woman come
into that honesty together,

00:49:35.210 --> 00:49:36.620 align:middle line:84%
it heals the
relationship between

00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:39.110 align:middle line:84%
the masculine and feminine,
between each other

00:49:39.110 --> 00:49:40.630 align:middle line:90%
and within themselves.

00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's a lot
of the work for us

00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:44.421 align:middle line:84%
in the West to do is
to learn to be safe--

00:49:44.421 --> 00:49:45.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A lot.

00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:46.035 align:middle line:90%
>>JEFFREY: --with one another--

00:49:46.035 --> 00:49:46.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's true.

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:48.990 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: --to recognize the
strength of the feminine aspect

00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:50.747 align:middle line:84%
of me as a man
and the masculine,

00:49:50.747 --> 00:49:51.830 align:middle line:90%
and say a man and a woman.

00:49:51.830 --> 00:49:54.850 align:middle line:84%
So that the woman isn't out of
balance and competing as a man

00:49:54.850 --> 00:49:56.910 align:middle line:90%
but losing her femininity.

00:49:56.910 --> 00:50:01.370 align:middle line:84%
Or the man, not in a dominant
aspect of masculinity,

00:50:01.370 --> 00:50:03.820 align:middle line:84%
but understands the
sacredness of his masculinity

00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:06.040 align:middle line:90%
and how those two work together.

00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:08.100 align:middle line:84%
So in these times and
what Allen, the man

00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:10.190 align:middle line:84%
we're speaking about,
experience was how

00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:12.370 align:middle line:84%
does he then come
out of a position

00:50:12.370 --> 00:50:15.290 align:middle line:84%
of protecting and
defending woman

00:50:15.290 --> 00:50:17.150 align:middle line:90%
because she has asked him to?

00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And when woman comes into her
own kind of eternal sense of I

00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:24.670 align:middle line:84%
bring in creation
and I birth it,

00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:28.650 align:middle line:84%
whether it be a baby or a
book or a meal or anything

00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:31.040 align:middle line:84%
like that, it's coming
into the fullness of woman.

00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And then man can step aside
out of the warrior position

00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:37.000 align:middle line:84%
and use his shepherd's hook or
his spear as a shepherd hook

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.590 align:middle line:84%
and really come to
shepherd consciousness

00:50:40.590 --> 00:50:42.290 align:middle line:84%
and stand there as
the two pillars.

00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And what's created
in between them

00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:46.790 align:middle line:84%
is that holy space where
everything comes through.

00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:49.974 align:middle line:90%
That's the sacred marriage.

00:50:49.974 --> 00:50:52.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Much work needs to
be done in the West that way,

00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:54.504 align:middle line:84%
but also in the East and
also in South America.

00:50:54.504 --> 00:50:55.420 align:middle line:90%
>>JEFFREY: Everywhere.

00:50:55.420 --> 00:50:57.461 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The relationships
between men and women

00:50:57.461 --> 00:50:59.340 align:middle line:84%
on the planet are
severely broken, either

00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:01.604 align:middle line:90%
from old paradigms or new.

00:51:01.604 --> 00:51:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: And so the
retreats or the programs

00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:05.840 align:middle line:84%
we offer in different
cities around the world

00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:09.560 align:middle line:84%
is experientially allowing
yourself to go into a space

00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:11.960 align:middle line:84%
and be held in such a
safety and understanding,

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:13.840 align:middle line:84%
and given a map of
consciousness so

00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:17.480 align:middle line:84%
you can recognize where
imbalance or unconsciousness

00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:20.570 align:middle line:84%
has its place in the cycle, and
then how we become alchemists

00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:23.070 align:middle line:90%
and change that into growth.

00:51:23.070 --> 00:51:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And in that way, people
have a working functioning

00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:28.330 align:middle line:84%
understanding that
they can then take back

00:51:28.330 --> 00:51:31.070 align:middle line:84%
to their family, their
boardroom, their classroom,

00:51:31.070 --> 00:51:32.660 align:middle line:84%
with their employees
or employers

00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:33.910 align:middle line:90%
and start to integrate this.

00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:35.960 align:middle line:84%
I always say in the last
day of the retreats,

00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:37.370 align:middle line:90%
we just did the prep work.

00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:39.140 align:middle line:84%
Now your work's really going
to begin the moment you get off

00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:40.100 align:middle line:90%
your plane.

00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:42.509 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, quite a shock.

00:51:42.509 --> 00:51:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: They often say, well,
how is this going to happen?

00:51:45.050 --> 00:51:46.140 align:middle line:10%
And I say, well, it's
going to be attracted

00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:49.030 align:middle line:10%
to you electromagnetically
because your thought is putting

00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:50.710 align:middle line:10%
out a certain form,
and you're going

00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:52.810 align:middle line:10%
to get exactly the opportunity.

00:51:52.810 --> 00:51:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, your option is to see do I
run from it, or do I engage it?

00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:58.730 align:middle line:84%
Do I see past the
screaming person

00:51:58.730 --> 00:52:02.020 align:middle line:84%
that's asking me to love
them in a very strange way?

00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And do I take this
opportunity to be a peacemaker

00:52:05.570 --> 00:52:06.550 align:middle line:90%
and bring it here?

00:52:06.550 --> 00:52:09.200 align:middle line:84%
Or do I simply retract
and go somewhere else

00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:11.720 align:middle line:84%
and then try to find
myself outside myself,

00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:14.540 align:middle line:84%
when all paths go
to the same place,

00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:17.740 align:middle line:84%
one's more expensive and maybe a
little more suffering involved?

00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:21.630 align:middle line:84%
I can't say that the path
of awakening is easy.

00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:22.814 align:middle line:90%
It's very simple.

00:52:22.814 --> 00:52:23.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But it's not easy.

00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: It takes
a lot of courage.

00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:25.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:29.310 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: And I think these
ancient cultures understand

00:52:29.310 --> 00:52:32.720 align:middle line:84%
this and embody it and then
can be that kind of beacon

00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:34.450 align:middle line:90%
in the darkness for us.

00:52:34.450 --> 00:52:35.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:35.250 --> 00:52:37.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, beautiful work
on your own life

00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:40.025 align:middle line:84%
and throughout your lifetime
and also in your film.

00:52:40.025 --> 00:52:40.900 align:middle line:90%
>>JEFFREY: Thank you.

00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:42.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I appreciate
you being here.

00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:43.670 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: Thank you very
much for having me today.

00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:45.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it was wonderful.

00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:48.700 align:middle line:84%
