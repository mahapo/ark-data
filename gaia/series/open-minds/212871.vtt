>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Angels and guides often

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.990 align:middle line:10%
seem to present us with
a double-edged sword.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.550 align:middle line:10%
Are we to engage them
only when necessary?

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.480 align:middle line:84%
Do they want us to call on them
for anything we can think of,

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.520 align:middle line:84%
or what if our
desire is selfish?

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.580 align:middle line:84%
Normandi Ellis is here today to
speak with us about the nature

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.000 align:middle line:84%
and history of angels and how
they engage with our lives.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.800 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Normandi.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NORMANDI ELLIS:
Thank you, Regina.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.298 align:middle line:90%
Really good to be here.

00:00:37.298 --> 00:00:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm happy
to have you here.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.110 align:middle line:84%
Let's just start
with your youth.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.760 align:middle line:84%
When you were young,
you told your mom

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.190 align:middle line:84%
that God's wife
was singing to you

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.900 align:middle line:84%
and that you sometimes
talked to her too.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.670 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that for just a sec.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: OK.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.960 align:middle line:90%
I was living in Kentucky.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.490 align:middle line:10%
It was a very deep
storm going on outside,

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.220 align:middle line:10%
and I could hear her calling
through the eaves of the house.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.400 align:middle line:84%
It was almost as if
she was saying my name.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.580 align:middle line:84%
So I opened the
door, and there stood

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.040 align:middle line:90%
this amazingly, beautiful angel.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
else to call her.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.890 align:middle line:90%
And she asked to come in.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.430 align:middle line:10%
And so I told my
mother, come in.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And my mother said
who's sitting with us.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.340 align:middle line:90%
I said, it's God's wife.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.320 align:middle line:90%
She tells me, it's God's wife.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.190 align:middle line:84%
My mother was-- she
was pretty curious.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.270 align:middle line:90%
She was like, OK.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.920 align:middle line:90%
Would you like a cup of coffee?

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's good.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.680 align:middle line:90%
She listened to you.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.120 align:middle line:84%
Usually they'd say, oh,
go play with your toys.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.920 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Oh, right.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.460 align:middle line:90%
That's--

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.885 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's wonderful.

00:01:37.885 --> 00:01:39.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: --true, but
she wanted to know.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.550 align:middle line:84%
So she invited her
to have coffee?

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.350 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Yes.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And so my mother and
Isis, which I later

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.183 align:middle line:84%
learned was God's wife's
name, had coffee together.

00:01:49.183 --> 00:01:50.600 align:middle line:84%
My mother would
ask me, well, what

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.383 align:middle line:84%
does she think about
blah, blah, blah?

00:01:52.383 --> 00:01:53.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's good.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: And I would
listen and tell her

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.270 align:middle line:90%
what she thought about it.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of the
interesting things about that

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.370 align:middle line:84%
is that my mother's sister had
had a son who died in his youth,

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.389 align:middle line:84%
when my mother was trying to
decide what religion should I?

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:10.910 align:middle line:90%
Be Catholic or what?

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.890 align:middle line:84%
She was leaving the
Catholic Church.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And so the question
she was asking me,

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.490 align:middle line:90%
Isis was answering for her.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.237 align:middle line:84%
And so I think it
really came in--

00:02:19.237 --> 00:02:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, was your mom
resonating with the answers?

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:22.800 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Oh, yes.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.700 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So did she--

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.170 align:middle line:84%
did you get a little more
street cred with her after that?

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Did she think you were
tapped into something

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.097 align:middle line:90%
or just a smart little kid?

00:02:33.097 --> 00:02:33.930 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: I think so.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.400 align:middle line:84%
I think she-- I got a
little street cred for it.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.335 align:middle line:84%
But I really resonated
with spirituality.

00:02:43.335 --> 00:02:46.560 align:middle line:90%
I had an aunt who--

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.830 align:middle line:84%
a great aunt, who was
a spiritualist medium.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, so your mom was
at least accustomed to this

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.180 align:middle line:90%
already?

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Oh, yeah.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.780 align:middle line:84%
She had had Billy, who
was the cousin who died,

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.990 align:middle line:84%
show up in this
aunt's room where

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.250 align:middle line:90%
she was sleeping one night.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.400 align:middle line:84%
It was a seance room
by day-- by night.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And my mother is staying with
my aunt, and so she saw Billy.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.180 align:middle line:90%
And it freaked her out.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.500 align:middle line:84%
So she put the pillow over her
face and told him to go away.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And in the morning, my aunt
was very angry with her.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.640 align:middle line:90%
My mother said, what's wrong?

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.440 align:middle line:90%
What did I do?

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you aren't
very nice to my guests.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.570 align:middle line:90%
You told Billy to go away.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.045 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But how nice it is
that your family was so open--

00:03:30.045 --> 00:03:30.720 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: They were.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.815 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --to the other realms?

00:03:31.815 --> 00:03:32.160 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Yes.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
were very lucky

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.307 align:middle line:84%
that they didn't shut
you down at a young age.

00:03:35.307 --> 00:03:38.910 align:middle line:84%
So in not shutting you down,
how did this continue developing

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.890 align:middle line:84%
and how long was it before you
understood that this was Isis?

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:51.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: I think I understood
that it was Isis rather early.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.330 align:middle line:84%
I started as a young adult
to read Dion Fortune.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And Dion Fortune clued
me in about priestess.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.230 align:middle line:90%
And so I read a lot of her work.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.720 align:middle line:84%
I had a lot of
incidences where things

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.290 align:middle line:90%
would manifest in my house.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And I at first was
afraid of them.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.580 align:middle line:84%
So I learned how
to protect myself.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.209 align:middle line:84%
And then I learned how
to talk with spirit.

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, that
kind of leads us

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.650 align:middle line:84%
into the story of how
I began to translate

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.750 align:middle line:90%
the Egyptian hieroglyphs.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.900 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, I mean, so here Isis is it
from the Egyptian iconography

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.180 align:middle line:84%
of the gods in the
order of the universe.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.400 align:middle line:84%
And my guides are the same,
come from the same background.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
that's uncommon

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.950 align:middle line:84%
right now that people who
had lives in that time,

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.490 align:middle line:84%
in Atlantean times, do
have their Egyptian guiding

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:55.820 align:middle line:90%
forces with them again.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:56.620 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Yes.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And one thing my
guides told me many years ago

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:05.710 align:middle line:84%
was that we did not accurately
understand the hieroglyphics,

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.670 align:middle line:84%
that there was much more
information than what--

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:11.052 align:middle line:90%
is it Budge--

00:05:11.052 --> 00:05:11.852 align:middle line:90%
Walter Budge?

00:05:11.852 --> 00:05:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Yes.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.405 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --had discovered.

00:05:13.405 --> 00:05:16.040 align:middle line:84%
That was a good start,
but that wasn't it.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Right.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
pick up the story

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.840 align:middle line:84%
from there because this
is fascinating to me.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:21.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: OK.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:29.770 align:middle line:84%
So it starts with my running
into an old neighborhood friend,

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.150 align:middle line:90%
who lived up the street from us.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.770 align:middle line:90%
He went to high school with me.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And then after he was
out of high school,

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.670 align:middle line:84%
he was drafted, big high
number, to go to Vietnam.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And he managed to get into the
medicore, medical part of it.

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And so he assisted
souls in transition.

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.957 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the Rosicrucians
came to find him and help him--

00:05:52.957 --> 00:05:54.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How interesting.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: --assist
souls in transition.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And so he had a lot
of material on that.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.230 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking
about Dion Fortune

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:05.350 align:middle line:84%
and he said, yeah, you
should read Wallis Budge.

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:06.730 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, oh, all right.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.580 align:middle line:84%
So he walks me over to the
bookstore across the street

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.670 align:middle line:84%
from where we're sitting, takes
the book off the shelf and says,

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:13.660 align:middle line:90%
buy this.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.560 align:middle line:90%
I was like, OK.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.630 align:middle line:90%
So I bought the book, went home.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And that night, he
comes to my door.

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.490 align:middle line:84%
He said, I just found out
that I have to leave town.

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.970 align:middle line:84%
He at that time was
working as a riverboat--

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.430 align:middle line:84%
on a riverboat and he
had to go downstream.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And he said, and I have to
move out of my apartment.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.700 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know what to
do with these materials.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.100 align:middle line:84%
But I'll give them to
you to take care of,

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.420 align:middle line:90%
and then I'll get them later.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.710 align:middle line:90%
I was like, OK, that's fine.

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.860 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'm not supposed
to share them around, but--

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was this
Rosicrucian materials?

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:46.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Yes.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.420 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Yes.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And so I took all
of his material

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:53.710 align:middle line:84%
and didn't think
much more about it.

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And I moved to
Boulder of all places.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.820 align:middle line:84%
I just felt this call like,
I have to go to Boulder.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.200 align:middle line:90%
So I went to Boulder.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.000 align:middle line:84%
I didn't take much with me
except $300 and his books.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And somehow I managed
to begin study

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.090 align:middle line:84%
at the University
of Colorado, which

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:16.730 align:middle line:84%
was right across the street
from where I was living,

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:20.360 align:middle line:90%
and in a translation workshop.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.658 align:middle line:84%
We had to work
with two languages.

00:07:22.658 --> 00:07:24.950 align:middle line:84%
I did Spanish, and then I
didn't have another language.

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:26.325 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm
assuming you didn't

00:07:26.325 --> 00:07:28.875 align:middle line:84%
suggest that it was Egyptian
hieroglyphics at the time.

00:07:28.875 --> 00:07:29.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Well, I did.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.740 align:middle line:84%
I said, I don't have
another language.

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
what interests you?

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:34.545 align:middle line:90%
And I said hieroglyphs.

00:07:34.545 --> 00:07:35.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, really?

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:38.510 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: Yeah, because I
kept these boxes of Robert's

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:41.150 align:middle line:90%
in the closet in my bedroom.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:43.308 align:middle line:84%
And I would open the
closet, and I could

00:07:43.308 --> 00:07:44.600 align:middle line:90%
feel them going [VOCALIZATION].

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.670 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: So he said, well, since
it's not your native language,

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:52.960 align:middle line:84%
go pick up something and
just start working with it.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:53.760 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:54.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow, lucky you.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:55.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: I know.

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:56.510 align:middle line:90%
He was a wonderful teacher.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:57.987 align:middle line:90%
Sidney Goldfarb, bless his soul.

00:07:57.987 --> 00:07:58.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: He was wonderful.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So take an
example of a glyph

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:10.940 align:middle line:84%
and what was previously
understood by Budge and then

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.570 align:middle line:84%
how it was fleshed out
within your meditations.

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.910 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: OK.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.730 align:middle line:84%
Let's use the image
of the dung beetle.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:20.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:24.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: OK, khepera, OK, that's
the name of the dung beetle.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.980 align:middle line:84%
And there are variations
upon the name.

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes there
were chants that were

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.970 align:middle line:90%
written in the book that was--

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:40.960 align:middle line:84%
it was always translated
as word for word,

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:45.400 align:middle line:84%
but it didn't account for the
play of sound into the material

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.840 align:middle line:90%
like, [NON-ENGLISH].

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.510 align:middle line:90%


00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And it means in the beginning,
which is khepera, I became,

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:58.240 align:middle line:84%
which is khepera, the becoming,
which is khepera, being,

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.690 align:middle line:84%
which is khepera, what I
created, which is khepera.

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And so it would not make
sense unless you figured out

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:10.900 align:middle line:84%
how to translate it and
try to keep the connection

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.820 align:middle line:90%
of the sounds in it together.

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it
went from, tell us

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.490 align:middle line:84%
what the original
definition of it was,

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:21.350 align:middle line:84%
and then when you did your
overlay, what it became.

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:22.150 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: OK.

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:27.280 align:middle line:84%
The original definition, it
was like, being becoming.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm a being becoming.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm a being becoming.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.852 align:middle line:90%
Over, and over, and over again.

00:09:30.852 --> 00:09:34.810 align:middle line:84%
But it didn't-- it didn't play
well because there were other

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:35.678 align:middle line:90%
connections to it.

00:09:35.678 --> 00:09:36.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm a being becoming.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And what did it
become when you--

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:43.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: In the beginning
I became the becoming

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:45.410 align:middle line:84%
being what I created,
which gives it

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:49.130 align:middle line:84%
a whole different flavor
because he was just saying,

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.740 align:middle line:84%
I am a being, I am a
being, I am a being.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:57.470 align:middle line:84%
But the flavor of the
extra consonants and parts

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:00.620 align:middle line:84%
of the language were
making it more than that.

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:01.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:04.760 align:middle line:84%
So you fleshed it
out into it sounds

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.340 align:middle line:90%
like a more dynamic language?

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:08.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Yeah.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:14.870 align:middle line:84%
For every sentence that Budge
had, I wanted to layer it.

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:18.560 align:middle line:84%
So I would layer
it with the sound.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.260 align:middle line:84%
I would layer it
with the imagery.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And I would layer it
with the narrative,

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:29.390 align:middle line:84%
which is the story
behind the dung beetle.

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:33.950 align:middle line:84%
So that became part of an
alchemical transformation

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:35.310 align:middle line:90%
that the Egyptians knew.

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:36.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:39.920 align:middle line:84%
So the other thing that my
guides had told me back then

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:44.600 align:middle line:84%
was that everything has been
left for us in the hieroglyphics

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.500 align:middle line:90%
about our future.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.417 align:middle line:84%
And they said they were
trying to make a joke,

00:10:47.417 --> 00:10:48.410 align:middle line:90%
but they're not funny--

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:50.030 align:middle line:90%
sorry, they're not funny.

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:53.790 align:middle line:84%
But they were saying, as you
would say, back to your future.

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And so they said, your future is
embedded in these hieroglyphics.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.390 align:middle line:84%
It's telling you
everything you need

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:01.880 align:middle line:90%
know to advance as a species.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:05.550 align:middle line:84%
Did you find that after
you translated it?

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:06.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: I did.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.320 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.350 align:middle line:84%
People will say to me,
oh, you must have had

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:14.990 align:middle line:90%
many, many past lives in Egypt.

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And I also think, well, maybe
I have many, many future lives

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:20.300 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just planning
them right now

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:25.850 align:middle line:84%
in studying this because in
reality, time isn't linear.

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:27.860 align:middle line:90%
It goes backwards and forwards.

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:32.000 align:middle line:84%
The spirit, let's
think of it as a bird,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.890 align:middle line:84%
fishes from one
end of the stream

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:38.700 align:middle line:84%
to the other end of the stream
and collects what it needs.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.550 align:middle line:84%
That's the same as
true with the Angels

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:45.800 align:middle line:84%
because we are all part of
a light dynamic which never

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.610 align:middle line:90%
forgets where it came from.

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:49.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to hop over into
the angelic realm in a moment.

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:54.540 align:middle line:84%
I want to just dig
a little bit more

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.340 align:middle line:84%
on the Egyptian part
of this because it's

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:57.780 align:middle line:90%
such a big part of your life.

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:01.660 align:middle line:84%
So of all that you studied
over those 10 years

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:05.490 align:middle line:84%
and looking at this template
for what humanity will become,

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:09.510 align:middle line:84%
what really stood out after
you had defined these?

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:13.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: The concept of
Maat, the winged Isis.

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:13.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:16.162 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: The concept
of Maat, I think that--

00:12:16.162 --> 00:12:18.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What you're
wearing around your neck?

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.995 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: Yes, I'm wearing
her around my neck.

00:12:19.995 --> 00:12:21.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:27.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: I think that that
idea of 42 negative confessions

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:31.000 align:middle line:84%
is what they called it, but
they were really 42 precepts.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.120 align:middle line:84%
I have not done this,
I have not done that.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.240 align:middle line:90%
It's much more than 10.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You could
explain to those

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:42.380 align:middle line:84%
who don't understand who Maat
is, what Maat represents.

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:45.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: Maat is the
goddess who weighs

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:48.160 align:middle line:84%
the heart in the balance
at the end of one's life.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Your heart is the
seat of consciousness.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And so your heart is placed
in the balance, which

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:59.830 align:middle line:84%
is on the scales of Maat,
and your consciousness, which

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:04.220 align:middle line:84%
is in your heart, it speaks and
it says, I have not done this.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.370 align:middle line:90%
I have not done that.

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:08.360 align:middle line:90%
So it's not what you do.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.535 align:middle line:84%
It's more about what
you have not done.

00:13:10.535 --> 00:13:12.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But in
terms of the negative?

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: In terms of
the negative, right.

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:15.107 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which
you did not choose

00:13:15.107 --> 00:13:17.680 align:middle line:84%
to participate in that would
have brought yourself lower?

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:18.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: That's right.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.620 align:middle line:84%
For example, I find
most fascinating

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:27.450 align:middle line:84%
that one of the precepts is I
have not polluted the water.

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:28.485 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:13:28.485 --> 00:13:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: That's something that
we need to pay attention to now.

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:31.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hugely.

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:32.600 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.880 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: I have not
dammed the river, which

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:39.960 align:middle line:84%
is to take the river's
abundance and take it away

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.080 align:middle line:90%
from your neighbor's land.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:41.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: So it's a
little fine tunings.

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:46.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Really
that does point more

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.960 align:middle line:84%
to how we're going to need
to rebalance ourselves

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:49.810 align:middle line:90%
in the future?

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:50.820 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Yes, it is.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, interesting.

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:55.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, OK, so let's
go on to the guides

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.540 align:middle line:84%
and talk about-- you
were in Egypt one time.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:00.280 align:middle line:84%
Obviously this led you to the
Egyptian Book of the Dead.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Yes.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now, we
have this story unfolding

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:07.050 align:middle line:84%
of the hieroglyphics, and
their deeper meaning, and Maat.

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:09.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's go to the
Egyptian Book of the Dead

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.130 align:middle line:90%
and what that brought to you.

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:11.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: OK.

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.430 align:middle line:90%
I translated the book.

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:16.380 align:middle line:90%
10 years it took me.

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:19.730 align:middle line:90%
I had never been to Egypt.

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:22.550 align:middle line:90%
And so I decided that--

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:24.860 align:middle line:84%
my mother-in-law at the
time, who was Greek,

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:27.020 align:middle line:84%
wanted to bring
us over to Greece.

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.017 align:middle line:90%
And I said, great.

00:14:28.017 --> 00:14:29.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be close
enough to Egypt.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm going.

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:34.190 align:middle line:84%
I was to meet a friend there,
but the friend had an accident

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:35.510 align:middle line:90%
before she could come.

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:38.420 align:middle line:90%
So I walked into Egypt alone.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:39.920 align:middle line:90%
I know no one.

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.860 align:middle line:84%
I know nothing except what I
know from the Book of the Dead.

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And yet, when I
step on the ground,

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:50.113 align:middle line:84%
I feel myself being lifted up
by this energy, by this spirit,

00:14:50.113 --> 00:14:51.780 align:middle line:84%
and I know I'm where
I'm supposed to be.

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked Isis,
show me the right person

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:56.900 align:middle line:90%
to take me on the tour.

00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And she walked me over-- it
felt like she walked me over

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:01.460 align:middle line:90%
to this table.

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.800 align:middle line:90%
I paid the man for--

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:07.970 align:middle line:84%
tour money and began to travel
on my own through Egypt.

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And it was an
amazing experience.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:14.360 align:middle line:90%
It was 1989 when I went.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:18.210 align:middle line:84%
It was a very different
Egypt than it is now.

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And I walked into
a shop, and I saw--

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:26.440 align:middle line:84%
I was in Luxor and I saw
this statue that I wanted.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And I was told I
needed to negotiate.

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:30.800 align:middle line:84%
So I tried to
negotiate with the guy.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.350 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't budging.

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:37.580 align:middle line:84%
But finally, I go back
before the kiosk closes

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.070 align:middle line:90%
and I purchase it.

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And then night has
descended, and I'm

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:45.150 align:middle line:84%
running through the street
trying to figure out, OK--

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:49.500 align:middle line:84%
clutching the statue
of Isis to my chest,

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.270 align:middle line:84%
it's like, I don't
know where I am.

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:53.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm lost.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:55.860 align:middle line:90%
And I felt someone following me.

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And I would switch over to
the other side of the street,

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.210 align:middle line:90%
and they would switch over.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:02.050 align:middle line:90%
And I kept going.

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:03.010 align:middle line:90%
I'd go around the corner.

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:04.343 align:middle line:90%
They would go around the corner.

00:16:04.343 --> 00:16:08.050 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh, my goddess,
what am I going to do?

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, this
carriage comes by

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:15.580 align:middle line:84%
and there's a young man driving
the horse and the carriage.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And he looks at me and he says,
lady, your hotel is that way.

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:21.970 align:middle line:90%
And so I said, thank you.

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:23.470 align:middle line:90%
And I run, and I turn.

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough,
that was my hotel.

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:26.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:27.707 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: I don't
know how he knew.

00:16:27.707 --> 00:16:29.507 align:middle line:84%
I had run all
through the entire--

00:16:29.507 --> 00:16:31.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it sounds
like someone gave him a nudge.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Yeah, I think he was.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:34.840 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, God gave him
a nudge and said,

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.020 align:middle line:84%
come disguised as that little
boy driving the chariot

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:39.550 align:middle line:90%
so she'll trust you.

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:40.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So, OK.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.530 align:middle line:84%
So now you're interacting with
your guides, with your angels.

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And so let's go to where
you decided to take this

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.800 align:middle line:84%
on as a life mission
to help others

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.780 align:middle line:84%
understand that they
too have angels,

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:55.960 align:middle line:84%
everyone has angels, and
the nature of that realm,

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.040 align:middle line:90%
and how they work with us.

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:58.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: OK.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:04.750 align:middle line:84%
So what caused me to pay
attention to the angels

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:10.839 align:middle line:84%
is actually that I was living
in Chesterfield, Indiana

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:12.819 align:middle line:90%
at a spiritualist camp.

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And we had a trail
of religions there.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:22.930 align:middle line:84%
All the major religions,
Jainism, and Buddhism,

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:27.880 align:middle line:84%
and Zoroastrian,
and Egyptian, there

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:33.020 align:middle line:84%
was an Osiris statue there,
and Christian, et cetera.

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
each-- what connected

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:41.310 align:middle line:84%
each one of these traditions
is that they don't always

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:45.570 align:middle line:84%
believe in the same God,
but they believe in angels.

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:48.270 align:middle line:84%
All of them believe in
the power of angels.

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And all of them believe that
angels are messengers, which

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:54.490 align:middle line:90%
I think is an important point.

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:57.780 align:middle line:90%
They don't say, pray to angels.

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:02.550 align:middle line:84%
They say ask the
angels for assistance.

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:03.350 align:middle line:90%
And where does--

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:04.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Big difference.

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:05.100 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Yes, yes.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.960 align:middle line:90%
And the assistance comes from--

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.250 align:middle line:90%
they take the message up.

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:10.120 align:middle line:90%
God, she needs your help.

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And so he sends it
down and he sends

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:15.800 align:middle line:84%
a particular angel, who is named
after one of his qualities.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:19.140 align:middle line:90%


00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.512 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Prudence?

00:18:20.512 --> 00:18:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: Well, actually
one of my favorite ones

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:24.450 align:middle line:90%
is this angel called Phanuel.

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:25.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: And the angel Phanuel
saves us from our own stupidity.

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:32.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, they must
be really busy right now.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.430 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Yeah, I think so.

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:41.150 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, and I wanted to
explore that connection

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:43.650 align:middle line:84%
between religions because I
thought that that was important.

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And the angels were
the vehicle to do that.

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:48.900 align:middle line:84%
So I studied all the
different traditions

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:53.220 align:middle line:84%
that I could and collected
all of their angelic stories.

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And in the process, I
ended up getting a PhD

00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:00.390 align:middle line:90%
in comparative religions.

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:04.740 align:middle line:84%
So my dissertation
essentially became the book.

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.720 align:middle line:84%
I just rewrote it so that
it was more manageable.

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:08.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right, right.

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:14.310 align:middle line:84%
So every tradition believes that
we have angels surrounding us.

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:16.290 align:middle line:84%
So let me get this
straight first.

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:19.210 align:middle line:84%
What's the difference
between an angel and a guide?

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:20.010 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Oh.

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:22.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because we all
perceive that we have guidance.

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:22.970 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Yes.

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And we can have guides who are
angels, but many of our guides

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:32.850 align:middle line:90%
have had a human life, OK.

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:36.960 align:middle line:90%
I have a guide whose name is--

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.390 align:middle line:84%
well, I'll just name
one, John RedBird.

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:42.720 align:middle line:90%
OK, and he once had a life.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.230 align:middle line:90%
And he is my protector.

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And Chuan in his native
language means red bird.

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.090 align:middle line:90%
So I heard John RedBird.

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:55.230 align:middle line:90%
OK, fine.

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:58.020 align:middle line:90%
That's who I communicate with.

00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:02.340 align:middle line:84%
His story I actually was able
to find it on the Internet,

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:08.680 align:middle line:84%
that he was a chief who stood
in one of the-- in Kentucky

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.320 align:middle line:90%
at one of the waterfalls.

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And he hid his people
behind the waterfall

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.610 align:middle line:84%
when they were
trying to kill them.

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And so he saved them, the
women and the children,

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.510 align:middle line:84%
by stepping out and letting
them think that he was alone.

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:25.180 align:middle line:90%
And he sacrificed himself.

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:29.380 align:middle line:84%
So this John RedBird was a
real Native American man.

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And I talked to him all the time
when I'm driving in the car.

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:37.060 align:middle line:84%
It's like, OK, I can
see out this window.

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:38.240 align:middle line:90%
Not so well out of that.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.730 align:middle line:90%
So take the wheel.

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:41.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking, OK.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Nice.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.155 align:middle line:84%
So you have very direct
personal relationship?

00:20:44.155 --> 00:20:44.955 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Yes.

00:20:44.955 --> 00:20:47.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So then how would
you add the angelic layer

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.190 align:middle line:90%
above that?

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:49.045 align:middle line:90%
Above, to the side.

00:20:49.045 --> 00:20:50.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't want to
make it hierarchical,

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.480 align:middle line:90%
but where do you add it?

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: I think that the
difference that I perceive

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.870 align:middle line:90%
in that is that angels--

00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:03.520 align:middle line:84%
most angels have not had
a human physical life.

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:06.770 align:middle line:84%
And they understand our
needs, but they don't really

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:10.820 align:middle line:84%
understand our attachment
to a particular outcome

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:12.518 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:21:12.518 --> 00:21:14.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the emotional
structure is very different?

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:15.610 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Yeah.

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:17.760 align:middle line:84%
The emotional structure
is very different.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:22.490 align:middle line:84%
So an angel will work with
us on an intellectual level,

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:24.440 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of our
guides work with us

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:28.800 align:middle line:84%
on an emotional
and psychic level.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.637 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So
day-to-day, you tend

00:21:30.637 --> 00:21:32.220 align:middle line:84%
to work a little
more with your guides

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:34.678 align:middle line:84%
or most people tend to work a
little more with their guides

00:21:34.678 --> 00:21:37.970 align:middle line:84%
because we're so
riddled with emotions?

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:39.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Right.

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:41.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so then,
how would we start

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:44.010 align:middle line:90%
interfacing with the angels?

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:46.320 align:middle line:90%
What would be the best way--

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:49.780 align:middle line:84%
best use of calling
on angelic energy?

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:50.580 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: OK.

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:54.990 align:middle line:84%
So I realized that I became
more comfortable working

00:21:54.990 --> 00:22:00.240 align:middle line:84%
with the angels when I
started to do meditations

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.670 align:middle line:84%
in the full moon
and the new moon.

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And in order to set the space,
I create a circle, a surrounding

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:13.770 align:middle line:84%
of protection, and then I call
on the angels of the directions.

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And I could physically feel them
come in once I called their name

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:23.940 align:middle line:84%
and stood there waiting for
Raphael to come from the east,

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:28.870 align:middle line:84%
for Michael to come from
the south, for Gabriel

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:34.330 align:middle line:84%
to come from the west, and
Uriel to come from the north.

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And I could wait there and
feel them surrounding me.

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:40.030 align:middle line:10%
And then as I did
the meditation,

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:45.130 align:middle line:10%
we could feel the light that
the angels were sending us.

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:47.710 align:middle line:84%
The whole room
became much lighter.

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:50.570 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's aura began to lift.

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
a really good way

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:57.370 align:middle line:84%
to start working with
angels, is to call them in.

00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:00.970 align:middle line:84%
You can do it one at a time
or you can set a circle.

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:03.340 align:middle line:90%
Many, many more will come.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, like I
said in the very beginning,

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.930 align:middle line:84%
I think people are a
little self conscious.

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:10.540 align:middle line:84%
Why would I-- why would
I call on a being that

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:14.730 align:middle line:84%
has so much already going on
for my personal little stuff

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:15.530 align:middle line:90%
in life?

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of people
want to know what's

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:19.842 align:middle line:90%
appropriate to work with--

00:23:19.842 --> 00:23:22.300 align:middle line:84%
you have your guides on board
with you when you're driving,

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:23.780 align:middle line:90%
like watch out on that mirror.

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:24.580 align:middle line:90%
It's blocked.

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:25.690 align:middle line:90%
But what about angels?

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:28.030 align:middle line:84%
What's the nature of
what you call them in for

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:29.333 align:middle line:90%
and utilize them for?

00:23:29.333 --> 00:23:32.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: The nature is usually,
when I do a meditation,

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:35.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing it not for
my personal gain.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:39.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: OK, I am doing a
meditation, and we're sitting

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:42.693 align:middle line:84%
and we're trying to
imagine world peace.

00:23:42.693 --> 00:23:44.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're trying
to bring higher knowledge

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:45.325 align:middle line:90%
for example?

00:23:45.325 --> 00:23:46.408 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Higher Knowledge.

00:23:46.408 --> 00:23:49.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's how I
use it too, higher knowledge.

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.940 align:middle line:90%
And it's interesting because--

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:55.480 align:middle line:84%
in fact, I'll just
toss this out to you.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:58.960 align:middle line:84%
I was listening to a podcast
with the British astrologer

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.120 align:middle line:90%
Pamela Gregory recently.

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:01.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Oh, I love her.

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:02.287 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, she's lovely.

00:24:02.287 --> 00:24:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And she had a guest on, Susan
Love I think was her name.

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And Susan said, I haven't
talked about this,

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:11.110 align:middle line:84%
but I've experienced
it for a long time.

00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And I recently
mentioned it to my--

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:16.660 align:middle line:84%
her following and they
started flooding her

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:20.950 align:middle line:84%
with feedback about
these blue beings.

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And I know my two
primary guides are--

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.080 align:middle line:84%
I just call them
the Big Blue Guys.

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:27.970 align:middle line:90%
And they've been with me--

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:30.880 align:middle line:84%
these have been with
me for about 25 years.

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.250 align:middle line:84%
They kind of-- I switched
out guides at one point.

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:35.980 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk a little
bit about this notion

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:39.970 align:middle line:84%
of these blue beings because
another lovely older woman years

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:42.010 align:middle line:84%
ago wrote a book in
Sedona about them,

00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:44.140 align:middle line:84%
about these blue beings
who are here to help

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:47.050 align:middle line:90%
humanity who are from Arcturus.

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:50.470 align:middle line:84%
So tell us a little bit, for
anyone listening that sees

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:53.410 align:middle line:90%
and experiences, the blue guys.

00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:56.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: OK.

00:24:56.120 --> 00:25:00.830 align:middle line:84%
My understanding in studying
all of these religions

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:06.350 align:middle line:84%
is that every one of them
is connected to astrology.

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:07.160 align:middle line:90%
And so each--

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And planets.

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:11.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: Each planet,
each constellation

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:19.480 align:middle line:84%
has its own blue beings, or
green beings, or whatever.

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:20.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Red.

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:21.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Red, yes.

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And each-- and in
studying the angels,

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:29.820 align:middle line:84%
each place is related to
an angel related to a star.

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:35.640 align:middle line:84%
So the angel is an overseer
of all of those Pleiadians

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:39.060 align:middle line:90%
or Arcturians.

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:41.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or one elephant in
the room would be Krishna.

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Yes.

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:44.145 align:middle line:90%
A nice blue being.

00:25:44.145 --> 00:25:46.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A nice blue being.

00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:49.870 align:middle line:84%
So these blue-- these blue
beings that people-- have you

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:51.120 align:middle line:90%
experienced these blue beings?

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:51.930 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Yes, I have.

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:52.200 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:55.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so what would you
say their fundamental nature is?

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:58.240 align:middle line:84%
Because I find are
incredibly helpful,

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.630 align:middle line:84%
but I just tend not
to ask for much help.

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'm shocked at how much
help is given if I actually ask.

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:07.500 align:middle line:90%


00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: I've tried
to understand them

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:12.660 align:middle line:84%
because I don't
see them as angels,

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:16.930 align:middle line:84%
but I see them as intelligent
life sent by angels.

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:18.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, OK.

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: OK.

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think that any
number of blue beings

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:28.550 align:middle line:84%
could come to you, to
me, to someone else.

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And I have seen
them show up when

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:33.646 align:middle line:90%
they have something to tell me.

00:26:33.646 --> 00:26:37.570 align:middle line:84%
"You need to pay
attention to this."

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:41.200 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough, they
tend to show up when--

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:44.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the nature
of Arcturus as a system,

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:46.810 align:middle line:84%
but they show up
when I'm near water.

00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:47.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:48.570 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Yeah.

00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:51.510 align:middle line:84%
So when I am near water,
when I was living at the farm

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:53.260 align:middle line:84%
where the creek ran
all the way around it,

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:55.510 align:middle line:90%
they'd show up all the time.

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:58.060 align:middle line:90%
They would show up in my dreams.

00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:01.090 align:middle line:84%
They had a lot of
energy for mind transfer

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:03.550 align:middle line:84%
and it was like, teach
me what I need to know.

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:07.300 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian gods
were blue beings--

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:08.100 align:middle line:90%
some of them were.

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:09.910 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's interesting.

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:12.050 align:middle line:90%
So I'll share a little anecdote.

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:13.300 align:middle line:90%
And I'll try to make it brief.

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:16.150 align:middle line:84%
It was a very profound
moment in life.

00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:19.330 align:middle line:84%
I've shared part of it before
I think in another talk.

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:24.100 align:middle line:84%
But I was in Israel, and
through bizarre circumstance

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:27.580 align:middle line:84%
I was at the John the
Baptist sanctuary--

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:29.260 align:middle line:90%
not sanctuary, monastery.

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And what is not known
is the baptismal well

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:36.910 align:middle line:84%
is protected within there,
but above it is a cave.

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:38.093 align:middle line:90%
I went into the cave.

00:27:38.093 --> 00:27:39.010 align:middle line:90%
This is right outside.

00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:41.050 align:middle line:90%
This is in Ankuram I think.

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:45.250 align:middle line:84%
And it was Christmas Eve,
Christmas Day-- maybe the day

00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:46.330 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:50.070 align:middle line:84%
Empty, there wasn't a single
person there, which was odd.

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And So I got the cave all
to myself and sat down.

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:56.450 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
everything came alive.

00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And these beings,
my guides, started--

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:02.470 align:middle line:84%
I could see them in the
room and a friend of mine,

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:04.300 align:middle line:90%
who shares the same history.

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And then this one in this
kind of billowy white just

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:12.070 align:middle line:84%
came diagonally through the
ceiling down in front of me.

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And I just-- I was
startled like I'd been--

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:17.750 align:middle line:84%
like a surprise birthday party
and you weren't ready for it.

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, whoa,
what's going on here?

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:22.270 align:middle line:84%
Hieroglyphics just
flashed by and were

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:23.530 align:middle line:90%
downloaded into the aura.

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:25.370 align:middle line:90%
And I said, who are you?

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:28.450 align:middle line:90%
And I heard Manat.

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:30.380 align:middle line:84%
I thought-- I was
trying to pick it up.

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:33.077 align:middle line:84%
So I got home, and then
talked to my guides

00:28:33.077 --> 00:28:35.410 align:middle line:84%
back when I was out of Israel
back in the United States.

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:38.695 align:middle line:84%
I said, yeah, this amazing
being, it was quite a show,

00:28:38.695 --> 00:28:39.495 align:middle line:90%
it came down.

00:28:39.495 --> 00:28:41.662 align:middle line:84%
They said, well, it took
that to get your attention.

00:28:41.662 --> 00:28:43.690 align:middle line:84%
She's been trying to get
your attention for eons

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:45.790 align:middle line:84%
and you haven't
really noticed her.

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yeah, I
thought her name was Manat

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:48.913 align:middle line:90%
and they said, very close.

00:28:48.913 --> 00:28:50.170 align:middle line:90%
That's my Maat.

00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And so they said, Maat has been
trying to get your attention.

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And that is that
downloading of information.

00:28:56.170 --> 00:29:00.160 align:middle line:84%
When I sit quietly, I do
get information from her

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:01.820 align:middle line:90%
in particular I believe.

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:02.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:06.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: I love what you say
about the hieroglyphics flashing

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:07.520 align:middle line:90%
through your mind.

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:10.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: When I was
in Egypt on a boat,

00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:12.835 align:middle line:90%
I remember one night we were--

00:29:12.835 --> 00:29:14.410 align:middle line:90%
the full moon was coming up.

00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:18.760 align:middle line:84%
It was an October full moon,
very spooky anyway, right?

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:19.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: And they were playing
music in the background.

00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And I looked into
the water, and I

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:28.480 align:middle line:84%
could see the music was
moving the water around.

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:29.980 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden, it started

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:31.613 align:middle line:90%
to create hieroglyphic shapes.

00:29:31.613 --> 00:29:32.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:36.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: And I was reading the
hieroglyphs inside the water.

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And other people began
to notice it too.

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:42.880 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, we got our videos
out and we're recording it.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.260 align:middle line:90%
It was quite amazing.

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:48.340 align:middle line:90%
But I think that happens a lot.

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:51.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think this
particular pantheon of beings

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:52.870 align:middle line:90%
is here on Earth.

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:54.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like they
said, your future

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:57.070 align:middle line:84%
is embedded in
the hieroglyphics.

00:29:57.070 --> 00:30:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And so your future, past,
whatever with that loop,

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:02.830 align:middle line:84%
but where we're headed
in terms of understanding

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:04.070 align:middle line:90%
the nature of reality.

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:05.920 align:middle line:84%
So I think that
pantheon of beings

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:11.500 align:middle line:84%
is back for those who can take
the quiet and time to listen

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:14.380 align:middle line:84%
and connect to start
guiding us with, again,

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:17.000 align:middle line:84%
this higher level
of information,

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.950 align:middle line:84%
a more refined
level of information

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:20.870 align:middle line:90%
than what we would normally get.

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:23.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's what I
find Maat particularly

00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:28.010 align:middle line:84%
wonderful for, is this
refined level of information

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:33.010 align:middle line:84%
saying just the right
thing when we need it.

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:34.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Yeah.

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:40.410 align:middle line:84%
There's another blue-faced
being called Ptah.

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And Ptah speaks the
world into being.

00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:46.714 align:middle line:90%
And his name, it's P-T-AH.

00:30:46.714 --> 00:30:48.670 align:middle line:90%
It's like [VOCALIZATION].

00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:50.530 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't move.

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:53.020 align:middle line:90%
He simply speaks.

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.090 align:middle line:84%
But he created the
world in this way.

00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And we hear that story
of how the world was

00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:00.680 align:middle line:84%
created through the lips,
through the language,

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:01.480 align:middle line:90%
through the tongue.

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:03.047 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Through the
vibration, the sound.

00:31:03.047 --> 00:31:04.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: Through
vibrations, the sound

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:06.090 align:middle line:90%
of the vibrations of speech.

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:06.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:07.990 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Yeah.

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:11.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we have--
so that kind of covers

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:14.230 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptian part, but
again, like you say,

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:17.200 align:middle line:84%
there are angels-- you say there
are as many angels as photons.

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.580 align:middle line:90%
Angels are everywhere.

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:19.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: That's right.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.083 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this gets
into an interesting subject

00:31:21.083 --> 00:31:22.030 align:middle line:90%
of free will.

00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:25.090 align:middle line:84%
Humans are really
unique this way.

00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:27.170 align:middle line:90%
We can say, hey, what the heck.

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:27.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm in Greece.

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:29.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to get
a bus ticket for Egypt

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:32.410 align:middle line:84%
and figure it out
when I get there.

00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:35.930 align:middle line:84%
That's not necessarily
the case on other planets

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:36.980 align:middle line:90%
and other realms.

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:41.090 align:middle line:84%
There seems to be more
of an orderliness,

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:44.600 align:middle line:84%
where the people understand
what they're doing together

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:46.730 align:middle line:84%
and work more toward
the good of the all

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:50.270 align:middle line:84%
where we're more free to just
do whatever the heck we want.

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And my understanding is we're
quite a curiosity for beings

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:58.850 align:middle line:84%
throughout the universe to watch
what this free will results in.

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:02.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're looking at what
it results in for good and bad.

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:03.770 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
angels and free will,

00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:06.660 align:middle line:84%
and how they deal with the
free will of human beings,

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:07.868 align:middle line:90%
and how they feel about that.

00:32:07.868 --> 00:32:08.668 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: OK.

00:32:08.668 --> 00:32:10.910 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to go back
to a biblical story, where

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:13.610 align:middle line:90%
Jesus is in the garden.

00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:18.140 align:middle line:84%
And he's praying and he knows
he's about to be sacrificed.

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:19.640 align:middle line:90%
And the angel appears.

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:21.590 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't tell him what to do.

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:25.730 align:middle line:84%
He just stands with
him as a witness.

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And his prayer is, take
this cup away from me.

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And yet he says, not
my will, but thine.

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And that is the essence of free
will, is to say not my will,

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:40.130 align:middle line:90%
but thine.

00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:43.490 align:middle line:84%
Or as my metaphysical
teacher taught me,

00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:47.750 align:middle line:84%
when you're working on something
that you're trying to create,

00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:52.340 align:middle line:84%
you'll say, this or
something better?

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And so you're going
to let the divine have

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:56.550 align:middle line:90%
a hand in figuring it out.

00:32:56.550 --> 00:33:01.470 align:middle line:84%
And that is acceptance of what
happens for the best of all.

00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:03.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's not how
we normally operate here.

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:05.560 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: No.

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:06.560 align:middle line:90%
No, I know.

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so how
does the angelic realm

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:13.625 align:middle line:84%
view human beings and
the way we use free will?

00:33:13.625 --> 00:33:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And how do they try to
work with us amidst that?

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:21.183 align:middle line:84%
Because there are just so
many options out there.

00:33:21.183 --> 00:33:22.850 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: And so the
stories that we know

00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:25.220 align:middle line:84%
are stories of how
God created man.

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:27.840 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how he created
the beings on the other planet.

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.750 align:middle line:84%
We're not told that
part of the story.

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:34.160 align:middle line:84%
OK, but there are many
apocryphal stories

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:37.250 align:middle line:84%
that have been taken out
of the various traditions.

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:42.110 align:middle line:84%
There are Jewish stories, and
there are Christian stories,

00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:43.513 align:middle line:90%
and there's--

00:33:43.513 --> 00:33:45.305 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Native American
creation stories.

00:33:45.305 --> 00:33:46.105 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Right.

00:33:46.105 --> 00:33:47.550 align:middle line:90%
All of those.

00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:50.560 align:middle line:84%
The apocryphal story
is that God said,

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:53.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to make these people.

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And he's making them out
of the same substance

00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:59.090 align:middle line:84%
as he made the
angels, but he's going

00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:03.470 align:middle line:84%
to add a little clay to it
to make us have a form that's

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:06.140 align:middle line:84%
different than the
angels, but we have a lot

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:08.060 align:middle line:90%
of the same energy of angels.

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And various of the other
angels come along and go,

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:14.460 align:middle line:84%
well, I mean, it's
not for me to say,

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:17.699 align:middle line:84%
but I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

00:34:17.699 --> 00:34:19.998 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I wouldn't make
people because, I mean,

00:34:19.998 --> 00:34:21.540 align:middle line:84%
you're going to put
them on a planet,

00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:24.943 align:middle line:84%
and they're just
going to run havoc.

00:34:24.943 --> 00:34:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
give them free will?

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:27.780 align:middle line:90%
We don't have free will.

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:30.150 align:middle line:84%
Why would you-- why
would you do that?

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And he says, because when
they come to me in the end,

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:39.409 align:middle line:84%
it will be more powerful than
even my work with the angels

00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:42.480 align:middle line:84%
because they will
have chosen me.

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's the
whole thing about free will,

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:48.320 align:middle line:84%
is that we need to learn
to choose the divine,

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:55.092 align:middle line:84%
and not to insert our
own emotional base.

00:34:55.092 --> 00:34:56.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a
very powerful journey,

00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:00.490 align:middle line:84%
and it's one that has a great
amount of resistance to it.

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And I know having read
from hermetic texts,

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.640 align:middle line:84%
they write about how
the angels will actually

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:09.160 align:middle line:84%
bow before a human
that has found

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:11.890 align:middle line:84%
their way through this
maze of life and journey

00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:14.860 align:middle line:84%
to ultimately choose
the divine in themselves

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:19.040 align:middle line:84%
and beyond because it's
such a hard journey here.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:22.720 align:middle line:84%
There's just so much to
distract us, so much to enjoy.

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:25.550 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, then
you hear the other part,

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:29.020 align:middle line:84%
which is that we are
here to enjoy this Earth.

00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:31.600 align:middle line:84%
We are here to enjoy
being in a body,

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:35.570 align:middle line:84%
being in this beautiful sensual
environment that we're in.

00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:38.260 align:middle line:84%
So that balance seems
to be the trick,

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:41.410 align:middle line:84%
trying to find the balance
between pure enjoyment

00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:45.190 align:middle line:84%
of the natural essence, and
sensuality, and beauty here

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:47.950 align:middle line:84%
versus the abuse of
it in taking ourselves

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:49.270 align:middle line:90%
into a downward spiral.

00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:51.990 align:middle line:84%
Really, kind of associating
with lower realm energy.

00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:52.790 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Yeah.

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:53.750 align:middle line:90%
I think you're right.

00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think the thingliness
of our existence confuses us.

00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:00.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:03.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: We have a
hard time saying, Oh,

00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:06.740 align:middle line:84%
that, pomegranate is just
wonderful, it tastes so good,

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:09.170 align:middle line:84%
and not going in and
hogging all of it

00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:10.670 align:middle line:84%
and making ourselves
sick with it.

00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:11.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:13.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: We have
to appreciate that.

00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:14.630 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:16.160 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, God.

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:21.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, waking up in the
morning and saying a prayer

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:26.560 align:middle line:84%
that everything that you do this
day is going to be God-driven

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:28.630 align:middle line:84%
makes your life a
lot more manageable.

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:29.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:31.455 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't take away from
the pleasure of life at all.

00:36:31.455 --> 00:36:32.255 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: No.

00:36:32.255 --> 00:36:37.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It may take away from,
as you said, the overconsumption

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:39.880 align:middle line:84%
of certain aspects of life,
which don't help anyway

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:43.330 align:middle line:84%
because that really amounts
to a feeling of lack, which

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:44.500 align:middle line:90%
leads to greed.

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:47.290 align:middle line:84%
The only reason we overconsume
is a fear of lack when

00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:48.680 align:middle line:90%
you come right underneath it.

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:51.700 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
in the end, there

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:54.430 align:middle line:84%
are varieties of angels
or categories of angels

00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:57.770 align:middle line:84%
just so people can see what
they resonate with here.

00:36:57.770 --> 00:36:59.900 align:middle line:84%
So plane one, plane
two, and plane three.

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:01.040 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Oh, gosh.

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:03.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We just have-- we have
about five or six minutes left,

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.020 align:middle line:84%
but I thought, geez,
we need to get to that.

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:05.820 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: OK.

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:08.890 align:middle line:84%
So the lowest
plane of the angels

00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:14.260 align:middle line:84%
are what we think of as the
everyday messengers that come.

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:16.540 align:middle line:90%
And in control of them--

00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:18.970 align:middle line:90%
there's three levels in those.

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And in control in charge are
the archangels that we know.

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:28.080 align:middle line:90%
And there are seven of those.

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.070 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:31.200 align:middle line:90%
Each tradition has seven--

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, all of them.

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:36.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: All of them have
seven major divine beings.

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And some of the levels above
that, some of the angels

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:48.200 align:middle line:84%
are intended not as
messengers, but as sun singers.

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.940 align:middle line:90%
They praise God.

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:54.930 align:middle line:84%
That's their whole point,
is to tell God, we love you.

00:37:54.930 --> 00:37:56.860 align:middle line:90%
We thank you.

00:37:56.860 --> 00:38:02.600 align:middle line:84%
I love the idea that
Shams, who was the Sufi who

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:07.100 align:middle line:84%
inspired Rumi, his name
in the Yazidi tradition

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:08.540 align:middle line:90%
means sun singer.

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And he would stand on
the edge of the cliff

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:13.730 align:middle line:90%
and sing the sun into being.

00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And we think about
Jacob's ladder,

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:18.620 align:middle line:84%
where he wrestles
with the angel.

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:21.410 align:middle line:84%
Then at the end, he sees
the angels going up and down

00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:23.030 align:middle line:90%
their several layers.

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And at the end, he
wrestles with an angel.

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:28.250 align:middle line:90%
And the angel says, let me go.

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:31.010 align:middle line:84%
I have to go because
the sun is coming

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:32.130 align:middle line:90%
because he's a sun singer.

00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:32.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:35.490 align:middle line:84%
So the sun is really central
to virtually all traditions--

00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:36.290 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Yes.

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:37.445 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --in the end?

00:38:37.445 --> 00:38:38.390 align:middle line:90%
It is central.

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:40.770 align:middle line:84%
And it is our life giver
in the solar system.

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:42.230 align:middle line:90%
So I think that's fair enough.

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:44.640 align:middle line:84%
So here we have
the angelic realm.

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
this other realm,

00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:49.250 align:middle line:84%
and you call it dominion,
powers, and virtues.

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:50.300 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Right, right.

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And the virtues--
the virtues are

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:55.190 align:middle line:84%
very interesting because
they don't really

00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:57.110 align:middle line:90%
have much of a physical form.

00:38:57.110 --> 00:39:02.330 align:middle line:84%
They show up as geometric
shapes with eyes.

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:05.720 align:middle line:84%
So it's like wheels within
wheels kind of thing,

00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:07.430 align:middle line:90%
like you see in Ezekiel.

00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:09.380 align:middle line:84%
They're very
powerful messengers.

00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:10.880 align:middle line:90%
They don't come very often.

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:12.830 align:middle line:90%
But when they do, it's like.

00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:14.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
to instill a virtue?

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:16.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Instill a virtue.

00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:16.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And then we have plane one,
which is the seraphim, cherubim,

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:21.900 align:middle line:90%
and thrones.

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:22.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: OK.

00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:25.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, the cherubim, we
always think of them

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.630 align:middle line:90%
as the little pudgy baby.

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.773 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:26.773 --> 00:39:27.220 align:middle line:90%
A little bit, yeah.

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:27.800 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Yeah, no.

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:28.760 align:middle line:90%
They're not like that.

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:31.775 align:middle line:90%


00:39:31.775 --> 00:39:34.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are they the ones that
are a little closer in that we

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:35.232 align:middle line:90%
tend to experience?

00:39:35.232 --> 00:39:36.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: They're
a little closer in

00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:36.900 align:middle line:90%
and we tend to experience them.

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:38.275 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I had
a dream one time.

00:39:38.275 --> 00:39:42.540 align:middle line:84%
This little man with this pure
white skin and these crystal

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:45.090 align:middle line:84%
blue eyes came and gave me
a little kiss in that he

00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:46.860 align:middle line:90%
was a little seraphim.

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:47.730 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Yeah.

00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:49.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, I don't
know if seraphim kiss you

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:50.570 align:middle line:90%
in your sleep, but anyway.

00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:51.370 align:middle line:90%
That was one.

00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: Well, we always ask
them to surround our bed,

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:53.700 align:middle line:90%
don't we?

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:54.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There we go.

00:39:54.210 --> 00:39:55.500 align:middle line:90%
Well, it was very sweet.

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:56.800 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't prurient at all.

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:57.600 align:middle line:90%
It was sweet.

00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:00.030 align:middle line:84%
OK, the difference between
the plane one beings,

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:02.580 align:middle line:90%
seraphim, cherubim, and thrones.

00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:06.825 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: OK, the thrones
are more orderly, more--

00:40:06.825 --> 00:40:11.010 align:middle line:84%
they're more of making the
world in which we live,

00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:13.787 align:middle line:84%
making the planet
spin in the right--

00:40:13.787 --> 00:40:15.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They create structure.

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.170 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: They create structure.

00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:17.128 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, cherubim.

00:40:17.128 --> 00:40:18.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Cherubim.

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:19.860 align:middle line:90%
The cherubim--

00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Give us a
general idea of what

00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:25.770 align:middle line:84%
the seraphim and cherubim, how
they present themselves to us.

00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:30.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: OK, they are more
called in by, I would say,

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.795 align:middle line:84%
organized religion
if that makes sense.

00:40:33.795 --> 00:40:41.010 align:middle line:84%
They take care of the places
in which we live kind of like--

00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:42.360 align:middle line:90%
gosh, I'm trying to think.

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:47.280 align:middle line:10%
I once saw a city of gold
appear on the horizon.

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:49.530 align:middle line:90%
And it was Merod.

00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And it was filled
with these beings

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:57.000 align:middle line:84%
that I would have identified
as angels that were cherubim

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.240 align:middle line:84%
and seraphim, but it
was more like they

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:03.360 align:middle line:90%
were Buddhist or Hindu.

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And it was a city
of gold that was

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:08.402 align:middle line:84%
floating through the air on
the harmonic convergence.

00:41:08.402 --> 00:41:09.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes, yes.

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:14.130 align:middle line:10%
>>ELLIS: When I sat
up at the mountains

00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:16.920 align:middle line:10%
and was meditating
before the sun came up,

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:18.900 align:middle line:10%
and I saw them
right over Denver.

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:20.490 align:middle line:10%
I was like, oh, that's cool.

00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I
was making it up.

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And my friend was with me
and she's, do you see this?

00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:28.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it sounds
like this group of angels

00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:31.620 align:middle line:84%
really protects the
energy of sacred spaces.

00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:34.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Yes, they do.

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And in the Tibetan
tradition, they

00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:40.440 align:middle line:84%
protect the monasteries
from falling apart

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:42.600 align:middle line:90%
during all the earthquakes.

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:47.190 align:middle line:84%
And so they're putting together
the structure of the Earth.

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:50.100 align:middle line:84%
So I would say, now
that we're feeling

00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:52.510 align:middle line:84%
all the energy of the
earthquakes coming along

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:53.310 align:middle line:90%
and the water--

00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:55.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have a lot of
Earth activity coming up.

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.325 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: We have a lot of
Earth activity coming up.

00:41:57.325 --> 00:42:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that those are the
angels that are watching that.

00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:01.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And we can call on them
to help stabilize things?

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Yes, we can.

00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:06.315 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:42:06.315 --> 00:42:08.587 align:middle line:90%
We didn't get to Lucifer.

00:42:08.587 --> 00:42:10.170 align:middle line:84%
Everybody likes to
talk about Lucifer,

00:42:10.170 --> 00:42:11.190 align:middle line:90%
but we didn't get there.

00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:16.620 align:middle line:84%
But essentially what would
you say Lucifer's purpose--

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:19.350 align:middle line:84%
in your studies, what
is Lucifer's purpose

00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:20.340 align:middle line:90%
among humankind?

00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:25.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLIS: I think Zoroastrians
have the best definition.

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:26.580 align:middle line:90%
They don't call him Lucifer.

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:28.230 align:middle line:90%
They call him Angra Mainyu.

00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a good
thought, bad thought.

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really he's an
embodiment of our poor choices.

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:38.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:41.900 align:middle line:90%
So lower mind-- lower mind?

00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:42.920 align:middle line:90%
>>ELLIS: Lower mind.

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:44.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, well, I
think that's about as good

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:46.170 align:middle line:90%
a description as I've heard.

00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:47.640 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's true.

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:50.090 align:middle line:84%
It's a representation
of our mind

00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:52.830 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't have the
divine overlay to it.

00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:53.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:54.540 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:58.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, I thank you so much for
taking 10 years to figure out

00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:02.370 align:middle line:84%
the hieroglyphics for us in a
way that gives it dimension.

00:43:02.370 --> 00:43:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And we can certainly
suggest that people take

00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:06.870 align:middle line:90%
a look through your own work.

00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:09.550 align:middle line:84%
So I really appreciate your
taking the time to be here--

>>ELLIS: Thank you, Regina.

00:43:09.761 --> 00:43:10.070 align:middle line:90%
It was fun to be here.

00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:11.612 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --talking
about the angels.

00:43:11.612 --> 00:43:15.740 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, well, next time,
maybe we'll get to Lucifer.

00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:17.910 align:middle line:90%
But for now, that's good enough.

00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:20.053 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, thank you
so much, Normandi.

00:43:20.053 --> 00:43:22.220 align:middle line:10%
Again, the name of the book
is The Ancient Tradition

00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:24.770 align:middle line:10%
of Angels, which you can find
through major booksellers.

00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:28.550 align:middle line:10%
You can also find her
work at normandiellis.com.

00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:31.490 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Open Minds.
