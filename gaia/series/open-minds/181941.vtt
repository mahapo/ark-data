[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:10.934 --> 00:00:20.378 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.378 --> 00:00:22.920 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: According
to my guest Randy Veitenhemier,

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.740 align:middle line:10%
we have the ability to change
our reality by understanding

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.210 align:middle line:10%
the rules of the game.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.570 align:middle line:84%
This happens by tapping into
a database of consciousness

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.470 align:middle line:90%
to answer our deepest questions.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.770 align:middle line:84%
In addition, Randy has
worked with the top masters

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.610 align:middle line:84%
of martial arts, Kundalini yoga,
shaman, and quantum physicists.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And today, he brings
his own teaching

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.970 align:middle line:84%
to us, which combines all of
the above into a self-created

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.780 align:middle line:84%
universe, as you call it,
measured by Doctor Hawkins'

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.630 align:middle line:84%
calibration of consciousness,
which is a wonderful starting

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.430 align:middle line:90%
place.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.763 align:middle line:84%
And we have a few different
places we can start in this,

00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:57.865 align:middle line:84%
because, first of all,
we were off-camera,

00:00:57.865 --> 00:00:58.740 align:middle line:90%
and we were chatting.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.407 align:middle line:84%
And you have your own
show here at Gaia.

00:01:00.407 --> 00:01:02.190 align:middle line:84%
So if people have
seen your show,

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.900 align:middle line:84%
they'll know some
of this information.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.519 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to give them
a little kind of glimpse

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.360 align:middle line:90%
into you.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.070 align:middle line:84%
So informing me of what you
do, you did the say your name

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.210 align:middle line:90%
and blah, blah, blah.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.280 align:middle line:90%
You went through your protocols.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And you talk about one
of the first things

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.530 align:middle line:84%
is are you actually
filling your own vessel

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.360 align:middle line:90%
with who you are authentically.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And let's start at
this place, because it

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.880 align:middle line:84%
seems that so much of
humanity has somehow

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.720 align:middle line:84%
either voluntarily given
away or had co-opted

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.912 align:middle line:90%
their genuine sense of self.

00:01:31.912 --> 00:01:33.370 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY VEITENHEIMER:
That's true.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And let's just
start from right there and what

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.770 align:middle line:84%
the repercussions are before
going into your new book

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.030 align:middle line:90%
and a lot more.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.187 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: OK.

00:01:40.187 --> 00:01:41.020 align:middle line:90%
Pleasure to be here.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.390 align:middle line:90%
Pleasure to meet you.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.640 align:middle line:84%
One of the things about
the study of the self,

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.120 align:middle line:84%
there's so many books,
so many avenues,

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.480 align:middle line:90%
so many ways to approach that.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.480 align:middle line:10%
And of course, every
author, every authority

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.660 align:middle line:10%
has their own ideas about that.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.040 align:middle line:84%
When I first was introduced
to Dr. David Hawkins' work,

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.890 align:middle line:84%
he had written a book
called "Power vs. Force."

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.580 align:middle line:90%
I give it to all my students.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.760 align:middle line:90%
I give it to all my clients.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.890 align:middle line:10%
And one day I said, David,
I want to use your book.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.050 align:middle line:84%
He said, for a
commonality of interest,

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.570 align:middle line:90%
a commonality of conversation.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.790 align:middle line:84%
And he's pretty
highly intuitive,

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.290 align:middle line:84%
because that was
the truth of it.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.320 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
when you talk to somebody

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.090 align:middle line:84%
is to have that commonality
of communication.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of that
is non-conscious.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.780 align:middle line:84%
Now we have a problem, because
the non-conscious knowledge

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.500 align:middle line:84%
of who you are, how you are,
what has happened to you

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.410 align:middle line:84%
generally doesn't come
forth in a conversation.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.060 align:middle line:84%
It's all surface level, or
even we say superficial.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.060 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Basic labels.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.270 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I'm a mother.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.500 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I do
this for a living.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.023 align:middle line:84%
I'm this old, this
age, or whatever.

00:02:56.023 --> 00:02:56.940 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yeah.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
somebody thinks

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.650 align:middle line:90%
they have some knowledge of you.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.950 align:middle line:84%
But the truth of
the matter is you

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.210 align:middle line:84%
as a person contain
all your information.

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.500 align:middle line:84%
You carry it in memory fields
is one way to look at it.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.740 align:middle line:84%
We could equate them to
one memory feel per year.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And that information's
available,

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.650 align:middle line:90%
just like in a computer.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.430 align:middle line:90%
And some people can access it.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.560 align:middle line:90%
We call them intuitives.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
popular in the '90s

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.850 align:middle line:90%
to become a medical intuitive.

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.550 align:middle line:84%
Carolyn Mayes and all
that group and everybody

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.350 align:middle line:90%
got all involved in that.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And really, it just
boils down to the ability

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.930 align:middle line:90%
to discern the truth.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It does, and be
able to do it through a lens--

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.340 align:middle line:84%
and everyone's is different--
that can be fed back

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.595 align:middle line:90%
to you in an accurate manner.

00:03:48.595 --> 00:03:49.470 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because some
people, you can just look,

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.920 align:middle line:90%
and you can see.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.720 align:middle line:90%
Other people know.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.070 align:middle line:84%
So the different ways in
which that kind of truth

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.800 align:middle line:84%
is reflected back is
important, because we

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.930 align:middle line:84%
seem to often
discredit ourselves,

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.120 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't look
like the way someone else's

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.258 align:middle line:90%
system approaches it.

00:04:04.258 --> 00:04:06.300 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Right.
or we acquired it through

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.540 align:middle line:84%
our intuition or something,
which, of course,

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.140 align:middle line:84%
is invalid but something
everybody does.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.150 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: So yeah, so one
of the things that happens is,

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.750 align:middle line:84%
when you're born, we could
say you're 100% yourself.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.003 align:middle line:84%
And somewhere along the
line, in my research,

00:04:22.003 --> 00:04:23.670 align:middle line:84%
generally around six
or seven years old,

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.980 align:middle line:90%
we start losing that.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.080 align:middle line:84%
We stop being present as
ourselves within ourselves.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And we extend our
consciousness out.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.270 align:middle line:90%
And we are extroverts.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.880 align:middle line:90%
We are engaged.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And home base kind of gets
abandoned to some level.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And then as we go
through life, we

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.460 align:middle line:84%
get beat up and
knocked about and go

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.640 align:middle line:84%
through all kinds of
experiences and ultimately

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.508 align:middle line:90%
lose our way, if not our place.

00:04:53.508 --> 00:04:55.550 align:middle line:84%
So one of the first things
I look at in a person,

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.320 align:middle line:90%
are you 100% yourself.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.570 align:middle line:90%
It's a very simple question.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:59.370 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And you were saying that in
85% of the cases, only about 2%

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.042 align:middle line:90%
of the original person is there.

00:05:05.042 --> 00:05:06.000 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That has
huge implications.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'd love for you
to talk about that.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.220 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Well,
David Hawkins said that,

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.930 align:middle line:90%
came up with that number.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And I work on people
and have for years.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And I've found it to be true
that the majority of people

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.260 align:middle line:84%
do not reside within
their own consciousness.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And martial arts training
and yoga and meditation,

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.220 align:middle line:84%
contemplation, it talks
about being centered

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.610 align:middle line:84%
or being present and being
present in the moment.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And all of that is
saying the same thing.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And then we go to what degree
you are present as yourself.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.890 align:middle line:84%
But then it gets interesting,
because if you're not yourself,

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:48.940 align:middle line:90%
who are you?

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:49.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Who are you?

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.780 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:50.200 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's the
interesting question.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.380 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: And
then, well, we have DNA.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.140 align:middle line:90%
We have our mom and dad's DNA.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.930 align:middle line:84%
And we literally have
their consciousness

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.480 align:middle line:90%
that is present in ourselves.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And generally
around 11 years old

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.440 align:middle line:84%
is where you see the
completion of the genome

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.550 align:middle line:84%
as far as consciousness
is concerned.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And you're no longer
your mom or dad.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:12.820 align:middle line:90%
You're yourself.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And of course, at
that point, it's

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.410 align:middle line:84%
also the deviation where we
tend to go to our friends.

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.250 align:middle line:90%
We tend to become a teenager.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.960 align:middle line:84%
We don't speak the same
languages, same music, dances,

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:23.950 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:26.440 align:middle line:84%
But then at 18, we
reach the completion

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.930 align:middle line:90%
of the physical genome.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.360 align:middle line:90%
At 18, that's who you are.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.280 align:middle line:84%
The body has reached its
completion from its start.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.310 align:middle line:90%
The consciousness has not.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And the consciousness, at that
point, is still malleable.

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:45.740 align:middle line:90%
You're still influenced.

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.240 align:middle line:84%
We say at 11 years
old, you become

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.000 align:middle line:84%
influenced by your
choice of friends,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.830 align:middle line:90%
by your little peer group.

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And of course, anybody
going to school

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.110 align:middle line:84%
at that age, your
choice of friends

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:57.370 align:middle line:90%
will determine your future.

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:58.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.348 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: And we
don't think about that.

00:07:00.348 --> 00:07:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And of course, nobody
teaches, hey, this

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.250 align:middle line:84%
is something you might
want to pay attention to.

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:04.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And
that's fundamental.

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:05.140 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.360 align:middle line:84%
If you can know
yourself and know that,

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.370 align:middle line:84%
then you are
capable of choosing,

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.450 align:middle line:84%
of discerning the truth
about who you are,

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:15.200 align:middle line:84%
where you're going,
and what you're doing.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:21.330 align:middle line:84%
So if we take all that, we
start having a better viewpoint,

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.890 align:middle line:90%
a better observation point.

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things, through
all the consciousness studies

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:30.940 align:middle line:84%
and everything,
is that you should

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.430 align:middle line:90%
be able to observe yourself.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.740 align:middle line:90%
We use other people as mirrors.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.840 align:middle line:90%
We use events as mirrors.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.150 align:middle line:90%
We use activities as mirrors.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.860 align:middle line:84%
But at some point, you should
be able to sit down and be

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:43.660 align:middle line:90%
yourself.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.380 align:middle line:90%
That would be ideal.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.650 align:middle line:90%
But what if you've been abused?

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:51.240 align:middle line:90%
What if you've been ill?

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:54.075 align:middle line:84%
It can be a long distance
to get back to yourself.

00:07:54.075 --> 00:07:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What I find
interesting as you're saying

00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:00.720 align:middle line:84%
these words is
how often people--

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.490 align:middle line:84%
they seem to be really kind
of almost self-centered,

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:05.410 align:middle line:84%
you'd say, in their
output and the way

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:06.670 align:middle line:90%
they're relating to others.

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:09.250 align:middle line:84%
Everything is
self-referential and so forth.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:12.010 align:middle line:84%
But because of this statistic
that we've brought up here,

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:15.910 align:middle line:84%
about 85% of people
only being 2% authentic,

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:17.650 align:middle line:84%
it seems to me what's
really happening

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:20.890 align:middle line:84%
is an attempt to glean
pieces of yourself

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:23.830 align:middle line:84%
through your interaction
with others as mirrors,

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:27.010 align:middle line:84%
to assemble some
context of what you are.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:28.120 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.430 align:middle line:84%
You've lost who
you are, we'd say.

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:31.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:34.179 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: And
Humpty Dumpty time.

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:36.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put
myself or piece myself

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:38.409 align:middle line:90%
back together in some image.

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:41.260 align:middle line:90%
And we'd look at that.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And to be self-centered is not
to be centered in the self.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:45.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.270 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: To be centered
in the self is a martial arts

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:47.550 align:middle line:90%
arm.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:48.760 align:middle line:90%
It's a meditation term.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.560 align:middle line:90%
It's a contemplation time.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.280 align:middle line:84%
But to be self-centered is, by
definition, to not be yourself.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which is ironic,
but that is how it comes off

00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:01.715 align:middle line:84%
to people around us when we're
behaving like that, right?

00:09:01.715 --> 00:09:02.590 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:04.423 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you
think, gosh, this person,

00:09:04.423 --> 00:09:05.778 align:middle line:90%
everything refers back to self.

00:09:05.778 --> 00:09:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And what are they trying
to piece together?

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:09.730 align:middle line:84%
Or what are they
trying not to lose,

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:11.410 align:middle line:84%
almost like they'll
lose the thread

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:14.960 align:middle line:84%
of the tiny bit of understanding
they have of themselves.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.960 align:middle line:90%
And this is epidemic.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.480 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:23.636 align:middle line:84%
The language is, existence
is self-sufficient.

00:09:23.636 --> 00:09:27.440 align:middle line:84%
I teach, you do not need
to apologize for yourself.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.150 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
validate yourself.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:30.700 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
define yourself.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:31.500 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:34.270 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: You don't
need to do anything in the way

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:37.270 align:middle line:84%
of explanation,
except to be present.

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:41.810 align:middle line:84%
If you are present as
yourself, you are sufficient.

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:46.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, that gets into judgment
and content and context

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:50.680 align:middle line:84%
and a whole bunch of things
where people become judgmental,

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.610 align:middle line:84%
because they operate off
content without context.

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And in the context of the
universe, you are sufficient.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:59.200 align:middle line:90%
It's you were created.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.000 align:middle line:90%
You're here.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.040 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:05.570 align:middle line:84%
Everything else becomes an
observation if it's in context.

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not an
observation in context,

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:08.717 align:middle line:90%
it becomes a judgment.

00:10:08.717 --> 00:10:10.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so
what is the context,

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.280 align:middle line:84%
the background context
for one's reality?

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: That the
totality of reality that you

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:19.940 align:middle line:90%
exist is sufficient.

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:20.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.073 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: I know that
sounds kind of an oxymoron.

00:10:23.073 --> 00:10:26.050 align:middle line:84%
But the idea that
you're insufficient

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:29.170 align:middle line:90%
is actually not true.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.300 align:middle line:84%
The idea that you're
not being yourself

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:33.860 align:middle line:84%
is true, for the most part,
for most people at any given

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:34.660 align:middle line:90%
moment.

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:35.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.810 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: So the idea
behind all this is you would

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:40.030 align:middle line:84%
find some way to come
back to yourself.

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there's
many ways out there.

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.295 align:middle line:84%
There's many paths
is what they call it.

00:10:44.295 --> 00:10:46.870 align:middle line:84%
What I've done is just
take all the information

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:51.760 align:middle line:84%
available through all the
different practices and studies

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.760 align:middle line:84%
and teachers and tried to
simplify them into something

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.790 align:middle line:90%
somebody can do very simply.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:59.260 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest
problems we face

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:04.180 align:middle line:84%
is that people override
our own energy field.

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:06.250 align:middle line:84%
They override our
own preferences,

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:09.070 align:middle line:90%
our own knowledge of ourself.

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:11.380 align:middle line:90%
We start to believe in things.

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And if you start believing
negative things about yourself,

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:18.550 align:middle line:84%
through marriages or through
school or through all kinds

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:22.030 align:middle line:84%
of mechanisms, then
the probability

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:23.710 align:middle line:84%
is you're not going
to be yourself,

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:27.520 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately, you're
not going to be happy.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.085 align:middle line:84%
So we equate happiness
with being yourself,

00:11:30.085 --> 00:11:32.472 align:middle line:84%
with being centered
and all that.

00:11:32.472 --> 00:11:34.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's interesting,
because we were playing around

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:35.500 align:middle line:90%
back there.

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:36.708 align:middle line:90%
And you were tapping into me.

00:11:36.708 --> 00:11:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And I had a fairly
high percentage

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:42.040 align:middle line:84%
of being present and available
in terms of being myself.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.310 align:middle line:84%
However, that said,
that the caveat to that

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:47.620 align:middle line:84%
is that for me,
an event happened

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.240 align:middle line:84%
at the age of two
which separated me

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.800 align:middle line:90%
out from humanity, basically.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:51.130 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:52.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA MEREDITH:
So I was a free agent.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.540 align:middle line:84%
So I did not allow
influences in.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And my whole point
of reference was

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.990 align:middle line:84%
whatever I observed
and participated in

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:02.490 align:middle line:84%
and whatever my
experiences were.

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:04.160 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes,
I agree with that.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so
it's interesting,

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:10.220 align:middle line:84%
because the more we socialize,
which is a good thing--

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:12.220 align:middle line:84%
It's a good thing to be
connected and socialize

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.447 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:12:14.447 --> 00:12:16.030 align:middle line:84%
It's the very thing
that takes us away

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:19.370 align:middle line:84%
from ourself, looking at it
in reverse of my situation,

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:20.170 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes,
because at two years old,

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.250 align:middle line:84%
we would say you became
an outsider to the rest

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:26.050 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:27.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, no, absolutely.

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:30.013 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: But that also
coincides with becoming what we

00:12:30.013 --> 00:12:32.920 align:middle line:84%
call a state of
the observer state,

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:37.000 align:middle line:84%
to be able to be within yourself
enough to be able to look

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.200 align:middle line:84%
at everything in a bright
light, we would call it, right.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.310 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting that all
the people we're around

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:48.850 align:middle line:84%
have the ability to
exercise exert or exercise

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:51.730 align:middle line:84%
some sort of control
over our energy field.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:54.483 align:middle line:90%


00:12:54.483 --> 00:12:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And everybody has
this experience.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:59.290 align:middle line:84%
I tell people, anybody ever made
you mad without touching you.

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:00.960 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, well, yeah.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And I go, they could
be 1,000 miles away.

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And one phone call and one word
and, like, rawr, rawr, rawr.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:10.330 align:middle line:84%
And what they did is they
took control of your heart

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:13.270 align:middle line:84%
rate, respiration rate,
glandular secretions,

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:16.000 align:middle line:84%
brainwave activity,
neural chemistry.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.410 align:middle line:90%
You talk about a weapon.

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And all they did
was push a button.

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:19.500 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: And
the button was you.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:21.730 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:24.272 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: So if we look
at that and look at the amount

00:13:24.272 --> 00:13:27.060 align:middle line:84%
of energy, it's kind of like
somebody pressing a remote.

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.580 align:middle line:84%
It didn't take anything on
their part, rawr, rawr, rawr.

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:30.100 align:middle line:84%
All you got to do is
mention your name.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.940 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: To go up your
sense of self against that.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:33.146 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they're
attacking, because that's

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:36.200 align:middle line:90%
where we're vulnerable.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But see, if we
don't have a real self,

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.200 align:middle line:84%
what are they actually
attacking except, really,

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.860 align:middle line:84%
kind of erroneously passing
through in held-now beliefs

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:45.660 align:middle line:90%
and such?

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Self-centered,
not centered self, right.

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:52.660 align:middle line:84%
So then, people say, well,
how does healing work.

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:56.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's the same
process in reverse.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:03.160 align:middle line:84%
It's somebody who is able to
have you be less energized

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.130 align:middle line:84%
to that name or to that
situation or that illness

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:07.420 align:middle line:90%
or that age.

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.390 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds of
different parameters

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:13.310 align:middle line:90%
that can be addressed on it.

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:17.470 align:middle line:84%
But at least it becomes a
start in the same fashion

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:20.630 align:middle line:84%
that you would pat
somebody on the back.

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:23.800 align:middle line:84%
The pat is delivered to
make somebody feel better.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.840 align:middle line:84%
If you expand that
with a lot of energy,

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.610 align:middle line:84%
then you're doing
the same thing I do.

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:30.200 align:middle line:84%
To me, you're supposed to have
about a 9-foot energy field.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.208 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: And it's
a great big ball of glowing

00:14:33.208 --> 00:14:34.008 align:middle line:90%
light.

00:14:34.008 --> 00:14:36.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you say also that
a lot of people in the world

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:39.400 align:middle line:84%
of martial arts, for example,
that is what you're going for.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.945 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have maximum
energy at your disposal--

00:14:41.945 --> 00:14:42.820 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:44.920 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --that you can
harness and use at will,

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:45.190 align:middle line:90%
correct?

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:45.460 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.330 align:middle line:84%
You draw energy from
your energy field.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:48.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:50.130 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Your
energy field supports you.

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:53.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's why
martial arts really has played

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:55.900 align:middle line:84%
largely into your education
and the concept that

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:57.635 align:middle line:84%
you've created, this
integrated concept.

00:14:57.635 --> 00:14:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:01.390 align:middle line:84%
But in America,
the first six years

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:04.210 align:middle line:84%
you learn martial arts, like
in kung fu and different ones,

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:06.040 align:middle line:90%
it's all physical arts.

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.320 align:middle line:84%
But very few people make
it through that training

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.180 align:middle line:84%
to the point you start
the energetic arts,

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:11.438 align:middle line:90%
the internal arts.

00:15:11.438 --> 00:15:12.730 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And you did Shaolin?

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:14.355 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER:
Yeah, Shaolin kung fu.

00:15:14.355 --> 00:15:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Kung fu
for 20-some years?

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:16.840 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: 20
or 30 years, yeah.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: 20 or 30 years?

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:19.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.520 align:middle line:90%
It sounds very exotic.

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:21.320 align:middle line:90%
We see movies.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.490 align:middle line:90%
We see martial arts movies.

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:23.550 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yeah, but
you only see the physical.

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We only
see the physical.

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:26.330 align:middle line:84%
So we don't really
understand it at all.

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:28.961 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: The
internal training,

00:15:28.961 --> 00:15:32.120 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't look as good on TV.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.400 align:middle line:84%
But you spend about
an equal amount

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.470 align:middle line:84%
in meditation and
contemplation as you

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:39.520 align:middle line:84%
do in actually physical exercise
and martial arts exercises.

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:42.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's talk about
what one of those meditations

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:46.137 align:middle line:84%
would be like to harness the
energy, strengthen the field.

00:15:46.137 --> 00:15:47.970 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Chinese
energetic medicine.

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:49.352 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:15:49.352 --> 00:15:50.810 align:middle line:10%
>> VEITENHEIMER:
More specifically,

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:54.870 align:middle line:10%
medical qigong therapy relates
to what we're talking about.

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:55.670 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:57.920 align:middle line:10%
>> VEITENHEIMER: And now we
break it down even farther

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:02.630 align:middle line:10%
instead of a big broad subject
to tai chi and then to qigong

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:04.740 align:middle line:10%
exercises.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:08.060 align:middle line:10%
There's a gentleman named
Robert Pang in New York

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:11.480 align:middle line:10%
City who wrote a book about it.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.360 align:middle line:10%
And I went to see him
and talked to him.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.840 align:middle line:10%
And what was fascinating,
he had his training in China

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.070 align:middle line:10%
in Shaolin.

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And I had my training here with
Chinese teachers from China,

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:24.260 align:middle line:90%
mainland.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And we basically had
the same training.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.753 align:middle line:90%


00:16:28.753 --> 00:16:29.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It was authentic.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.020 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yeah, it made
me kind of happy to know that

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:35.480 align:middle line:84%
I'd actually been traditionally
trained, as it's called.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:36.420 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:38.670 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: But if we
go back to the energy field

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:42.200 align:middle line:84%
itself, the idea on those
meditations is to produce,

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.640 align:middle line:84%
harness, and be able
to utilize the energy.

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:48.560 align:middle line:84%
So if we take and
we need a model

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.080 align:middle line:90%
about it, a two-year-old baby.

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:55.160 align:middle line:84%
A baby when it's born has about
a 30-40-foot energy field.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.390 align:middle line:90%
Everybody wants to hold them.

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:57.670 align:middle line:84%
Everybody wants to
buy them presents,

00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:59.680 align:middle line:84%
take them places, this,
that, and the other.

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:02.000 align:middle line:90%
I always tell the joke.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.700 align:middle line:84%
Female, when you get to be
21, buy your own clothes,

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:07.910 align:middle line:90%
hug yourself, buy your own food.

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:11.970 align:middle line:84%
Nobody wants to do that anymore
unless you're a charismatic.

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:12.770 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:14.490 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: And a
charismatic has a big energy

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:15.290 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And the people want
to be around that.

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:19.520 align:middle line:90%
They want to be around babies.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.702 align:middle line:90%
They want to hold them.

00:17:20.702 --> 00:17:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And they want to be around
charismatics, because they

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:24.599 align:middle line:90%
have a big energy field.

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, they
want to draw their energy

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:30.770 align:middle line:84%
from that person as opposed
to creating their own.

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:33.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But how often are
charismatics actually drawing

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:36.530 align:middle line:84%
their energy from the people
around that are giving to them

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:37.640 align:middle line:90%
and worshipping them?

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:38.540 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:39.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's
a two-way street.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:40.557 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yeah.

00:17:40.557 --> 00:17:42.980 align:middle line:84%
So now we have energy
flowing this way.

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:46.480 align:middle line:90%
And we teach it flows this way.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.280 align:middle line:84%
So the energy of
a human is innate.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.050 align:middle line:90%
And it enters the body.

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:55.460 align:middle line:10%
It enters the energy
field and in the process

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:59.120 align:middle line:10%
energizes all these activities,
processes, functions,

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.450 align:middle line:10%
and consciousness itself.

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:03.170 align:middle line:90%


00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:07.140 align:middle line:84%
So these types of training
are all over the world,

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:08.390 align:middle line:90%
just not in the United States.

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:13.480 align:middle line:84%
And even here, we get them only
as the fighting aspects of it.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.170 align:middle line:84%
In traditional
Shaolin kung fu, they

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:18.320 align:middle line:84%
call them priests, because
you learn the fighting

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.700 align:middle line:90%
for the first six years.

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:21.590 align:middle line:84%
But then you spend
the next 30 years

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:24.240 align:middle line:84%
learning how to heal people,
learning how to be a doctor.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.760 align:middle line:84%
So that's why sometimes they
use that certain phrase.

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Are they using--

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:31.713 align:middle line:90%
you call it "gigong," qigong?

00:18:31.713 --> 00:18:32.630 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yeah.

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:33.920 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: There's so
many different spellings

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:34.700 align:middle line:90%
and pronunciations.

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:36.690 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: The problem
with gongs is what I call it.

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:37.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You're right.

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:38.848 align:middle line:84%
The problem with gongs,
one of the gongs.

00:18:38.848 --> 00:18:40.610 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER:
Qigong, nigong, gigong.

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:42.870 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I usually say qigong.

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:45.740 align:middle line:84%
But they use this in
particular in tai chi

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:49.130 align:middle line:84%
to help build the field
and harness the energy?

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:50.180 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:51.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Those are
the primary practices,

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:57.110 align:middle line:84%
or is it also mental and
imaging yourself reaching out,

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:58.070 align:middle line:90%
coming back?

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: So
physical movement.

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And then physical
movement, we say,

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:05.600 align:middle line:84%
concentrate in
the United States.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And in Chinese martial arts,
we say physical movement

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:12.320 align:middle line:90%
plus contemplation.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.600 align:middle line:84%
In other words, an
awareness of your movement.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.040 align:middle line:84%
So if we go to football
players, they move.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.900 align:middle line:90%
They're physical.

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:24.680 align:middle line:84%
But their consciousness doesn't
extend into their movements.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.170 align:middle line:84%
Their awareness
doesn't extend into it.

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And I've worked with some
of those athletes and stuff

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.528 align:middle line:90%
to better their capacity.

00:19:34.528 --> 00:19:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I was going
to say, as a result,

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.020 align:middle line:84%
could they have a
contracted field?

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.320 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Oh, yes.

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.528 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They might be
powerful physically and have

00:19:41.528 --> 00:19:44.760 align:middle line:84%
physical energy, but maybe the
field isn't as extended as it

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:45.560 align:middle line:90%
could be?

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:46.727 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Right, yes.

00:19:46.727 --> 00:19:49.550 align:middle line:90%


00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:54.020 align:middle line:84%
Several major college
coaches, and some of them

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.480 align:middle line:90%
I've worked with.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:00.470 align:middle line:84%
But then I've
approached NBA and NFL.

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And I go, you really
need to learn this.

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.060 align:middle line:84%
These are things
that would allow

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:08.835 align:middle line:84%
you to be energized all
throughout the game instead

00:20:08.835 --> 00:20:11.600 align:middle line:84%
of getting tired,
because we learn this

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.340 align:middle line:90%
like going into a tournament.

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:14.870 align:middle line:84%
You would go in
and have a fight.

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:16.290 align:middle line:90%
You would be, normally, tired.

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:17.090 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:18.882 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: And
all we had do was go--

00:20:18.882 --> 00:20:21.670 align:middle line:84%
[BREATHING IN THROUGH NOSE] and
we were instantly re-energized.

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:22.660 align:middle line:90%
Here we go again.

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:25.752 align:middle line:84%
Energizer bunny-- and so that
would be a good technique.

00:20:25.752 --> 00:20:26.710 align:middle line:90%
They should learn this.

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:27.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:28.940 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: And
so of course, over 20,

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:31.210 align:middle line:84%
30 years of me trying
to tell them that.

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And then I think it was the
Seattle Seahawks or somebody,

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:37.130 align:middle line:84%
they go, we need to hire
some karate guy or somebody

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:38.530 align:middle line:90%
to come in here.

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:40.462 align:middle line:84%
This is just in the last
three or four years.

00:20:40.462 --> 00:20:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, well,
yeah, I've been

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.420 align:middle line:84%
trying to tell you
that for 30 years

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:45.253 align:middle line:84%
that you need to get
somebody in here that--

00:20:45.253 --> 00:20:46.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Knows energy.

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:48.933 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yeah, because
that is the defining difference

00:20:48.933 --> 00:20:51.400 align:middle line:84%
between, do you give out
in the third quarter,

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.260 align:middle line:84%
or do you make it all
the way to the end.

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:54.700 align:middle line:90%
Now let's apply it to a human.

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:55.870 align:middle line:90%
Do you give out in your 30s?

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:57.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Versus
a star athlete.

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:58.257 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yeah.

00:20:58.257 --> 00:20:59.830 align:middle line:90%
Or your 40s or 50s?

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:02.020 align:middle line:84%
Where do you start
losing function?

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And the functionality of
the body is through energy.

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Energy either goes there or
it doesn't and if it doesn't

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:10.360 align:middle line:84%
go there, then we would
want to find some way

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:11.920 align:middle line:90%
to re-energize it.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.960 align:middle line:84%
And those are not
necessarily pharmaceuticals.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:15.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:16.718 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:21:16.718 --> 00:21:20.350 align:middle line:84%
So now we're engaged in
the practice of somebody

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:23.890 align:middle line:84%
should practice being
themselves, right?

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:26.260 align:middle line:84%
So I looked at all
this over the years

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:31.750 align:middle line:84%
and decided that, with all
the clients and everything,

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:34.390 align:middle line:84%
if I could give somebody
very simple things

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:37.690 align:middle line:84%
to do that anybody
of any age could do--

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
writing all that down.

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And it comes out as a
book called "War Day."

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:44.180 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I know.

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:46.480 align:middle line:84%
When you told me the name,
I thought, "War Day?"

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.880 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yeah.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.617 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You need
to on that one to us.

00:21:49.617 --> 00:21:51.950 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yeah, I've
gotten some flak about that.

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:56.800 align:middle line:84%
But if you think about it,
from the moment you're born,

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.950 align:middle line:90%
you're basically at war.

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:02.830 align:middle line:84%
You're at war for your
survival for food, comfort,

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:04.610 align:middle line:90%
for all these things.

00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:08.155 align:middle line:84%
And if you're in a benign
environment, that's not true.

00:22:08.155 --> 00:22:10.390 align:middle line:84%
War Day is not true
for somebody that

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:13.420 align:middle line:84%
has life easy, we would
say, meaning that all

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:15.490 align:middle line:90%
their needs are satisfied.

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:16.990 align:middle line:84%
But if you think
about it, every day

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:20.170 align:middle line:84%
you go into the potential
for emotional war.

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:22.690 align:middle line:84%
Your emotions,
you're at war with.

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:24.640 align:middle line:90%
How about it's Monday?

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.470 align:middle line:84%
People automatically
go negative.

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:28.630 align:middle line:90%
How about your relationships?

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:30.700 align:middle line:90%
How about the need for money?

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:32.320 align:middle line:90%
And we use the language.

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:34.330 align:middle line:90%
It's a battle.

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:36.190 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
language of Wall Street,

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:40.290 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the
language of health care--

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:42.790 align:middle line:84%
oh, we need to
battle cancer, right?

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:43.630 align:middle line:90%
The war on cancer.

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:46.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: My portfolio
just took a hit.

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:48.400 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: 347 points.

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.400 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so it's not
just your portfolio,

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.968 align:middle line:90%
because energy is money.

00:22:52.968 --> 00:22:54.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Energy is you.

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:54.810 align:middle line:90%
It's your security.

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:56.040 align:middle line:90%
It's your sense of self.

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:56.560 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:57.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:00.370 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: And so when
we look at all that, it's like,

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:02.110 align:middle line:90%
can I be more energetic.

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:03.430 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is yes.

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:05.080 align:middle line:90%
Can I be more myself?

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:05.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.390 align:middle line:84%
Are there simple
techniques I can

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:10.930 align:middle line:84%
do to get there
that don't involve

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:14.170 align:middle line:84%
adopting a whole new religion
or a whole new philosophy?

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:15.580 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is yes.

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And I know this because
some of my clients.

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:21.760 align:middle line:90%
I will tell one name.

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:22.730 align:middle line:90%
I use first names.

00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:26.950 align:middle line:90%
Helen, 79 years old, came to me.

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:29.440 align:middle line:84%
She's been married
several times,

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:33.190 align:middle line:84%
several children, all
the travails of life.

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:35.830 align:middle line:90%
No energy, not herself.

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:38.810 align:middle line:84%
I gave her one simple
exercise, and she did it.

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:41.590 align:middle line:90%
And she came back 30 days later.

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:43.915 align:middle line:84%
The difference in
her was astounding.

00:23:43.915 --> 00:23:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What
was the exercise?

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:46.443 align:middle line:90%
You can't tease us.

00:23:46.443 --> 00:23:48.610 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: It's a
very simple rolling exercise

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:50.860 align:middle line:84%
to increase the size
of your energy field.

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:52.240 align:middle line:90%
It's very simple.

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:54.970 align:middle line:84%
Anybody can do it if you
can get down on the floor.

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:57.495 align:middle line:84%
If you can't, just don't
fall out of the bed.

00:23:57.495 --> 00:23:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, say you
can get down on the floor.

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:00.580 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:04.930 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Oh, in any yoga
book, it's called log rolls.

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:05.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Log rolls?

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:06.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:08.708 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Put your feet
together, arms by your side,

00:24:08.708 --> 00:24:11.188 align:middle line:84%
and just inhale deep,
exhale, roll, roll, roll.

00:24:11.188 --> 00:24:12.730 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a
progressive exercise.

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:14.150 align:middle line:90%
But I gave it to her.

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And the funny story is, I
said, OK, try this exercise.

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:19.690 align:middle line:90%
And maybe I'm not clear.

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:24.680 align:middle line:84%
But I said, you want
to do 11 minutes of it.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:27.570 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is, you want
to do one minute if you can.

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER:
And over a year,

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:32.377 align:middle line:84%
you might build up to 11
minutes every morning.

00:24:32.377 --> 00:24:34.210 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the exercises
I give in my book.

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:35.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean, do
you roll both ways?

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:36.250 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yeah.

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:37.930 align:middle line:84%
It depends on how
much space you have.

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:38.510 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:39.760 align:middle line:84%
So you have to go
back and forth.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:40.718 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:24:40.718 --> 00:24:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And so you just roll
and breathe with it.

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:44.902 align:middle line:90%
So she comes back 30 days later.

00:24:44.902 --> 00:24:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, say your name,
[AFFECTING A VERY DEEP VOICE]

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.695 align:middle line:90%
Helen.

00:24:48.695 --> 00:24:49.695 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, goodness.

00:24:49.695 --> 00:24:51.430 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: I'm like,
what have you been doing.

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, well,
I've been doing

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:54.040 align:middle line:90%
11 minutes of that exercise.

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:54.910 align:middle line:90%
I go, are you crazy.

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:55.510 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: 11?

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:57.460 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: You're supposed
to do one minute and work

00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:58.270 align:middle line:90%
your way up.

00:24:58.270 --> 00:24:59.660 align:middle line:90%
No, I've been doing 11.

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:01.060 align:middle line:90%
It's been three years.

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:03.920 align:middle line:84%
That woman runs about a 12
to 15-foot energy field.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:04.720 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wow.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: We talk about
people having like 36 volts

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:09.100 align:middle line:90%
of energy along their spine.

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:10.820 align:middle line:90%
She runs about 40 to 100.

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wow.

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:15.070 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: And there is no
way that you would think of her

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:15.950 align:middle line:90%
as 82 years old.

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:17.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: She is a holy roller.

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:21.100 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Right
I should patent that.

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And so she still
continues to do it?

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:25.420 align:middle line:90%
This is her therapy?

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:26.700 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes,
she continues to do it.

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:28.620 align:middle line:84%
She comes and sees
me every few months.

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:31.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, why
do you come see me.

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:33.450 align:middle line:90%
You are yourself.

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:35.190 align:middle line:90%
And you have your own energy.

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:36.898 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, I just
like talking to you.

00:25:36.898 --> 00:25:38.607 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, and
you taught her that.

00:25:38.607 --> 00:25:40.735 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, when
we're little kids, that's

00:25:40.735 --> 00:25:42.360 align:middle line:84%
one of our favorite
things in the world

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:43.880 align:middle line:90%
to do is roll down a hill.

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:44.350 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:44.400 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA:

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: You just
want to roll every chance you

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:47.530 align:middle line:90%
get.

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:50.210 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: I taught at
Kundalini yoga class one time.

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And funny story, I had about
55 people in the class.

00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:55.920 align:middle line:90%
It was jam-packed.

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK,
you put your arms

00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:01.350 align:middle line:84%
by your side, legs together,
inhale deep, and roll.

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:04.020 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there's
geniuses in the class.

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:05.230 align:middle line:90%
And they go, which way.

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:06.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:07.800 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: And I
go, I said, just roll.

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.130 align:middle line:90%
I didn't give you a direction.

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:10.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Just don't
roll into each other.

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:12.260 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: No,
that's what happens.

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:15.540 align:middle line:84%
Then they start rolling and
hit somebody and roll back.

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And it looks like a big
game of bumper cars.

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:18.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Sure it does.

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.558 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: And
after about three minutes,

00:26:20.558 --> 00:26:22.530 align:middle line:90%
they are screaming laughing.

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:24.420 align:middle line:90%
That is joyfulness.

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:26.370 align:middle line:90%
That is energy flow.

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:28.120 align:middle line:84%
They didn't need to
do anything else.

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:29.828 align:middle line:84%
They could have walked
out of class right

00:26:29.828 --> 00:26:31.860 align:middle line:84%
then with a 10,
20-foot energy field.

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And so we don't think
it would be that simple.

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:39.120 align:middle line:84%
We think it has to be energy
drinks or donuts or coffee

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.510 align:middle line:90%
or something else.

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:42.830 align:middle line:84%
But we all have that capacity
to energize ourselves.

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What is it about
that particular function that

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:49.005 align:middle line:84%
so electrifies the
field, the rolling?

00:26:49.005 --> 00:26:50.997 align:middle line:90%


00:26:50.997 --> 00:26:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER:
It's circular motion.

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:53.910 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK, circular motion.

00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:54.868 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:26:54.868 --> 00:26:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And kung fu and
aikido is circular.

00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:58.470 align:middle line:90%
These are martial arts.

00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:59.280 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And you're also exposing many
surface areas of the body.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER:
It is self-massage.

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:05.640 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Self-massage.

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:09.810 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: So what you're
doing is causing the body to be

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:12.300 align:middle line:90%
homogeneous.

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:15.630 align:middle line:84%
At that point, energy
flows through it evenly.

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:19.850 align:middle line:84%
At that point, the
tendency is to be happy,

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:21.090 align:middle line:90%
we would say, right?

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:23.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, it makes
you ecstatic when you roll

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:23.910 align:middle line:90%
as a little kid.

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:25.500 align:middle line:84%
You're just laughing
your little tail off.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:26.417 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yeah.

00:27:26.417 --> 00:27:29.250 align:middle line:84%
So we knew that,
and we lost that.

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:30.430 align:middle line:90%
It's not a secret.

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:31.620 align:middle line:90%
It's just nobody does it.

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:32.910 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:37.000 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: And of course,
that's just one of the little--

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.730 align:middle line:90%
in "War Day," I break it down.

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:39.990 align:middle line:90%
People do battle.

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:41.730 align:middle line:84%
What if you have a
child that's sick?

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:44.665 align:middle line:84%
Or what if you have
a marriage or divorce

00:27:44.665 --> 00:27:45.540 align:middle line:90%
you're going through?

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:47.160 align:middle line:90%
They're both equal, by the way.

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And you think about the need for
shelter and the need for food.

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And these are battles
for some people.

00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, the
less you are yourself,

00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:00.150 align:middle line:90%
the greater that battle is.

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And the point you've
lost yourself,

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:03.900 align:middle line:90%
they become insurmountable.

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.840 align:middle line:84%
There's no you
there to do battle.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:08.340 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I
called it "War Day,"

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:11.190 align:middle line:84%
because it's meant to
address people that

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:14.250 align:middle line:84%
don't have the resources
of going to the gym

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:16.710 align:middle line:84%
or being able to
get out and about

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:21.388 align:middle line:84%
in a way that will allow
them to be healthy.

00:28:21.388 --> 00:28:23.555 align:middle line:84%
So that's idea, it's to
give them five simple things

00:28:23.555 --> 00:28:24.420 align:middle line:90%
that they can do.

00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:26.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I was going to say,
can you give us one more so we

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:28.080 align:middle line:90%
have at least two simple things?

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:31.710 align:middle line:84%
Because people, they love things
they can take away and then

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:33.060 align:middle line:90%
play right away.

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:36.090 align:middle line:84%
Some will pause this video and
start rolling before we even

00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:37.010 align:middle line:90%
get to this part.

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:40.230 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: So they
may not want those visuals,

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:42.500 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:45.577 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Maybe a second
simple exercise like that.

00:28:45.577 --> 00:28:46.410 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: OK.

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:50.940 align:middle line:10%
So in martial arts
training and the way

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:54.150 align:middle line:10%
I train people
when I teach this,

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:57.810 align:middle line:10%
the first one is to be yourself.

00:28:57.810 --> 00:29:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And so even if you
don't know what that is,

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:06.300 align:middle line:84%
it's a starting point of
where you intend to go.

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And then the second
thing is discipline.

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:12.480 align:middle line:84%
So the first exercise I give
is get up at the same time.

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.580 align:middle line:90%
Go to bed at same time.

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:17.790 align:middle line:84%
What you're doing is training
your body over a period of 40

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:21.330 align:middle line:84%
days or so to know what
it means to get up,

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:22.980 align:middle line:84%
to know what it
means to eat, know

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:25.000 align:middle line:84%
what it means to go
through your day,

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.280 align:middle line:84%
and to have a baseline, your
baseline in your own life,

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.980 align:middle line:84%
to see what happens during
the course of your day.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:33.510 align:middle line:90%
And you can take stock.

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:35.670 align:middle line:84%
You can take notes of
your mental condition

00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:37.080 align:middle line:90%
or emotional state.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:39.810 align:middle line:84%
Those are really
M-E, we call it.

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:41.910 align:middle line:90%
Me is important.

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:45.030 align:middle line:84%
Me is where we lose all the
energy, mental thinking,

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:48.100 align:middle line:84%
and emotional, all the
feelings and things.

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:51.900 align:middle line:84%
So if we take those
and we have a baseline,

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:54.010 align:middle line:84%
now we have the basis
to do something,

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:56.950 align:middle line:84%
say, like even rolling or some
of the other little simple

00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:58.230 align:middle line:90%
exercises.

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And we can tell the difference,
because until then, you may not

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:05.010 align:middle line:84%
be able to tell a difference
from the very minor things

00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:06.060 align:middle line:90%
that these things are.

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:07.350 align:middle line:90%
They're that simple.

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:09.450 align:middle line:84%
But once your awareness
includes being

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:13.330 align:middle line:84%
able to know your baseline,
now you have a starting point.

00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:15.917 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the starting
point's always to be you,

00:30:15.917 --> 00:30:16.750 align:middle line:90%
to be what you know.

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:17.590 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:22.280 align:middle line:84%
So if the average
person isn't themselves,

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:25.680 align:middle line:84%
and you have other data
and information filling

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:28.440 align:middle line:84%
that gap, most of it
unconscious, a lot of it

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:33.430 align:middle line:84%
projected through media, through
culture, through education,

00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:35.290 align:middle line:84%
through entertainment,
through all of it,

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:37.387 align:middle line:90%
and now you have basically--

00:30:37.387 --> 00:30:39.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know what you
would call it, like junk DNA.

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:43.410 align:middle line:84%
You've got a junk version
of who you are in there.

00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:47.460 align:middle line:84%
There has to be a process of
also not just strengthening

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:52.500 align:middle line:84%
the self but at the same
time maybe learning to hold

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:56.940 align:middle line:90%
at bay outside influences.

00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:58.230 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Two things.

00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:01.830 align:middle line:84%
A 9-foot energy field is what we
recommend in ayurvedic medicine

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:04.202 align:middle line:90%
or in Chinese medicine.

00:31:04.202 --> 00:31:05.910 align:middle line:84%
At that point, you
have sufficient energy

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:09.300 align:middle line:84%
to function and supply
energy to all the functions

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:11.430 align:middle line:90%
and processes of the body.

00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:13.800 align:middle line:84%
You have a tendency
to not get sick,

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:17.460 align:middle line:84%
a tendency to not
get the flu or colds.

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:19.470 align:middle line:84%
The other aspect of
that is, everybody

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:22.350 align:middle line:90%
wants to talk about diet.

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And diet is strictly, let's
talk about your food intake.

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:29.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's talk about
your mental intake.

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:31.500 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about your
emotional intake.

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:34.800 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
your programming.

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And there's a reason they
call programming on TV

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:41.700 align:middle line:90%
and movies and things like that.

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Let's take your
environmental programming

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:45.990 align:middle line:90%
and environmental inputs.

00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:47.455 align:middle line:90%
What's your diet of it?

00:31:47.455 --> 00:31:49.080 align:middle line:84%
So now we come up
with all these things

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:52.260 align:middle line:84%
about being out in the words
and doing all these things.

00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:58.380 align:middle line:84%
And really, it's so subjective,
and that's the other problem.

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:00.750 align:middle line:84%
Everybody needs to find
what works for them.

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:03.570 align:middle line:84%
There's no simple,
straight answer.

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:05.880 align:middle line:84%
But with some simple
techniques, you

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:09.570 align:middle line:84%
have the ability to find out
those answers better than

00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:11.100 align:middle line:90%
if you didn't do them.

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:13.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, you just
mentioned a walk in the woods,

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:16.440 align:middle line:84%
because nature is
herself, right?

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:18.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, been tampered
with but still herself.

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:21.790 align:middle line:84%
Forget EMF frequencies and
other things passing through it.

00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Do people generally, you find,
by just exposing themselves

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:29.550 align:middle line:84%
to nature on any level, start
coming more back into harmony?

00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:30.670 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:32.295 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about
the rolling exercise

00:32:32.295 --> 00:32:34.530 align:middle line:84%
and increasing
your energy field,

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:38.890 align:middle line:84%
that is a physical exercise
to increase your energy field.

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:41.190 align:middle line:84%
But once you step
off the pavement,

00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:43.560 align:middle line:84%
especially if you
step into deep woods,

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:46.890 align:middle line:84%
you have a natural inclination
to expand your energy field

00:32:46.890 --> 00:32:51.360 align:middle line:84%
as big as you can get it so
that you can have advance

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:54.280 align:middle line:90%
knowledge of what's out there.

00:32:54.280 --> 00:33:01.740 align:middle line:84%
You expand a big bubble, 30
feet's normal, out to 100, 200.

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And if you contemplate it
or meditatively experience

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:08.520 align:middle line:84%
with it, combine
it, then your senses

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:11.040 align:middle line:84%
start being pick up
all kinds of things,

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:15.180 align:middle line:84%
from the animals to, actually,
if it's going to rain.

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:16.980 align:middle line:90%
You're sensitive to all of it.

00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And all that happened just
because you stepped off

00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:19.970 align:middle line:90%
in the woods.

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:21.600 align:middle line:84%
So that's the natural
method to do it.

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:24.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And this is part
of your own heritage, right?

00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:28.560 align:middle line:84%
As your own
Pottawatomie background,

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:32.490 align:middle line:84%
you're very tied
into nature on levels

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:36.300 align:middle line:84%
that your European side of your
heritage may not have been.

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:39.000 align:middle line:90%


00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.970 align:middle line:84%
Give us some glimpses in
the Native American aspect

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:46.290 align:middle line:84%
of your own culture and your
being of how you draw on nature

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:49.050 align:middle line:84%
and expand yourself
through nature?

00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:53.490 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: First of all,
it's done not with intention.

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:57.130 align:middle line:90%
They talk about intentionality.

00:33:57.130 --> 00:33:59.190 align:middle line:84%
I think today, they'd
almost call it abuse.

00:33:59.190 --> 00:34:03.637 align:middle line:84%
At five years old, I would tell
my mother, I'm going hunting.

00:34:03.637 --> 00:34:04.470 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, true.

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:06.270 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: And out the
back door and into the woods I

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:06.390 align:middle line:90%
went.

00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:07.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It was that
way in the suburbs.

00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:10.219 align:middle line:84%
We'd just take off as a
gang and show up for dinner

00:34:10.219 --> 00:34:11.670 align:middle line:90%
at three, four, five.

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:12.587 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yeah.

00:34:12.587 --> 00:34:15.900 align:middle line:84%
So to wander in the woods,
that was my playground.

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:18.100 align:middle line:90%
That was normal.

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there's
some attunement

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:21.780 align:middle line:90%
that comes from that.

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:24.150 align:middle line:84%
You either become comfortable,
or you become fearful

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:25.389 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And of course, if you become
comfortable, then that's home.

00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:29.699 align:middle line:90%
The woods are home.

00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:33.929 align:middle line:90%
I teach that in certain aspects.

00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And of course, out
of that came hunting.

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And hunting is a
relationship, whether it's

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:46.639 align:middle line:84%
hunting for food or housing
or a mate or anything,

00:34:46.639 --> 00:34:48.120 align:middle line:90%
it's relationships.

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:51.449 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily violence,
what I want to get into.

00:34:51.449 --> 00:34:55.170 align:middle line:84%
There's some sustenance
involved in it.

00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:59.100 align:middle line:84%
So then to be out
in nature, we moved

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:03.870 align:middle line:84%
from the woods of Oklahoma,
about nine years old,

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:07.725 align:middle line:84%
out into what would
become Page, Arizona.

00:35:07.725 --> 00:35:08.850 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, yes, uh-huh.

00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:10.600 align:middle line:10%
>> VEITENHEIMER: In
the middle of nowhere.

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:13.237 align:middle line:10%
It was 65 miles or 80
miles to the grocery store.

00:35:13.237 --> 00:35:14.070 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:14.870 align:middle line:10%
Been there.

00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:16.790 align:middle line:10%
>> VEITENHEIMER: And
just like you said,

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:20.453 align:middle line:10%
they took all us kids and
said go away, basically,

00:35:20.453 --> 00:35:21.620 align:middle line:10%
don't hang out in the house.

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:23.210 align:middle line:90%
You'll make mom crazy.

00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And we would come
back at sunset.

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:31.790 align:middle line:84%
So then, again, you become
attuned to your environment.

00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:33.260 align:middle line:90%
And now we're back to that diet.

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:35.460 align:middle line:84%
What kind of environment
do you live in?

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:39.500 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's important that
your house be a comfort to you

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:41.340 align:middle line:90%
as much as possible.

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.640 align:middle line:90%
And we talk about the house.

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:47.430 align:middle line:84%
How about being inside yourself
should be a comfort to you?

00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:48.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Indeed.

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:49.670 align:middle line:90%
So let's go back to that.

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:53.090 align:middle line:84%
So you and your little playmates
would be out running around,

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:54.460 align:middle line:90%
as I was.

00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:57.410 align:middle line:90%
I lived outdoors, basically.

00:35:57.410 --> 00:35:59.997 align:middle line:84%
And you develop a
sense of relationship.

00:35:59.997 --> 00:36:00.830 align:middle line:90%
You have activities.

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:01.730 align:middle line:90%
You have competition.

00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:02.530 align:middle line:90%
You do the things.

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:03.630 align:middle line:90%
You mess around.

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:05.210 align:middle line:90%
You do things kids do.

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:07.970 align:middle line:84%
How do you contrast that
in the sense of self

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:10.760 align:middle line:84%
that was developed in
children at that time

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:15.170 align:middle line:84%
compared to how children
are developing today, mostly

00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:18.680 align:middle line:84%
indoor and an indoor
lifestyle and especially

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:21.710 align:middle line:84%
associated with
lots of technology?

00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:24.060 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: When
you learn from nature--

00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:26.780 align:middle line:84%
this is the Native
American aspect--

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:29.910 align:middle line:84%
it's a knowledge
that doesn't go away.

00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:31.420 align:middle line:90%
It's internalized.

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:34.100 align:middle line:90%


00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:36.530 align:middle line:84%
External knowledge
is kind of like,

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:39.670 align:middle line:84%
tell me the fourth book
you read three years ago.

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:40.470 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:40.850 align:middle line:90%
I read it.

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:42.058 align:middle line:90%
It was important at the time.

00:36:42.058 --> 00:36:43.340 align:middle line:90%
But it's gone.

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:48.320 align:middle line:84%
So that form of
externalized knowledge,

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:51.345 align:middle line:84%
it's not incorporated
into the self.

00:36:51.345 --> 00:36:53.720 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But that's what
our education system is almost

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:56.840 align:middle line:84%
exclusively based
on is external.

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:59.480 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yeah.

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:01.190 align:middle line:90%
I look at all the kids.

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:02.900 align:middle line:84%
They have the screens
and this and that.

00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And of course, everybody
wants to complain

00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:06.450 align:middle line:84%
about the generations
or whatever.

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:10.430 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, we'd
look at it and go, what

00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:13.190 align:middle line:90%
is the purpose of all this.

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:17.150 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like if I look
at my generation and say,

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:22.340 align:middle line:84%
my purpose was to extend
what was known before me.

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:24.272 align:middle line:84%
And then we'd look at
the current generation

00:37:24.272 --> 00:37:26.480 align:middle line:84%
and go, well, with all the
electronics and everything

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:29.480 align:middle line:84%
else, they're obviously
not extending anything,

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:32.870 align:middle line:84%
because the internet,
25 years ago, didn't

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:35.300 align:middle line:90%
exist as far as commercial.

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:39.500 align:middle line:84%
So now we take a look at it
and go, what kind of society

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:41.540 align:middle line:90%
do they need these skills for.

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:43.730 align:middle line:84%
The skills I learned
as a child, I

00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:46.760 align:middle line:84%
was learning because they were
important for that environment

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:49.370 align:middle line:84%
that I grew up in, Native
American environment,

00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:51.890 align:middle line:84%
living in the woods, hunting,
fishing, all the other things,

00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:53.570 align:middle line:90%
living in the woods.

00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:57.520 align:middle line:84%
That's not so important,
except as recreation now.

00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:58.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.278 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: So if
we look at the children,

00:38:00.278 --> 00:38:02.630 align:middle line:84%
rather than find fault with
what's going on, it would be

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:06.890 align:middle line:84%
interesting to note what
skill sets do they have,

00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:08.430 align:middle line:90%
because they all develop them.

00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:13.010 align:middle line:84%
They all have this absolute
electronic integration.

00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'd want to know what,
30 years or 100 years

00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:18.550 align:middle line:90%
from now, that portends.

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:21.380 align:middle line:90%
And of course, we don't know.

00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:22.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, we
don't know yet.

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:27.680 align:middle line:84%
I think, on a concerned level,
or shadow side level of that--

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:29.720 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't matter
what your age is.

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:34.700 align:middle line:84%
The more exposure to
external media of any kind,

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:36.352 align:middle line:90%
the less you is there.

00:38:36.352 --> 00:38:37.310 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:38.610 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:38:38.610 --> 00:38:41.720 align:middle line:90%
That's why most people--

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:45.560 align:middle line:84%
this is a judgment, or more of
an observation, I apologize.

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:48.950 align:middle line:84%
Is that people are not
comfortable being themselves

00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:51.510 align:middle line:84%
and, more importantly,
being with themselves.

00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:55.400 align:middle line:84%
So at that point, they
seek satisfaction or input

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:56.750 align:middle line:90%
is what I call it.

00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And they seek all
that input externally.

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And there appears
to be historical--

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:07.160 align:middle line:84%
some comfort in being
yourself and with yourself.

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And now we have to
be entertained 24/7.

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.760 align:middle line:90%
There has to be externalized--

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:14.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And if you were to
measure the uncalibrated people

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:17.960 align:middle line:84%
from before long ago and their
sense of authenticity of who

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:21.530 align:middle line:84%
they were compared to today, I
would think you'd have vastly

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:22.970 align:middle line:90%
different reflections.

00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: because I
found comfort in being myself.

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:32.000 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to be
Superman or anybody else.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think since there's no
sense of the self present,

00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:41.270 align:middle line:84%
then I want to be
everything but myself.

00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
a current state.

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:47.500 align:middle line:84%
We could calibrate how many
people and everything else.

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, that comes
down to this authenticity

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:55.922 align:middle line:84%
that people talk about of
being the south and stuff.

00:39:55.922 --> 00:39:57.380 align:middle line:84%
But most people
never take the time

00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:02.778 align:middle line:84%
to find that place, in the old
language, to find themselves.

00:40:02.778 --> 00:40:04.070 align:middle line:90%
That's the old hippie language.

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're
not you, and you're

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:08.900 align:middle line:84%
everything that's been
stuffed into your field that's

00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:12.200 align:middle line:84%
accumulated, and that's kind
of pretending to be you,

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:13.670 align:middle line:84%
you end up with
internal conflict.

00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:15.212 align:middle line:84%
And you and I were
talking off camera

00:40:15.212 --> 00:40:16.940 align:middle line:84%
that one of the
biggest issues in terms

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:19.400 align:middle line:84%
of working with
people, your clients,

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:22.700 align:middle line:84%
on health issues and other
issues, emotional issues,

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:26.030 align:middle line:84%
is this internal conflict
of being you're not-self.

00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:27.480 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.240 align:middle line:84%
The reason that's
so important is

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:30.710 align:middle line:84%
like when we talk
about discipline

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:32.190 align:middle line:90%
as the first exercise.

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:34.010 align:middle line:90%
It's an exercise.

00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:36.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give
you a baseline.

00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to come up
with every reason in the book

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:41.720 align:middle line:84%
to not get up at 6:00 AM and
go to bed at 10:30 every night

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:45.110 align:middle line:84%
or 7:00 and 11:00,
whatever numbers they are.

00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:46.430 align:middle line:90%
And that throws people.

00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:48.440 align:middle line:90%
I say, well, pick that time.

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.120 align:middle line:90%
And they go, well, what.

00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:51.800 align:middle line:90%
I go, no, that's you.

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:53.870 align:middle line:84%
You pick a time
you want to get up.

00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:55.290 align:middle line:90%
It's your choice.

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:57.290 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to make
me happy by picking one

00:40:57.290 --> 00:40:58.340 align:middle line:90%
over the other.

00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And then the same
thing going to bed.

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:02.633 align:middle line:84%
What you're doing is saying, I'm
going to set some parameters,

00:41:02.633 --> 00:41:04.820 align:middle line:84%
some metrics where I can
find out about myself.

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And in the process
of that, I'm going

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:10.220 align:middle line:84%
to discover what I need to do
to be able to be healthy and be

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:15.860 align:middle line:84%
myself and to participate in
the world from a positive point.

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:16.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, OK.

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.448 align:middle line:84%
And where would you
progress after you've

00:41:18.448 --> 00:41:20.810 align:middle line:84%
done this experiment
where you're going to bed

00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:23.100 align:middle line:84%
and getting up at
a specific time?

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:26.210 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Knowingness
becomes available.

00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:30.660 align:middle line:84%
You become knowing of
where you need to be

00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:36.320 align:middle line:84%
or what you need to do
without an internal conflict.

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:39.650 align:middle line:84%
You don't do things
because you're supposed to

00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:41.180 align:middle line:90%
or this, that, and the other.

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:44.240 align:middle line:84%
You do them because they
benefit you or benefit others.

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:47.420 align:middle line:84%
The benefit of being the
self becomes apparent.

00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:50.470 align:middle line:90%
It becomes noticeable.

00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:53.510 align:middle line:84%
When you do these
exercises like discipline,

00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:56.048 align:middle line:84%
you start noticing
how much negativity

00:41:56.048 --> 00:41:57.590 align:middle line:84%
you have to getting
up in the morning

00:41:57.590 --> 00:41:59.360 align:middle line:90%
or going to bed at night.

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:03.020 align:middle line:84%
That negativity has to find
expression in the body.

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:04.490 align:middle line:90%
That's what it amounts to.

00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And so over a long
period of time,

00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:10.280 align:middle line:84%
that can become chronic
illness or susceptibility

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:13.580 align:middle line:84%
to different problems
in the world.

00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:15.663 align:middle line:84%
And again, they don't
all have to be health.

00:42:15.663 --> 00:42:16.580 align:middle line:90%
They can be financial.

00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:18.590 align:middle line:90%
They can be mental, emotional.

00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:20.570 align:middle line:84%
They might be
relationship issues.

00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:22.860 align:middle line:84%
So that negativity
finds an expression.

00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:25.450 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'll say.

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:27.440 align:middle line:84%
So when you do
discipline, you're

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:31.010 align:middle line:84%
establishing a way to
observe whether you

00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:33.200 align:middle line:90%
have internal conflicts.

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, through
contemplation and meditation,

00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:38.120 align:middle line:84%
you start being
able to expand out

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:40.430 align:middle line:90%
into your information fields.

00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And you start going, wow, I have
a need to make people happy,

00:42:44.830 --> 00:42:49.430 align:middle line:84%
or I have a need to make people
mad, or I do all these things,

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:51.830 align:middle line:90%
but they're really not me.

00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:52.920 align:middle line:90%
They're things that I do.

00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't even
realize I was doing.

00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you're
becoming an observer.

00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:57.290 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Right.

00:42:57.290 --> 00:43:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And observing the self that way
occurs through contemplation

00:43:00.590 --> 00:43:02.270 align:middle line:90%
and meditation.

00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And now there's
millions of books.

00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:11.750 align:middle line:84%
In today's society, there's
no reason to not be available.

00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:14.330 align:middle line:84%
But 30 or 40 years
ago, you were pretty

00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:19.020 align:middle line:84%
kooky to want to do yoga or
meditation and those things.

00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the progression
we're going through.

00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:23.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So getting into
a little bit more abstract

00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:27.050 align:middle line:84%
conversation on it, talking
about the notion of what I am

00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:31.280 align:middle line:84%
and I am not, you have a
notion of 1 and 0 reality,

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:33.380 align:middle line:84%
because again, we're
talking about data.

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, does that 1 and
0 reality relate to,

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:39.710 align:middle line:84%
say, Hawkins' field
of consciousness?

00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:41.480 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Uh-huh.

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:45.080 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
we're taught in life

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:49.380 align:middle line:90%
is positive and negative.

00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:52.250 align:middle line:84%
If you look at a plug on
a wall, a wall socket,

00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:53.990 align:middle line:90%
it has three prongs.

00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And one of them
is called neutral.

00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:59.060 align:middle line:90%
I think that's very interesting.

00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:01.760 align:middle line:84%
One of them's neutral,
one of them's grounding.

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:04.980 align:middle line:84%
To be grounded, which is one
of the exercises in the book

00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:07.940 align:middle line:90%
"War Day," is important.

00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:10.670 align:middle line:84%
It means you're stable
before you're tipped

00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:13.340 align:middle line:90%
over upset by what goes on.

00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:16.010 align:middle line:84%
But the other one
is to be neutral.

00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:17.960 align:middle line:84%
If you think about
the amount of energy

00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:21.380 align:middle line:90%
you expend being upset about--

00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:25.040 align:middle line:84%
and I won't get into the
politics and the current world

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:26.960 align:middle line:90%
situation, we'll call it.

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:29.300 align:middle line:90%
People expend all this energy.

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:31.172 align:middle line:84%
How much did you
have to start with?

00:44:31.172 --> 00:44:32.630 align:middle line:84%
That's the whole
point of this book

00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:35.120 align:middle line:84%
is to get to that
starting point of having

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:39.680 align:middle line:84%
enough energy for your day and
then getting beyond that, to be

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:43.070 align:middle line:90%
truly rich in your own energy.

00:44:43.070 --> 00:44:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And so if you look at
that to be neutral,

00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:48.080 align:middle line:84%
it would be something
that we'd really like

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:50.290 align:middle line:90%
to be present in our education.

00:44:50.290 --> 00:44:52.040 align:middle line:84%
In other words, what
do you think of this?

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:54.560 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:55.940 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean you don't?

00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:56.900 align:middle line:90%
It's important.

00:44:56.900 --> 00:45:02.120 align:middle line:84%
No, I do not have an
ability to interact with it.

00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:04.760 align:middle line:84%
I use war as an example,
because it's the book.

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:06.260 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
of the war in fill

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:08.322 align:middle line:84%
in the blank, any place
you want to think about?

00:45:08.322 --> 00:45:09.530 align:middle line:90%
Well, I don't think about it.

00:45:09.530 --> 00:45:10.820 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean you
don't think about it?

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:11.690 align:middle line:90%
I don't have any guns.

00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:12.560 align:middle line:90%
I don't have any bullets.

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:13.460 align:middle line:90%
I don't have a money.

00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:15.267 align:middle line:90%
I don't have any transportation.

00:45:15.267 --> 00:45:16.350 align:middle line:90%
I don't know who to shoot.

00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:17.642 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how many to shoot.

00:45:17.642 --> 00:45:19.267 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
would be accomplished

00:45:19.267 --> 00:45:20.180 align:middle line:90%
by shooting somebody.

00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:22.640 align:middle line:84%
So I don't have an
opinion about it.

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And I just made myself crazy
with that whole statement.

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:26.162 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:45:26.162 --> 00:45:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER:
And I lost energy.

00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:30.890 align:middle line:84%
So then we'd go,
neutral is a good thing.

00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:35.130 align:middle line:84%
I should only expend energy in
a positive or negative manner.

00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And discipline is
learning how I'm spending

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:39.870 align:middle line:90%
that energy during the day.

00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:44.090 align:middle line:84%
So 0 and 1 reality
is part of what

00:45:44.090 --> 00:45:47.870 align:middle line:84%
I call proximate realities,
the other book I'm writing.

00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You just said
approximate reality.

00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:51.650 align:middle line:90%
What is proximate reality?

00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:54.320 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: OK, so
proximate reality is another

00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:56.630 align:middle line:84%
book I've been writing
on for quite a while.

00:45:56.630 --> 00:46:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And it has a lot
of implications.

00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:03.870 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things is
we divide the world up.

00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:05.180 align:middle line:90%
I didn't do that.

00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:08.660 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else made
night and day.

00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:11.300 align:middle line:84%
If we take that
as a base duality,

00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:13.370 align:middle line:84%
now we have positive
and negative.

00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:14.990 align:middle line:90%
Remember the neutral?

00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:17.690 align:middle line:84%
We really want to get
neutral back in there,

00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:20.270 align:middle line:84%
because at that point,
I don't hate Mondays,

00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:22.760 align:middle line:84%
and I don't love night or
hate day or vice versa.

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:25.220 align:middle line:90%
I go out of expending energy.

00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:27.590 align:middle line:90%
I retain that energy for myself.

00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:30.220 align:middle line:84%
But number 1 reality
is all the reality

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:32.150 align:middle line:90%
you can use your senses on.

00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:34.730 align:middle line:84%
It's everything you can
touch and everything.

00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:37.310 align:middle line:84%
The 0 reality is a
whole other game.

00:46:37.310 --> 00:46:39.090 align:middle line:90%
It is your imagination.

00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:41.120 align:middle line:84%
It's your daydreams,
your nightmares,

00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:46.340 align:middle line:84%
your out-of-body experiences,
your consciousness

00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:47.780 align:middle line:90%
when it's floating free.

00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:51.980 align:middle line:84%
It's when you're being
an artist or a musician.

00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:54.090 align:middle line:90%
You're not in number 1 reality.

00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:56.780 align:middle line:84%
You're not dealing with
hard, physical objects,

00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:58.070 align:middle line:90%
physical reality.

00:46:58.070 --> 00:47:02.420 align:middle line:84%
You're dealing with something
that has no physical existence.

00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:05.010 align:middle line:84%
We call it non-local
consciousness.

00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And so if you look at
0 and 1, divide it up,

00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:10.670 align:middle line:84%
how much energy do
you expend physically?

00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:13.040 align:middle line:84%
If you're a
carpenter, contractor,

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:15.640 align:middle line:84%
construction worker,
a football player,

00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:17.360 align:middle line:90%
you spend a lot of energy.

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:23.150 align:middle line:84%
But what if you spend twice that
much in nightmares, bad dreams,

00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:24.800 align:middle line:84%
thinking about
your relationships,

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:28.670 align:middle line:84%
or, again, the negative that I
need money or I didn't do this

00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:30.150 align:middle line:90%
or I'm sick?

00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:32.420 align:middle line:84%
There's where all
your energy went.

00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:36.770 align:middle line:84%
So 0 reality is a net
consumer of energy,

00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:38.718 align:middle line:90%
far in excess of physicality.

00:47:38.718 --> 00:47:40.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Of physical reality.

00:47:40.010 --> 00:47:41.210 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: That's it.

00:47:41.210 --> 00:47:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And so we would want to
become observant of it.

00:47:44.930 --> 00:47:47.610 align:middle line:84%
We would want to become
interactive with it.

00:47:47.610 --> 00:47:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And in the show
I'm doing, I talk

00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:52.740 align:middle line:90%
about a lot of aspects of that.

00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:56.610 align:middle line:90%
And they apply on both sides.

00:47:56.610 --> 00:47:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's get to
a really basic one then,

00:47:59.930 --> 00:48:01.903 align:middle line:90%
the word should.

00:48:01.903 --> 00:48:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER:
I hate that word.

00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:04.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: There you go.

00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: If I
used it, I apologize.

00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:06.533 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Most people do.

00:48:06.533 --> 00:48:08.930 align:middle line:90%
So we do, we all use it.

00:48:08.930 --> 00:48:10.160 align:middle line:90%
And we all hate the word.

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And we all hate what that
word implies and feels like.

00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And yet it drives a
lot of our 0 reality.

00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:18.695 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes,
because the implication is

00:48:18.695 --> 00:48:19.495 align:middle line:90%
there's a payoff.

00:48:19.495 --> 00:48:23.300 align:middle line:90%


00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:26.060 align:middle line:90%
We are goal-oriented.

00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And that is one of
the processes that

00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:32.390 align:middle line:84%
occurs as you advance
your consciousness is

00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:38.540 align:middle line:84%
that you're not so interested
in the payoff anymore.

00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:41.900 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Hawkins talks
about a lot of people

00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:44.960 align:middle line:84%
in negative
emotional states have

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:49.970 align:middle line:84%
those states to gain
energy from somebody else.

00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:51.050 align:middle line:90%
And we call it juice.

00:48:51.050 --> 00:48:52.280 align:middle line:90%
We call them vampires.

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:54.780 align:middle line:90%
We all know these people.

00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And then the answer
is, as an observer,

00:48:58.130 --> 00:49:00.200 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to be that way.

00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And if I catch myself doing
it, well, the only way

00:49:03.410 --> 00:49:05.480 align:middle line:84%
to catch yourself
is to get to a point

00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:09.610 align:middle line:84%
of being yourself sufficient
to be able to catch yourself.

00:49:09.610 --> 00:49:11.060 align:middle line:90%
Now we're back to that again.

00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:14.690 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But you're still down
to the basic mechanics of life.

00:49:14.690 --> 00:49:15.533 align:middle line:90%
This has to be done.

00:49:15.533 --> 00:49:16.700 align:middle line:90%
I have to get there on time.

00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:18.080 align:middle line:90%
Got to drop the kids off.

00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:20.152 align:middle line:90%
Got to go to the grocery store.

00:49:20.152 --> 00:49:21.110 align:middle line:90%
I think I'll make this.

00:49:21.110 --> 00:49:23.300 align:middle line:84%
I'll try to get a jump on it,
because we have to be somewhere

00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:24.380 align:middle line:90%
right after dinner.

00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:25.400 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:27.150 align:middle line:90%
That's your should list.

00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:28.430 align:middle line:90%
But look what that does.

00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:31.793 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: And should
and have to are the same.

00:49:31.793 --> 00:49:32.960 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They're the same.

00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:36.020 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Because they
represent a negative stance

00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:37.350 align:middle line:90%
in relation to it.

00:49:37.350 --> 00:49:38.150 align:middle line:90%
I love my daughter.

00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.840 align:middle line:90%
She called one day.

00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:40.215 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I go,
what are doing.

00:49:40.215 --> 00:49:42.172 align:middle line:90%
She goes, I have to go to work.

00:49:42.172 --> 00:49:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And I go, no, you
don't, starve to death.

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:46.430 align:middle line:90%


00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:47.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: There you go.

00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:47.870 align:middle line:90%
Look at it.

00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:49.770 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: And
then I go, what's this.

00:49:49.770 --> 00:49:51.340 align:middle line:90%
I love to eat.

00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:52.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to work.

00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:54.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get me
a pizza afterwards.

00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:55.340 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:57.680 align:middle line:90%
Now we have joyfulness now.

00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:00.770 align:middle line:90%


00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:04.220 align:middle line:84%
Where did it become to
complain about work?

00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:05.490 align:middle line:90%
It's not about the work.

00:50:05.490 --> 00:50:06.950 align:middle line:84%
It's the benefit
you get out of it

00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:10.790 align:middle line:84%
So once you start looking
at the benefit, which

00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:14.420 align:middle line:90%
can be positive or negative--

00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:16.090 align:middle line:84%
one of the sad
things is people that

00:50:16.090 --> 00:50:18.250 align:middle line:90%
work to a negative benefit.

00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
that's very sad.

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:23.270 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: And so it's
very normal in our society,

00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:24.800 align:middle line:90%
but it's not healthy.

00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the things you find

00:50:26.770 --> 00:50:28.600 align:middle line:84%
with a whole lot
of activity that we

00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:30.830 align:middle line:90%
pursue every day in our lives.

00:50:30.830 --> 00:50:31.760 align:middle line:90%
It may be normal.

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:32.730 align:middle line:90%
You may be normal.

00:50:32.730 --> 00:50:36.080 align:middle line:84%
You may be acting
in the correct way.

00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:38.170 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't mean
you're energized.

00:50:38.170 --> 00:50:40.960 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean you're fulfilled
or happy at the end of the day.

00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:41.630 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:43.755 align:middle line:84%
And that's where they have
tos and shoulds come in,

00:50:43.755 --> 00:50:45.495 align:middle line:84%
because these are a
matter of perception.

00:50:45.495 --> 00:50:46.870 align:middle line:84%
There are things
that we actually

00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:51.520 align:middle line:84%
do need to do in order to
make enough money to put food

00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:53.680 align:middle line:84%
on the table, have a
roof over our head,

00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:56.110 align:middle line:84%
or have a relationship
that's functional.

00:50:56.110 --> 00:50:58.660 align:middle line:84%
There are things that
need to be covered.

00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:01.780 align:middle line:90%


00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:04.840 align:middle line:84%
The vast majority of
people tend to language it

00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:08.350 align:middle line:84%
as a burden and
obligation, all of it.

00:51:08.350 --> 00:51:11.650 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: And that is the
reason I called it "War Day,"

00:51:11.650 --> 00:51:16.410 align:middle line:84%
because more people would
recognize what they go through

00:51:16.410 --> 00:51:20.050 align:middle line:84%
as some kind of battle
on a daily basis.

00:51:20.050 --> 00:51:22.462 align:middle line:84%
If I called it
"Fun Day," I don't

00:51:22.462 --> 00:51:23.920 align:middle line:84%
think there's that
many people that

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:26.440 align:middle line:84%
would look at it like,
oh, my god, it's Monday,

00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:29.015 align:middle line:84%
and I get to go to work and
have it out with everybody.

00:51:29.015 --> 00:51:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So is this
part of the book,

00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:34.960 align:middle line:84%
where you talk about reframing
your perspective about what

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:37.420 align:middle line:84%
a day represents,
activities represent?

00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:39.610 align:middle line:84%
Even if they're
mandatory activities,

00:51:39.610 --> 00:51:41.318 align:middle line:84%
they don't have to be
a drag or a burden.

00:51:41.318 --> 00:51:43.777 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Well, you
don't have to approach them from

00:51:43.777 --> 00:51:45.010 align:middle line:90%
standpoint of a battle.

00:51:45.010 --> 00:51:47.680 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to approach them
from a should or I have to,

00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:49.120 align:middle line:90%
even.

00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:51.470 align:middle line:84%
Everything and all
life is an opportunity.

00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:52.270 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:51:52.270 --> 00:51:55.960 align:middle line:90%


00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:59.170 align:middle line:90%
Hawkins teaches 540 joyfulness.

00:51:59.170 --> 00:52:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And we look at conscious
evolution as something

00:52:02.530 --> 00:52:05.080 align:middle line:84%
you attain to or work
your way towards.

00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And what I teach people is,
why don't you just start there.

00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:11.500 align:middle line:84%
Every day, you start
out and go, I'm joyful.

00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
the whole world is

00:52:13.690 --> 00:52:16.827 align:middle line:84%
going to maybe make
that a hard position.

00:52:16.827 --> 00:52:18.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They'll challenge it.

00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:19.035 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:52:19.035 --> 00:52:21.760 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of the day,
think how much more ahead

00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:24.970 align:middle line:84%
you are, because
maybe you didn't

00:52:24.970 --> 00:52:28.780 align:middle line:84%
go so far all the way down
to guilt and shame and apathy

00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:31.300 align:middle line:84%
and anger and all these
negative emotions.

00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:34.747 align:middle line:84%
And so the next day, you
start with joyfulness again.

00:52:34.747 --> 00:52:35.830 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It makes sense.

00:52:35.830 --> 00:52:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And then when you hear people,
say, at the office or whatever,

00:52:39.010 --> 00:52:43.270 align:middle line:84%
engaging in a debate,
for example, about maybe

00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:45.983 align:middle line:84%
a political situation
that's occurring,

00:52:45.983 --> 00:52:48.400 align:middle line:84%
you start to learn to be more
discerning about whether you

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:51.820 align:middle line:84%
want to hop in on it and
use your energy that way,

00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:54.725 align:middle line:84%
because these little things
steal energy all day long.

00:52:54.725 --> 00:52:55.600 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And that becomes
the non-conscious

00:52:58.300 --> 00:53:00.790 align:middle line:90%
and the unconscious.

00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:04.960 align:middle line:84%
Freud, in some ways, did a
service and a disservice.

00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:07.630 align:middle line:10%
He broke conscious down in
conscious, subconscious,

00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:09.190 align:middle line:10%
unconscious.

00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:11.080 align:middle line:10%
To me, conscious is homogeneous.

00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:13.390 align:middle line:84%
It's extensive throughout
the body and the brain

00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:15.010 align:middle line:90%
and the mind and all that.

00:53:15.010 --> 00:53:17.440 align:middle line:84%
But one thing he
left out is energy.

00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:19.160 align:middle line:84%
I can have all kinds
of consciousness.

00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:22.370 align:middle line:84%
I can have all kinds of idea
of doing well in the universe.

00:53:22.370 --> 00:53:24.430 align:middle line:84%
But if I don't have
the energy for it--

00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the base level
I attacked in "War Day,"

00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:32.290 align:middle line:84%
is I want to generate and want
you to generate enough energy

00:53:32.290 --> 00:53:34.870 align:middle line:84%
that, no matter what
you go through the day,

00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:38.860 align:middle line:84%
at the end of it, you can come
up and go, I'm still standing.

00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:40.990 align:middle line:90%
I still have energy for myself.

00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:42.235 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Incredibly useful.

00:53:42.235 --> 00:53:43.110 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:45.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, now let's talk
about some other simple things

00:53:45.610 --> 00:53:47.260 align:middle line:84%
we can do besides
being in nature,

00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:51.190 align:middle line:84%
going for a walk in
nature, moving to nature.

00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:53.000 align:middle line:90%
What about qigong, tai chi?

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.320 align:middle line:84%
What is their place in
energizing the field?

00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: If you take
what I call what's available

00:53:59.050 --> 00:54:01.500 align:middle line:90%
to you--

00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:04.960 align:middle line:90%
I love diet books, not true.

00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:07.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Testing
on that, not true.

00:54:07.890 --> 00:54:10.490 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Your field goes
weak if you even think about

00:54:10.490 --> 00:54:11.290 align:middle line:90%
diet.

00:54:11.290 --> 00:54:14.920 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at it,
walking is something.

00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:17.410 align:middle line:84%
Like in ayurvedic medicine
and Kundalini yoga,

00:54:17.410 --> 00:54:19.690 align:middle line:90%
we say walk 3 miles a day.

00:54:19.690 --> 00:54:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And I can make a judgment that
children don't do that anymore

00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:26.080 align:middle line:90%
at school.

00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:27.747 align:middle line:84%
The parents drop them
off, pick them up.

00:54:27.747 --> 00:54:29.980 align:middle line:84%
If they've got to walk,
like, 20 feet to the car,

00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:33.130 align:middle line:90%
it's a long distance.

00:54:33.130 --> 00:54:35.650 align:middle line:84%
But walking is
available to everybody.

00:54:35.650 --> 00:54:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And the thing about
walking, people go,

00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:39.670 align:middle line:84%
oh, well, it's physical
exercise for you weight.

00:54:39.670 --> 00:54:44.080 align:middle line:84%
No, it is a subconscious
exercise to clear the mind,

00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:47.140 align:middle line:84%
because over the course of
about 45 minutes of walking,

00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:50.150 align:middle line:84%
your subconscious will
come back into balance.

00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And if you come home and
sit down in front of TV

00:54:53.290 --> 00:54:55.705 align:middle line:84%
and three hours of
TV, your subconscious

00:54:55.705 --> 00:54:58.690 align:middle line:84%
has still not attained
its new balance point.

00:54:58.690 --> 00:55:01.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I find that
very true with walking.

00:55:01.210 --> 00:55:03.460 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: So walking
is available to everybody.

00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:05.507 align:middle line:90%
If you can't walk, roll.

00:55:05.507 --> 00:55:07.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, so you
want to walk and roll.

00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:08.350 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yeah.

00:55:08.350 --> 00:55:10.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, now
let's go further,

00:55:10.210 --> 00:55:12.370 align:middle line:84%
because YouTube makes
almost everything available

00:55:12.370 --> 00:55:13.480 align:middle line:90%
to everybody.

00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:16.550 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: And for
the first time in history.

00:55:16.550 --> 00:55:19.430 align:middle line:84%
When I first heard about
Kundalini yoga, my kung fu

00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:25.820 align:middle line:84%
teacher in 1969,
grandmaster George Ing goes,

00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:28.372 align:middle line:84%
well, you go to LA, study
with grandmaster R.D. Wong.

00:55:28.372 --> 00:55:29.330 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you a letter.

00:55:29.330 --> 00:55:31.310 align:middle line:84%
I had to have all
that back then.

00:55:31.310 --> 00:55:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And the second thing, he
said, study Kundalini yoga.

00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:38.210 align:middle line:90%
In 1969, it wasn't available.

00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:39.375 align:middle line:90%
So I went to the library.

00:55:39.375 --> 00:55:40.770 align:middle line:90%
There wasn't no internet.

00:55:40.770 --> 00:55:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And I found out that there
was this thing called

00:55:42.770 --> 00:55:43.610 align:middle line:90%
Kundalini yoga.

00:55:43.610 --> 00:55:47.180 align:middle line:90%
And it was taught in India.

00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:51.170 align:middle line:84%
But I moved to LA and
coincided with studying

00:55:51.170 --> 00:55:56.228 align:middle line:84%
kung fu with master
R.D. Wong, Yogi Bhajian

00:55:56.228 --> 00:55:57.770 align:middle line:84%
came to the United
States and started

00:55:57.770 --> 00:55:59.700 align:middle line:90%
teaching Kundalini yoga.

00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And so I walked in the
door and said, sign me up.

00:56:02.810 --> 00:56:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And they go, do you
want to know about it.

00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:05.990 align:middle line:90%
And I go, no.

00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:08.130 align:middle line:84%
My kung fu teacher
told me to study it.

00:56:08.130 --> 00:56:09.720 align:middle line:90%
So I'm here to study it.

00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:13.660 align:middle line:84%
So I wasn't a devotee, but
I was definitely a student.

00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things about
martial arts and Kundalini yoga

00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:20.330 align:middle line:84%
and everything, do what
your teacher tells you.

00:56:20.330 --> 00:56:22.700 align:middle line:90%
So I would do the exercises.

00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And I can truthfully
say it is probably

00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:28.400 align:middle line:84%
the most progressive way to
alter your physical and mental

00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:30.140 align:middle line:90%
form that's ever existed.

00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:31.250 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That is true.

00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny on
just a personal note.

00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:35.300 align:middle line:90%
And I know this isn't normal.

00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:40.040 align:middle line:84%
But my beings, my soul
group told me years ago,

00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:40.880 align:middle line:90%
do Hatha yoga.

00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:42.400 align:middle line:90%
This is wonderful.

00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:43.880 align:middle line:90%
Never do Kundalini yoga.

00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:45.700 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, why, I wonder.

00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:46.500 align:middle line:90%
I didn't ask why.

00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:47.810 align:middle line:90%
I just said, all right.

00:56:47.810 --> 00:56:51.440 align:middle line:84%
So I end up in a Kundalini yoga
class years later accidentally.

00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:53.570 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that's
what I was in.

00:56:53.570 --> 00:56:56.210 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the class,
I was out of my body

00:56:56.210 --> 00:56:58.773 align:middle line:84%
so solidly I couldn't
find my way back in.

00:56:58.773 --> 00:57:00.440 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't write a
check, find my shoes.

00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:01.310 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: How
long did it take you?

00:57:01.310 --> 00:57:02.370 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: A long time.

00:57:02.370 --> 00:57:04.200 align:middle line:84%
I was the last
one sitting there.

00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And I just couldn't find
anything, because I felt myself

00:57:07.730 --> 00:57:10.170 align:middle line:90%
sitting next to myself.

00:57:10.170 --> 00:57:12.027 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER:
Let me explain that.

00:57:12.027 --> 00:57:13.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We only have
a minute or so left.

00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:14.660 align:middle line:90%
Do tell me.

00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:17.240 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: I've taught
Kundalini yoga for 40 years.

00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:22.670 align:middle line:84%
The first time, it took 2 and
1/2 hours for me to come back,

00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:26.030 align:middle line:84%
without relating the
whole experience.

00:57:26.030 --> 00:57:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And the thing about when
we teach Kundalini yoga

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:32.430 align:middle line:84%
and when we teach Tantra
yoga and things like that,

00:57:32.430 --> 00:57:34.310 align:middle line:84%
one of the things
that we do now,

00:57:34.310 --> 00:57:36.830 align:middle line:84%
and back then we didn't,
and that was tell somebody,

00:57:36.830 --> 00:57:41.070 align:middle line:84%
if you start this, you will
not be the same person.

00:57:41.070 --> 00:57:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And I would say the same
thing about "War Day."

00:57:43.070 --> 00:57:46.130 align:middle line:84%
If you start this book, if
you practice what's in it,

00:57:46.130 --> 00:57:48.770 align:middle line:84%
you will not be the
same person, because you

00:57:48.770 --> 00:57:52.490 align:middle line:84%
will lose all the negativity,
all the attractions,

00:57:52.490 --> 00:57:55.610 align:middle line:84%
all the interactions that
keep you from being yourself.

00:57:55.610 --> 00:57:57.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's a
good advertisement.

00:57:57.240 --> 00:58:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And if it keeps its promise,
then it's a very valuable book.

00:58:01.310 --> 00:58:03.860 align:middle line:10%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Every
day, every new client,

00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:06.440 align:middle line:10%
I'm giving do this and
this and this and this,

00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:09.050 align:middle line:10%
because I want you to be
able to help yourself.

00:58:09.050 --> 00:58:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I think
that's excellent.

00:58:10.550 --> 00:58:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like
it's, like you say,

00:58:12.170 --> 00:58:14.195 align:middle line:84%
something that
everybody can access.

00:58:14.195 --> 00:58:16.070 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to spend
a lot of money, other

00:58:16.070 --> 00:58:17.420 align:middle line:90%
than the price of a book.

00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:20.780 align:middle line:84%
It's all within our power
to regain a sense of self

00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:22.820 align:middle line:84%
and then pump our
field back out where

00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:24.380 align:middle line:90%
it should be to sustain us.

00:58:24.380 --> 00:58:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes, because
you're a joy to the universe.

00:58:27.830 --> 00:58:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And then you can
actually start having that

00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:32.330 align:middle line:84%
lovely vertical
integration of truth.

00:58:32.330 --> 00:58:33.247 align:middle line:90%
>> VEITENHEIMER: Yes.

00:58:33.247 --> 00:58:34.580 align:middle line:90%

00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:35.820 align:middle line:90%
Well, Randy, thank you.

It's been a pleasure
being with you.
