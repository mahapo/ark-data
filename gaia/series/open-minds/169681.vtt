00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:31.031 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: The info
war rages on as to whether UFO

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:33.951 align:middle line:10%
sightings are a matter of
extraterrestrial or military

00:00:33.951 --> 00:00:34.952 align:middle line:10%
presence.

00:00:34.952 --> 00:00:37.621 align:middle line:10%
David Hatcher Childress has
jumped into the conversation

00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:40.457 align:middle line:10%
with his new book, "The
Anti-gravity Files," which

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:42.626 align:middle line:10%
details intriguing
information about many

00:00:42.626 --> 00:00:44.878 align:middle line:10%
of the exotic
technology patents that

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:47.297 align:middle line:10%
have been filed over
the past 60 years

00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:49.758 align:middle line:10%
and the implications
of them being granted.

00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:51.510 align:middle line:84%
Has the military
industrial complex

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.804 align:middle line:84%
mastered anti-gravity
propulsion,

00:00:53.804 --> 00:00:57.641 align:middle line:84%
normally credited to ET
craft, or are both true?

00:00:57.641 --> 00:00:58.809 align:middle line:10%
David, welcome to the show.

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:00.978 align:middle line:10%
I think many people here
are familiar with your face

00:01:00.978 --> 00:01:03.146 align:middle line:10%
from "Ancient
Aliens" and a passion

00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:06.900 align:middle line:10%
for this particular topic, so
it's good that you're here.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.568 align:middle line:10%
The book is a real--

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:11.113 align:middle line:10%
I found it very interesting,
because you're kind of looking

00:01:11.113 --> 00:01:14.783 align:middle line:10%
at the chronology of what all
these different brilliant minds

00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:16.994 align:middle line:10%
on the planet--
terrestrial minds--

00:01:16.994 --> 00:01:17.786 align:middle line:10%
have come up with.

00:01:17.786 --> 00:01:21.707 align:middle line:84%
And some of it is
almost massively

00:01:21.707 --> 00:01:23.959 align:middle line:84%
overwhelming in its
technicality in terms

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:25.002 align:middle line:90%
of what they applied for.

00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:27.462 align:middle line:84%
I don't even understand
half the physics of it.

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:29.381 align:middle line:84%
And some of it's
just really fun when

00:01:29.381 --> 00:01:31.008 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at
the ideas people

00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:32.926 align:middle line:84%
had about these
little private craft

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:36.221 align:middle line:84%
kind of propelling us through
space as individuals--

00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:39.308 align:middle line:90%
a little cart almost in space.

00:01:39.308 --> 00:01:41.935 align:middle line:84%
So tell us what propelled
you down this path

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:43.562 align:middle line:90%
of exploring propulsion?

00:01:43.562 --> 00:01:45.521 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID CHILDRESS: I've
always been interested

00:01:45.521 --> 00:01:47.816 align:middle line:90%
in the unexplained and UFOs.

00:01:47.816 --> 00:01:49.693 align:middle line:90%
As a kid, I read--

00:01:49.693 --> 00:01:51.527 align:middle line:84%
in the late '60s
and early '70s--

00:01:51.527 --> 00:01:55.073 align:middle line:84%
lots of UFO books
and paranormal things

00:01:55.073 --> 00:01:58.118 align:middle line:84%
and ESP and
reincarnation, everything

00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:00.162 align:middle line:90%
from Atlantis to Bigfoot.

00:02:00.162 --> 00:02:03.165 align:middle line:84%
I was always very much
interested in those things.

00:02:03.165 --> 00:02:04.082 align:middle line:90%
And world travel--

00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:10.255 align:middle line:84%
I've always loved history,
too, Tesla and Einstein,

00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:14.384 align:middle line:84%
and ancient technology, too,
going to the Great Pyramid

00:02:14.384 --> 00:02:15.886 align:middle line:90%
and obelisks.

00:02:15.886 --> 00:02:19.765 align:middle line:84%
I'm the author of over 20
books, and some of my books

00:02:19.765 --> 00:02:22.809 align:middle line:84%
are about ancient
Hindu aircraft--

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:23.602 align:middle line:90%
Vimanas.

00:02:23.602 --> 00:02:24.436 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:02:24.436 --> 00:02:25.603 align:middle line:90%
I remember that, yeah.

00:02:25.603 --> 00:02:28.648 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS: So I'm a
believer in ancient technology,

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:32.069 align:middle line:84%
in advanced ancient
civilizations.

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.862 align:middle line:84%
I believe there are
structures on the moon.

00:02:33.862 --> 00:02:36.990 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that there's
extraterrestrial life out there

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.658 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:41.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm not so sure that all of
the UFOs that we're seeing

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.454 align:middle line:90%
are extraterrestrials.

00:02:43.454 --> 00:02:46.541 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I think many of
them are terrestrial craft.

00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:48.877 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's the
conversation we're going to be

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:51.755 align:middle line:90%
getting into in detailing, yeah.

00:02:51.755 --> 00:02:54.674 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS: I mean, even some
terrestrial craft I think are

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:56.093 align:middle line:90%
ancient craft.

00:02:56.093 --> 00:03:01.264 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that there have
been societies on planet Earth

00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:06.103 align:middle line:84%
who built the Great Pyramid
and all these megaliths,

00:03:06.103 --> 00:03:09.189 align:middle line:84%
lifting 1,000-pound
blocks of stone,

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:12.859 align:middle line:84%
and that they had to have
also some kind of anti-gravity

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:16.029 align:middle line:90%
or levitation to do that.

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:20.158 align:middle line:84%
The whole subject has
fascinated me for a long time.

00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:22.744 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until
really the mid-80s

00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:25.579 align:middle line:84%
when I returned from
traveling all over the world

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:31.837 align:middle line:84%
and living in India, and
Africa, and the Far East

00:03:31.837 --> 00:03:36.299 align:middle line:84%
that I went to the Midwest and
to sort of a new age community

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.091 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:41.054 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I really found
out a lot of stuff about Tesla.

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:45.225 align:middle line:84%
And though I was a good
student and somebody who

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:47.436 align:middle line:84%
was interested in
science and whatnot,

00:03:47.436 --> 00:03:50.188 align:middle line:90%
I knew very little about Tesla.

00:03:50.188 --> 00:03:52.941 align:middle line:84%
And what I realized
later as I began

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:58.488 align:middle line:84%
to study him and anti-gravity
and a lot of this super-science

00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:04.494 align:middle line:84%
was that Tesla was not only
the most incredible genius who

00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:10.083 align:middle line:84%
electrified the world today
with his AC inventions,

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:14.129 align:middle line:84%
but that he also invented
anti-gravity type devices,

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.755 align:middle line:84%
although he never gave
us any patents for it.

00:04:16.755 --> 00:04:22.095 align:middle line:84%
And he ultimately became
a suppressed person,

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:24.890 align:middle line:84%
to the point where people are
going to go to high school

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.683 align:middle line:84%
and college, and
they're going to learn

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:29.978 align:middle line:84%
that Otis invented the
elevator and Edison invented

00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:30.979 align:middle line:90%
the photograph.

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:33.106 align:middle line:84%
But you're not going to
learn much about Tesla,

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:35.442 align:middle line:84%
because they don't want
you to know much about him.

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:37.611 align:middle line:90%
That's what I believe.

00:04:37.611 --> 00:04:39.362 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:43.116 align:middle line:84%
He was a dangerous mind in a
time when it wasn't desirable.

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:46.203 align:middle line:84%
And to this day, I
think it's interesting

00:04:46.203 --> 00:04:47.871 align:middle line:84%
that he has been
vindicated, mostly

00:04:47.871 --> 00:04:50.081 align:middle line:84%
through the work of everybody
else that points to him

00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:51.582 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, if
he hadn't done it,

00:04:51.582 --> 00:04:52.918 align:middle line:90%
we wouldn't be able to do it.

00:04:52.918 --> 00:04:57.380 align:middle line:84%
So kind of in a backwards sense,
he has finally earned the place

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.382 align:middle line:90%
that he deserved in history.

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:00.383 align:middle line:90%
So I understand.

00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:02.427 align:middle line:84%
So going through all
of this and then,

00:05:02.427 --> 00:05:05.639 align:middle line:84%
again, your participation
on the very wildly popular

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:06.598 align:middle line:90%
show "Ancient Aliens"--

00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:08.892 align:middle line:84%
I think that's one of the
network's most popular shows,

00:05:08.892 --> 00:05:09.893 align:middle line:90%
if not the most, right?

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:11.311 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS: For
History Channel?

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:12.229 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:14.397 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS: It's not their
most popular in the US.

00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:15.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Really?

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.234 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS: Yeah,
actually, the "Pawn Stars"

00:05:17.234 --> 00:05:18.902 align:middle line:84%
show about the pawn
shop in Las Vegas.

00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:20.028 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Well, of course.

00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:20.737 align:middle line:90%
It's America.

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:22.072 align:middle line:90%
>> CHILDRESS: Yeah, it was more.

00:05:22.072 --> 00:05:25.867 align:middle line:84%
And also their Oak Island
show actually outrates

00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:26.743 align:middle line:90%
"Ancient Aliens."

00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:29.329 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's an
international show.

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:31.706 align:middle line:84%
"Ancient Aliens" is
perhaps their most popular.

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:33.291 align:middle line:84%
It's widely popular
in Latin America

00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:35.377 align:middle line:90%
and in Asia and in Europe.

00:05:35.377 --> 00:05:36.711 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, I believe that.

00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:40.048 align:middle line:90%
It's very well-produced, too.

00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:42.175 align:middle line:84%
Tell me, because you're
so intimately involved

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:44.594 align:middle line:90%
with the show, right?

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:47.847 align:middle line:84%
What is the larger, if
you want to call it,

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:50.558 align:middle line:84%
message or agenda the
network or that show

00:05:50.558 --> 00:05:52.477 align:middle line:84%
is trying to put forward,
whether it's about--

00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:53.812 align:middle line:84%
because it's not all
about ancient aliens--

00:05:53.812 --> 00:05:55.897 align:middle line:84%
night templars, Magdalene,
all kinds of stuff now.

00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:58.650 align:middle line:84%
It's just kind of
alternative everything.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.777 align:middle line:84%
What is the position
of that show, just

00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:04.197 align:middle line:84%
for people who are your fans
on that network as well?

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:09.119 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS: "Ancient Aliens"
really came from the movie

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:11.663 align:middle line:84%
"Indiana Jones and
the Crystal Skull."

00:06:11.663 --> 00:06:15.375 align:middle line:84%
That is really the origin of
the "Ancient Aliens" show.

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:20.088 align:middle line:84%
When that movie was coming
out, History went to Prometheus

00:06:20.088 --> 00:06:23.550 align:middle line:84%
and asked them for a
documentary about crystal skulls

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.886 align:middle line:84%
to go along with the
Indiana Jones film.

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And I was in that documentary,
and so was Giorgio Tsoukalos.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.645 align:middle line:84%
That documentary did very
well for History Channel.

00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:37.939 align:middle line:84%
And then the History Channel
came back to Prometheus

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:40.317 align:middle line:84%
and said, yeah, we
want more of this.

00:06:40.317 --> 00:06:43.570 align:middle line:10%
And at that point, Kevin
Burns of Prometheus

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.781 align:middle line:10%
then said, well, why don't
we do something that's

00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:49.284 align:middle line:10%
a spin-off of the Erich
von Daniken "Chariots

00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:53.288 align:middle line:10%
of the Gods" book, which
was so popular in the '70s.

00:06:53.288 --> 00:06:57.792 align:middle line:84%
And I read that book, too, and
I became a very popular reader

00:06:57.792 --> 00:06:59.628 align:middle line:90%
of Erich's books.

00:06:59.628 --> 00:07:01.171 align:middle line:90%
And I met him a couple of times.

00:07:01.171 --> 00:07:02.922 align:middle line:90%
I like Erich von Daniken.

00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:07.052 align:middle line:84%
I don't agree with all of
his theories and ideas,

00:07:07.052 --> 00:07:09.888 align:middle line:84%
but that was definitely
the direction of the show.

00:07:09.888 --> 00:07:12.432 align:middle line:10%
Giorgio Tsoukalos,
who's a great guy,

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:14.601 align:middle line:10%
and I've known
Giorgio for many years

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:17.145 align:middle line:10%
and from before
"Ancient Aliens."

00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:20.065 align:middle line:90%
And he grew up in Switzerland.

00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:22.692 align:middle line:84%
His father was a
Greek doctor who

00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:24.444 align:middle line:90%
had immigrated to Switzerland.

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:26.571 align:middle line:84%
And so Giorgio as
a young man also

00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:31.660 align:middle line:84%
got involved with Erich von
Daniken's sort of group,

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.120 align:middle line:84%
which is based in
Interlaken, Switzerland.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:39.584 align:middle line:84%
And in Switzerland and
Germany, Erich von Daniken

00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:42.295 align:middle line:84%
is still very popular
and well-known.

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:45.715 align:middle line:84%
Less so in other
countries, but typically

00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:48.718 align:middle line:84%
in Switzerland and Germany,
he's very, very popular.

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:54.349 align:middle line:84%
And so Giorgio became in
some ways a protege of Erich.

00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:56.643 align:middle line:84%
And then Giorgio moved
to the United States,

00:07:56.643 --> 00:07:59.771 align:middle line:84%
lived in upstate
New York, eventually

00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:02.273 align:middle line:90%
San Francisco, and then LA.

00:08:02.273 --> 00:08:05.402 align:middle line:84%
And he, I think, just
sort of stumbled in,

00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:09.572 align:middle line:84%
because he was a friend
of Erich von Daniken.

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:10.782 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So the cast formed.

00:08:10.782 --> 00:08:13.451 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS: The cast formed,
and the show crystallized

00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:16.162 align:middle line:90%
around Erich and Giorgio.

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:20.125 align:middle line:84%
I was brought in also for
the very earliest shows.

00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And I really liked these
guys, and I've always

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:28.216 align:middle line:84%
been amazed at how they
continually come up

00:08:28.216 --> 00:08:31.219 align:middle line:90%
with new innovative episodes.

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:34.264 align:middle line:84%
It's going over 10
years now, actually.

00:08:34.264 --> 00:08:38.601 align:middle line:84%
I have to hand it to them that
their research staff is very,

00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:43.481 align:middle line:84%
very good, and they find out
things that I've never heard of

00:08:43.481 --> 00:08:45.358 align:middle line:90%
and am surprised to find out.

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:46.818 align:middle line:90%
And they do a good job.

00:08:46.818 --> 00:08:49.404 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
slant is very much

00:08:49.404 --> 00:08:54.325 align:middle line:84%
that ancient astronauts
came here and did things

00:08:54.325 --> 00:08:55.577 align:middle line:90%
on early planet Earth.

00:08:55.577 --> 00:08:58.037 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But at the end,
it'll say, but we'll never know.

00:08:58.037 --> 00:09:00.373 align:middle line:90%
Maybe one day.

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:02.417 align:middle line:84%
That's the one thing
about the show.

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:04.335 align:middle line:84%
It's a great show,
but at the end,

00:09:04.335 --> 00:09:05.754 align:middle line:90%
it's always, but maybe one day.

00:09:05.754 --> 00:09:06.421 align:middle line:90%
>> CHILDRESS: It's a what if.

00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And Erich von Daniken was always
like that, too, I want to say.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:11.926 align:middle line:84%
And that was a good part about
Erich von Daniken's books.

00:09:11.926 --> 00:09:15.847 align:middle line:84%
Erich shoved any theories
down your throat or said,

00:09:15.847 --> 00:09:17.432 align:middle line:90%
this is how it is.

00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:19.225 align:middle line:90%
He would just say, what if?

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:21.060 align:middle line:90%
Could this be?

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.187 align:middle line:90%
This is a possible thing.

00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:25.565 align:middle line:84%
And it was always
a question mark

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:27.525 align:middle line:84%
at the end of every
paragraph, practically.

00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:31.362 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean, it's wise
in a lot of ways just to let

00:09:31.362 --> 00:09:33.323 align:middle line:84%
people figure things
out for themselves.

00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:34.741 align:middle line:90%
And I do agree with that.

00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:38.203 align:middle line:84%
On another level
also, it's a lot safer

00:09:38.203 --> 00:09:40.622 align:middle line:84%
in terms of one's
reputation or tenure

00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:44.417 align:middle line:84%
and legally, even, to also
leave things on a question mark.

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:46.503 align:middle line:84%
So all the way around,
it's a wise thing to do.

00:09:46.503 --> 00:09:48.046 align:middle line:84%
I always poke fun
at it, because it's

00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:50.757 align:middle line:84%
like, you just made a case
for the last hour for this.

00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:53.593 align:middle line:90%
You're saying, eh, maybe not.

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:55.303 align:middle line:84%
And I know that's the
nature of the show,

00:09:55.303 --> 00:09:58.181 align:middle line:84%
and we also know this
has to be managed also

00:09:58.181 --> 00:09:59.098 align:middle line:90%
at very high levels.

00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:01.893 align:middle line:84%
We've talked with many people,
including Richard Dolan,

00:10:01.893 --> 00:10:05.563 align:middle line:84%
about the notion that
shows do have to be--

00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:07.023 align:middle line:84%
they don't have to
be, but they are

00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:09.526 align:middle line:84%
managed at higher levels
for how far content

00:10:09.526 --> 00:10:13.071 align:middle line:84%
will be allowed to go and
where you draw the line.

00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:16.699 align:middle line:84%
And any show, any network, they
have to choose their position.

00:10:16.699 --> 00:10:19.077 align:middle line:84%
We draw the line here, we
won't step over that line.

00:10:19.077 --> 00:10:20.119 align:middle line:90%
>> CHILDRESS: Absolutely.

00:10:20.119 --> 00:10:21.955 align:middle line:84%
And History Channel
does that for sure.

00:10:21.955 --> 00:10:24.457 align:middle line:84%
And they approve every
episode and send it back

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:26.751 align:middle line:84%
for re-editing and
removing of things.

00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:30.129 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And this is a
very savvy audience that

00:10:30.129 --> 00:10:32.507 align:middle line:84%
you're speaking to right now,
so people are subtle enough

00:10:32.507 --> 00:10:34.217 align:middle line:90%
to understand all that.

00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:37.554 align:middle line:84%
I just had to get my little
kind of "chk chk" in there.

00:10:37.554 --> 00:10:39.264 align:middle line:84%
So let's go into
the subject itself.

00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:43.351 align:middle line:84%
Even though the book
really is talking

00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:45.854 align:middle line:84%
about a lot of this
post-World War II,

00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:48.523 align:middle line:84%
you believe that the
subject regarding

00:10:48.523 --> 00:10:51.651 align:middle line:84%
anti-gravity propulsion in the
military industrial complex

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:53.653 align:middle line:90%
began prior to World War II.

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:54.821 align:middle line:90%
So let's go ahead and start.

00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:57.156 align:middle line:84%
And I think certainly,
Tesla folds into the story.

00:10:57.156 --> 00:10:58.658 align:middle line:90%
And we were talking off camera.

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:01.911 align:middle line:84%
Don't know if he folds in, but
you have a particular interest

00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:05.456 align:middle line:84%
also in Marconi and how he
may have folded in somehow.

00:11:05.456 --> 00:11:08.126 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about these
characters historically,

00:11:08.126 --> 00:11:09.878 align:middle line:90%
back from the teens and '20s.

00:11:09.878 --> 00:11:11.212 align:middle line:90%
>> CHILDRESS: Exactly.

00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:16.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm a big fan, actually, of
the old serials of the 1930s.

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:18.803 align:middle line:84%
And that's really where,
say, "Indiana Jones"

00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:23.516 align:middle line:84%
and the "Star Wars" movies
really come from the old

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:25.435 align:middle line:90%
serials of the '30s--

00:11:25.435 --> 00:11:28.730 align:middle line:84%
"Buck Rogers," "Flash
Gordon," "The Lost City."

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.274 align:middle line:84%
And when you watch
those old serials,

00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:33.359 align:middle line:84%
they are full of
Tesla technology.

00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:35.778 align:middle line:90%
They're battling with ray guns.

00:11:35.778 --> 00:11:37.447 align:middle line:90%
They're zapping each other.

00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:39.824 align:middle line:90%
Everything's electric.

00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:42.619 align:middle line:84%
Their spaceships
are not rockets,

00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:46.706 align:middle line:84%
they're electric craft, zapping
and crackling with electricity

00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:49.709 align:middle line:90%
as they zoom off to the moon.

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:53.504 align:middle line:84%
One of the popular
more of the '40s serial

00:11:53.504 --> 00:11:54.839 align:middle line:90%
was "Radar Men from the Moon."

00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:56.507 align:middle line:84%
And they were going
to the moon, they're

00:11:56.507 --> 00:11:58.009 align:middle line:84%
flying around in
these rocket ships,

00:11:58.009 --> 00:11:59.385 align:middle line:90%
they have their death rays.

00:11:59.385 --> 00:12:01.220 align:middle line:90%
This was the 1930s.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.805 align:middle line:90%
Towers-- Tesla towers.

00:12:02.805 --> 00:12:06.893 align:middle line:84%
When you read magazines like
"Electrical Experimenter"

00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:10.897 align:middle line:84%
in the 1930s, there would be
articles about Tesla and his

00:12:10.897 --> 00:12:15.234 align:middle line:84%
towers, and anti-gravity
airships, and death rays,

00:12:15.234 --> 00:12:19.364 align:middle line:84%
and these powerful searchlight
beams, and tractor beams--

00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:22.909 align:middle line:84%
all the things that we
got again in the '60s

00:12:22.909 --> 00:12:24.494 align:middle line:90%
in "Star Trek" and things.

00:12:24.494 --> 00:12:26.955 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you believe the
producers of those very early

00:12:26.955 --> 00:12:29.457 align:middle line:84%
shows were actually
familiar with Tesla's work?

00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:30.249 align:middle line:90%
>> CHILDRESS: Yes.

00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:33.461 align:middle line:84%
And almost everyone was, and
Tesla was very famous then.

00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:38.716 align:middle line:84%
Tesla was still a known
person, particularly

00:12:38.716 --> 00:12:41.803 align:middle line:90%
in New York on his birthday.

00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:44.597 align:middle line:84%
He was known as an
eccentric, of course,

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:46.557 align:middle line:84%
and this is one of the
things about Tesla.

00:12:46.557 --> 00:12:49.352 align:middle line:90%
He was something of a misfit.

00:12:49.352 --> 00:12:50.603 align:middle line:90%
He was a terrible businessman.

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:52.188 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: He was
anti-social, more or less.

00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:53.815 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS: Yeah,
he was anti-social.

00:12:53.815 --> 00:12:55.441 align:middle line:84%
He never got married
or really dated.

00:12:55.441 --> 00:12:58.194 align:middle line:90%
He had a number of phobias.

00:12:58.194 --> 00:13:02.198 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't have a
peach on his table.

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:06.119 align:middle line:84%
He would go through
napkins and silverware.

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:07.662 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Sounds
like Howard Hughes.

00:13:07.662 --> 00:13:09.497 align:middle line:84%
But then he comes into
the story later, so.

00:13:09.497 --> 00:13:10.623 align:middle line:90%
>> CHILDRESS: OK, right.

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:17.338 align:middle line:84%
So with Tesla, on his birthday,
reporters would come to him.

00:13:17.338 --> 00:13:21.217 align:middle line:84%
And he would proclaim all
kinds of fantastic things,

00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:25.054 align:middle line:84%
talk about death rays, talk
about real super science,

00:13:25.054 --> 00:13:29.392 align:middle line:84%
and his inventions that hadn't
come out yet kind of thing.

00:13:29.392 --> 00:13:32.437 align:middle line:90%
And they were often fantastic.

00:13:32.437 --> 00:13:36.733 align:middle line:84%
But what happened later to Tesla
was that the powers that be--

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:39.527 align:middle line:84%
which, in a sense,
would be oil companies--

00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:43.823 align:middle line:84%
they decided that they wanted to
strip Tesla of his importance.

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And they literally turned
him into the mad scientist.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:52.623 align:middle line:84%
And in 1940, they started
creating these Max Fleischer

00:13:52.623 --> 00:13:57.003 align:middle line:84%
cartoons for the movie
theaters with "Superman."

00:13:57.003 --> 00:14:00.173 align:middle line:84%
And those cartoons are
public domain today.

00:14:00.173 --> 00:14:02.675 align:middle line:84%
And the very first
one of those cartoons

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:05.928 align:middle line:84%
is Superman battling
this mad scientist,

00:14:05.928 --> 00:14:07.680 align:middle line:90%
and he's clearly Tesla.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.808 align:middle line:90%
He's got this magneto death ray.

00:14:10.808 --> 00:14:11.768 align:middle line:90%
He looks like Tesla.

00:14:11.768 --> 00:14:14.312 align:middle line:84%
They don't call him
Tesla in the cartoon,

00:14:14.312 --> 00:14:19.025 align:middle line:84%
but they've turned him
into an evil nemesis,

00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:21.652 align:middle line:90%
and Superman has to stop him.

00:14:21.652 --> 00:14:27.325 align:middle line:84%
And so they really created the
mad scientist at this time.

00:14:27.325 --> 00:14:29.327 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean, you
have to give them credit.

00:14:29.327 --> 00:14:30.495 align:middle line:90%
It's very clever.

00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:32.371 align:middle line:84%
The mass manipulation
of consciousness

00:14:32.371 --> 00:14:36.042 align:middle line:84%
is not that hard to do if it
starts with something as simple

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:36.876 align:middle line:90%
as that--

00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:40.296 align:middle line:84%
something as childlike
and seemingly innocent

00:14:40.296 --> 00:14:42.548 align:middle line:90%
as a comic book or a movie.

00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:43.591 align:middle line:90%
>> CHILDRESS: Yes, right.

00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:47.929 align:middle line:84%
And Tesla appeared in other
of the Superman cartoons,

00:14:47.929 --> 00:14:49.555 align:middle line:90%
also as the mad scientist.

00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:53.684 align:middle line:84%
And Superman battled
him over and over again.

00:14:53.684 --> 00:14:55.436 align:middle line:90%
Tesla died during World War II.

00:14:55.436 --> 00:14:57.313 align:middle line:90%
He died in 1943.

00:14:57.313 --> 00:15:00.691 align:middle line:84%
And then the FBI went
into his offices,

00:15:00.691 --> 00:15:02.693 align:middle line:84%
and they took all of his
papers that were there.

00:15:02.693 --> 00:15:05.655 align:middle line:84%
Other people had maybe
ransacked it Earlier.

00:15:05.655 --> 00:15:06.697 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Someone, yeah.

00:15:06.697 --> 00:15:07.740 align:middle line:90%
I remember that.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.242 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, go ahead.

00:15:09.242 --> 00:15:11.828 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS: There's now been
stories that Tesla was actually

00:15:11.828 --> 00:15:16.541 align:middle line:84%
murdered, and that's an
interesting story, too.

00:15:16.541 --> 00:15:20.461 align:middle line:84%
Otto Skorzeny and
Reinhard Gehlen supposedly

00:15:20.461 --> 00:15:23.297 align:middle line:84%
had come to New York during
the war and gone to Tesla

00:15:23.297 --> 00:15:24.090 align:middle line:90%
and murdered him.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.175 align:middle line:84%
This is a story
that comes out now.

00:15:26.175 --> 00:15:28.302 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now, why would
Reinhard Gehlen have been

00:15:28.302 --> 00:15:29.929 align:middle line:90%
involved in such a thing?

00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:32.014 align:middle line:84%
Politically, I don't
understand that.

00:15:32.014 --> 00:15:34.600 align:middle line:84%
I know the Germans were
really on their own race

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.768 align:middle line:90%
technologically.

00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:36.310 align:middle line:90%
>> CHILDRESS: Yes, right.

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:38.187 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so did they
feel he was somehow a threat

00:15:38.187 --> 00:15:39.105 align:middle line:90%
to their technology?

00:15:39.105 --> 00:15:41.232 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS: Well, and
they wanted his technology.

00:15:41.232 --> 00:15:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's a really good
point you're making.

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:46.279 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
don't realize this,

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:51.367 align:middle line:84%
but World War II, in many
ways, was an oil war.

00:15:51.367 --> 00:15:53.578 align:middle line:90%
The axis powers--

00:15:53.578 --> 00:15:56.205 align:middle line:90%
Germany and Italy and Japan--

00:15:56.205 --> 00:15:57.707 align:middle line:90%
did not have oil fields.

00:15:57.707 --> 00:15:59.584 align:middle line:90%
They still don't today.

00:15:59.584 --> 00:16:04.630 align:middle line:84%
What they did during World
War II is each of those powers

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:07.049 align:middle line:84%
went out and
occupied oil fields.

00:16:07.049 --> 00:16:10.261 align:middle line:84%
The Germans occupied oil
fields in Eastern Europe

00:16:10.261 --> 00:16:13.306 align:middle line:84%
and the Ukraine, the
Japanese occupied oil fields

00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:17.018 align:middle line:84%
in Manchuria, and the
Italians occupied oil fields

00:16:17.018 --> 00:16:18.519 align:middle line:90%
in North Africa.

00:16:18.519 --> 00:16:21.105 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that was
redistributed after the war,

00:16:21.105 --> 00:16:22.106 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:16:22.106 --> 00:16:22.815 align:middle line:90%
>> CHILDRESS: Well, in a sense.

00:16:22.815 --> 00:16:24.817 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Between Britain,
the US, and Europe.

00:16:24.817 --> 00:16:26.110 align:middle line:90%
>> CHILDRESS: Right.

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:28.946 align:middle line:84%
And other countries were
allowed to be independent.

00:16:28.946 --> 00:16:31.365 align:middle line:90%
Manchuria is a part of China.

00:16:31.365 --> 00:16:35.077 align:middle line:84%
So what was going on
as part of World War II

00:16:35.077 --> 00:16:41.876 align:middle line:84%
was that these axis powers
lacked oil, as the Allies did.

00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:43.669 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, at the
Battle of the Bulge,

00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:47.298 align:middle line:84%
that ended because the
Germans ran out of gas

00:16:47.298 --> 00:16:49.300 align:middle line:84%
and the tanks just
stopped working.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.510 align:middle line:84%
That was the end of the
Battle of the Bulge.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:52.803 align:middle line:90%
They ran out of gas.

00:16:52.803 --> 00:16:56.807 align:middle line:84%
But the Germans, not
having large oil supplies,

00:16:56.807 --> 00:17:01.145 align:middle line:84%
had to find alternative
energy sources.

00:17:01.145 --> 00:17:04.397 align:middle line:84%
And it was the Germans who also
created the Sasol plants, which

00:17:04.397 --> 00:17:07.484 align:middle line:90%
was turning coal into oil.

00:17:07.484 --> 00:17:09.237 align:middle line:84%
They did that
during World War II.

00:17:09.237 --> 00:17:11.571 align:middle line:84%
And the South Africans
also then took

00:17:11.571 --> 00:17:13.491 align:middle line:84%
that technology, because
South Africa does not

00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:14.992 align:middle line:90%
have oil fields.

00:17:14.992 --> 00:17:18.537 align:middle line:84%
So they used the Sasol
plants of Germany.

00:17:18.537 --> 00:17:21.374 align:middle line:84%
Brazil is another
major country that

00:17:21.374 --> 00:17:23.584 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have large oil fields.

00:17:23.584 --> 00:17:26.087 align:middle line:84%
So you have these
industrial countries--

00:17:26.087 --> 00:17:27.463 align:middle line:84%
Japan would be
one, and Germany--

00:17:27.463 --> 00:17:29.173 align:middle line:84%
but they don't really
have oil fields.

00:17:29.173 --> 00:17:31.634 align:middle line:84%
So it was during World
War II particularly

00:17:31.634 --> 00:17:36.138 align:middle line:84%
that the Germans were looking
for other types of energy.

00:17:36.138 --> 00:17:39.392 align:middle line:84%
And so the craft
that are electric--

00:17:39.392 --> 00:17:42.270 align:middle line:84%
and that was what Tesla
was all working on.

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:47.858 align:middle line:84%
So part of the idea of World
War II in the end was you had

00:17:47.858 --> 00:17:50.820 align:middle line:84%
the oil companies trying
to control the world,

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:55.032 align:middle line:84%
and they are pushing for
oil-based technology--

00:17:55.032 --> 00:17:58.869 align:middle line:90%
rockets, jets.

00:17:58.869 --> 00:18:02.415 align:middle line:90%
Their spacecraft is oil and--

00:18:02.415 --> 00:18:04.125 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Obviously
limited as a result.

00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:05.251 align:middle line:90%
>> CHILDRESS: That's right.

00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:08.587 align:middle line:84%
But now let's say, for instance,
that Tesla had survived

00:18:08.587 --> 00:18:10.756 align:middle line:84%
World War II and
had somehow become

00:18:10.756 --> 00:18:16.512 align:middle line:84%
part of the post-World
War II space program.

00:18:16.512 --> 00:18:18.848 align:middle line:84%
What kind of spaceships
would he have been creating?

00:18:18.848 --> 00:18:20.141 align:middle line:90%
Not rockets.

00:18:20.141 --> 00:18:23.519 align:middle line:84%
He would have been creating
electric spacecraft,

00:18:23.519 --> 00:18:25.771 align:middle line:84%
and that's part of the
thing with the UFO enigma.

00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:28.232 align:middle line:84%
When you look at
UFOs, whether they're

00:18:28.232 --> 00:18:33.821 align:middle line:84%
large cylindrical cigar-shaped
UFOs, or big flying triangles,

00:18:33.821 --> 00:18:39.577 align:middle line:84%
or they're discoid flying saucer
craft, they're not rockets.

00:18:39.577 --> 00:18:43.122 align:middle line:84%
They're not jets, although
some flying saucer

00:18:43.122 --> 00:18:45.916 align:middle line:90%
craft were actually jets.

00:18:45.916 --> 00:18:47.793 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, they're electric.

00:18:47.793 --> 00:18:52.173 align:middle line:84%
So now, when we look at UFO
technology and technology being

00:18:52.173 --> 00:18:54.216 align:middle line:84%
used by, say, the
Germans and whatnot,

00:18:54.216 --> 00:18:56.969 align:middle line:84%
such as foo fighters
during World War II--

00:18:56.969 --> 00:18:59.597 align:middle line:90%
these things are electric.

00:18:59.597 --> 00:19:00.848 align:middle line:90%
They're anti-gravity.

00:19:03.392 --> 00:19:06.604 align:middle line:84%
They're a different kind of
technology than we're used to.

00:19:06.604 --> 00:19:11.776 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, with Tesla
and the military and the oil

00:19:11.776 --> 00:19:16.072 align:middle line:84%
companies, after World
War II, they just

00:19:16.072 --> 00:19:17.823 align:middle line:84%
took us in a
different direction--

00:19:17.823 --> 00:19:22.953 align:middle line:84%
away from Tesla technology,
away from electric craft,

00:19:22.953 --> 00:19:29.960 align:middle line:84%
and into a world of jets,
rockets, and gasoline,

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:30.961 align:middle line:90%
aviation fuels.

00:19:30.961 --> 00:19:32.588 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Fuel
dependent technologies.

00:19:32.588 --> 00:19:33.714 align:middle line:90%
>> CHILDRESS: That's right.

00:19:33.714 --> 00:19:36.300 align:middle line:84%
The world's technology
and economy today

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:38.928 align:middle line:90%
is completely dependent on oil.

00:19:38.928 --> 00:19:40.513 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But they're
having trouble.

00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:41.347 align:middle line:90%
This is changing.

00:19:41.347 --> 00:19:41.889 align:middle line:90%
>> CHILDRESS: Well, right.

00:19:41.889 --> 00:19:43.391 align:middle line:84%
And it is changing,
and it's slowly.

00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:46.977 align:middle line:84%
And companies like the
Tesla Motor Company--

00:19:46.977 --> 00:19:49.563 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I just going to say
Tesla Motor Company, Elon Musk.

00:19:49.563 --> 00:19:49.980 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS: What
a great thing.

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:50.773 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, Elon Musk.

00:19:50.773 --> 00:19:52.691 align:middle line:90%
And it takes someone like him.

00:19:52.691 --> 00:19:55.903 align:middle line:10%
I have a tremendous respect
for people like Elon

00:19:55.903 --> 00:19:58.155 align:middle line:10%
Musk or Richard Branson--

00:19:58.155 --> 00:20:02.410 align:middle line:10%
people who have
money and the desire

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:05.996 align:middle line:10%
to create and fund
new technologies.

00:20:05.996 --> 00:20:07.623 align:middle line:84%
Look at the Tesla
Car Company today.

00:20:07.623 --> 00:20:10.918 align:middle line:84%
It's the second most valuable
car company in the world.

00:20:10.918 --> 00:20:14.088 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They just introduced
a $36,000 base model for this

00:20:14.088 --> 00:20:16.090 align:middle line:90%
coming year of the Tesla.

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:18.384 align:middle line:84%
I mean, now it's bringing
down into a range

00:20:18.384 --> 00:20:21.554 align:middle line:84%
that the average family
could even look at.

00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:22.805 align:middle line:90%
>> CHILDRESS: That's right.

00:20:22.805 --> 00:20:24.223 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
the holy grail.

00:20:24.223 --> 00:20:26.725 align:middle line:84%
Who was going to be
the first to do that?

00:20:26.725 --> 00:20:29.103 align:middle line:90%
And then his whole--

00:20:29.103 --> 00:20:31.730 align:middle line:84%
the battery plant he has,
I think, in Las Vegas.

00:20:34.108 --> 00:20:35.693 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
he came from or who

00:20:35.693 --> 00:20:38.154 align:middle line:84%
he is, but he is
changing the dynamics

00:20:38.154 --> 00:20:40.823 align:middle line:90%
in the world of fossil fuels--

00:20:40.823 --> 00:20:41.907 align:middle line:90%
hugely, the markets.

00:20:41.907 --> 00:20:44.160 align:middle line:84%
Some people say-- I was just
reading another article--

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.911 align:middle line:90%
those markets may not come back.

00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:50.040 align:middle line:84%
The more the electric
technology starts

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.667 align:middle line:84%
seeping in to a
mainstream level,

00:20:51.667 --> 00:20:54.879 align:middle line:90%
how could it ever recover?

00:20:54.879 --> 00:20:57.339 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS: People often
don't understand exactly how

00:20:57.339 --> 00:20:59.592 align:middle line:84%
electricity's made
and the power.

00:20:59.592 --> 00:21:02.678 align:middle line:84%
I was at a conference in
Amsterdam some years ago,

00:21:02.678 --> 00:21:05.764 align:middle line:84%
and one of the
speakers was a peak oil

00:21:05.764 --> 00:21:08.142 align:middle line:84%
person, who was saying that
we're running out of oil.

00:21:08.142 --> 00:21:09.310 align:middle line:90%
We need oil.

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:12.813 align:middle line:84%
And during his lecture, he
singled me out in the audience.

00:21:12.813 --> 00:21:15.941 align:middle line:84%
And he said, and how
is electricity made?

00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:18.235 align:middle line:84%
And then he went on to
say, it's made by oil

00:21:18.235 --> 00:21:19.987 align:middle line:90%
and that we need generators.

00:21:19.987 --> 00:21:21.405 align:middle line:90%
And I was just shaking my head.

00:21:21.405 --> 00:21:23.032 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't believe
he was saying that,

00:21:23.032 --> 00:21:27.161 align:middle line:84%
because oil has nothing to
do with creating electricity.

00:21:27.161 --> 00:21:30.956 align:middle line:84%
Alternating current is created
by rotating magnetic fields.

00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:34.418 align:middle line:84%
That's the genius of
alternating current.

00:21:34.418 --> 00:21:38.547 align:middle line:84%
And the only oil you need
is to lubricate axles

00:21:38.547 --> 00:21:42.468 align:middle line:90%
and moving parts of things.

00:21:42.468 --> 00:21:44.553 align:middle line:84%
People don't understand,
too, that nuclear power

00:21:44.553 --> 00:21:49.600 align:middle line:84%
plants are just boiling
water to turn the turbines.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.768 align:middle line:90%
That's all they do.

00:21:50.768 --> 00:21:52.019 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's all primitive.

00:21:52.019 --> 00:21:54.146 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS: Nuclear
technology is very primitive.

00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:56.941 align:middle line:84%
It's a giant nuclear
campfire boiling water

00:21:56.941 --> 00:21:59.735 align:middle line:90%
in a giant power plant, OK?

00:21:59.735 --> 00:22:03.364 align:middle line:84%
So understanding exactly
how electricity works

00:22:03.364 --> 00:22:07.535 align:middle line:84%
and where oil comes in, yes, we
are transitioning fortunately

00:22:07.535 --> 00:22:08.911 align:middle line:90%
out of this oil economy.

00:22:08.911 --> 00:22:10.454 align:middle line:90%
It will still take decades.

00:22:10.454 --> 00:22:11.288 align:middle line:90%
Part of it too--

00:22:11.288 --> 00:22:13.749 align:middle line:84%
many of these third world
countries that have oil--

00:22:13.749 --> 00:22:17.127 align:middle line:84%
Saudi Arabia is a good
example and others--

00:22:17.127 --> 00:22:18.921 align:middle line:90%
that's all they have.

00:22:18.921 --> 00:22:22.800 align:middle line:84%
Their economies will collapse
once we don't need oil

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:23.968 align:middle line:90%
from them anymore.

00:22:23.968 --> 00:22:26.637 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we're watching it
play out in geopolitical events

00:22:26.637 --> 00:22:27.429 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:22:27.429 --> 00:22:29.640 align:middle line:84%
The Russian's economy--
they're in a severe recession

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.392 align:middle line:84%
because of the
lowered oil prices.

00:22:31.392 --> 00:22:32.309 align:middle line:90%
Venezuela is right--

00:22:32.309 --> 00:22:33.477 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS: That's right.
Venezuela's a mess.

00:22:33.477 --> 00:22:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --on the brink of
absolute civil war as a result.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS: And oil prices in
my mind are not going to rise.

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:41.860 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps they'll
stabilize where they are.

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.654 align:middle line:84%
We don't really need
oil the way they have.

00:22:43.654 --> 00:22:44.697 align:middle line:90%
I mean, ask Tesla.

00:22:44.697 --> 00:22:45.656 align:middle line:90%
Ask Elon Musk.

00:22:45.656 --> 00:22:49.326 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, and municipal
areas are starting to demand

00:22:49.326 --> 00:22:52.538 align:middle line:84%
clean vehicles in their fleets,
and they're starting to make

00:22:52.538 --> 00:22:56.375 align:middle line:84%
incentives to the
average person.

00:22:56.375 --> 00:22:59.795 align:middle line:84%
These programs are
well underway now.

00:22:59.795 --> 00:23:02.131 align:middle line:84%
Some people were kind of
complaining, including myself,

00:23:02.131 --> 00:23:03.841 align:middle line:90%
that it took 20 years too long.

00:23:03.841 --> 00:23:05.759 align:middle line:84%
But we are now seeing
that it's happening.

00:23:05.759 --> 00:23:08.679 align:middle line:84%
And I think the proof is in
the pudding in that the oil

00:23:08.679 --> 00:23:11.974 align:middle line:84%
prices are not bouncing
back from 2008 for a reason.

00:23:11.974 --> 00:23:14.101 align:middle line:90%
The demand has diminished.

00:23:14.101 --> 00:23:17.646 align:middle line:84%
And granted, there was the
politics of OPEC and Saudis

00:23:17.646 --> 00:23:20.274 align:middle line:84%
continuing to pump it out
when there was already a glut.

00:23:20.274 --> 00:23:22.234 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's all
that shale production.

00:23:22.234 --> 00:23:24.570 align:middle line:84%
But still, in the end,
it shows that whatever

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:27.531 align:middle line:84%
Tesla was trying
to do 100 years ago

00:23:27.531 --> 00:23:29.575 align:middle line:84%
took us time-- we're
slow learners--

00:23:29.575 --> 00:23:31.785 align:middle line:84%
but it is coming to
the forefront now.

00:23:31.785 --> 00:23:34.038 align:middle line:84%
As far as electricity
goes, I remember asking,

00:23:34.038 --> 00:23:36.248 align:middle line:84%
because no one really
understands electricity.

00:23:36.248 --> 00:23:38.959 align:middle line:84%
I remember asking
Patrick Flanagan one day.

00:23:38.959 --> 00:23:42.338 align:middle line:84%
I said, Patrick, what's
electricity anyway?

00:23:42.338 --> 00:23:44.757 align:middle line:84%
He said, oh, well,
that's when energy

00:23:44.757 --> 00:23:48.427 align:middle line:84%
flows from a higher potential
into a lower potential

00:23:48.427 --> 00:23:49.261 align:middle line:90%
to be utilized.

00:23:49.261 --> 00:23:53.223 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, OK, thank you.

00:23:53.223 --> 00:23:54.933 align:middle line:84%
I want to see what
that looks like.

00:23:54.933 --> 00:23:56.352 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS: And
in the same way,

00:23:56.352 --> 00:23:58.437 align:middle line:84%
we don't really understand
what gravity is either.

00:23:58.437 --> 00:24:00.481 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's
where we're going to go now

00:24:00.481 --> 00:24:01.899 align:middle line:90%
in the conversation-- gravity.

00:24:01.899 --> 00:24:05.277 align:middle line:84%
These are anti-gravity
craft, yet

00:24:05.277 --> 00:24:11.659 align:middle line:84%
science itself is not at all in
consensus on what gravity is.

00:24:11.659 --> 00:24:13.077 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:24:13.077 --> 00:24:17.039 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about how
mathematics and gravity--

00:24:17.039 --> 00:24:18.957 align:middle line:84%
the current
understanding of gravity,

00:24:18.957 --> 00:24:21.335 align:middle line:84%
which is incomplete, but still,
the current understanding

00:24:21.335 --> 00:24:23.921 align:middle line:84%
in humanity-- how those
two fields have had

00:24:23.921 --> 00:24:26.590 align:middle line:90%
to parallel each other and why.

00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:28.384 align:middle line:90%
>> CHILDRESS: Well, right.

00:24:28.384 --> 00:24:31.053 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a physicist or
an electrical engineer.

00:24:31.053 --> 00:24:35.724 align:middle line:84%
I'm a total layperson who just
is interested in these things.

00:24:35.724 --> 00:24:40.771 align:middle line:84%
Einstein said in the
1920s, he talked about what

00:24:40.771 --> 00:24:42.898 align:middle line:90%
was called the unified field.

00:24:42.898 --> 00:24:46.318 align:middle line:84%
And according to Einstein,
the unified field

00:24:46.318 --> 00:24:53.117 align:middle line:84%
was a combination of electricity
and magnetism and gravity--

00:24:53.117 --> 00:24:54.034 align:middle line:90%
those three forces.

00:24:54.034 --> 00:24:56.203 align:middle line:84%
And then there's also what
they call the weak force,

00:24:56.203 --> 00:24:58.789 align:middle line:84%
or the nuclear force
would be a fourth force.

00:24:58.789 --> 00:25:03.252 align:middle line:84%
But so with the
unified field, Einstein

00:25:03.252 --> 00:25:07.047 align:middle line:84%
was saying that once you
understand the unified field,

00:25:07.047 --> 00:25:14.138 align:middle line:84%
you can then come up with, say,
an electromagnetism equation.

00:25:14.138 --> 00:25:14.930 align:middle line:90%
And we have that.

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:18.225 align:middle line:84%
There's an equation
for electromagnetism.

00:25:18.225 --> 00:25:19.810 align:middle line:84%
But what Einstein
was also saying

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:21.353 align:middle line:84%
was that with a
unified field, you're

00:25:21.353 --> 00:25:24.857 align:middle line:84%
going to also have an
equation for electrogravity.

00:25:24.857 --> 00:25:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And also, because magnetism
is part of the stew,

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:32.156 align:middle line:84%
you would have an equation
for magnetogravity as well.

00:25:32.156 --> 00:25:34.867 align:middle line:84%
Now, these equations
are not published.

00:25:34.867 --> 00:25:39.872 align:middle line:84%
This is where the researchers
are looking into these things.

00:25:39.872 --> 00:25:44.710 align:middle line:84%
The term anti-gravity
is kind of a buzzword.

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:46.503 align:middle line:84%
A lot of physicists
don't like it.

00:25:46.503 --> 00:25:49.173 align:middle line:84%
It's one of those
knee-jerk words.

00:25:49.173 --> 00:25:52.342 align:middle line:84%
When I first published my
first book on this subject,

00:25:52.342 --> 00:25:55.804 align:middle line:84%
called "The Anti-gravity
Handbook" in 1985,

00:25:55.804 --> 00:26:01.310 align:middle line:84%
my goal at that point was to
make the term "anti-gravity"

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:02.352 align:middle line:90%
a popular term.

00:26:02.352 --> 00:26:05.981 align:middle line:84%
I wanted it to be a household
name-- anti-gravity.

00:26:05.981 --> 00:26:08.776 align:middle line:84%
Later, we published
books by Moray B. King

00:26:08.776 --> 00:26:11.945 align:middle line:84%
on "Tapping the
Zero Point Energy."

00:26:11.945 --> 00:26:15.324 align:middle line:84%
So later, we wanted
also to bring that term,

00:26:15.324 --> 00:26:16.700 align:middle line:90%
"zero point energy."

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:19.286 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Then came overunity,
and all these terms floated

00:26:19.286 --> 00:26:20.204 align:middle line:90%
on the heels of it.

00:26:20.204 --> 00:26:22.289 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS: Right, overunity
generators and things like

00:26:22.289 --> 00:26:23.081 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:26:23.081 --> 00:26:25.584 align:middle line:84%
So with gravity control
or anti-gravity,

00:26:25.584 --> 00:26:29.838 align:middle line:84%
what it really means
is artificial gravity,

00:26:29.838 --> 00:26:30.964 align:middle line:90%
gravity control--

00:26:30.964 --> 00:26:32.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Working
against gravity.

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.301 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS:
--again, anti-gravity.

00:26:34.301 --> 00:26:37.054 align:middle line:90%
A gyro is anti-gravity.

00:26:37.054 --> 00:26:39.306 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, back
in the '80s, there

00:26:39.306 --> 00:26:43.143 align:middle line:84%
was a free energy researcher
named Joseph Neumann.

00:26:43.143 --> 00:26:46.313 align:middle line:84%
And he was fortunate to
get on the Johnny Carson

00:26:46.313 --> 00:26:49.399 align:middle line:90%
Show in the late 1970s.

00:26:49.399 --> 00:26:51.652 align:middle line:84%
And Johnny Carson
had him on just

00:26:51.652 --> 00:26:54.780 align:middle line:84%
for 15 minutes or
something, and Johnny Carson

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.282 align:middle line:84%
wanted him to explain
his free energy motor.

00:26:57.282 --> 00:27:00.828 align:middle line:84%
And Joseph Newman was
popular for a little while,

00:27:00.828 --> 00:27:02.246 align:middle line:84%
but he had a hard
time explaining

00:27:02.246 --> 00:27:03.455 align:middle line:90%
exactly how his thing worked.

00:27:03.455 --> 00:27:04.498 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: In 15 minutes.

00:27:04.498 --> 00:27:06.166 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS: But
he brought a gyro,

00:27:06.166 --> 00:27:10.546 align:middle line:84%
and he tried to explain his
invention in terms of a simple

00:27:10.546 --> 00:27:11.630 align:middle line:90%
gyro.

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:16.301 align:middle line:84%
Gyros are anti-gravity,
and they're used.

00:27:16.301 --> 00:27:18.345 align:middle line:90%
You can buy them at a toy store.

00:27:18.345 --> 00:27:21.849 align:middle line:84%
But gyros are also used
in Coast Guard cutters,

00:27:21.849 --> 00:27:26.854 align:middle line:84%
they're used in special ships,
they're used for balancing.

00:27:26.854 --> 00:27:28.522 align:middle line:84%
There's special
things about gyros.

00:27:28.522 --> 00:27:32.192 align:middle line:84%
The more you know about gyros
and certain types of gyros,

00:27:32.192 --> 00:27:37.865 align:middle line:84%
you get into classified
military material.

00:27:37.865 --> 00:27:39.366 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So extend
that into UFOs.

00:27:39.366 --> 00:27:41.493 align:middle line:90%
>> CHILDRESS: Yes, right.

00:27:41.493 --> 00:27:45.289 align:middle line:84%
In some ways, some
UFOs, it appears--

00:27:45.289 --> 00:27:48.083 align:middle line:84%
and I talk about
this in the book--

00:27:48.083 --> 00:27:51.003 align:middle line:90%
are flying gyros.

00:27:51.003 --> 00:27:52.379 align:middle line:84%
There's something
else, too, that

00:27:52.379 --> 00:27:58.176 align:middle line:84%
goes back to the ancient Indian
texts on vimanas and things.

00:27:58.176 --> 00:28:01.179 align:middle line:84%
And some of these
are pretty technical,

00:28:01.179 --> 00:28:04.308 align:middle line:84%
although it's difficult
to really sort out

00:28:04.308 --> 00:28:06.226 align:middle line:84%
exactly what technology
they're talking about.

00:28:06.226 --> 00:28:10.814 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: How did the
Vedic texts relay them?

00:28:10.814 --> 00:28:11.607 align:middle line:90%
>> CHILDRESS: OK.

00:28:11.607 --> 00:28:15.777 align:middle line:84%
They would talk about
crystals and certain poles,

00:28:15.777 --> 00:28:20.115 align:middle line:84%
like towers-- like the Tesla
towers or a Tesla coil.

00:28:20.115 --> 00:28:25.078 align:middle line:84%
But part of the workings-- at
least of some of the vimanas,

00:28:25.078 --> 00:28:26.371 align:middle line:90%
according to ancient texts--

00:28:26.371 --> 00:28:28.999 align:middle line:90%
mercury was part of it.

00:28:28.999 --> 00:28:30.959 align:middle line:90%
And that is very curious.

00:28:30.959 --> 00:28:34.004 align:middle line:84%
So mercury-- as I
started researching

00:28:34.004 --> 00:28:36.381 align:middle line:84%
all this, particularly the
early books into anti-gravity,

00:28:36.381 --> 00:28:40.177 align:middle line:84%
and it's in my current book,
"The Anti-gravity Files."

00:28:40.177 --> 00:28:43.931 align:middle line:84%
Mercury is an unusual
and unique element.

00:28:43.931 --> 00:28:47.351 align:middle line:84%
It's also a metal, and it's a
liquid, and it's a conductor.

00:28:47.351 --> 00:28:49.603 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it always
shows up in alchemical texts,

00:28:49.603 --> 00:28:50.854 align:middle line:90%
no matter what the tradition.

00:28:50.854 --> 00:28:52.439 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS: Mercury
is very special,

00:28:52.439 --> 00:28:54.942 align:middle line:84%
and there's things you can do
with mercury that you cannot do

00:28:54.942 --> 00:28:56.193 align:middle line:90%
with anything else.

00:28:56.193 --> 00:28:59.321 align:middle line:84%
And the vimana texts
would talk about mercury.

00:28:59.321 --> 00:29:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's go back
to World War II.

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:06.828 align:middle line:84%
Towards the end of World War
II, as the Allies were bombing

00:29:06.828 --> 00:29:09.706 align:middle line:84%
Germany and Germany
was losing the war,

00:29:09.706 --> 00:29:14.294 align:middle line:84%
and we were basically on our way
to Berlin with all the armies--

00:29:14.294 --> 00:29:17.547 align:middle line:10%
at that point, foo
fighters began showing up

00:29:17.547 --> 00:29:19.007 align:middle line:10%
in the skies over Germany.

00:29:19.007 --> 00:29:20.592 align:middle line:10%
The foo fighters, apparently,

00:29:20.592 --> 00:29:26.890 align:middle line:10%
were a kind of a basketball
or larger sized glass

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:29.810 align:middle line:90%
ball of some sort.

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:31.687 align:middle line:90%
It was filled with mercury.

00:29:31.687 --> 00:29:38.235 align:middle line:84%
That mercury was put in a
gyroscopic swirling manner

00:29:38.235 --> 00:29:40.028 align:middle line:90%
and then electrified.

00:29:40.028 --> 00:29:43.532 align:middle line:84%
So you have essentially
what we call--

00:29:43.532 --> 00:29:44.992 align:middle line:90%
and we talk about in the book--

00:29:44.992 --> 00:29:48.161 align:middle line:90%
a mercury vortex generator.

00:29:48.161 --> 00:29:52.082 align:middle line:84%
So you now have a
gyro that's electric,

00:29:52.082 --> 00:29:57.004 align:middle line:84%
has a swirling plasma of
mercury that's electrified.

00:29:57.004 --> 00:29:58.547 align:middle line:84%
When you electrify
mercury like that,

00:29:58.547 --> 00:30:03.176 align:middle line:84%
it becomes an electrified gas,
which is known as a plasma.

00:30:03.176 --> 00:30:04.344 align:middle line:90%
It's bright.

00:30:04.344 --> 00:30:06.513 align:middle line:90%
It's like a bright light.

00:30:06.513 --> 00:30:09.433 align:middle line:90%
It's swirling and spinning.

00:30:09.433 --> 00:30:11.226 align:middle line:90%
It's a vortex.

00:30:11.226 --> 00:30:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, it has
anti-gravity effects.

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:18.483 align:middle line:10%
What the foo fighters
were doing, apparently,

00:30:18.483 --> 00:30:19.651 align:middle line:10%
during World War II--

00:30:19.651 --> 00:30:22.988 align:middle line:10%
now, you have certain
people on the UFO side

00:30:22.988 --> 00:30:26.908 align:middle line:84%
who believe that foo fighters
were extraterrestrials

00:30:26.908 --> 00:30:30.787 align:middle line:84%
coming to earth and watching
the final battles of World War

00:30:30.787 --> 00:30:33.957 align:middle line:90%
II, in a sense, over Germany.

00:30:33.957 --> 00:30:37.294 align:middle line:84%
From a Tesla
standpoint, yeah, these

00:30:37.294 --> 00:30:41.590 align:middle line:90%
are mercury gyros that fly.

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:45.177 align:middle line:84%
They pulse power, and they
emit a pulsing electromagnetic

00:30:45.177 --> 00:30:45.969 align:middle line:90%
pulse.

00:30:45.969 --> 00:30:48.221 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what
was their purpose?

00:30:48.221 --> 00:30:52.225 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS: The purpose
was to stall the engines

00:30:52.225 --> 00:30:55.687 align:middle line:90%
of the bombers.

00:30:55.687 --> 00:30:57.814 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: To mess with
their electrical Instruments

00:30:57.814 --> 00:30:58.065 align:middle line:90%
on the craft?

00:30:58.065 --> 00:30:59.608 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS: The electrical
system on the bombers, yeah,

00:30:59.608 --> 00:31:01.485 align:middle line:90%
and make the engines cut out.

00:31:01.485 --> 00:31:06.198 align:middle line:84%
And the electrical system
of the bomber would fail.

00:31:06.198 --> 00:31:11.286 align:middle line:84%
It would be like the very
common stories of a flying

00:31:11.286 --> 00:31:13.997 align:middle line:84%
saucer hovering over your car or
something at night and your car

00:31:13.997 --> 00:31:15.665 align:middle line:90%
not working.

00:31:15.665 --> 00:31:17.542 align:middle line:84%
And until that
craft has left and

00:31:17.542 --> 00:31:20.587 align:middle line:84%
the strong electromagnetic
field that's emanating from it

00:31:20.587 --> 00:31:23.256 align:middle line:84%
is gone, then your
car will start again.

00:31:23.256 --> 00:31:27.219 align:middle line:84%
And that was going on with
the foo fighters over Germany.

00:31:27.219 --> 00:31:31.056 align:middle line:84%
So what was going on then was
as the American bombers coming

00:31:31.056 --> 00:31:33.558 align:middle line:84%
from bases in Britain
are flying over Germany,

00:31:33.558 --> 00:31:38.730 align:middle line:84%
they're suddenly seeing
these swarms of glowing balls

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:40.690 align:middle line:90%
of light spinning.

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And there would
be swarms of them

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:46.404 align:middle line:84%
all around and at the
height of the bombers.

00:31:46.404 --> 00:31:47.948 align:middle line:84%
And the bombers
even would somehow

00:31:47.948 --> 00:31:49.866 align:middle line:90%
attract the foo fighters.

00:31:49.866 --> 00:31:52.077 align:middle line:84%
And then as a swarm of foo
fighters were around them,

00:31:52.077 --> 00:31:56.498 align:middle line:84%
the electrical system of the
bomber would start to fail,

00:31:56.498 --> 00:31:57.707 align:middle line:90%
and the engines go out.

00:31:57.707 --> 00:31:59.918 align:middle line:84%
And then what would happen--
this is what the Germans

00:31:59.918 --> 00:32:00.877 align:middle line:90%
wanted--

00:32:00.877 --> 00:32:04.506 align:middle line:84%
was that the bombers would then
drop their bombs on a farmer's

00:32:04.506 --> 00:32:08.301 align:middle line:84%
field in Western Germany
and turn back to Britain

00:32:08.301 --> 00:32:11.721 align:middle line:84%
and not make it to
Dresden or Berlin

00:32:11.721 --> 00:32:13.932 align:middle line:90%
for the saturation bombing.

00:32:13.932 --> 00:32:18.061 align:middle line:84%
In the end, there's an
overwhelming number of bombers

00:32:18.061 --> 00:32:20.438 align:middle line:84%
that the Americans and British
were able to come up with.

00:32:20.438 --> 00:32:24.609 align:middle line:84%
We overwhelmed the
Germans, and it failed.

00:32:24.609 --> 00:32:26.736 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's a very
interesting theory on what

00:32:26.736 --> 00:32:27.571 align:middle line:90%
those are, though.

00:32:27.571 --> 00:32:28.655 align:middle line:90%
>> CHILDRESS: Well, right.

00:32:28.655 --> 00:32:29.823 align:middle line:90%
And here's the thing.

00:32:29.823 --> 00:32:30.615 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:32:30.615 --> 00:32:34.202 align:middle line:84%
And I have a whole
chapter in the new book

00:32:34.202 --> 00:32:37.122 align:middle line:84%
about foo fighters, because I
think they're very important.

00:32:37.122 --> 00:32:41.668 align:middle line:84%
And this is part
of the thing too

00:32:41.668 --> 00:32:44.254 align:middle line:84%
when you come out
of World War II.

00:32:44.254 --> 00:32:46.464 align:middle line:84%
There are things in World
War II that are still

00:32:46.464 --> 00:32:47.883 align:middle line:90%
classified and secret.

00:32:47.883 --> 00:32:50.927 align:middle line:84%
The British, particularly,
have all kinds of secrets

00:32:50.927 --> 00:32:53.138 align:middle line:84%
during World War II that
they had never declassified,

00:32:53.138 --> 00:32:54.848 align:middle line:90%
and it's well-known in Britain.

00:32:54.848 --> 00:32:56.391 align:middle line:90%
The US, too.

00:32:56.391 --> 00:33:00.270 align:middle line:84%
We supposedly have largely
declassified most of the things

00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:01.146 align:middle line:90%
from World War II.

00:33:01.146 --> 00:33:02.856 align:middle line:84%
Americans like to
think that, but I

00:33:02.856 --> 00:33:03.982 align:middle line:90%
think that's not the truth.

00:33:03.982 --> 00:33:04.983 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, I don't.

00:33:04.983 --> 00:33:07.152 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS: But the foo
fighters are part of this,

00:33:07.152 --> 00:33:09.863 align:middle line:84%
and it's something that's
never really addressed.

00:33:09.863 --> 00:33:12.407 align:middle line:84%
And at this point,
the US military

00:33:12.407 --> 00:33:17.495 align:middle line:84%
has never ever told us what
foo fighters were, told us

00:33:17.495 --> 00:33:20.790 align:middle line:84%
that they even
existed, filled us

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:23.835 align:middle line:84%
in on the technology
behind foo fighters.

00:33:23.835 --> 00:33:25.045 align:middle line:90%
We just don't know.

00:33:25.045 --> 00:33:26.713 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they ignore it.

00:33:26.713 --> 00:33:29.883 align:middle line:84%
But it apparently was something
that generally happened

00:33:29.883 --> 00:33:32.385 align:middle line:84%
during World War II,
and it was something

00:33:32.385 --> 00:33:33.511 align:middle line:90%
the Germans were making.

00:33:33.511 --> 00:33:38.350 align:middle line:84%
Later, the Germans allegedly
created these Vril craft

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:40.060 align:middle line:90%
and Haunebu craft.

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:41.645 align:middle line:90%
And it's the same technology.

00:33:41.645 --> 00:33:49.027 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, one
possible diagram of one

00:33:49.027 --> 00:33:52.364 align:middle line:10%
of these craft when you see
the Haunebu or the Vril craft,

00:33:52.364 --> 00:33:53.198 align:middle line:10%
they look like this.

00:33:53.198 --> 00:33:57.118 align:middle line:10%
They have little domes
beneath them, which would be--

00:33:57.118 --> 00:33:59.287 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Like the little
foo fighter plasma balls.

00:33:59.287 --> 00:33:59.663 align:middle line:10%
>> CHILDRESS: --those little
foo fighter things, yeah,

00:33:59.663 --> 00:34:01.081 align:middle line:90%
cells there.

00:34:01.081 --> 00:34:02.457 align:middle line:84%
And you would have
three of them,

00:34:02.457 --> 00:34:03.833 align:middle line:84%
and these things
are directional.

00:34:03.833 --> 00:34:08.170 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing is lifting up by
tilting, and doing that, you're

00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:10.382 align:middle line:90%
taking off this way, that way--

00:34:10.382 --> 00:34:11.591 align:middle line:90%
how to control these things.

00:34:11.591 --> 00:34:14.386 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So where do you
think that technology may have

00:34:14.386 --> 00:34:16.972 align:middle line:90%
originally come from?

00:34:16.972 --> 00:34:19.474 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS: Well, I ultimately
believe it came from Tesla.

00:34:19.474 --> 00:34:25.981 align:middle line:84%
But the Germans were doing
all kinds of experiments.

00:34:25.981 --> 00:34:27.440 align:middle line:84%
We were talking
about this earlier,

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:30.360 align:middle line:84%
too, with their not
having oil thing,

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.152 align:middle line:84%
so they were looking
at alternative things.

00:34:32.152 --> 00:34:34.614 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Right. so
they're motivated, sure.

00:34:34.614 --> 00:34:36.824 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS: And they were
looking at ancient texts.

00:34:36.824 --> 00:34:38.451 align:middle line:84%
And the Germans
were very interested

00:34:38.451 --> 00:34:43.206 align:middle line:84%
in the Aryan texts, the
Sanskrit texts, vimanas.

00:34:43.206 --> 00:34:46.083 align:middle line:90%
They were going to Tibet.

00:34:46.083 --> 00:34:48.585 align:middle line:84%
They believed in Atlantis,
the Thule Society.

00:34:48.585 --> 00:34:51.547 align:middle line:84%
They were sending submarines
to Antarctica at that time.

00:34:51.547 --> 00:34:53.132 align:middle line:90%
All kinds of things were going.

00:34:53.132 --> 00:34:56.136 align:middle line:84%
And it's well known
that the Germans were--

00:34:56.136 --> 00:35:00.181 align:middle line:84%
the Nazis, anyway-- were
heavily into occult things.

00:35:00.181 --> 00:35:07.522 align:middle line:84%
They had mediums who were giving
them information, psychics--

00:35:07.522 --> 00:35:10.525 align:middle line:84%
they believed in all
that kind of stuff.

00:35:10.525 --> 00:35:14.779 align:middle line:84%
But on top of what we might
call their esoteric weirdness

00:35:14.779 --> 00:35:18.575 align:middle line:84%
and it would almost seem
like goofy-type stuff,

00:35:18.575 --> 00:35:20.285 align:middle line:84%
still, at the same
time, we have to admit

00:35:20.285 --> 00:35:25.415 align:middle line:84%
the German's very technical
culture and making things.

00:35:25.415 --> 00:35:26.499 align:middle line:90%
I mean, their cars--

00:35:26.499 --> 00:35:29.044 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They were trying to
use the best from both realms,

00:35:29.044 --> 00:35:31.087 align:middle line:90%
so to speak, Earth and beyond.

00:35:31.087 --> 00:35:32.047 align:middle line:90%
>> CHILDRESS: Right.

00:35:32.047 --> 00:35:34.299 align:middle line:84%
And so they then
did also what they

00:35:34.299 --> 00:35:35.884 align:middle line:90%
called the Bell Experiment.

00:35:35.884 --> 00:35:39.095 align:middle line:84%
High energy
experiments allegedly

00:35:39.095 --> 00:35:45.560 align:middle line:84%
created some of these early
flying saucer-type craft,

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:48.730 align:middle line:84%
underground factories
and things like that.

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:51.399 align:middle line:84%
What went on towards
the end of World War II

00:35:51.399 --> 00:35:54.361 align:middle line:84%
is really something
else, and we still

00:35:54.361 --> 00:35:55.737 align:middle line:84%
don't know exactly
what happened.

00:35:55.737 --> 00:35:56.946 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Do you think
that Antarctica was--

00:35:56.946 --> 00:35:58.031 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS: They
went to Antarctica.

00:35:58.031 --> 00:35:59.115 align:middle line:90%
They went to South America.

00:35:59.115 --> 00:36:00.784 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --technologically
involved in all this,

00:36:00.784 --> 00:36:01.117 align:middle line:84%
that there were
developments there?

00:36:01.117 --> 00:36:02.994 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS: I think
so, that's right, yeah.

00:36:02.994 --> 00:36:05.914 align:middle line:84%
And they had secret
bases in Greenland, too,

00:36:05.914 --> 00:36:08.124 align:middle line:90%
and in the Canary Islands.

00:36:08.124 --> 00:36:10.335 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Just kind of hid
everything under the ice.

00:36:10.335 --> 00:36:12.629 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS: Well,
and underground.

00:36:12.629 --> 00:36:18.218 align:middle line:84%
They had these underground
sub pens and things like that.

00:36:18.218 --> 00:36:21.429 align:middle line:84%
The Germans use submarines
very, very extensively.

00:36:21.429 --> 00:36:24.516 align:middle line:84%
And there was also what they
called the black U-boats.

00:36:24.516 --> 00:36:28.186 align:middle line:84%
It's believed that a number
of U-boats after World War II

00:36:28.186 --> 00:36:30.105 align:middle line:90%
were still operational.

00:36:30.105 --> 00:36:32.524 align:middle line:84%
Two surrendered in
Argentina about a year

00:36:32.524 --> 00:36:34.984 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the war, and
those two U-boats had apparently

00:36:34.984 --> 00:36:35.568 align:middle line:90%
been in Antarctica.

00:36:35.568 --> 00:36:35.944 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:36:35.944 --> 00:36:37.529 align:middle line:84%
I've done a couple of
shows on that, yes.

00:36:37.529 --> 00:36:38.363 align:middle line:90%
>> CHILDRESS: Right.

00:36:38.363 --> 00:36:40.657 align:middle line:84%
But other boats were
also kept going.

00:36:40.657 --> 00:36:44.786 align:middle line:84%
A u-boat was found that
was sunk off of Indonesia.

00:36:44.786 --> 00:36:47.080 align:middle line:90%
It had a cargo of mercury.

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:49.332 align:middle line:84%
Then just about 10
years ago, there

00:36:49.332 --> 00:36:51.918 align:middle line:84%
was an interesting story
that was out of Norway.

00:36:54.879 --> 00:36:56.589 align:middle line:84%
I pay attention to
any news article

00:36:56.589 --> 00:36:58.091 align:middle line:84%
that has to do
with German U-boats

00:36:58.091 --> 00:37:00.343 align:middle line:90%
and also has to do with mercury.

00:37:00.343 --> 00:37:03.304 align:middle line:84%
And there was a u-boat
that was found sunken

00:37:03.304 --> 00:37:09.310 align:middle line:84%
in a fjord in Norway and had
been there since World War II.

00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:11.855 align:middle line:84%
And they were worried
about it, because it

00:37:11.855 --> 00:37:13.898 align:middle line:90%
had a cargo of mercury.

00:37:13.898 --> 00:37:15.984 align:middle line:84%
So why are these
U-boats carrying

00:37:15.984 --> 00:37:18.278 align:middle line:90%
these huge cargoes of mercury?

00:37:18.278 --> 00:37:21.865 align:middle line:84%
They were apparently
shipping mercury to Japan.

00:37:21.865 --> 00:37:24.534 align:middle line:84%
Later, foo fighters were
seen around the Korean War

00:37:24.534 --> 00:37:26.119 align:middle line:90%
in Japan--

00:37:26.119 --> 00:37:30.832 align:middle line:90%
flying saucers too seen there.

00:37:30.832 --> 00:37:34.252 align:middle line:90%
It seems so fantastic to people.

00:37:34.252 --> 00:37:40.425 align:middle line:84%
And even today, 50, 60, 70
years after World War II,

00:37:40.425 --> 00:37:44.137 align:middle line:84%
people cannot wrap their
heads around foo fighters,

00:37:44.137 --> 00:37:48.516 align:middle line:84%
around early flying
saucer sightings.

00:37:48.516 --> 00:37:52.395 align:middle line:84%
Around Los Angeles in the early
'50s, fleets of flying saucers

00:37:52.395 --> 00:37:53.980 align:middle line:90%
were seen flying over.

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:57.275 align:middle line:90%
It was almost a daily thing.

00:37:57.275 --> 00:37:59.527 align:middle line:90%
Columnists would write about it.

00:37:59.527 --> 00:38:04.157 align:middle line:84%
There's the famous Lubbock
lights, which were also

00:38:04.157 --> 00:38:05.492 align:middle line:90%
photographed in the 1950s.

00:38:05.492 --> 00:38:09.454 align:middle line:10%
And they were flying saucers
flying in V formation.

00:38:09.454 --> 00:38:11.998 align:middle line:84%
So you have all these
things going on.

00:38:11.998 --> 00:38:14.876 align:middle line:84%
There's the Cash-Landrum
case, which was

00:38:14.876 --> 00:38:17.670 align:middle line:90%
in Texas in the early 1980s.

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:23.551 align:middle line:84%
And the Cash-Landrum case was
about two women and some kids

00:38:23.551 --> 00:38:25.553 align:middle line:84%
in East Texas,
and they claimed--

00:38:25.553 --> 00:38:28.681 align:middle line:84%
this was during an afternoon--
they said a flying saucer came,

00:38:28.681 --> 00:38:32.018 align:middle line:84%
hovered over their
car, irradiated them.

00:38:32.018 --> 00:38:35.980 align:middle line:84%
They touched the hood of
the car, it was burning hot.

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:39.067 align:middle line:84%
Then they claimed that no
less than 20 helicopters

00:38:39.067 --> 00:38:41.819 align:middle line:84%
came, surrounded the flying
saucer, which was glowing

00:38:41.819 --> 00:38:43.863 align:middle line:84%
and had fiery sparks
coming out of it,

00:38:43.863 --> 00:38:46.199 align:middle line:90%
and then escorted it away.

00:38:46.199 --> 00:38:47.408 align:middle line:90%
And then their hair fell out.

00:38:47.408 --> 00:38:48.201 align:middle line:90%
They had cancer.

00:38:48.201 --> 00:38:50.912 align:middle line:10%
And they sued the US
government and the military

00:38:50.912 --> 00:38:52.539 align:middle line:10%
for their health damages.

00:38:52.539 --> 00:38:55.583 align:middle line:84%
This was the famous
Cash-Landrum case.

00:38:55.583 --> 00:38:58.461 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And this was before
there was any kind of zeitgeist

00:38:58.461 --> 00:39:00.213 align:middle line:90%
around this subject.

00:39:00.213 --> 00:39:03.716 align:middle line:84%
This was just some women
having an experience.

00:39:03.716 --> 00:39:06.010 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS: It wasn't until
really the mid '80s, late

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:08.930 align:middle line:84%
'80s that suddenly everyone
got interested in UFOs,

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:11.432 align:middle line:84%
and then the reptilian aliens
were here, and the greys,

00:39:11.432 --> 00:39:12.267 align:middle line:90%
and all that.

00:39:12.267 --> 00:39:12.934 align:middle line:90%
This was before that.

00:39:12.934 --> 00:39:15.311 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's why I really
like the studies that were

00:39:15.311 --> 00:39:17.939 align:middle line:84%
happening more in the '50s and
'60s when this was still quiet

00:39:17.939 --> 00:39:18.773 align:middle line:90%
overall.

00:39:18.773 --> 00:39:19.857 align:middle line:90%
>> CHILDRESS: Well, right.

00:39:19.857 --> 00:39:21.859 align:middle line:84%
Back then, people
like George Adamski

00:39:21.859 --> 00:39:25.196 align:middle line:84%
would claim that he would
meet extraterrestrials,

00:39:25.196 --> 00:39:27.907 align:middle line:84%
and they'd meet in a
hotel room and go out.

00:39:27.907 --> 00:39:29.742 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I was just
going to bring him up.

00:39:29.742 --> 00:39:31.578 align:middle line:10%
>> CHILDRESS: And so
with George Adamski,

00:39:31.578 --> 00:39:35.582 align:middle line:10%
here's a guy who was in contact
with Venusians supposedly.

00:39:35.582 --> 00:39:37.625 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, they talk
in German accents.

00:39:37.625 --> 00:39:40.503 align:middle line:84%
They're total normal humans,
they're just dressed.

00:39:40.503 --> 00:39:43.548 align:middle line:84%
They go to a hotel room,
meet him in his hotel room.

00:39:43.548 --> 00:39:46.467 align:middle line:90%
They sit in a bar.

00:39:46.467 --> 00:39:47.885 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make a lot of sense.

00:39:47.885 --> 00:39:49.971 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And what's
interesting is the guy was

00:39:49.971 --> 00:39:50.888 align:middle line:90%
an upright guy.

00:39:50.888 --> 00:39:54.058 align:middle line:84%
He even said,
disprove any of this.

00:39:54.058 --> 00:39:57.186 align:middle line:84%
I'm open to anyone
examining anything of this.

00:39:57.186 --> 00:40:01.274 align:middle line:84%
He was pleading with the public
and the particular officials

00:40:01.274 --> 00:40:06.070 align:middle line:84%
and so forth in the day to
try to examine this with him.

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:07.447 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you're
doing something

00:40:07.447 --> 00:40:09.407 align:middle line:84%
in that kind of open
spirit rather than

00:40:09.407 --> 00:40:12.452 align:middle line:84%
an authoritative one, I
always give it more credit,

00:40:12.452 --> 00:40:14.537 align:middle line:84%
because the spirit of
collaboration is there.

00:40:14.537 --> 00:40:15.872 align:middle line:84%
He isn't the one that's
trying to shove anything

00:40:15.872 --> 00:40:16.873 align:middle line:90%
down anybody's throat.

00:40:16.873 --> 00:40:20.501 align:middle line:84%
So I just have a soft spot
for that particular story.

00:40:20.501 --> 00:40:21.919 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
things in your book

00:40:21.919 --> 00:40:23.463 align:middle line:84%
that I found very
interesting was--

00:40:26.049 --> 00:40:32.680 align:middle line:84%
I think as I recall in the book,
the oldest dated UFO photograph

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:36.851 align:middle line:84%
was from 1929 right
over Colorado.

00:40:36.851 --> 00:40:38.269 align:middle line:84%
Now, talk about
that a little bit.

00:40:38.269 --> 00:40:39.979 align:middle line:90%
This way preceded everything.

00:40:39.979 --> 00:40:41.064 align:middle line:90%
>> CHILDRESS: Well, right.

00:40:41.064 --> 00:40:42.690 align:middle line:84%
So you have some old
photos, including

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:44.817 align:middle line:90%
that one over Colorado.

00:40:44.817 --> 00:40:47.654 align:middle line:84%
There's also another
photograph that's

00:40:47.654 --> 00:40:50.782 align:middle line:84%
taken over New Hampshire
in the late 1800s.

00:40:50.782 --> 00:40:52.700 align:middle line:84%
We have also, which
is a curious thing,

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:55.495 align:middle line:84%
and it's coming right
around the time of Tesla

00:40:55.495 --> 00:40:59.499 align:middle line:84%
lighting the Chicago
World's Fair in 1893.

00:40:59.499 --> 00:41:04.003 align:middle line:84%
And mysterious airships
were seen across America.

00:41:04.003 --> 00:41:07.715 align:middle line:84%
And for a couple of years,
that was a big deal--

00:41:07.715 --> 00:41:13.054 align:middle line:84%
these kind of dirigible
Zeppelin cigar-shaped air ships

00:41:13.054 --> 00:41:16.099 align:middle line:84%
that are moving across
the United States.

00:41:16.099 --> 00:41:19.477 align:middle line:84%
And some were
photographed and drawn.

00:41:19.477 --> 00:41:22.230 align:middle line:84%
And so you have a curious
thing there-- these sort

00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:26.943 align:middle line:84%
of Jules Verne renegade
inventors with their subs

00:41:26.943 --> 00:41:29.904 align:middle line:84%
and air ships and
things like that.

00:41:29.904 --> 00:41:31.656 align:middle line:84%
Curiously, these air
ships would often

00:41:31.656 --> 00:41:34.867 align:middle line:84%
have a very powerful
searchlight beam in front

00:41:34.867 --> 00:41:39.080 align:middle line:90%
of them and powerful lights.

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:42.250 align:middle line:84%
This was exactly what
Tesla had demonstrated

00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:45.336 align:middle line:10%
at the World's Fair in Chicago.

00:41:45.336 --> 00:41:48.965 align:middle line:84%
So Chicago, in a sense, was
like the first city really

00:41:48.965 --> 00:41:54.137 align:middle line:84%
lit by AC power, and
then Tesla went on

00:41:54.137 --> 00:41:57.724 align:middle line:84%
to put the power plant
at Niagara Falls, really.

00:41:57.724 --> 00:42:00.184 align:middle line:84%
And then power was lighting
Toronto, and Albany,

00:42:00.184 --> 00:42:01.853 align:middle line:90%
and New York City.

00:42:01.853 --> 00:42:04.480 align:middle line:84%
But with all of these
things going on and then

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:07.984 align:middle line:90%
these early UFO reports--

00:42:07.984 --> 00:42:13.114 align:middle line:84%
and I'm a believer too in
these ancient civilizations.

00:42:13.114 --> 00:42:15.450 align:middle line:84%
I have to admit, I've always
been fascinated by Mt.

00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:19.829 align:middle line:84%
Shasta and all of the legends
that are associated with it.

00:42:19.829 --> 00:42:23.708 align:middle line:84%
I'm a believer that there are
places in Tibet where there are

00:42:23.708 --> 00:42:30.256 align:middle line:90%
secret places, shall we say.

00:42:30.256 --> 00:42:34.510 align:middle line:84%
In Tibet and in South America,
there are many stories--

00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:35.303 align:middle line:90%
and Mt.

00:42:35.303 --> 00:42:37.764 align:middle line:84%
Shasta has the same
myth around it--

00:42:37.764 --> 00:42:39.557 align:middle line:84%
that you have these
hollowed out mountains.

00:42:39.557 --> 00:42:43.728 align:middle line:84%
And then inside them are these
ancient Atlantian or whatever

00:42:43.728 --> 00:42:49.817 align:middle line:84%
or Ramah empire India, with
their technology and aircraft

00:42:49.817 --> 00:42:51.861 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:42:51.861 --> 00:42:57.742 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, until Cheyenne
Mountain existed near here

00:42:57.742 --> 00:43:00.536 align:middle line:84%
in Colorado Springs, that
is exactly the same thing.

00:43:00.536 --> 00:43:03.998 align:middle line:84%
It's a hollowed out
mountain, and inside of it

00:43:03.998 --> 00:43:05.875 align:middle line:10%
is a high tech city.

00:43:05.875 --> 00:43:07.210 align:middle line:10%
There are elevators.

00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:12.048 align:middle line:84%
There are electric trains
running around through it.

00:43:12.048 --> 00:43:15.301 align:middle line:84%
We'll never be able to go
inside Cheyenne Mountain,

00:43:15.301 --> 00:43:18.012 align:middle line:84%
but the military
admits, yes, we have it.

00:43:18.012 --> 00:43:18.971 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:43:18.971 --> 00:43:20.973 align:middle line:84%
We can't tell you exactly
what's all in there.

00:43:20.973 --> 00:43:24.101 align:middle line:84%
I believe there's even
underground trains and train

00:43:24.101 --> 00:43:26.270 align:middle line:84%
systems that are
connecting Cheyenne

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:32.527 align:middle line:84%
Mountain with the Dulce base
and Los Alamos in New Mexico.

00:43:32.527 --> 00:43:35.655 align:middle line:84%
Back in the '90s,
there was a big thing

00:43:35.655 --> 00:43:39.826 align:middle line:84%
in Taos, New Mexico, about what
they called the "Taos hum."

00:43:39.826 --> 00:43:43.871 align:middle line:84%
And people in Taos--
it was common talk

00:43:43.871 --> 00:43:45.498 align:middle line:90%
and in the newspapers of this.

00:43:45.498 --> 00:43:48.584 align:middle line:84%
People were hearing this
humming and grinding

00:43:48.584 --> 00:43:50.920 align:middle line:90%
noise beneath Taos.

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:54.507 align:middle line:84%
It was like some giant
tunnel boring machine

00:43:54.507 --> 00:43:59.470 align:middle line:84%
was moving under the city on its
way to Los Alamos or something.

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:01.597 align:middle line:84%
And they have these
things-- these giant tunnel

00:44:01.597 --> 00:44:02.390 align:middle line:90%
boring machines.

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:04.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Sandia Mountain,
Alamos, all of it.

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:05.476 align:middle line:90%
>> CHILDRESS: Right.

00:44:05.476 --> 00:44:06.853 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
stories like this

00:44:06.853 --> 00:44:10.731 align:middle line:84%
too, that even Washington DC
and other bases in the United

00:44:10.731 --> 00:44:15.945 align:middle line:84%
States are connected by a
special underground electric

00:44:15.945 --> 00:44:17.029 align:middle line:90%
train system.

00:44:17.029 --> 00:44:18.656 align:middle line:90%
I mean, these are rumors.

00:44:18.656 --> 00:44:19.448 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Indeed.

00:44:19.448 --> 00:44:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think where
we are right now

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:22.952 align:middle line:84%
in this conversation
is it's kind

00:44:22.952 --> 00:44:24.829 align:middle line:90%
of a wonderful free-for-all.

00:44:24.829 --> 00:44:29.709 align:middle line:84%
Because the fact is, the subject
is a wonderful free-for-all.

00:44:29.709 --> 00:44:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And I want to get into a couple
of other very specific things,

00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:35.339 align:middle line:84%
but what you're
demonstrating anyway

00:44:35.339 --> 00:44:39.886 align:middle line:84%
is, yes, there likely very much
were these ancient technologies

00:44:39.886 --> 00:44:41.971 align:middle line:84%
from other cultures
that have come to Earth

00:44:41.971 --> 00:44:43.848 align:middle line:84%
and probably been
here all along.

00:44:43.848 --> 00:44:45.766 align:middle line:84%
Yes, at the same
time, we've also--

00:44:45.766 --> 00:44:48.936 align:middle line:84%
through people such as Tesla
and Tesla specifically--

00:44:48.936 --> 00:44:50.438 align:middle line:84%
have been able to
bring ourselves up

00:44:50.438 --> 00:44:53.816 align:middle line:84%
to a very high level of secreted
away technology that's been

00:44:53.816 --> 00:44:55.693 align:middle line:90%
used even since World War II.

00:44:55.693 --> 00:44:57.612 align:middle line:84%
What's happening in
between, we don't know.

00:44:57.612 --> 00:45:01.699 align:middle line:84%
But now we have industrialists
like Elon Musk coming along,

00:45:01.699 --> 00:45:04.785 align:middle line:84%
which is an interesting
kind of mind that I respect.

00:45:04.785 --> 00:45:07.038 align:middle line:84%
Because here, he
understands this.

00:45:07.038 --> 00:45:09.498 align:middle line:84%
He's harnessing the
use of electricity.

00:45:09.498 --> 00:45:12.043 align:middle line:84%
He's making it available
for people's homes.

00:45:12.043 --> 00:45:15.588 align:middle line:84%
For $100 a month you can
have panels on your home

00:45:15.588 --> 00:45:17.089 align:middle line:90%
now and so forth.

00:45:17.089 --> 00:45:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
he's standing out publicly

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:23.137 align:middle line:84%
against the abuse of
technology in transhumanism.

00:45:23.137 --> 00:45:27.975 align:middle line:84%
So it's really interesting kind
of characters and psychology

00:45:27.975 --> 00:45:31.562 align:middle line:84%
being thrown at the
public for evaluation

00:45:31.562 --> 00:45:32.772 align:middle line:90%
all at the same time.

00:45:32.772 --> 00:45:35.691 align:middle line:90%
And then you have other players.

00:45:35.691 --> 00:45:38.945 align:middle line:84%
Zuckerberg standing up-- total
transhumanist-- standing up

00:45:38.945 --> 00:45:40.446 align:middle line:90%
and saying, no, I'm all for it.

00:45:40.446 --> 00:45:41.781 align:middle line:90%
Yay, let's go.

00:45:41.781 --> 00:45:44.200 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's kind of having
to almost line up and show

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:46.827 align:middle line:84%
their true colors at
this point in time.

00:45:46.827 --> 00:45:47.870 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:49.705 align:middle line:84%
And what you've
put in this is kind

00:45:49.705 --> 00:45:52.333 align:middle line:84%
of like what we talked about
earlier, a compendium of all

00:45:52.333 --> 00:45:54.460 align:middle line:84%
these weird and
wild technologies.

00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:57.088 align:middle line:84%
But there are cohesive
stories underneath it.

00:45:57.088 --> 00:45:59.674 align:middle line:84%
So now let's get back
to Tesla for a moment.

00:45:59.674 --> 00:46:02.385 align:middle line:90%
This was intriguing to me--

00:46:02.385 --> 00:46:04.929 align:middle line:84%
the invisible Chinese
wall of defense

00:46:04.929 --> 00:46:09.433 align:middle line:90%
around America, a 1934 article.

00:46:09.433 --> 00:46:10.309 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:11.352 align:middle line:90%
>> CHILDRESS: Well right.

00:46:11.352 --> 00:46:15.523 align:middle line:84%
This is what's known as a Tesla
shield, and it's a force field.

00:46:15.523 --> 00:46:20.152 align:middle line:84%
What Tesla was often talking
about were these energy fields.

00:46:20.152 --> 00:46:25.032 align:middle line:84%
And Tesla had this whole
concept of a barrier

00:46:25.032 --> 00:46:27.201 align:middle line:90%
that was an energy barrier.

00:46:27.201 --> 00:46:30.121 align:middle line:84%
And he would surround
a city, or he

00:46:30.121 --> 00:46:33.165 align:middle line:84%
believed he could surround
an entire continent

00:46:33.165 --> 00:46:37.336 align:middle line:84%
with that energy barrier
that was generated

00:46:37.336 --> 00:46:40.464 align:middle line:84%
through these Tesla towers
and things like that,

00:46:40.464 --> 00:46:44.510 align:middle line:84%
almost like an invisible
dome over, say, a city

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:46.554 align:middle line:90%
or over a continent.

00:46:46.554 --> 00:46:52.560 align:middle line:84%
It's thought in that sense
by a number of Tesla experts

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:58.065 align:middle line:10%
that perhaps the Tunguska
fireball in 1909 in Siberia

00:46:58.065 --> 00:47:00.943 align:middle line:10%
was actually created
by Tesla experimenting

00:47:00.943 --> 00:47:03.487 align:middle line:10%
with these high energy blast--

00:47:03.487 --> 00:47:04.739 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Plasma balls, yeah.

00:47:04.739 --> 00:47:05.823 align:middle line:10%
>> CHILDRESS: Yeah, balls.

00:47:05.823 --> 00:47:09.201 align:middle line:84%
And that was something
Marconi allegedly did too.

00:47:09.201 --> 00:47:13.789 align:middle line:84%
Marconi allegedly lit
lights in Australia

00:47:13.789 --> 00:47:18.836 align:middle line:84%
from the Mediterranean by using
the Earth's natural energy grid

00:47:18.836 --> 00:47:24.550 align:middle line:84%
and by, in a sense, shooting
energy around the world

00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:27.928 align:middle line:90%
as a giant energy stream--

00:47:27.928 --> 00:47:32.308 align:middle line:84%
or in Tesla's case,
a fireball, which

00:47:32.308 --> 00:47:34.518 align:middle line:90%
became the Tunguska explosion.

00:47:34.518 --> 00:47:38.773 align:middle line:84%
So these are all
different ideas.

00:47:38.773 --> 00:47:41.358 align:middle line:84%
Part of it too is that
the military itself

00:47:41.358 --> 00:47:44.612 align:middle line:90%
is by nature very secretive.

00:47:44.612 --> 00:47:48.449 align:middle line:84%
And I have a lot of respect
for the American military.

00:47:48.449 --> 00:47:53.037 align:middle line:84%
I was never in the military
myself, but I do admire them.

00:47:53.037 --> 00:47:54.580 align:middle line:90%
They're secretive.

00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:57.374 align:middle line:84%
They have, in my mind,
tremendous technology

00:47:57.374 --> 00:48:01.087 align:middle line:84%
that they are keeping a secret
and not telling us about.

00:48:01.087 --> 00:48:04.882 align:middle line:84%
I believe we're probably
already on the moon with bases.

00:48:04.882 --> 00:48:06.842 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
don't understand

00:48:06.842 --> 00:48:10.513 align:middle line:84%
as well that there are other
space programs in the United

00:48:10.513 --> 00:48:12.765 align:middle line:84%
States besides the
NASA space program.

00:48:12.765 --> 00:48:15.017 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The secret space
program that Gaia features

00:48:15.017 --> 00:48:15.434 align:middle line:90%
heavily.

00:48:15.434 --> 00:48:17.728 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS: OK, right, and
you guys have your things.

00:48:17.728 --> 00:48:20.106 align:middle line:84%
And the Navy has their
own space program.

00:48:20.106 --> 00:48:21.816 align:middle line:84%
The Army has their
own space program.

00:48:21.816 --> 00:48:24.360 align:middle line:84%
They're launching
rockets and space ships,

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:26.195 align:middle line:90%
and they don't tell us right.

00:48:26.195 --> 00:48:29.740 align:middle line:84%
They're doing things
that are not public.

00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:31.992 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:48:31.992 --> 00:48:34.912 align:middle line:84%
Just quickly, I want to go back
to Tesla again in a minute,

00:48:34.912 --> 00:48:36.705 align:middle line:84%
but why does any of
this matter today?

00:48:36.705 --> 00:48:38.749 align:middle line:84%
Because there's
something very real

00:48:38.749 --> 00:48:41.460 align:middle line:84%
that matters if we buy
into this one story.

00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:44.380 align:middle line:90%
But first, quickly, USOs--

00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:47.007 align:middle line:90%
Unidentified Submerged Objects.

00:48:47.007 --> 00:48:48.342 align:middle line:90%
>> CHILDRESS: Right.

00:48:48.342 --> 00:48:50.636 align:middle line:84%
With a lot of these craft,
because they're electric

00:48:50.636 --> 00:48:53.764 align:middle line:84%
and they don't
have exhaust, they

00:48:53.764 --> 00:48:57.059 align:middle line:84%
need very strong
supplies of power.

00:48:57.059 --> 00:49:00.020 align:middle line:84%
They are submarines
and aircraft,

00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:02.314 align:middle line:84%
and this is an
amazing part of them.

00:49:02.314 --> 00:49:06.318 align:middle line:84%
And that was something also of
the Mannas of ancient India.

00:49:06.318 --> 00:49:09.947 align:middle line:84%
They were also to be--
and allegedly, according

00:49:09.947 --> 00:49:12.074 align:middle line:84%
to books on Atlantis
and things like that--

00:49:12.074 --> 00:49:14.660 align:middle line:84%
that yeah, these
craft, they're airships

00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:16.370 align:middle line:90%
and they're submarines.

00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:20.416 align:middle line:84%
So they can dive into the
water, come out of the water,

00:49:20.416 --> 00:49:23.252 align:middle line:90%
fly through the sky.

00:49:23.252 --> 00:49:24.336 align:middle line:90%
They're very versatile.

00:49:24.336 --> 00:49:25.504 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Underwater bases.

00:49:25.504 --> 00:49:26.881 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS: And they have
underwater bases, yeah,

00:49:26.881 --> 00:49:27.673 align:middle line:90%
that's right.

00:49:30.134 --> 00:49:33.345 align:middle line:84%
Bases in Antarctica,
probably underwater.

00:49:33.345 --> 00:49:35.556 align:middle line:84%
And well, they go
into cliff sides.

00:49:35.556 --> 00:49:37.975 align:middle line:84%
And the Germans were
already building all these--

00:49:37.975 --> 00:49:40.644 align:middle line:84%
these u-boat pens
and things like that,

00:49:40.644 --> 00:49:43.272 align:middle line:84%
and their entrances
would be underwater.

00:49:43.272 --> 00:49:46.483 align:middle line:84%
But then they would come
up in these caverns.

00:49:46.483 --> 00:49:49.695 align:middle line:84%
Even in the "Indiana Jones and
the Raiders of the Lost Ark"

00:49:49.695 --> 00:49:52.781 align:middle line:84%
movie, towards the
end of the movie,

00:49:52.781 --> 00:49:56.452 align:middle line:84%
they're in an underground
u-boat pen built by the Nazis

00:49:56.452 --> 00:49:57.286 align:middle line:90%
during the war.

00:50:00.206 --> 00:50:03.918 align:middle line:84%
You know, it seems fantastic
to us, because in my mind,

00:50:03.918 --> 00:50:07.796 align:middle line:84%
the military has done such a
good job of disinformation,

00:50:07.796 --> 00:50:09.131 align:middle line:90%
of having us look the other way.

00:50:09.131 --> 00:50:10.758 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Deflection,
covering up.

00:50:10.758 --> 00:50:11.884 align:middle line:90%
>> CHILDRESS: That's right.

00:50:11.884 --> 00:50:15.095 align:middle line:84%
They promote, in
my mind, all kinds

00:50:15.095 --> 00:50:20.476 align:middle line:84%
of things that deflects
people's view of them.

00:50:20.476 --> 00:50:24.271 align:middle line:84%
And so we're thinking
that the men in black

00:50:24.271 --> 00:50:27.900 align:middle line:84%
are running around because
you've seen an alien ship

00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:29.026 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:50:29.026 --> 00:50:30.402 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, no, indeed.

00:50:30.402 --> 00:50:33.530 align:middle line:84%
But it comes back-- when I
was looking at all of this

00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:35.866 align:middle line:84%
and researching your book
and just kind of trying

00:50:35.866 --> 00:50:38.577 align:middle line:84%
to trickle it down
to why it matters.

00:50:38.577 --> 00:50:42.957 align:middle line:84%
Getting back to the death
ray, getting back to it.

00:50:42.957 --> 00:50:45.501 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to Ed Dames and
other people, "The Killshot,"

00:50:45.501 --> 00:50:46.710 align:middle line:90%
all these things.

00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:49.838 align:middle line:84%
I'd really rather not
go into any of that

00:50:49.838 --> 00:50:51.590 align:middle line:90%
or even give energy to it.

00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:58.555 align:middle line:84%
However, one person I respect
immensely is Dr. Judy Wood.

00:50:58.555 --> 00:50:59.515 align:middle line:90%
I do respect her.

00:50:59.515 --> 00:51:01.141 align:middle line:84%
I love the work she
did in terms of--

00:51:01.141 --> 00:51:03.185 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS: I'm sort of
familiar with her work.

00:51:03.185 --> 00:51:04.353 align:middle line:90%
I don't know her, but, yeah.

00:51:04.353 --> 00:51:06.021 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, "Where
did the Towers Go?"

00:51:06.021 --> 00:51:08.941 align:middle line:84%
She's just a quiet,
dignified woman, teacher--

00:51:08.941 --> 00:51:09.733 align:middle line:90%
you know, Virginia.

00:51:13.487 --> 00:51:16.073 align:middle line:84%
She really did her research
and she showed the evidence

00:51:16.073 --> 00:51:17.283 align:middle line:90%
for all of it.

00:51:17.283 --> 00:51:20.536 align:middle line:84%
And so in the end,
what she said was

00:51:20.536 --> 00:51:25.416 align:middle line:84%
it was a Tesla-type technology
that took those buildings down.

00:51:25.416 --> 00:51:28.127 align:middle line:84%
That's the only thing that
could have turned them to dust.

00:51:28.127 --> 00:51:29.670 align:middle line:84%
But what was even
more interesting

00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:32.423 align:middle line:84%
in her statement
was that she said,

00:51:32.423 --> 00:51:34.466 align:middle line:90%
I'm not looking at who did it.

00:51:34.466 --> 00:51:37.094 align:middle line:84%
I'm not looking at
who did this or why.

00:51:37.094 --> 00:51:38.971 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at the
scientific evidence

00:51:38.971 --> 00:51:40.889 align:middle line:90%
of the technology that did it.

00:51:40.889 --> 00:51:45.019 align:middle line:84%
My question, she said,
is if it can do that,

00:51:45.019 --> 00:51:48.897 align:middle line:84%
what good could that
technology be doing the world--

00:51:48.897 --> 00:51:52.318 align:middle line:84%
to harness it and use it
on behalf of humankind?

00:51:52.318 --> 00:51:54.528 align:middle line:84%
That's where I don't
respect the military.

00:51:54.528 --> 00:51:56.572 align:middle line:84%
I respect that they're
doing these things,

00:51:56.572 --> 00:51:58.240 align:middle line:84%
and I know it's
every kind of person

00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:00.826 align:middle line:84%
under the sun is in the
military-- with the best

00:52:00.826 --> 00:52:02.411 align:middle line:84%
and highest of
intentions, and those

00:52:02.411 --> 00:52:04.246 align:middle line:84%
that are secretive,
cloaked, and don't really

00:52:04.246 --> 00:52:07.249 align:middle line:84%
care about humanity--
both, all, just like us.

00:52:07.249 --> 00:52:11.462 align:middle line:84%
But what about that
lingering question?

00:52:11.462 --> 00:52:15.382 align:middle line:84%
If these foo fighters, if it
was a Tesla technology that

00:52:15.382 --> 00:52:18.344 align:middle line:84%
took the towers
down, her question

00:52:18.344 --> 00:52:20.179 align:middle line:84%
is the most valid in
anything I've heard

00:52:20.179 --> 00:52:21.805 align:middle line:90%
of all these technologies.

00:52:21.805 --> 00:52:25.434 align:middle line:84%
Why are we not using it for
the betterment of our planet

00:52:25.434 --> 00:52:26.310 align:middle line:90%
and humanity?

00:52:26.310 --> 00:52:29.021 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to leave
this subject on that note.

00:52:29.021 --> 00:52:29.938 align:middle line:90%
>> CHILDRESS: OK.

00:52:29.938 --> 00:52:36.028 align:middle line:84%
Well, along those lines, it's
been said by other people

00:52:36.028 --> 00:52:41.658 align:middle line:84%
that the technology that
we get as the public

00:52:41.658 --> 00:52:46.330 align:middle line:84%
is something that the military
has already had for 50 years.

00:52:46.330 --> 00:52:52.711 align:middle line:84%
So whatever we have, whether
it's computers, and Wi-Fi,

00:52:52.711 --> 00:52:55.839 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of things,
the military has had it--

00:52:55.839 --> 00:52:57.091 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Since World War II.

00:52:57.091 --> 00:52:59.426 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS:
Yeah, for 50 years.

00:52:59.426 --> 00:53:04.473 align:middle line:84%
And there's a point where
it gets declassified or just

00:53:04.473 --> 00:53:07.684 align:middle line:90%
slips out into the mainstream.

00:53:07.684 --> 00:53:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And I believe honestly
that the military over time

00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:15.275 align:middle line:84%
does want these
technologies to come out.

00:53:15.275 --> 00:53:18.946 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But they're answering
to someone else, always.

00:53:18.946 --> 00:53:19.738 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:53:19.738 --> 00:53:24.535 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS: Well, and there's
the command control structure.

00:53:24.535 --> 00:53:27.996 align:middle line:84%
One thing that I hear
a lot of from people

00:53:27.996 --> 00:53:34.378 align:middle line:84%
who are skeptic of this is
that I was in the military,

00:53:34.378 --> 00:53:39.216 align:middle line:84%
or I worked for NASA, and
they're not smart enough

00:53:39.216 --> 00:53:40.634 align:middle line:90%
to keep those secrets.

00:53:40.634 --> 00:53:42.594 align:middle line:90%
I was in the Army.

00:53:42.594 --> 00:53:44.638 align:middle line:90%
I would know all these things.

00:53:44.638 --> 00:53:45.973 align:middle line:90%
And that's the thing.

00:53:45.973 --> 00:53:47.975 align:middle line:84%
You're like, no, no,
no, you wouldn't.

00:53:47.975 --> 00:53:49.726 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You wouldn't
know those things.

00:53:49.726 --> 00:53:51.061 align:middle line:90%
>> CHILDRESS: That's right.

00:53:51.061 --> 00:53:55.899 align:middle line:84%
Not even elected officials are
allowed this kind of stuff.

00:53:55.899 --> 00:53:59.111 align:middle line:90%
It is super secret.

00:53:59.111 --> 00:54:02.406 align:middle line:84%
Dick Cheney might be privy
to some of this stuff,

00:54:02.406 --> 00:54:06.201 align:middle line:84%
but it is kept secret
at the highest levels.

00:54:06.201 --> 00:54:08.829 align:middle line:84%
And those levels are beyond
President of the United States.

00:54:08.829 --> 00:54:11.582 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to
show him that stuff.

00:54:11.582 --> 00:54:12.416 align:middle line:90%
They know they can't.

00:54:12.416 --> 00:54:13.917 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And then beyond
that, it takes it into a big

00:54:13.917 --> 00:54:15.335 align:middle line:90%
philosophical debate.

00:54:15.335 --> 00:54:18.172 align:middle line:84%
Is it just that the unwashed,
unintelligent, uninformed

00:54:18.172 --> 00:54:22.050 align:middle line:84%
masses can't handle beautiful
technology that benefits them,

00:54:22.050 --> 00:54:24.761 align:middle line:84%
because maybe one crazed
person will take it and us it

00:54:24.761 --> 00:54:26.472 align:middle line:84%
to their advantage
like we all do

00:54:26.472 --> 00:54:28.682 align:middle line:90%
in our militaries of the world?

00:54:28.682 --> 00:54:30.642 align:middle line:84%
It is a larger
philosophical conversation.

00:54:30.642 --> 00:54:33.604 align:middle line:84%
So I understand that's
kind of a loaded question.

00:54:33.604 --> 00:54:35.981 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS: Just one final
thing I would say about Judy

00:54:35.981 --> 00:54:41.195 align:middle line:84%
Woods and her theories on
that, which I think are good.

00:54:41.195 --> 00:54:45.908 align:middle line:84%
That technology is a
destructive technology.

00:54:45.908 --> 00:54:47.910 align:middle line:84%
She's thinking, well,
this could maybe do good.

00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:49.286 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, what are you
going to use it

00:54:49.286 --> 00:54:54.750 align:middle line:84%
for, to blast cliff faces out
and for mining or something?

00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:57.878 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Her argument was that
it can be modulated and used

00:54:57.878 --> 00:55:00.255 align:middle line:84%
to simply generate
massive amounts of energy.

00:55:00.255 --> 00:55:02.216 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS: Well,
they're doing that already.

00:55:02.216 --> 00:55:05.219 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's the point,
is it could be used to fuel

00:55:05.219 --> 00:55:06.094 align:middle line:90%
cities.

00:55:06.094 --> 00:55:09.806 align:middle line:84%
We could end all of these
wars and conversations.

00:55:09.806 --> 00:55:11.558 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS: We
are moving that way.

00:55:11.558 --> 00:55:15.896 align:middle line:84%
But once again, back to
the whole oil economy.

00:55:15.896 --> 00:55:20.776 align:middle line:84%
Really, since the 1920s,
the world's economy

00:55:20.776 --> 00:55:22.819 align:middle line:90%
is based on oil and gasoline.

00:55:22.819 --> 00:55:24.446 align:middle line:90%
And it still is today.

00:55:24.446 --> 00:55:26.114 align:middle line:90%
It would collapse.

00:55:26.114 --> 00:55:28.617 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Until all those
players are gone and dead,

00:55:28.617 --> 00:55:29.409 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:55:29.409 --> 00:55:31.787 align:middle line:84%
Until the stocks of all
those companies have tanked,

00:55:31.787 --> 00:55:33.330 align:middle line:84%
and they have to
revision themselves

00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:34.623 align:middle line:90%
into healthy technologies.

00:55:34.623 --> 00:55:36.959 align:middle line:84%
>> CHILDRESS: And if shows
like yours that are, I think,

00:55:36.959 --> 00:55:39.628 align:middle line:84%
steadily educating people
and giving them a new idea

00:55:39.628 --> 00:55:41.255 align:middle line:84%
of perhaps how to
think about all this.

00:55:41.255 --> 00:55:43.632 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, I think so,
and work like yours as well.

00:55:43.632 --> 00:55:45.676 align:middle line:84%
And I thank you for
joining us here today.

00:55:45.676 --> 00:55:46.635 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it, David.

00:55:46.635 --> 00:55:49.096 align:middle line:84%
You've been a long time, and
you've published a lot of works

00:55:49.096 --> 00:55:51.306 align:middle line:84%
and given people
a lot to chew on.

00:55:51.306 --> 00:55:52.474 align:middle line:90%
>> CHILDRESS: Thank you.

00:55:52.474 --> 00:55:54.893 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The name of the
book again is "The Anti-gravity

00:55:54.893 --> 00:55:57.104 align:middle line:84%
Files," for anyone who's
interested in the scientific

00:55:57.104 --> 00:55:59.523 align:middle line:84%
trail behind all
of this phenomena.

00:55:59.523 --> 00:56:01.441 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:56:01.441 --> 00:56:03.277 align:middle line:90%
on "Open Minds."

00:56:03.277 --> 00:56:06.321 align:middle line:90%
