00:00:18.848 --> 00:00:21.020 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: Like
many people on this show,

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.240 align:middle line:10%
Suzanne Giesemann was
minding her own business

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.240 align:middle line:10%
as a high-powered navy commander
when life threw her a curveball.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.400 align:middle line:10%
Deeply prone to strategic
and fact-based thinking,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.960 align:middle line:10%
her journey may sound familiar
to the rational and logical

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.220 align:middle line:10%
among us, which I think is all
of us, so let's dig into it.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.660 align:middle line:84%
But before we do, you can see
we have another person here.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.700 align:middle line:84%
Many of you may
know Emilio Ortiz.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.880 align:middle line:84%
He has his own podcast
called Just Tap

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.680 align:middle line:90%
In for the last few years.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.060 align:middle line:90%
A magnificent young man.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.320 align:middle line:84%
He and I are in
amazing resonance.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.940 align:middle line:10%
And we want to do
some things together

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.520 align:middle line:10%
so we decided to bring him in
and then try this little kind

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.470 align:middle line:10%
of fun show experiment today.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.270 align:middle line:10%
Welcome, Emilio.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.560 align:middle line:10%
>> EMILIO ORTIZ: Thank
you for having me.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.250 align:middle line:10%
Super excited.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.417 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It just feels
so natural having you here.

00:01:03.417 --> 00:01:04.990 align:middle line:90%
>> ORTIZ: Yeah, very natural.

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:07.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So, Suzanne, now
you have all of our attention.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And you have a
fascinating story.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.980 align:middle line:84%
I think people love this
story because they can relate

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.820 align:middle line:84%
to the fact that, wow, this
woman had nothing to do with

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.780 align:middle line:84%
the subjects that we're talking
about, mediumship, anything,

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:20.580 align:middle line:90%
quote, "woo woo."

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.642 align:middle line:90%
That was not your gig.

00:01:21.642 --> 00:01:22.600 align:middle line:10%
You were not religious.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.920 align:middle line:10%
You were not spiritual.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.420 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little
bit about your life

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.780 align:middle line:90%
as a commanding naval officer.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.285 align:middle line:84%
And also you're an aide to
the Joint Chiefs of Staff?

00:01:30.285 --> 00:01:31.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you moved
up there, girl.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.660 align:middle line:10%
>> SUZANNE GIESEMANN: I was
the personal assistant asked

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.120 align:middle line:10%
by the chairman of the
Joint Chiefs to be his aide.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.960 align:middle line:10%
He's the head of the whole
United States Armed forces.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.712 align:middle line:10%
He saw my work and he
said, I need a good aide.

00:01:43.712 --> 00:01:44.920 align:middle line:10%
Would you like to be my aide?

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.320 align:middle line:10%
And when he asked me
that, I thought, would I?

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.960 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I knew
what that entailed.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.140 align:middle line:84%
You're right there when he meets
kings and queens and other world

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.680 align:middle line:84%
leaders, you fly around
the world on Air Force One.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was because I was
so left brained and very logical

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:00.810 align:middle line:90%
and very analytical.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, let's talk
a little bit about that.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.930 align:middle line:84%
What's it like flying
on Air Force One?

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll get to the Queen
Elizabeth story in a minute.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.530 align:middle line:84%
>> GIESEMANN: I tell people
it's like the old show Get Smart

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.630 align:middle line:84%
where there are multiple doors
at the beginning of the show

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:12.350 align:middle line:90%
that open.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.308 align:middle line:84%
As you go up the stairs
to get on Air Force One

00:02:14.308 --> 00:02:16.690 align:middle line:84%
and one set of doors opens,
there's another set of doors.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
a conference room,

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.427 align:middle line:84%
and that's where I was with
just the chairman of the Joint

00:02:20.427 --> 00:02:22.610 align:middle line:84%
Chiefs, the Secretary of
Defense and his assistant.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.550 align:middle line:90%
The four of us.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And then the plane
takes off and in

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.610 align:middle line:84%
walks the president
at an angle because--

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which
president are we talking?

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.930 align:middle line:84%
>> GIESEMANN: President
Bush, the younger one.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.143 align:middle line:84%
And it was his first flight
on Air Force One as well.

00:02:33.143 --> 00:02:34.060 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, really?

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.860 align:middle line:90%
>> GIESEMANN: Yeah.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, let's talk
about Queen Elizabeth and what

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.440 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.670 align:middle line:84%
>> GIESEMANN: Well, I was very
excited because my boss had been

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.490 align:middle line:84%
chosen to be knighted
by Queen Elizabeth.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.190 align:middle line:84%
We were three hours
out over the Atlantic,

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.270 align:middle line:84%
and we got a call that a small
plane had flown into the World

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.910 align:middle line:90%
Trade Center towers.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And so we put on the headsets,
and were just witness

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.310 align:middle line:90%
to the reports.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.947 align:middle line:84%
And then I called back to
the Pentagon to our office,

00:02:59.947 --> 00:03:01.030 align:middle line:90%
was speaking to a colonel.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.155 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Suzanne,
something just happened here.

00:03:03.155 --> 00:03:03.970 align:middle line:90%
I have to go.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.977 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, that's
when the jet hit.

00:03:06.977 --> 00:03:09.060 align:middle line:84%
So we turned around, didn't
get to meet the Queen.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you saw
the wreckage afterwards?

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.390 align:middle line:10%
>> GIESEMANN: First we
got back to the Pentagon,

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.490 align:middle line:10%
and the Chairman immediately had
a briefing from his terrorism

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.030 align:middle line:10%
experts and then said, I want
to see the site of the impact.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And we started going through
the center of the building.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.030 align:middle line:84%
The lights are out,
it's filled with smoke.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.450 align:middle line:84%
So we went out into this bright
sunshine around the corner,

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.070 align:middle line:84%
and there's just this
gaping hole in the building,

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.330 align:middle line:84%
the firemen are spraying
it, it's clearly collapsed.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.630 align:middle line:84%
Ambulances lined
up along the curb.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.950 align:middle line:84%
I stepped over jet engine
pieces in the grass.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.190 align:middle line:84%
There was no doubt in my mind
that this had been a jet.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.190 align:middle line:90%
You could identify the blades.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.030 align:middle line:84%
There was a commander,
same rank as I am,

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.290 align:middle line:84%
that was two weeks away from
retirement who was killed.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.790 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't eligible to
retire for two more years,

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:52.970 align:middle line:90%
but I put in my papers.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And on the very day that
I was retirement eligible,

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.730 align:middle line:84%
I retired and the next day
we set off in our sailboat.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you were sailing,
and you were off the Coast

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.110 align:middle line:84%
of Croatia and then another
horrifying thing happened.

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And then from this
point, we're going

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.890 align:middle line:84%
to start talking about how
you became who you are today.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.930 align:middle line:84%
Emilio's going to
jump in a minute.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.850 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
what happened.

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.470 align:middle line:84%
>> GIESEMANN: We were not able
to access email or phone calls

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.649 align:middle line:90%
in 2006.

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:21.850 align:middle line:84%
We got them over a
single sideband radio.

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.310 align:middle line:84%
Really great technology
at the time, but very

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.130 align:middle line:90%
challenging to get emails.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And we got one from my
stepdaughter, Elizabeth, that

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.310 align:middle line:90%
said, you need to call home.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.410 align:middle line:90%
It's important.

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.250 align:middle line:90%
That's all it said.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And I had no psychic
abilities at the time,

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.490 align:middle line:84%
did not suspect
anything was wrong.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.050 align:middle line:84%
But we were on a remote
island, we had no phone,

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.590 align:middle line:84%
so we had to spend a day
getting to the nearest phone.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.350 align:middle line:84%
And my husband
dialed his daughter,

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.470 align:middle line:84%
and my other stepdaughter's
husband answered the phone.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Tye, my husband, was very
pleasant, hey, what's up?

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And my son-in-law
said, nothing good.

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.010 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden I
thought-- well, Susan

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.630 align:middle line:10%
had been six months
pregnant, and I thought, oh,

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.850 align:middle line:10%
she lost the baby.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.970 align:middle line:10%
It was so much worse.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.770 align:middle line:10%
I saw my husband crumple
against the phone booth.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:19.210 align:middle line:10%
And he looked at me and
he said, Susan is gone.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.130 align:middle line:90%
It was incomprehensible.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.290 align:middle line:84%
She was absolutely
the light of his life.

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.445 align:middle line:84%
And so it was the baby
and Susan were gone.

00:05:28.445 --> 00:05:30.570 align:middle line:84%
So we suddenly had to get
back to the United States

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.230 align:middle line:90%
with our dog, leave the boat.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.570 align:middle line:90%
It was a personal nightmare.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.370 align:middle line:84%
9/11 was feeling everybody's
grief but being able to stay

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.590 align:middle line:84%
beyond it, now suddenly we were
immersed in grief of our own.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:48.010 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it's important
to point out that by a stroke

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.507 align:middle line:84%
of whatever, she was literally
struck by lightning and died.

00:05:52.507 --> 00:05:53.340 align:middle line:90%
>> GIESEMANN: Right.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.780 align:middle line:84%
She was struck by lightning
crossing the flight line

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:56.580 align:middle line:90%
at work.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.300 align:middle line:84%
She was a marine sergeant,
another military member.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.700 align:middle line:90%
And it was not even raining.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.400 align:middle line:84%
The bolt of lightning came out
of the blue and struck her.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And this will come
up as very important later on.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.750 align:middle line:90%
So, Emilio, take it from here.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.240 align:middle line:10%
>> ORTIZ: Yeah, it's a
very chilling experience.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.240 align:middle line:10%
And when you went back to go
see her and you saw the body,

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.140 align:middle line:10%
you said, this isn't Susan.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
is that you were reading

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.200 align:middle line:84%
a book about mediumship on the
boat, Crossing the Atlantic,

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.840 align:middle line:84%
and you made this
commitment to yourself,

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to connect with Susan.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And I found a little recipe
of how you started opening up.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And I would love to
hear your take, which

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.860 align:middle line:84%
is what's possible for you and
for people when they connect

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:50.080 align:middle line:84%
with unconditional love,
devotional intention

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.680 align:middle line:84%
and this military grade type
of devotion and discipline

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.440 align:middle line:84%
to be able to open and pierce
the veil to the other side

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.460 align:middle line:84%
and connect with Susan
for the first time.

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.640 align:middle line:84%
>> GIESEMANN: Well, Emilio, you
nailed it right there because it

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.100 align:middle line:84%
was this knowing within me
that she could not be gone.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And I know that it's no
coincidence that I just

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.880 align:middle line:84%
happened to find a book about
mediumship when we sailed

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.140 align:middle line:84%
past the US Navy base in Italy,
and there was a grab bag fill it

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:14.940 align:middle line:90%
with books.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.700 align:middle line:10%
And there's this book by
James Van Praagh, a medium.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.380 align:middle line:84%
I had not studied
mediumship at all.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:20.640 align:middle line:90%
That sounds interesting.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.400 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it
was nonsense when

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.440 align:middle line:84%
I read what he wrote
about a greater reality

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.700 align:middle line:84%
where people are still
living and working.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And I hid the book
from my husband.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:29.820 align:middle line:90%
In fact, I threw it out.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:31.760 align:middle line:84%
James knows this
so I can say that.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.580 align:middle line:84%
Because I didn't want him
seeing me reading this book.

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.680 align:middle line:84%
But now I see that it
opened me to possibilities,

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.940 align:middle line:90%
and that is key.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:42.720 align:middle line:84%
If our minds are not
open, open minds,

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.780 align:middle line:90%
we won't even explore something.

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:48.820 align:middle line:84%
But looking at Susan's body, I
just knew that what James said

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.300 align:middle line:90%
was right that we have to go on.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:52.560 align:middle line:90%
So that's right.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.280 align:middle line:84%
That's where the military
discipline kicked in,

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to connect with
her no matter what it takes.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.220 align:middle line:84%
But today I realize,
after people come up to me

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.380 align:middle line:84%
and they say, yeah,
but you have discipline

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:05.080 align:middle line:84%
and I don't, it's not
so much discipline.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.820 align:middle line:90%
It's commitment.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:10.600 align:middle line:84%
And when your heart knows
something, you commit to it.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And when you love someone with
all your heart and your heart

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.140 align:middle line:84%
and your soul knows
they're still here,

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:19.060 align:middle line:84%
you're just not going to stop
until you make that connection.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And that opens us up
to this connection

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.760 align:middle line:90%
that's available for all of us.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:24.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.740 align:middle line:84%
So let's get into
the-- a little bit

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.700 align:middle line:84%
of the nuts and bolts
of when you first

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.980 align:middle line:84%
started feeling that
transmission where

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.700 align:middle line:84%
you started feeling
the connection that's

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:33.778 align:middle line:90%
called mediumship.

00:08:33.778 --> 00:08:36.159 align:middle line:84%
>> GIESEMANN: I had no idea
it was going to be a medium.

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:38.880 align:middle line:84%
All I wanted to do was
feel Susan's presence,

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.820 align:middle line:90%
to know that she was around.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And Regina, she came to me
a few years ago and told me

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:48.280 align:middle line:84%
she deliberately held
back for three years so

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:52.360 align:middle line:84%
that I would open up to
other people and other beings

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.240 align:middle line:84%
and the greater reality, and
have far more experiences

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.080 align:middle line:84%
with expanded states
of consciousness

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.640 align:middle line:84%
than if I had sensed
her right away.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.560 align:middle line:84%
So it's very
important that people

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.500 align:middle line:84%
understand that there's no
timeline to how long this takes.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.400 align:middle line:84%
It's really what your
soul needs to evolve.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:14.600 align:middle line:84%
But in the process of every day
sitting quietly and shutting out

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.280 align:middle line:84%
the outer world and saying,
Susan, where are you?

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.520 align:middle line:84%
Susan, let me see you, let
me hear you, let me feel you,

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.840 align:middle line:84%
I had adventures that
I never expected.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And started to connect with
guides and get evidence.

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And, happily, I had a
reading with another medium

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.380 align:middle line:84%
and then learned
what's possible,

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.820 align:middle line:84%
learned why getting
evidence is important.

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:39.220 align:middle line:84%
So I started questioning those
who I sensed, prove this to me

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.240 align:middle line:84%
this is who you are,
and it just opened up

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.400 align:middle line:84%
this whole other avenue
that I never expected.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>> ORTIZ: I would love to know,
after those three years when

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:51.250 align:middle line:84%
Susan came to you, what did
she explain to you that she was

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.496 align:middle line:90%
doing on the other side?

00:09:53.496 --> 00:09:55.882 align:middle line:84%
>> GIESEMANN: Wow,
did I even ask you?

00:09:55.882 --> 00:09:57.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Then
you are saying you.

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.750 align:middle line:84%
>> GIESEMANN: Yeah,
because she's right here.

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:00.076 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, I assume.

00:10:00.076 --> 00:10:00.876 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:00.876 --> 00:10:03.390 align:middle line:10%
>> GIESEMANN: She didn't
tell me what she was doing.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:06.210 align:middle line:84%
She just wanted her dad
to know that she was fine.

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:09.010 align:middle line:84%
I was her messenger,
which is what a medium is.

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:10.670 align:middle line:90%
And I could tell she was fine.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:14.330 align:middle line:84%
And now she helps
me, not all the time.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:18.050 align:middle line:84%
But I have never really
asked her what she was doing.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:19.500 align:middle line:90%
She just said just hanging out.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Just hanging
out, waiting for you.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.320 align:middle line:90%
>> ORTIZ: Having a good time.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So this talk
about one of the things--

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:27.250 align:middle line:84%
because people
doubt themselves--

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:31.130 align:middle line:84%
so in this process of
opening up and being

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.850 align:middle line:84%
comfortable with the notion we
might be speaking to entities

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:39.690 align:middle line:84%
beyond ourselves, tell us how
you differentiated between other

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:43.110 align:middle line:84%
and what was your own mind
or your own higher mind.

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:44.740 align:middle line:84%
What was the
differentiating factor?

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.282 align:middle line:84%
>> GIESEMANN: That is the number
one challenge for people who

00:10:47.282 --> 00:10:48.410 align:middle line:90%
connect, am I making it up.

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:49.650 align:middle line:90%
It's twofold.

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:51.710 align:middle line:84%
There's a knowing in
the heart that this

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:54.950 align:middle line:84%
is something beyond
what I call me,

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:59.750 align:middle line:84%
and it's receiving insights
or information that stand out,

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:02.270 align:middle line:84%
that are not what
you expected to hear,

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:05.670 align:middle line:90%
that are helpful, not ordinary.

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:08.450 align:middle line:84%
So you look for
something that, oh,

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:09.980 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't have thought of that.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It has to be apart
from your own thought process.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.890 align:middle line:90%
>> GIESEMANN: Not always.

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:17.330 align:middle line:84%
There are things that we need
to hear that we might think,

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:18.950 align:middle line:90%
but why did it come up now?

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:19.750 align:middle line:90%
So the timing is--

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:20.810 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So timing too.

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:20.956 align:middle line:90%
>> GIESEMANN: Mhm.

00:11:20.956 --> 00:11:22.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK, interesting.

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:26.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, all right, so this
gets us toward something

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:28.870 align:middle line:84%
we both-- we all
love is the story

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:32.430 align:middle line:84%
that really touched your
heart and brought you deeper

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:36.470 align:middle line:84%
into it, which is the story
of a young man named Wolf.

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:37.570 align:middle line:90%
>> ORTIZ: Yeah.

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:40.130 align:middle line:84%
Wolf, I mean, being
also a young man

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:43.530 align:middle line:84%
and he passed in a very
similar way as Susan,

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:48.890 align:middle line:84%
with a bolt of lightning, he was
a very peculiar young man where

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:51.010 align:middle line:84%
he had pictures-- and
maybe we can pull one up--

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:53.750 align:middle line:84%
where he was pointing
at his head and saying,

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:56.090 align:middle line:90%
I was in two worlds at once.

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:58.090 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't shut off the voices.

00:11:58.090 --> 00:11:59.990 align:middle line:84%
He was diagnosed
as schizophrenic.

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
a powerful reframe

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:07.770 align:middle line:84%
to telling how extraordinary
of a being he was

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:12.310 align:middle line:84%
and how can the society just
say you have a mental illness.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:14.890 align:middle line:84%
So what was your
experience like of getting

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:17.570 align:middle line:84%
to know a spirit that
was on the other side,

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:21.180 align:middle line:84%
and also dealing with these
things in the physical realm?

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:24.290 align:middle line:10%
>> GIESEMANN: The importance
of telling Wolf's story is that

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:26.230 align:middle line:10%
of all the souls
I've connected with,

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:29.550 align:middle line:10%
he left for all of
us the most profound,

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:32.510 align:middle line:10%
irrefutable evidence
that we are souls.

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:34.350 align:middle line:84%
This is why we focus
on Wolf's story,

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:37.030 align:middle line:84%
because he knew he would
be struck by lightning.

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:39.550 align:middle line:84%
He left a poem about
it, and he left

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:42.110 align:middle line:84%
a drawing that shows
where it would happen

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:43.990 align:middle line:84%
and what would
happen afterwards.

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And then he came through
to me after connecting me

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:49.350 align:middle line:84%
with his dad and his
stepmom, Mike and Beth.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And dropped in on
me unexpectedly

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:53.690 align:middle line:84%
when there was nobody
to give me feedback--

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:55.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking I'm
reading their mind--

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:58.390 align:middle line:84%
and told me all about
himself, and left out

00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:02.470 align:middle line:84%
a few details that helped me
to unravel this mystery of why

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:03.910 align:middle line:90%
Wolf came back.

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:07.110 align:middle line:84%
To find out, after doing a
reading for his parents, that he

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:10.242 align:middle line:84%
was diagnosed as
mentally ill stunned me

00:13:10.242 --> 00:13:11.450 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the reading.

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:14.038 align:middle line:84%
I remember saying--
well, first of all,

00:13:14.038 --> 00:13:15.830 align:middle line:84%
I was stuttering and
shaking in the reading

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:16.980 align:middle line:90%
because he was so powerful.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:18.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You have
a documentary on him.

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:20.823 align:middle line:84%
And you hear you
doing the reading,

00:13:20.823 --> 00:13:22.240 align:middle line:84%
and you're stuttering
and shaking.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>> GIESEMANN: Yes,
and I'm not a stutter.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you
said it's because soul,

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:28.170 align:middle line:84%
you never encountered
such a powerful soul,

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:29.850 align:middle line:90%
that energy coming through you.

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:31.120 align:middle line:90%
So continue, yeah.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.870 align:middle line:84%
>> GIESEMANN: And so here's this
powerful soul who was so loving.

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly I said, he
just said schizophrenia.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.200 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't make sense.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And his stepmother
said, oh, yeah, he

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.320 align:middle line:90%
was diagnosed schizophrenic.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And it just knocked
me off balance

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.600 align:middle line:90%
because he was so powerful.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's when he said, I
was in two worlds at once.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.660 align:middle line:90%
It was very busy in here.

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And his dad said,
he always said that.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And they have a picture
of him doing that.

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And to your point, Emilio,
that is such a powerful piece

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.720 align:middle line:84%
of this documentary
because we all

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:08.040 align:middle line:84%
know people who are
different, who don't fit in.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And this film is helping
people see them differently,

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.460 align:middle line:90%
to see the souls in all of us.

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:16.400 align:middle line:84%
If we could walk
around and instead

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.960 align:middle line:84%
of saying, oh, they're
weird, oh, they're strange

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:23.900 align:middle line:84%
and push back, say, mm,
but their soul is fine,

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:26.142 align:middle line:84%
let me see if I can
connect with their soul,

00:14:26.142 --> 00:14:27.850 align:middle line:84%
it would be a completely
different world.

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:31.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I want to get deeper
into that topic in a little bit

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:34.760 align:middle line:84%
because so many of the souls
being born now are wired quite

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:35.680 align:middle line:90%
differently.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.460 align:middle line:84%
So we need to get into that,
people on the spectrum who

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.900 align:middle line:84%
appear to be on the
spectrum, who are also

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:42.200 align:middle line:90%
walking in both worlds.

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:46.220 align:middle line:84%
But some of the cool stuff
about Wolf too because this

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.580 align:middle line:84%
brings back your
daughter, the lightning,

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:50.100 align:middle line:90%
being struck by lightning.

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.200 align:middle line:90%
Her little dog was named Thor.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.660 align:middle line:84%
>> GIESEMANN: Yeah,
the God of lightning.

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:56.740 align:middle line:90%
Three dogs, Regina.

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:59.680 align:middle line:84%
I only came to this
awareness a few years ago,

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.740 align:middle line:90%
Thor, the son of Odin.

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:07.000 align:middle line:84%
Loki was her other dog,
which is Odin's son as well.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And the other dog was Athena,
who is also associated

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:11.620 align:middle line:90%
with thunder and lightning.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:12.420 align:middle line:90%
And then she--

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: From
her father, Zeus.

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:14.720 align:middle line:90%
>> GIESEMANN: Yes, yes.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.160 align:middle line:90%
And she was killed by lightning.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.760 align:middle line:84%
That didn't occur to
us until years later.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:19.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And so that's
really what brought

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:23.880 align:middle line:90%
you together is his parents.

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.620 align:middle line:84%
You were at the Edgar
Cayce Institute,

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.240 align:middle line:84%
and you were doing
a lecture there.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And the parents heard you
talk about your daughter being

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:32.720 align:middle line:84%
struck by lightning,
and they just came up.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:33.807 align:middle line:90%
They had to talk to you.

00:15:33.807 --> 00:15:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's how this
whole thing began.

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:36.190 align:middle line:90%
>> GIESEMANN: Yes.

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:39.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's talk a
little bit more about what was

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:43.080 align:middle line:84%
in Wolf's room, his
preparation for this,

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:46.220 align:middle line:84%
the t-shirt he
had on, et cetera.

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:47.563 align:middle line:90%
Just tell us the whole story.

00:15:47.563 --> 00:15:48.980 align:middle line:84%
>> GIESEMANN: It's
a real spoiler,

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:50.190 align:middle line:90%
but there's so much more to it.

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:52.565 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: There's so much
more to it that people can see

00:15:52.565 --> 00:15:55.580 align:middle line:84%
in the documentary, but just
give us a good dose of it now.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>> GIESEMANN: The final poem
that definitely was written

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.300 align:middle line:90%
within two days of his passing--

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:03.520 align:middle line:84%
because his father visited
him just two days prior--

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.160 align:middle line:84%
and always walked
around his apartment

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.160 align:middle line:84%
to see what new
artwork Wolf had put

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.920 align:middle line:84%
on the walls, which were
covered, floor to ceiling,

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.120 align:middle line:90%
with his artwork--

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.780 align:middle line:84%
which was a little
dark, a little odd

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:16.560 align:middle line:90%
but that's who he was--

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:20.500 align:middle line:84%
this poem was not there when
dad visited the apartment.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And the final line
of the poem says,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:29.080 align:middle line:84%
"Time has come for the light
of nature to free my soul."

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:34.100 align:middle line:84%
He tacked that to the wall, set
a chair that wasn't normally

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:37.360 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the
floor, facing that poem

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.860 align:middle line:84%
as if to say, sit
here and read this.

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And then across from the
poem, behind the chair,

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:47.140 align:middle line:84%
he cut out his favorite
t-shirt that he had just

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.940 align:middle line:84%
worn the weekend
before, and put what

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:53.300 align:middle line:84%
was on that t-shirt on the
wall, a bolt of lightning.

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:54.967 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You can't
make this stuff up.

00:16:54.967 --> 00:16:56.133 align:middle line:90%
>> GIESEMANN: No, you can't.

00:16:56.133 --> 00:16:58.580 align:middle line:84%
>> ORTIZ: It was like an art
gallery where he had a chair

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:02.800 align:middle line:84%
specifically where he wanted
people to sit, read the poem.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And in the back he had the
symbology of the lightning.

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And for you, you've had
this thread of lightning

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.940 align:middle line:84%
throughout your whole life,
Susan's passing then Wolf.

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:15.860 align:middle line:84%
Your group, Sanaya,
actually means--

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:17.880 align:middle line:84%
>> GIESEMANN: The name
means flash of lightning.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.803 align:middle line:84%
They gave that to me
without me knowing it.

00:17:19.803 --> 00:17:21.220 align:middle line:84%
But you just
reminded me, when you

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:22.980 align:middle line:84%
talked about the
artwork, what we left out

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:27.440 align:middle line:84%
was there was also a drawing
with his poem that he drew.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:31.810 align:middle line:84%
It's an eye which the saying
goes when your eye is single,

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:33.610 align:middle line:84%
may your entire body
be filled with light.

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:35.402 align:middle line:84%
That's paraphrasing,
of course, but the eye

00:17:35.402 --> 00:17:37.070 align:middle line:90%
is the window of the soul.

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:40.710 align:middle line:84%
In the center, the pupil
is the yin yang symbol.

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:42.670 align:middle line:84%
On the left is a
dreamcatcher, which

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:45.390 align:middle line:84%
is the perfect symbology
for the web of connections

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:47.310 align:middle line:90%
that unites us all.

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:49.190 align:middle line:90%
But on the right--

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:52.950 align:middle line:84%
his parents didn't realize
it until three weeks later--

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:56.890 align:middle line:84%
is the tree where he was
struck, the very tree.

00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:59.630 align:middle line:84%
It's very distinctive
big old birch tree.

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:02.010 align:middle line:84%
But at the base of
it, in his drawing

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:07.390 align:middle line:84%
you can see two roses that his
parents put there in tribute

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:09.830 align:middle line:90%
to him after he was killed.

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And not only
that, when they went in, neat

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:13.490 align:middle line:90%
as a pin.

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:15.130 align:middle line:84%
He didn't normally
live like that.

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:17.450 align:middle line:84%
His bed was made,
dishes were done.

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:19.590 align:middle line:84%
Everything was in
perfect order for them

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:20.882 align:middle line:90%
to come in after his departure.

00:18:20.882 --> 00:18:22.007 align:middle line:90%
>> GIESEMANN: That's right.

00:18:22.007 --> 00:18:23.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Can you imagine--

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:25.550 align:middle line:84%
I can't even imagine
what was going

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:27.830 align:middle line:84%
through his being
that day, knowing

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:29.450 align:middle line:90%
he was going to be taken.

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:30.590 align:middle line:90%
He was going to go home.

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:32.390 align:middle line:84%
>> GIESEMANN: I can tell
you what was in his mind,

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:34.690 align:middle line:84%
because he and Susan have been
so present with me since this

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:35.490 align:middle line:90%
film came out.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:37.330 align:middle line:90%
It's phenomenal for me.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:40.330 align:middle line:84%
He just said what was
going through his mind

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:43.650 align:middle line:84%
was peace and
tranquility, which is

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:47.870 align:middle line:84%
the first line of that poem,
"Spirit of great healer,

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:49.310 align:middle line:90%
awaken within this heart.

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:52.470 align:middle line:84%
Peace and tranquility
flow like water."

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And I never asked
him the question

00:18:54.030 --> 00:19:00.180 align:middle line:84%
but he says he was peaceful
and tranquil and on a mission.

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:04.970 align:middle line:84%
>> GIESEMANN: In one of the
other drawings in his room,

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:08.810 align:middle line:84%
there was a poem that read, "I
long to be freed of the chains

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:11.170 align:middle line:90%
that hold my heart captive."

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most potent
teachings that he left behind

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:17.010 align:middle line:84%
was that we're far too
anchored in our head

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:18.610 align:middle line:90%
and not enough in our heart.

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And you've said that Wolf
stands for the freedom

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:24.370 align:middle line:84%
from being a prisoner
to our heads,

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:26.570 align:middle line:84%
and that freedom
leads to balance.

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And the result of that balance
is peace and tranquility.

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:34.670 align:middle line:84%
So what happens when a species
moves into that balance

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:37.128 align:middle line:84%
and invokes that
energy of the heart?

00:19:37.128 --> 00:19:39.170 align:middle line:84%
>> GIESEMANN: That's what
we're here to find out.

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:40.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:41.010 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:43.510 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, all the people
that talk about him

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:45.470 align:middle line:90%
just say he was pure heart.

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:47.630 align:middle line:90%
He was just-- he was love.

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:48.430 align:middle line:90%
He was love.

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:51.482 align:middle line:84%
So I think he was
an angel, right?

00:19:51.482 --> 00:19:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And so, yet, like many angels
are here on Earth misunderstood,

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:58.950 align:middle line:90%
very hard to walk on this Earth.

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:03.670 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Linda Backman talks about
this a great deal in the souls

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:06.550 align:middle line:84%
that she sees in her
hypnotherapy practice,

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:09.370 align:middle line:84%
that you have IP souls,
interplanetary souls,

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:11.770 align:middle line:84%
you have Earth-based souls,
the majority of people.

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And then you have angelic souls,
and they have a really hard time

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:16.190 align:middle line:90%
integrating here.

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And I think oftentimes they're
the ones that are labeled.

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:20.990 align:middle line:90%
So can you talk about other--

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:22.990 align:middle line:84%
not just Wolf, but
other clients that

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:26.563 align:middle line:84%
are coming to you with
these same issues of finding

00:20:26.563 --> 00:20:28.730 align:middle line:84%
it very difficult to walk
the Earth but they're here

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:29.530 align:middle line:90%
for purpose.

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:32.050 align:middle line:84%
They're here to show and
to share something with us.

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>> GIESEMANN: My clients come
to hear from their loved ones

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:35.410 align:middle line:90%
across the veil.

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:36.210 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But some of
them must be these beings.

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:41.490 align:middle line:84%
>> GIESEMANN: Often I have
folks across the veil who had

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:44.010 align:middle line:84%
disabilities and
their loved ones say,

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:46.590 align:middle line:84%
why would they choose to
be in a body like that?

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's very clear
when you talk to them

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:51.330 align:middle line:90%
because their souls chose that.

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:55.010 align:middle line:10%
And that provided their
family an opportunity

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:59.570 align:middle line:10%
to learn patience and
unconditional love, compassion.

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:03.570 align:middle line:84%
It gives caregivers
someone to serve.

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:05.610 align:middle line:84%
There's purpose in
everything, even

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:10.930 align:middle line:84%
though we see it as a
disability or a mental illness.

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:12.930 align:middle line:84%
If everybody could
just understand

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:16.910 align:middle line:84%
that our souls are already
whole and perfectly fine,

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:20.650 align:middle line:84%
that we are divine already, we
didn't come here to be perfect.

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:22.830 align:middle line:84%
This is part of the
beauty of Wolf's message.

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:27.620 align:middle line:84%
You really summarize the message
that he came back to make sure

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:29.780 align:middle line:90%
we understood very well.

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:35.060 align:middle line:84%
We may never be perfect here,
but let's find that divinity

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:37.710 align:middle line:90%
and enjoy it together.

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And yet you see
homeless encampments and you

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:43.160 align:middle line:84%
have mental illness,
you have drug addiction,

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:47.880 align:middle line:84%
but you also have people who are
actually simply in Wolf's state.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:51.380 align:middle line:84%
They're walking in both worlds,
they're talking to other beings.

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:53.730 align:middle line:84%
I've thought about this
for many, many years like,

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:55.320 align:middle line:84%
you don't know who
that person is.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.540 align:middle line:84%
They may seem insane
to you, but they may be

00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:01.217 align:middle line:90%
talking with their own guides.

00:22:01.217 --> 00:22:02.800 align:middle line:84%
>> GIESEMANN: And
that's where we met.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.452 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned Edgar
Cayce's association

00:22:04.452 --> 00:22:06.660 align:middle line:84%
for research and enlightenment,
and I love this quote

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:10.760 align:middle line:84%
by Edgar Cayce where somebody
said to him, Mr. Cayce,

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.300 align:middle line:90%
am I mentally ill?

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And he replied, madam, everyone
is mentally ill to someone else.

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:19.330 align:middle line:90%
>> ORTIZ: It's relative.

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>> GIESEMANN: It's all relative.

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:22.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We're all in our
different realities or siloed

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:26.020 align:middle line:84%
into our own one of 8 billion
different realities, which--

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:26.820 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:29.560 align:middle line:84%
Anything else from other
clients along that line

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.360 align:middle line:84%
that you would like
to share at this time

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:34.320 align:middle line:84%
that you're hearing from the
other side about a opening?

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And going back to what
Emilio was talking about,

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:42.040 align:middle line:84%
huge, this need for humanity to
start merging with and living

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:42.840 align:middle line:90%
through the heart.

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:44.600 align:middle line:90%
>> GIESEMANN: It is huge.

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:48.580 align:middle line:84%
Especially as we go more towards
technology and relying on that,

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:50.460 align:middle line:90%
we're not listening within.

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:55.880 align:middle line:10%
We're not realizing there
is a divine intelligence.

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.600 align:middle line:10%
Even though artificial
intelligence

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.880 align:middle line:10%
is incredibly wise and
powerful, what's missing

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:04.940 align:middle line:10%
is the personal aspect that
we can find by going within.

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:08.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm not personally seeing
those people across the soul.

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:10.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm mostly connecting with
regular people's loved ones

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.820 align:middle line:90%
when I do mediumship.

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:13.880 align:middle line:84%
But that is just such
a small part of my work

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:17.200 align:middle line:84%
because, really,
it's, to me, what

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.820 align:middle line:90%
is the message of mediumship.

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:21.340 align:middle line:84%
The fact that we can connect
to people's loved ones

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:24.360 align:middle line:84%
tells us there's
something so much greater.

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:26.420 align:middle line:84%
So that's why my
main work is helping

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:30.060 align:middle line:84%
people live, as you know,
what I call the awakened way.

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:32.500 align:middle line:84%
That's available for all
of us, whether or not

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.580 align:middle line:84%
you connect to loved
ones across the veil,

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:38.540 align:middle line:84%
to live in awareness that
our souls here and now.

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:42.980 align:middle line:84%
That we are all connected,
that love is what connects us,

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:44.210 align:middle line:90%
that will change your life.

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:47.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So Lee Harrison, who
has the group the Z's, he and I

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:50.680 align:middle line:84%
did a book together that came
out recently called The Future

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:51.480 align:middle line:90%
Human.

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:55.120 align:middle line:84%
The point being that the most
dominant message in the book,

00:23:55.120 --> 00:24:00.440 align:middle line:84%
in my opinion, was that the Z's
kept saying, you as a species

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:04.420 align:middle line:84%
are remarkable in nature, living
in this dense third dimensional

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:07.580 align:middle line:90%
reality with gravity and time.

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:09.940 align:middle line:90%
In that you're now going to be--

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:12.980 align:middle line:84%
your future version of self,
which is already beginning,

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:15.180 align:middle line:84%
is going to be running
our intelligence

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:17.300 align:middle line:90%
and mind through the heart.

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:18.100 align:middle line:90%
>> GIESEMANN: Yeah.

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so I think
Wolf was really living in that

00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:24.440 align:middle line:84%
unfiltered place with his
intelligence running through his

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.240 align:middle line:90%
heart.

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.650 align:middle line:10%
>> ORTIZ: Well, you say that
Wolf was very unfiltered,

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:30.710 align:middle line:10%
and there are more beings
coming around that are very open

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:35.030 align:middle line:10%
hearted, but along the way
sometimes we create those chains

00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:36.470 align:middle line:10%
around our heart.

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And I would love
to know what have

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:40.547 align:middle line:84%
you found is those
ways to release

00:24:40.547 --> 00:24:42.630 align:middle line:84%
the chains around our
heart, to be able to connect

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:43.920 align:middle line:90%
with this greater reality?

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>> GIESEMANN: We need to
dampen the left hemisphere

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:49.870 align:middle line:90%
of the brain's activity.

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And meditation or
practices and mindfulness

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:54.790 align:middle line:84%
do that, they dampen
the left hemisphere

00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:57.010 align:middle line:84%
and activate the
right hemisphere.

00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:59.270 align:middle line:84%
So that drawing with
the yin and yang symbol

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:01.710 align:middle line:84%
was perfect for talking
about the balance.

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And in my military
career, very left brain.

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And the meditation
that I did daily,

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:10.030 align:middle line:84%
trying to connect with
Susan, did exactly

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:13.130 align:middle line:84%
that, it brought that
right brain back online.

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:15.750 align:middle line:84%
It brought me into
a state of balance,

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:17.650 align:middle line:90%
and now I can feel the heart.

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:19.710 align:middle line:90%
So they all work together.

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:23.050 align:middle line:84%
So any practice where you
shut out the outer world

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:28.170 align:middle line:84%
and just become silent and
listen and watch your thoughts

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:30.330 align:middle line:84%
for just a few
minutes a day is going

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:33.290 align:middle line:84%
to make a huge difference
in repatterning

00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:36.275 align:middle line:84%
those neural pathways
that keep us stuck.

00:25:36.275 --> 00:25:37.650 align:middle line:84%
It's actually very
simple, but it

00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:40.020 align:middle line:84%
does take that commitment
we talked about earlier.

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:42.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: A lot of people
feel a little bit lost

00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:44.430 align:middle line:84%
because of the notion
of that's like, oh,

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:46.730 align:middle line:84%
if you just be in
love, stay in love.

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:49.310 align:middle line:90%
That's too abstract, honestly.

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:51.290 align:middle line:84%
There are too many
interpretations

00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:52.770 align:middle line:90%
of what love means.

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's why what
you're talking about

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:57.060 align:middle line:84%
is wholly different
from just be in love.

00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>> GIESEMANN: As my
guides have shown me,

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:01.590 align:middle line:90%
love is lack of separation.

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:03.370 align:middle line:84%
We know that as romantic
love because when

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:05.550 align:middle line:84%
you're in love with somebody,
you're just so alive.

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:07.570 align:middle line:84%
There's no separation
until you start

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:10.190 align:middle line:84%
to notice those little
things and then you--

00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:11.390 align:middle line:90%
the problems arise.

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:14.630 align:middle line:10%
But when you sit quietly and
shut out the outer world,

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:17.930 align:middle line:10%
you touch that place where
everything is connected.

00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:23.110 align:middle line:84%
You go to that place beyond the
stories, beyond me versus you,

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:27.270 align:middle line:84%
and then you come to know
that that's in everybody.

00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And then you can project,
well, if that's in me

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:32.270 align:middle line:84%
and that's in
everybody, if I can go

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:34.350 align:middle line:90%
to that place, that's namaste.

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:37.790 align:middle line:84%
When I'm in that place in me
and you're in that place in you,

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:39.150 align:middle line:90%
we are one.

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:43.190 align:middle line:84%
So that sounds woo woo but to
have the personal experience

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:49.230 align:middle line:84%
of no story, total
connectedness, that's

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:50.950 align:middle line:90%
divine love.

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:53.930 align:middle line:84%
That's what will
change the world.

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:57.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now, imagine
that you're you now,

00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:00.430 align:middle line:84%
understanding life as
you understand it now,

00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:04.110 align:middle line:84%
and you're back in the military
with the Joint Chiefs of Staff

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:05.190 align:middle line:90%
as an aide.

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And you're watching
how things play out

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:12.390 align:middle line:84%
in the war room, et cetera,
coming from the heart.

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Because our future is
going from the heart,

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:17.150 align:middle line:84%
what happens to things
like the military?

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:23.370 align:middle line:84%
>> GIESEMANN: The challenge
is that until people beyond

00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:27.770 align:middle line:84%
our tribe also awaken, we're
still going to be in this us

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:30.330 align:middle line:90%
versus them mentality.

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:34.570 align:middle line:84%
So there's this reality
that people may attack us,

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:37.890 align:middle line:84%
and love will not
stop and attack.

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:41.890 align:middle line:10%
This is a very slow process of
bringing people to the awareness

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:46.770 align:middle line:10%
that there is a better way, that
we need to try to see things

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:51.530 align:middle line:10%
from other people's perspective,
experience why they are coming

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:53.650 align:middle line:10%
from that place.

00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:55.410 align:middle line:90%
What is the better way?

00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:58.750 align:middle line:84%
That's where I would be if I had
known what I know now back then.

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:00.270 align:middle line:84%
What's a better
way of seeing this?

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:01.310 align:middle line:90%
How can we reframe it?

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:02.930 align:middle line:84%
But it's very
challenging when you

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:06.130 align:middle line:84%
have both the human story
and the soul's awareness

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:07.230 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:10.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I would imagine we
would have completely different

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:13.700 align:middle line:84%
outcomes if we have someone
like you sitting in the room

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:15.380 align:middle line:90%
in a strategic meeting.

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:17.573 align:middle line:84%
How do we approach
this situation?

00:28:17.573 --> 00:28:19.240 align:middle line:84%
And there's no room
for that now, right?

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.700 align:middle line:84%
>> GIESEMANN:
There's no room, no.

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:23.260 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting
because I just

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:25.060 align:middle line:84%
had an experience the
other day of somebody

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:26.840 align:middle line:84%
sent me-- we call
them in the Navy

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:31.120 align:middle line:84%
a nastygram, an email
that was very nasty to me.

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And luckily I can only think of
five of these over the years.

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And immediately
you go like this,

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.040 align:middle line:84%
but I've learned that
the ego does this

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:41.560 align:middle line:90%
but the soul has no defenses.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And instead of deleting it,
I just wrote, I hear you.

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:47.740 align:middle line:10%
I appreciate what you say.

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:53.180 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps if you understood that
this is why this happened,

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:55.620 align:middle line:90%
but may I offer you this?

00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:57.420 align:middle line:84%
Just like every
other time I've done

00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:01.360 align:middle line:84%
that, the person comes back with
capital letters, I'm so sorry.

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.180 align:middle line:90%
I was so nasty.

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:05.120 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh, you heard me.

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.260 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine if we
brought that energy

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:13.340 align:middle line:84%
into war rooms or boardrooms or
family living rooms, I hear you.

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:15.580 align:middle line:84%
Let me see from
your perspective.

00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:17.040 align:middle line:90%
Can you see from mine?

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:20.340 align:middle line:84%
With no defensiveness,
that's what's missing.

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:24.640 align:middle line:84%
We're in our human mode, and
the brain, the left brain

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:27.720 align:middle line:90%
is wired for self-defense.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:31.650 align:middle line:84%
So when you live with that
right brain balance more,

00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:34.400 align:middle line:84%
you automatically
go to alternatives

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:36.600 align:middle line:84%
but are still aware
of the human mode.

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:40.080 align:middle line:84%
>> ORTIZ: And beyond your
response to those emails,

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.800 align:middle line:84%
you also have one of your
favorite phrases which is,

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.340 align:middle line:90%
isn't that interesting?

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>> GIESEMANN: Oh yeah, that's
the first response always.

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:50.460 align:middle line:84%
You look at that email and,
[GASPS] isn't that interesting?

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:52.710 align:middle line:84%
That takes you
immediately to neutral.

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:55.260 align:middle line:84%
>> ORTIZ: Yeah, it puts you
into the observer mindset.

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.060 align:middle line:90%
>> GIESEMANN: Yeah.

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:58.483 align:middle line:84%
We have people with t-shirts
on it now that say, isn't--

00:29:58.483 --> 00:29:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Isn't
that interesting?

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Interesting is an
interesting word.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And so we, from
the ground up, are

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:09.120 align:middle line:84%
starting to understand the
need to inculcate intelligence

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:11.600 align:middle line:84%
into the heart and
operate through that,

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.660 align:middle line:84%
so it's going to be
a ground-up thing.

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:16.640 align:middle line:84%
They're the last-- they'll
be the last to get it, right?

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.960 align:middle line:84%
>> GIESEMANN: That's why I'm so
pleased that Wolf's messages,

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:24.300 align:middle line:84%
the film and my book, is gaining
traction because people watch it

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:25.820 align:middle line:90%
and it speaks to the heart.

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.660 align:middle line:84%
There's a transmission
in there that people

00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:30.860 align:middle line:84%
can't not listen and
feel the emotion,

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:33.820 align:middle line:90%
and it makes them think.

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:36.590 align:middle line:84%
So we're balancing thinking
with the heart all of a sudden,

00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:37.590 align:middle line:90%
and it shifts something.

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:38.465 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh it did.

00:30:38.465 --> 00:30:41.580 align:middle line:84%
I watched it this morning before
coming in here to the studio,

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:43.800 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't pull myself out.

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.460 align:middle line:84%
I was in that energy,
and it took a while

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:48.900 align:middle line:84%
to find my way back out of it
so I could sit here and chat

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:50.820 align:middle line:90%
with both of you.

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:53.593 align:middle line:84%
So I really encourage
people to watch it.

00:30:53.593 --> 00:30:55.980 align:middle line:84%
It's not just touching,
it's very empowering.

00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:58.800 align:middle line:84%
>> ORTIZ: He actually left a
whole scavenger hunt for you.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:30:59.600 align:middle line:90%
>> GIESEMANN: Yeah.

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.400 align:middle line:84%
>> ORTIZ: And I'm
curious to know,

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:04.460 align:middle line:84%
is there a mystery that
Wolf left behind that you

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:06.200 align:middle line:90%
haven't been able to solve yet?

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:09.160 align:middle line:84%
>> GIESEMANN: I don't know
but there was one that I

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:13.560 align:middle line:84%
didn't realize was unsolved that
became apparent when the film

00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:14.440 align:middle line:90%
came out.

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:17.560 align:middle line:84%
Our Director, Jim
Spruell, found an ending

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:19.580 align:middle line:84%
to this film that's
different from my book

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:21.800 align:middle line:84%
because it hadn't happened
when I wrote the book.

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:24.997 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with the fact
that Wolf's stepmother, Beth, is

00:31:24.997 --> 00:31:27.080 align:middle line:84%
going through a tremendous
challenge with leukemia

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:29.610 align:middle line:84%
right now and facing
her own death.

00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:30.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:32.680 align:middle line:84%
>> GIESEMANN: But I didn't
realize that if you watch

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:34.860 align:middle line:84%
the film, there was
a book that moved.

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:36.740 align:middle line:90%
I saw it move on the bookshelf.

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:38.700 align:middle line:84%
Other people might say
it was a hallucination,

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:41.080 align:middle line:84%
but that book said
to me, by moving,

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:42.500 align:middle line:90%
you're supposed to buy this.

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And there's a funny part in the
movie where it solved a mystery

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.140 align:middle line:90%
from his original visit.

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:50.680 align:middle line:10%
But there was another thing
in the book, a winged creature

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:53.220 align:middle line:10%
that when I read the book
and looked at the picture,

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:54.380 align:middle line:10%
Wolf dropped in on me.

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:57.880 align:middle line:10%
It's in my book, Wolf's Message,
where I say, Wolf is here.

00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:59.640 align:middle line:10%
I wrote to his dad
and said, he tells me

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.620 align:middle line:10%
he has a picture of
this winged creature.

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:02.680 align:middle line:10%
Send it to me.

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:03.740 align:middle line:90%
There was no question.

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:06.670 align:middle line:84%
I didn't say, Mike, did he draw
a winged creature like this?

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:07.470 align:middle line:90%
Wolf was here.

00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:09.310 align:middle line:84%
He said, have my
dad send you this.

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:11.310 align:middle line:90%
Mike sent me Wolf's drawing.

00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:13.850 align:middle line:84%
It's identical to
what's in the book.

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:15.690 align:middle line:90%
So, wow, that's really cool.

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:17.170 align:middle line:90%
But why?

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:18.150 align:middle line:90%
That was the point.

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:20.090 align:middle line:90%
That was the mystery.

00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:22.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, that figure,
according to the book,

00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:25.090 align:middle line:84%
was called a chimera
where you cross

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:28.970 align:middle line:84%
a DNA of an animal with
a human being, a chimera.

00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:31.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, just a few months
ago, Beth, Will's stepmother

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:33.210 align:middle line:84%
who's going through
cancer treatment

00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:36.570 align:middle line:84%
and had a stem cell
transplant, texted me.

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:39.290 align:middle line:84%
And she said, my
test results are in.

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:43.510 align:middle line:84%
The donor's DNA is 100%
accepted by my body.

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:46.560 align:middle line:90%
The chimerism test proved it.

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:47.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wow.

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:51.970 align:middle line:84%
>> GIESEMANN: And I gasped
because I saw this is a soul

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:53.190 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:58.610 align:middle line:84%
Beth's soul agreed to
take on this illness

00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:02.770 align:middle line:84%
because the final bits of
the movie are so touching.

00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And the message that
we couldn't have

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:08.030 align:middle line:84%
told if somebody had produced
this even five years earlier was

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:12.210 align:middle line:84%
it takes away the fear
of death to know this,

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:14.510 align:middle line:90%
that we are eternal souls.

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And now I know why he
drew me to this chimera

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:21.515 align:middle line:84%
back then, because just
you put the dots together.

00:33:21.515 --> 00:33:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --things to
reveal themselves sometimes.

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:24.840 align:middle line:84%
>> GIESEMANN: There's
no time across the veil.

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:27.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Treasure hunts
like that can take a lifetime.

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:28.180 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>> GIESEMANN: It's fun
to connect the dots.

00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:33.350 align:middle line:84%
But to connect that one
and say, Jim Spruell

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:36.070 align:middle line:84%
knew to put that in there
because his soul and his son

00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:40.280 align:middle line:84%
across the veil guided him to
do that, it was perfection.

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:43.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So we touched on but
didn't go into the soul group

00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:46.790 align:middle line:84%
that you talk with, Sanaya, so
let's talk about them a little

00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:48.610 align:middle line:90%
bit, what you do with them.

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And right now is a
good time to start

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:54.070 align:middle line:84%
sharing some of their messages
that come through repeatedly

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:55.960 align:middle line:84%
for humanity at
this point in time.

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.810 align:middle line:10%
>> GIESEMANN: Sanaya came to
me on my birthday in 2010.

00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:01.370 align:middle line:84%
In the film I say cool things
have happened on my birthday.

00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And one of them I
didn't reveal is

00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:05.670 align:middle line:84%
my guide, Sanaya, revealed
themselves to me on my birthday.

00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:07.310 align:middle line:90%
A very powerful group.

00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:08.810 align:middle line:90%
I said, who are you?

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:12.010 align:middle line:84%
They said, we are a collective
consciousness of your guides.

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And you will write and
write and write as us.

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:17.270 align:middle line:84%
But I did not expect to
also be speaking as them.

00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:19.690 align:middle line:84%
It was very awkward
for this navy commander

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:23.270 align:middle line:84%
to start channeling for a small
group, and now for large groups.

00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:25.010 align:middle line:84%
I've channeled for
up to 500 people.

00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And had a great conversation
with Lee Harris on my podcast

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:29.750 align:middle line:84%
recently about the
book you did with him.

00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And it was fun to have
two channelers talking

00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:36.090 align:middle line:84%
together and comparing stories
and very, very similar.

00:34:36.090 --> 00:34:38.469 align:middle line:84%
It's a little awkward,
but you can't not do it.

00:34:38.469 --> 00:34:41.330 align:middle line:84%
We've had physical healings
from people in attendance

00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:44.010 align:middle line:84%
when the guides come through
because the energy is

00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:45.010 align:middle line:90%
so powerful.

00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:46.469 align:middle line:84%
And they're talking
through me now.

00:34:46.469 --> 00:34:51.010 align:middle line:84%
I always hook into them before
I do an interview because they

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:53.250 align:middle line:84%
have the bigger picture,
and their answers

00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:56.237 align:middle line:84%
are going to be much wiser than
anything I could come up with.

00:34:56.237 --> 00:34:58.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what are some
specifics they're telling us

00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:02.260 align:middle line:84%
now, as humanity, that we need
to start really keying into?

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:05.790 align:middle line:84%
>> GIESEMANN: They
say to watch the fear,

00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:10.170 align:middle line:84%
that these times really are not
that much worse than they were

00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:10.970 align:middle line:90%
in the past.

00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:13.030 align:middle line:84%
It only seems that
way, especially

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:15.930 align:middle line:84%
because the media is
putting it in our face.

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And we are falling right into
the trap of giving that more

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:25.030 align:middle line:84%
intention than the underlying
things, the slower things

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:27.510 align:middle line:84%
that we need to be
paying attention to.

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:29.490 align:middle line:90%
How are we treating each other?

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:33.070 align:middle line:84%
Why are we allowing people
to mistreat each other

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:36.770 align:middle line:84%
and violence that we
just take for granted,

00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:40.730 align:middle line:84%
and violent movies
and poor food choices,

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:44.710 align:middle line:84%
everything that leads to
illness and the underlying

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:49.070 align:middle line:84%
causes for the big change,
things that make the news.

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:53.350 align:middle line:84%
So they're saying, watch
the fear, be present now.

00:35:53.350 --> 00:35:55.790 align:middle line:84%
Listen to the
guidance within and

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:59.752 align:middle line:84%
flow, which is Wolf
spelled out backwards.

00:35:59.752 --> 00:36:01.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
right, the flow.

00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:01.980 align:middle line:90%
>> ORTIZ: OK.

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:02.780 align:middle line:90%
>> GIESEMANN: Yeah.

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:06.520 align:middle line:84%
>> ORTIZ: I think a lot of it is
we ignore that there's this true

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:09.460 align:middle line:84%
self that you say is
not just the spirit,

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:13.200 align:middle line:84%
it's not just the physical,
but it's a merge between both.

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:15.320 align:middle line:84%
Instead of just knowing
that intellectually

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:20.440 align:middle line:84%
that we have a true self, how
do you live in daily harmony

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:21.590 align:middle line:90%
with your true self?

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:23.340 align:middle line:84%
>> GIESEMANN: In my
book The Awakened Way,

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:25.760 align:middle line:84%
I talk about having
a miracle mindset.

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.280 align:middle line:84%
We really need to come to know
that this true self is not

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:30.060 align:middle line:90%
just a concept we talk about.

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:33.400 align:middle line:84%
It really is the source
of all these wonders.

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:35.760 align:middle line:90%
So you can sit quietly and say--

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:41.400 align:middle line:84%
I literally say bring on
the miracles, bring it on.

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And that has to come
from the deepest place

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:46.160 align:middle line:90%
where anything is possible.

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.940 align:middle line:90%
And it will happen.

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:49.800 align:middle line:90%
Miracles become the norm.

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to say,
well, how did that happen?

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:54.680 align:middle line:90%
How did you explain that?

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:58.980 align:middle line:10%
So ask to have what I call
NOEs, no other explanation

00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:02.420 align:middle line:10%
moments, and then,
hopefully, by grace, you'll

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:05.880 align:middle line:10%
have this moment where
you say there is a God,

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:07.820 align:middle line:10%
but it's not some being.

00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:14.740 align:middle line:84%
It's this being itself that
just has to create miracles

00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:16.460 align:middle line:90%
to get our attention.

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:20.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's a process of changing
your whole understanding of what

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:26.500 align:middle line:84%
God is to it's this bigger
self that's breathing us.

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:27.840 align:middle line:90%
See, I never talked like this.

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:29.980 align:middle line:84%
I never had that
realization when I first

00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:30.923 align:middle line:90%
started as a medium.

00:37:30.923 --> 00:37:32.340 align:middle line:84%
For me it was just
let me show you

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:34.460 align:middle line:84%
your loved ones
haven't really died.

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:38.860 align:middle line:84%
But it has opened up
this sacred awareness

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:43.686 align:middle line:84%
of what is the true self
that's called self-realization.

00:37:43.686 --> 00:37:47.423 align:middle line:84%
To share that with other people,
to see other people get it,

00:37:47.423 --> 00:37:48.840 align:middle line:84%
when people come
up to me and say,

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:54.860 align:middle line:84%
your work has changed my life,
that's what it's all about.

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:57.020 align:middle line:90%
I do a monthly gathering.

00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:58.740 align:middle line:84%
We call it the
monthly connection.

00:37:58.740 --> 00:37:59.540 align:middle line:90%
It's a webinar.

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:02.360 align:middle line:84%
Every month I have two
hours full of new teaching

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:05.760 align:middle line:84%
from the guides, and I
refuse to go to scary fear

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:07.520 align:middle line:90%
on my subject lines.

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:09.195 align:middle line:90%
And so we have a normal number.

00:38:09.195 --> 00:38:10.820 align:middle line:84%
That's a very nice
number that attends.

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:12.880 align:middle line:90%
We have a beautiful community.

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.180 align:middle line:90%
Anybody can attend.

00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:17.080 align:middle line:84%
But when something
bad happens to me

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:20.020 align:middle line:84%
and I truthfully put it in
the subject line, oh my gosh,

00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:21.720 align:middle line:90%
the numbers are off the chart.

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:24.560 align:middle line:84%
So, oh, my husband almost
died, oh my God, did we get

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:26.100 align:middle line:90%
the numbers?

00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:27.820 align:middle line:90%
But it was true.

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:31.453 align:middle line:84%
So it's very challenging
to not succumb to that.

00:38:31.453 --> 00:38:32.620 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh my God, it is.

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:33.537 align:middle line:90%
>> GIESEMANN: I don't.

00:38:33.537 --> 00:38:36.400 align:middle line:90%
And I hope I won't.

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:40.260 align:middle line:84%
If people are drawn
to this, they'll come.

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:43.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We've had--
privately had this conversation

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:46.040 align:middle line:84%
because you have a
podcast, I have a podcast.

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like you, it's not
doing the scary headlines,

00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:52.260 align:middle line:90%
the clickbait.

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:53.820 align:middle line:90%
I just don't want to do it.

00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:57.300 align:middle line:84%
How can you make it intriguing
and powerful without fear?

00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:59.400 align:middle line:84%
That's an art form,
and it's hard to do.

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And I know you've had to
struggle with that too.

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:03.500 align:middle line:90%
Final question, final thoughts.

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:07.073 align:middle line:84%
>> ORTIZ: I would love to just
bring to the surface again,

00:39:07.073 --> 00:39:11.340 align:middle line:84%
Wolf is symbolic as well,
like the animal totem.

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:15.420 align:middle line:84%
And you say that the wolf comes
when we most need guidance.

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:17.280 align:middle line:84%
So for people
tuning in right now,

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:20.097 align:middle line:84%
why do you feel the wolf is
coming to the surface right now?

00:39:20.097 --> 00:39:22.180 align:middle line:84%
>> GIESEMANN: I got the
goosebumps as you say that

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:24.000 align:middle line:84%
because I wrote the
book 12 years ago,

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.360 align:middle line:90%
and it's still relevant.

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:27.860 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think
masses of people

00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:31.380 align:middle line:84%
were ready to hear this
even five years ago,

00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:33.880 align:middle line:84%
but now people are
open to the woo woo.

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.320 align:middle line:90%
I just heard a new expression.

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:36.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm sharing it everywhere.

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:39.000 align:middle line:84%
I have new people in the
audience that are new to this.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And I say, how many of you are
new to this kind of teaching?

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And few people will
raise their hand

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:44.579 align:middle line:84%
and I'll say, well,
you're new woo.

00:39:44.579 --> 00:39:45.420 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: New woo.

00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:46.450 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER] I like it.

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:47.250 align:middle line:90%
That's cute.

00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:50.900 align:middle line:10%
>> GIESEMANN: So people are open
to this because it's becoming

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:52.017 align:middle line:10%
more safe.

00:39:52.017 --> 00:39:53.850 align:middle line:10%
That they're not going
to worry about, well,

00:39:53.850 --> 00:39:56.350 align:middle line:10%
what will people think
if I start meditating

00:39:56.350 --> 00:40:00.770 align:middle line:10%
or if I talk about my no
other explanation moment?

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I see
my path, that people

00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:06.030 align:middle line:84%
look at my background and
say, well, she's not flaky.

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:08.550 align:middle line:84%
We can believe her,
but you already

00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:10.230 align:middle line:90%
know in your heart what's real.

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:12.490 align:middle line:84%
So the message is
trust your heart.

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And I love that Wolf came
knowing that his message would

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:18.170 align:middle line:90%
help people open to this.

00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:21.235 align:middle line:90%
And, yeah, the time is now.

00:40:21.235 --> 00:40:22.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: The time is now.

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:23.210 align:middle line:84%
>> GIESEMANN: That's
what they say.

00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:24.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Well, thank you.

00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:25.530 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:28.870 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for your journey
