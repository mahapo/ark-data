00:00:04.347 --> 00:00:06.762 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:06.762 --> 00:00:08.227 align:middle line:90%


00:00:08.227 --> 00:00:10.810 align:middle line:84%
>>ALAN W. GREEN: I was used to
going, "Look at me, look at me,

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.070 align:middle line:90%
look at me tap dance."

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And now, it was all, "Oh
no, don't look at me.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.059 align:middle line:90%
Don't express your ego."

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.380 align:middle line:90%
Ego is Latin for I am.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.340 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.290 align:middle line:84%
I had never had the
least bit of interest

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.730 align:middle line:90%
in Shakespeare my whole life.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.140 align:middle line:84%
God, It, She, led me to it
and I realized, "Oh my God,

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.390 align:middle line:90%
this is the biggest story ever.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.570 align:middle line:90%
Why would he do this?

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.720 align:middle line:84%
Why would he leave
codes that I somehow

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.340 align:middle line:90%
have a knack for finding?"

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.340 align:middle line:90%
He's 007 for God's sake.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.298 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:00:35.298 --> 00:00:37.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: Ian Fleming knew this
and built James Bond on him.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.010 align:middle line:84%
He hides on the
surface of the poetry.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.070 align:middle line:84%
It's pointing you to the
Great Pyramid of Giza.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.230 align:middle line:84%
For God's sake,
what's that doing?

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.640 align:middle line:84%
He's telling you history's a lot
more mysterious than you think.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.890 align:middle line:90%
To be or not to be.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.300 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean?

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.520 align:middle line:84%
It's the most well known
line in all of literature

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.545 align:middle line:90%
and he's really saying.

00:00:56.545 --> 00:01:00.777 align:middle line:90%


00:01:00.777 --> 00:01:02.610 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: One of the
more intriguing stories

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.690 align:middle line:10%
of modern history is the mystery
of Shakespeare's true identity.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.690 align:middle line:10%
In today's show, we're going to
romp through some pretty juicy

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.090 align:middle line:10%
characters but it was the
anagrams and cryptographs

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.280 align:middle line:10%
that helped our
author on our show

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.430 align:middle line:10%
today identify the little
known historical characters

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.400 align:middle line:10%
as Shakespeare with a
good degree of confidence

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.560 align:middle line:10%
because you can see.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.590 align:middle line:90%
You're a seer and you have help.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.875 align:middle line:84%
And that actually parallels some
of the characters of the day.

00:01:28.875 --> 00:01:31.500 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to say, as I was
reading your book, "Shakespeare

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.440 align:middle line:84%
Decoded" and you have that
series here on Gaia 2,

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.200 align:middle line:84%
"Shakespeare Decoded", I kept
thinking, he has this in him

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.000 align:middle line:90%
already.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.120 align:middle line:84%
That's why you're able
to see things and decode,

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.070 align:middle line:84%
and have things come
to you the way you do.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.920 align:middle line:84%
That you were already so
well developed and just

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.990 align:middle line:84%
primed to bring this
message through again.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.430 align:middle line:90%
That's my big fat opinion.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.760 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.560 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: All right.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Welcome, welcome.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.590 align:middle line:90%
So I think this of you.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.460 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, I wanted to
set the context for your book

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.640 align:middle line:84%
because you do this
beautiful work having to do

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.410 align:middle line:90%
with anagrams and pictographs.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.800 align:middle line:84%
Weaving the story of the
day of Shakespeare's peers,

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.900 align:middle line:84%
of the day royalty,
religion, and everything.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.212 align:middle line:84%
And so I wanted to find
out who you are first.

00:02:14.212 --> 00:02:15.670 align:middle line:84%
A little bit about
your background.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.330 align:middle line:90%
You're a creative for one.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.130 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: I am.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.170 align:middle line:10%
I've been a musician
my whole life.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.080 align:middle line:10%
Pianist, composer, singer.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.140 align:middle line:84%
Been involved in
the music industry

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.180 align:middle line:84%
and really the heart
of the music industry

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.100 align:middle line:90%
for quite a long time at first.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.700 align:middle line:90%
So I was on five record labels.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.260 align:middle line:84%
I was musical director for Davy
Jones of the Monkees pop group.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.060 align:middle line:84%
In and out of those sort of
circles doing what I thought

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.780 align:middle line:90%
I wanted as a kid, right?

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Great.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.112 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: I wanted to be
the next Beatles but--

00:02:48.112 --> 00:02:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You
weren't mature enough

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.840 align:middle line:84%
to do what you're doing now,
but you knew how to manifest.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.345 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: But the
point about it is,

00:02:55.345 --> 00:02:58.530 align:middle line:84%
you get into that Hollywood
and the music business.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Actually, once I was in
it, I couldn't stand it.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.280 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to be in it
because of all the lies, all

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.550 align:middle line:90%
the fakeness of it.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.240 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, I wow my
way through there

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.250 align:middle line:84%
but I learned a
tremendous amount.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you learned
how to manifest, and connect,

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.190 align:middle line:90%
and bring things to fruition.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.990 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Yeah.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.470 align:middle line:84%
I was able to do that in a
rather extraordinary way that

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.580 align:middle line:84%
was just I had a memory
of an actual system

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.870 align:middle line:84%
for manifesting, which served
me well until it didn't anymore.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And the turning
point for that is

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.020 align:middle line:84%
if you think you're
the one doing it,

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.042 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking I
can manifest this.

00:03:31.042 --> 00:03:32.000 align:middle line:90%
I've got a record deal.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.910 align:middle line:90%
I can manifest this.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.740 align:middle line:84%
I see myself being signed
by Clive Davis of Arista.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:37.540 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.050 align:middle line:90%
Boomph.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.217 align:middle line:84%
And it went over and over
and I kept thinking, oh, I

00:03:40.217 --> 00:03:41.090 align:middle line:90%
can do anything.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.025 align:middle line:84%
And then one day,
the voice came.

00:03:43.025 --> 00:03:44.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A humbling voice.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: That voice.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.530 align:middle line:90%
Humbling is a good word.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.780 align:middle line:84%
Literally, we know it
if we've experienced it.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.560 align:middle line:84%
Silent, compelling,
loving, insight.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And all it said,
well, at first was,

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.730 align:middle line:84%
"Alan, when you're
at a piano playing

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.430 align:middle line:84%
for 10 of your
friends a new song

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.490 align:middle line:84%
and they're all adoring
you and one person isn't

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:12.300 align:middle line:84%
paying attention, you get
really upset, don't you?"

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.260 align:middle line:90%
Busted.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.550 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm, "Yeah, yeah.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:18.810 align:middle line:90%
Pearls before swine.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:19.769 align:middle line:90%
That was me.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:20.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: And the
voice just said--

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm driving at the time.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And he says, "I'm playing
this song all the time

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.140 align:middle line:84%
and hardly, anyone's
paying attention."

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:33.740 align:middle line:90%
How beautiful.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: And I was
thrown into bliss,

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.220 align:middle line:90%
into unity consciousness.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.650 align:middle line:84%
Something I'd never experienced
before and literally

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.240 align:middle line:90%
thrown into it.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.710 align:middle line:84%
I could see the
sap in the trees.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.050 align:middle line:84%
I could see the stars
in the daylight sky.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at the electrons
in the steering wheel

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:54.830 align:middle line:84%
and I'm in utter,
utter staggering bliss.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.570 align:middle line:90%
What do you want?

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:57.488 align:middle line:90%
What do you want?

00:04:57.488 --> 00:04:58.530 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you know what I want?

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:59.820 align:middle line:90%
I want a new record deal.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:00.620 align:middle line:90%
Ask me.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.460 align:middle line:90%
You've never asked me.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.830 align:middle line:84%
You think you're doing it
all with this manifest.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:05.670 align:middle line:90%
So it was beautiful.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.680 align:middle line:90%
It changed my life completely.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And the state lasted
for four months.

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.570 align:middle line:84%
I was completely in
this bliss performance.

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.570 align:middle line:84%
All my friends thought I
was on acid all the time.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.437 align:middle line:84%
I've been going, give
me what you got bud.

00:05:17.437 --> 00:05:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, "I
don't have anything.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.890 align:middle line:84%
I wish I could give it
you but I was there."

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:21.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: And then it
gradually faded away.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.520 align:middle line:90%
Of course, it was grace.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.850 align:middle line:84%
It was grace that
showed me that exists.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.200 align:middle line:90%
Now, go find it.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.300 align:middle line:84%
I went and found
it in meditation,

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.980 align:middle line:84%
and I've been doing
that meditation ever

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.350 align:middle line:84%
since a form of
yoga for 42 years.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.790 align:middle line:90%
Where I can go into bliss.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:37.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:38.400 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: You know that
it's your innate nature.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.560 align:middle line:84%
But what I had to
learn from it was,

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.980 align:middle line:84%
yeah, do it for the right reason
and do it honoring the divine

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.000 align:middle line:90%
because you are-- it is in you.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.800 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it is,
and it's in everyone.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.180 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
there are some people

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.080 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps have the messages
a little louder and clearer

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.290 align:middle line:84%
because they have a particular
mission or purpose to do.

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And you needed to be put
into a position where

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:07.013 align:middle line:84%
you knew there was more
to mind than your mind.

00:06:07.013 --> 00:06:08.680 align:middle line:84%
Where you needed to
be prepared for what

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.190 align:middle line:84%
was going to happen
and to listen.

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Yeah.

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you were
going to be shown a lot.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:13.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Yeah.

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it was
time, and it's time.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.070 align:middle line:84%
The people that I interview,
I start seeing patterns

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.970 align:middle line:84%
emerge in the types of stories
coming because they actually

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.190 align:middle line:90%
start validating each other.

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.650 align:middle line:84%
That the time has come
for these ancient,

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.660 align:middle line:84%
ancient messages
which have-- they

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.210 align:middle line:84%
tried to emerge in the
day of Shakespeare.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And now, they're
trying to emerge again

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:36.730 align:middle line:84%
in the same characters, in
my opinion, keep coming back

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.030 align:middle line:84%
and try it from another angle
to move the information forward

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.230 align:middle line:90%
for humanity.

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.510 align:middle line:84%
So now let's skip
to 19 years ago.

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:46.540 align:middle line:84%
You've been prepped
and you're visited.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: Well, as
you know Regina,

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.410 align:middle line:84%
what happens to a
lot of us when we

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.280 align:middle line:84%
get on a so-called
spiritual path, I mean,

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.530 align:middle line:90%
we're all on a spiritual path.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:54.447 align:middle line:90%
We just don't know it.

00:06:54.447 --> 00:06:58.120 align:middle line:84%
But when we get on one, we go,
"Oh, this is my path, right?"

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.220 align:middle line:84%
You can easily, and I did,
get locked into this idea of,

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.020 align:middle line:90%
"Oh no.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.730 align:middle line:90%
I must be so humble.

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.470 align:middle line:84%
I should be in a
cave meditating.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:08.120 align:middle line:90%
And don't express your ego."

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.330 align:middle line:90%
Ego is Latin for I am.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:10.130 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:10.260 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:10.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's it.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:10.990 align:middle line:90%
It's just you.

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:11.790 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: I am.

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.750 align:middle line:84%
But there's a perilous
balance, right?

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:19.107 align:middle line:84%
I was using it before to
get all this stuff for me.

00:07:19.107 --> 00:07:20.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Out of balance desire.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.440 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Out of balance.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.600 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.338 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
you're thrown into,

00:07:25.338 --> 00:07:27.880 align:middle line:84%
I must-- so in other words, I
was used to going, "Look at me,

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.800 align:middle line:84%
look at me, look
at me tap dance."

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And now, it was all, "Oh
no, don't look at me,

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.190 align:middle line:84%
don't look at me
because that's wrong."

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.760 align:middle line:84%
And I had to finally come
back into a complete balance

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.070 align:middle line:84%
between those two because
of course, there's

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:42.880 align:middle line:90%
nothing wrong with the ego.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.310 align:middle line:84%
The big ego of you
were all the divine

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:49.590 align:middle line:84%
and we're here to say
that I'm waking it

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:50.550 align:middle line:90%
in others if possible.

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:51.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that is the
classic path people go through

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:52.790 align:middle line:90%
for the most part.

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:54.930 align:middle line:84%
It's you go through,
oh, I'm nothing

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:56.910 align:middle line:84%
but a drop in the
ocean of consciousness.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, we all
go through it, OK?

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.220 align:middle line:84%
So now you found your way
back to your own true identity

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.120 align:middle line:84%
because we're each
here for purpose.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.850 align:middle line:90%
So you have to stand in you.

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:07.350 align:middle line:90%
Now, what happened after that?

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: Well, at that
point, I was praying heavily

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.790 align:middle line:84%
to the divine saying,
"You can take me.

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:13.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm done.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:15.390 align:middle line:84%
I've done what I
wanted to do here.

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:16.290 align:middle line:90%
And take me.

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:17.582 align:middle line:90%
My daughter is off and running.

00:08:17.582 --> 00:08:19.890 align:middle line:84%
She's at New York
University, Tisch.

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:20.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm fine.

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:21.570 align:middle line:90%
You can take me.

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:23.230 align:middle line:90%
I don't even like it here."

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:24.030 align:middle line:90%
And I said--

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:26.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're
ready, Sayonara.

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:29.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: But I was really
forcing God to say,

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.145 align:middle line:84%
show me what's next or
get rid of me because I--

00:08:32.145 --> 00:08:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You don't want
to just hang around.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:37.679 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: If I'm here for
something which I suspect I am,

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:38.909 align:middle line:90%
got to show me what it is.

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:40.440 align:middle line:84%
Two weeks later, a
friend invites me

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.580 align:middle line:90%
to a Shakespeare show.

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:44.110 align:middle line:84%
I had never had the least bit
of interest in Shakespeare

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:45.030 align:middle line:90%
in my whole life.

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:46.980 align:middle line:84%
That was a part of the
programming as well.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:48.533 align:middle line:90%
Oh, Shakespeare bad.

00:08:48.533 --> 00:08:49.450 align:middle line:90%
That happened earlier.

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:50.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you're
English, aren't you?

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:51.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: I am English, yes.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you didn't have
any interest in Shakespeare.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: I did not have any
interest and we could go there

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.280 align:middle line:90%
but that was to be another show.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.522 align:middle line:84%
I was blocked from
knowing it, which

00:08:59.522 --> 00:09:01.480 align:middle line:84%
meant I didn't have to
unlearn all the rubbish.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.438 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I understand.

00:09:02.438 --> 00:09:04.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: So he
introduced me to it.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Got, It, She, led me to
it and I realized, oh.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:08.830 align:middle line:90%
I went, "Oh my God.

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:11.230 align:middle line:90%
This is it biggest story ever."

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:12.918 align:middle line:90%
The guy left no paper trail.

00:09:12.918 --> 00:09:13.960 align:middle line:90%
There are no manuscripts.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.710 align:middle line:84%
No plays, no poems, not a letter
not a line in his own hand.

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:19.630 align:middle line:90%
No one even saw him.

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:20.800 align:middle line:90%
It's a mystery.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.600 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'll write this
as a musical and I'm

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.975 align:middle line:84%
off and running going, "Oh,
that's what I came here for."

00:09:24.975 --> 00:09:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'm writing it as a
musical for two years.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.100 align:middle line:84%
But then I found I was
finding real codes.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.060 align:middle line:90%
I mean, real codes.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the musical
then seemed a little trivial

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:35.890 align:middle line:84%
compared to this
main story that, oh,

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:38.680 align:middle line:84%
he's trying to lead
us to something

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.090 align:middle line:90%
that is really important.

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:42.110 align:middle line:90%
Why would he do this?

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:44.710 align:middle line:84%
Why would he leave
codes that I somehow

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:47.340 align:middle line:90%
have a knack for finding.

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And there you are,
but they are deep.

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:50.190 align:middle line:90%
They go deep.

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:50.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And so this character called
William Shakespeare is

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.930 align:middle line:84%
essentially, we're going
to go with your story,

00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:59.040 align:middle line:90%
no other story.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And your story, part of your
story was also exemplified

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.730 align:middle line:84%
and well, it was demonstrated
in the film, "Anonymous"

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:09.600 align:middle line:84%
which was done by Roland
Emmerich and 2011.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.250 align:middle line:90%
Which is a beautiful film.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:13.110 align:middle line:84%
You can tell he poured
himself in because he

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:14.490 align:middle line:90%
was as intrigued as you.

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:16.170 align:middle line:90%
You've taken it further.

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:18.150 align:middle line:90%
But nonetheless, it gets him.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:21.210 align:middle line:84%
If anyone wants to watch it,
it gives you some really rich

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:22.120 align:middle line:90%
emotional backdrop.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: And it's
a well-told story.

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:24.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And I want us to tell
essentially that and more.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.730 align:middle line:84%
And so let's go to
what intrigued Roland

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:31.170 align:middle line:90%
and what intrigued you.

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:33.510 align:middle line:90%
And go back to the day itself.

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:35.940 align:middle line:84%
The characters of
the day and let's

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:40.740 align:middle line:84%
make the central figure
really, Queen Elizabeth I.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: Well, of course,
you had that reign

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:47.290 align:middle line:84%
of who has often been thought
of as England's greatest monarch

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:49.300 align:middle line:90%
and most powerful woman.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:53.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she really was and
she had a definite intention

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:56.170 align:middle line:84%
to show the world
how powerful she was.

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:58.540 align:middle line:84%
She grew up in a completely
dysfunctional family, right?

00:10:58.540 --> 00:10:58.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, of course.

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: Her dad executed
her mother when she was two.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.220 align:middle line:90%
There is that.

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There's that.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: I mean,
there were swarming

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:10.720 align:middle line:84%
around her all these
intimations of incest, right?

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.700 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that marriage
was not legitimate

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:13.832 align:middle line:90%
because it was incestuous.

00:11:13.832 --> 00:11:15.790 align:middle line:84%
This is not legitimate
because it's incestuous.

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:18.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In other
words, royal stuff.

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:19.390 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Exactly.

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:24.230 align:middle line:84%
Just your typical everyday
story at Buckingham Palace.

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:25.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:28.330 align:middle line:84%
So here, you have this
beautiful, passionate character

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.720 align:middle line:84%
who was-- was Queen
Elizabeth literate herself?

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:35.320 align:middle line:84%
She certainly seemed to
historically appreciate

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.270 align:middle line:90%
words and history.

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:40.270 align:middle line:90%
And she had a lot of depth.

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:43.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: Oh, tremendously
intelligent and well tutored.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, she could really
talk the hind leg of a horse,

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:50.790 align:middle line:90%
as we say in England.

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:52.350 align:middle line:84%
Anyone around her,
she knew stuff.

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:53.610 align:middle line:90%
But I mean, think of this.

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:57.130 align:middle line:84%
She translated a work
when she was 11 years old,

00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:58.890 align:middle line:84%
called the mirror
of the sinful soul

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:03.240 align:middle line:84%
that was given to her by French
Queen Marguerite of Navarre

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.563 align:middle line:90%
about incest.

00:12:05.563 --> 00:12:06.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:11.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: And she translated
it from French into English.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.360 align:middle line:90%
And as--

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: At age 11?

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.090 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: At age 11.

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And part of the
principle behind it

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:23.250 align:middle line:84%
is that if we are brothers
and sisters in Christ,

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:31.130 align:middle line:84%
but Christ is also my
husband, and I am as reigning,

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:32.240 align:middle line:90%
I am the mother of--

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's all
a convoluted thing

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:40.270 align:middle line:84%
where she's able to
rationalize her incest is

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:41.500 align:middle line:90%
just nothing really.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're all basically
only come from the one.

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:47.770 align:middle line:84%
How can there really be
true incestuous behavior?

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:50.320 align:middle line:84%
Which figures later
in her life when

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:54.250 align:middle line:84%
she's rationalizing how she
can be the Virgin Queen.

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:56.420 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: And yet.

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:56.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And yet.

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get into that
and yet because that's really

00:12:59.170 --> 00:12:59.810 align:middle line:90%
the story.

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:02.260 align:middle line:84%
That's a big part of the story
is what happens from the end

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:03.060 align:middle line:90%
yet.

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:06.340 align:middle line:84%
And so, here, you have
this lovely woman.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.830 align:middle line:84%
This brilliant woman,
powerful woman.

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And she ultimately-- we'll get
to her backstory a little bit.

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:19.660 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, she marries off
to William Cecil, her advisor.

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:20.920 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Cecil is her advisor.

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:21.985 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is her advisor.

00:13:21.985 --> 00:13:23.402 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: Close
confidant, but it's

00:13:23.402 --> 00:13:28.342 align:middle line:84%
Cecil's daughter who he insists
he marry to his ward of court.

00:13:28.342 --> 00:13:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, because she's
the Virgin Queen, right?

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:31.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:35.170 align:middle line:84%
So Cecil comes in and he is
like a handler in her life.

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:38.140 align:middle line:84%
So what's going on with
the politics of the day?

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:42.180 align:middle line:84%
That first of all, cryptography,
anagrams, and everything

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:42.980 align:middle line:90%
flourished.

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:44.930 align:middle line:84%
We're not even to
the theater yet.

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:48.050 align:middle line:84%
But why did all of this
flourish in the day?

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:49.020 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: No Netflix.

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:49.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:50.620 align:middle line:90%
Well, there you go.

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:51.420 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:52.520 align:middle line:90%
There was more to that.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:53.527 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about--

00:13:53.527 --> 00:13:54.860 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: No Netflix, no theater.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:55.803 align:middle line:90%
Well, the theater.

00:13:55.803 --> 00:13:57.470 align:middle line:84%
All they had was
church and the theater.

00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:59.120 align:middle line:90%
That was their entertainment.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:02.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so let's talk
about why secrecy though?

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:05.070 align:middle line:84%
Because there were messages
that were trying to come out.

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:05.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Oh, sure.

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:06.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:07.130 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk.

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:09.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: Well, of course,
we're in the middle

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:10.250 align:middle line:90%
of the Reformation.

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:10.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: We've been
Catholic, Catholic, Catholic,

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:13.400 align:middle line:90%
Catholic, Catholic.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.530 align:middle line:84%
Henry wants to
marry someone else.

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:17.090 align:middle line:90%
He wants to marry Anne Boleyn.

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:18.050 align:middle line:90%
Pope won't let him.

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:20.300 align:middle line:84%
OK then, we're not
Catholic anymore.

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.230 align:middle line:90%
We are now Protestant.

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:23.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:26.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: And then he dies
and Mary's on the throne

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:29.120 align:middle line:84%
and she's a staunch
Catholic again, right?

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.170 align:middle line:90%
Ahead of Elizabeth.

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:30.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:33.020 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: And then Edward VI is--

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:34.700 align:middle line:90%
she dies of probably cancer.

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:37.798 align:middle line:84%
And now, Edward VI is on and
now we're Protestants again.

00:14:37.798 --> 00:14:39.590 align:middle line:84%
So nobody knew what to
do with their beads.

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:41.330 align:middle line:84%
They're going, do we
use it, do we do not?

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, then,
what's happening?

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:43.990 align:middle line:84%
So then we have
the story up North.

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:44.790 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:48.030 align:middle line:84%
So Scotland because King
James starts coming into it.

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:50.810 align:middle line:84%
So what's going on
in terms of religion

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:53.330 align:middle line:90%
between Elizabeth and James.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: Well, let's
just say overall,

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:59.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Elizabeth had to
very reluctantly execute

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:01.250 align:middle line:90%
James's mother, right?

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:02.150 align:middle line:90%
Mary Queen of Scots.

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mary, Queen of Scots.

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:03.110 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:06.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: All of that mishmash
is really to do with the idea

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:09.780 align:middle line:84%
that England is now, because of
her father, is now Protestant.

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:10.580 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's Catholic.

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:11.720 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's Protestant again.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.940 align:middle line:84%
Elizabeth is a
Protestant queen again

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.760 align:middle line:84%
but she's got to try
and balance and placate

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:20.750 align:middle line:84%
the Catholics who are at
least 50% of the country.

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And there's death threats
on her all the time.

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And so sending codes
to protect or even

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.520 align:middle line:90%
to try to assassinate her.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.780 align:middle line:90%
Codes were everywhere.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:31.920 align:middle line:90%
This was not a vague thing.

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They were a necessary
part of communication.

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:37.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: Necessary part
because it was a very, very

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:41.960 align:middle line:90%
tight system of control.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.580 align:middle line:90%
The Elizabethan era, right?

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:46.890 align:middle line:84%
It was just printing was
just coming into its own.

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:49.280 align:middle line:84%
They had to have
control of finding out

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.030 align:middle line:90%
who's on their side, who's not.

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:51.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:53.538 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: She was
constantly under threat.

00:15:53.538 --> 00:15:55.790 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of codes
is not at all--

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:57.560 align:middle line:90%
everybody was doing it.

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And you could not say a
word against the monarchy.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:05.390 align:middle line:84%
People would get
obviously hung, drawn,

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:07.370 align:middle line:84%
and quartered for saying--
suggesting anything

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:08.660 align:middle line:90%
about who she should marry.

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.382 align:middle line:84%
They all wanted her to marry and
she was absolutely insistent.

00:16:11.382 --> 00:16:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And growing up in that
completely dysfunctional

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:15.740 align:middle line:84%
family, she said
famously, "There

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:17.610 align:middle line:84%
will be one master
in this house on me."

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:18.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:20.077 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: She wasn't
going to get married

00:16:20.077 --> 00:16:23.900 align:middle line:84%
but of course she's a woman
with natural, healthy, sexual,

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.370 align:middle line:90%
and amorous instincts.

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And she happens to
fall in love with

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.660 align:middle line:84%
this dashing young
beautiful guy who

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:32.480 align:middle line:84%
comes to court 21 years
old, Edward de Vere.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.410 align:middle line:90%
He's a great poet.

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:35.210 align:middle line:90%
He's a flashy dancer.

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:36.920 align:middle line:90%
We know Elizabeth liked dancing.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.380 align:middle line:90%
He's also a great athlete.

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:41.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how old
was she at the time?

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: She was 17
years older than him.

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:43.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.130 align:middle line:90%
And this comes up later?

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.830 align:middle line:84%
So she was a little
older, beautiful,

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:53.960 align:middle line:84%
and she meets this essentially
polymath, this amazing man.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.570 align:middle line:90%
And he can match her intellect.

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And so for her, this
is something just

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:03.740 align:middle line:84%
to find a person who is
as educated, as clever, as

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:05.630 align:middle line:90%
beautiful a mind as she.

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:07.160 align:middle line:90%
And so he's a little younger.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.119 align:middle line:90%
He's 21, right?

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:09.500 align:middle line:90%
You said 21 at the time?

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: Well,
he'd have been 20.

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:12.950 align:middle line:90%
Well, here's the point.

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:16.800 align:middle line:84%
His father was got
rid of, shall we say.

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:20.270 align:middle line:84%
So that he became the
17th Earl of Oxford.

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:22.190 align:middle line:84%
His father was the
16th Earl of Oxford.

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:24.050 align:middle line:90%
Owned vast swaths of land.

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:25.280 align:middle line:90%
Let's get rid of him.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:27.770 align:middle line:84%
Let's get this
guy close to court

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:30.240 align:middle line:90%
under the Ward of William Cecil.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:33.620 align:middle line:84%
So that Cecil is now training
him and educating him

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:37.130 align:middle line:84%
in the best libraries, better
than anything in Europe.

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:41.280 align:middle line:84%
Just the place you'd need in
order to become a great writer.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, he's literally
got the world at his feet

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:49.290 align:middle line:84%
but he's but he's trapped in
that household until he's 21.

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And William Cecil wants him
to marry his daughter, Anne.

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:54.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:58.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: Because that will
make him connected to--

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:01.260 align:middle line:84%
the backstory to
all of this is--

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:02.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's a tricky part.

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:05.980 align:middle line:84%
So let's go to
Elizabeth at age 14.

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:09.510 align:middle line:84%
She's written this document
you spoke about, about divinity

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:11.370 align:middle line:84%
and we're all brothers,
we're all sisters.

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And it puts a different
lens around incest.

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:18.420 align:middle line:84%
Now she's 14 years old,
which is actually a pretty--

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:21.720 align:middle line:84%
I remember me at 14,
pretty passionate age.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:22.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Sure.

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:24.127 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about what

00:18:24.127 --> 00:18:26.100 align:middle line:90%
was going on then in her life.

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:29.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Well, she was placed.

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:31.870 align:middle line:90%
Now, Henry VIII has died.

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:36.300 align:middle line:84%
So the widow of Henry VIII
marries Thomas Seymour,

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.900 align:middle line:84%
a dashing Lord Admiral but
he's a bit of a scoundrel.

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And Elizabeth has been
placed in their household.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And the housekeepers
make a note of

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:49.800 align:middle line:84%
and it's very, very specific
in their expressions.

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:53.070 align:middle line:84%
Inappropriate bedroom
play with Thomas Seymour

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:54.910 align:middle line:90%
and the young princess.

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:56.350 align:middle line:90%
And it goes on for a long time.

00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, he's
brought up on charges

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.260 align:middle line:84%
of treason, 33 charges
of treason including

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.480 align:middle line:84%
trying to impregnate
Elizabeth in order

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:07.480 align:middle line:84%
to then convince her to marry
him so that he can be King.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Pretty convoluted path to power
but that's what he thought.

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And he got busted and
he got executed for it.

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.410 align:middle line:84%
But there is a rumor that
he did impregnate her.

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:20.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, on the surface of
it historically, it's

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.310 align:middle line:90%
only a rumor.

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:23.770 align:middle line:84%
You can find
documents, books that

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:26.590 align:middle line:90%
say, "Yeah, that happened."

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:28.840 align:middle line:84%
I never liked to talk
about it conclusively

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:32.500 align:middle line:84%
until I found codes that
were just too undeniable.

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.060 align:middle line:84%
Code after code
after code after code

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:36.250 align:middle line:84%
going, "Yes, that's
what happened."

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:39.010 align:middle line:84%
He's telling us he
was the first child

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:41.410 align:middle line:84%
of Elizabeth raped
at 14 years old.

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:45.160 align:middle line:84%
Put into what they would
call a changeling situation.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:48.130 align:middle line:84%
He's a changeling child put
into the home of the 16th Earl

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:49.750 align:middle line:90%
of Oxford, his father.

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:51.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 16th Earl of Oxford.

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:51.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:53.268 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: So now, they
get rid of the 16th Earl.

00:19:53.268 --> 00:19:56.080 align:middle line:84%
He literally died a month after
making out his will very, very

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:58.180 align:middle line:90%
prominently to William Cecil.

00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:00.263 align:middle line:84%
And he's only died,
just drop dead.

00:20:00.263 --> 00:20:01.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He just
happened to drop dead.

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:04.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have this
17th Earl of Oxford.

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:08.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: The 17th is now brought
into town with 120 horsemen

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:09.280 align:middle line:90%
and dressed in Black.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.947 align:middle line:84%
The town must have
thought, "Who is this

00:20:10.947 --> 00:20:12.550 align:middle line:90%
coming into town protected?

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:13.350 align:middle line:90%
Big procession.

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:14.150 align:middle line:90%
Who is he?"

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:15.640 align:middle line:90%
He's just 17th Earl of Oxford.

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:18.680 align:middle line:84%
He's a kid, 12 years old but he
ends up at Cecil's and now he's

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:19.480 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:23.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, Cecil can bleed all the
grounds from the 16th Earl.

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.080 align:middle line:84%
They can bring all that
into their treasury.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:29.650 align:middle line:84%
But he's in place and
he's close to the queen.

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And one assumes, if one finds
critical evidence, which

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:35.498 align:middle line:84%
I claim I have in
terms of the codes.

00:20:35.498 --> 00:20:37.540 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not just one
code where you can say,

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:38.650 align:middle line:90%
"Oh well, that's your opinion."

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:39.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Coincidence.

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:39.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:41.907 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: Five, six, seven of
them all saying, "Yes, that's

00:20:41.907 --> 00:20:43.390 align:middle line:90%
what happened."

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:46.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're now talking
about the 17th Earl of Oxford.

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:46.690 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Yeah.

00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:47.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: None other
than Edward de Vere.

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:48.887 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Edward de Vere.

00:20:48.887 --> 00:20:50.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is where
it gets complicated.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.070 align:middle line:84%
It almost makes me,
I don't know why,

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:53.480 align:middle line:90%
a little teary for some reason.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.400 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing
is so convoluted.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:21:00.650 align:middle line:84%
So she now is 37 and meets a
21-year-old Edward de Vere.

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:01.520 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Yeah.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:04.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did she know what
happened to the changeling

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:06.710 align:middle line:90%
where he went, who raised him?

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:08.370 align:middle line:90%
Did she know his identity?

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:09.262 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:21:09.262 --> 00:21:10.220 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: We don't know.

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:11.975 align:middle line:90%
It would be remiss.

00:21:11.975 --> 00:21:13.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We don't know.

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:13.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: I don't know.

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:14.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We don't know.

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:14.330 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:15.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: I cannot say
anything I can't prove.

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:15.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:16.420 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:18.462 align:middle line:84%
So we don't know if she
knew that Edward de Vere.

00:21:18.462 --> 00:21:19.628 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: But she certainly--

00:21:19.628 --> 00:21:21.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Appears
to have been her son

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:23.580 align:middle line:84%
but she did have a lot
of resonance with him

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:24.380 align:middle line:90%
when they met.

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:25.130 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: They hit it off.

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:25.400 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.483 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They hit it off.

00:21:26.483 --> 00:21:29.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: And all the Spanish
ambassadors there at court

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:30.800 align:middle line:90%
were writing back to Spain.

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:33.635 align:middle line:90%
Oh, the queen, de Vere having--

00:21:33.635 --> 00:21:36.770 align:middle line:84%
all of that's been expunged from
the English records, of course.

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:37.790 align:middle line:90%
She's the Virgin Queen.

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:40.490 align:middle line:84%
But it's in other records
that say no they were having

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:42.170 align:middle line:90%
an affair, quite definitely.

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:46.310 align:middle line:84%
Plus then we know
that in 1572 and '73,

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:50.340 align:middle line:84%
they had three separate private
interviews with the Archbishop

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:51.870 align:middle line:90%
of Canterbury.

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:53.220 align:middle line:90%
For what reason?

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:57.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the only
conceivable reason

00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:00.210 align:middle line:84%
would be if a
child is on the way

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:03.750 align:middle line:84%
because the only person
allowed to marry the monarch

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:05.400 align:middle line:90%
is the Archbishop of Canterbury.

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.900 align:middle line:10%
They had these
meetings in private,

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.570 align:middle line:10%
their reference but
no one else was there.

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:13.860 align:middle line:10%
And one can assume that was in
order to officially marry them

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:16.890 align:middle line:10%
so that when the child came,
the child was legitimate

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:20.130 align:middle line:10%
and she could name that child
some future point as being

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:22.545 align:middle line:10%
successor and the Tudor
lineage could continue.

00:22:22.545 --> 00:22:25.170 align:middle line:90%


00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:29.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: William Cecil
argued heavily against this

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:34.350 align:middle line:84%
when she declared that she was
in love with de Vere, right?

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:35.192 align:middle line:90%
Didn't he try--

00:22:35.192 --> 00:22:36.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: That's a
little literary license

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.650 align:middle line:84%
on behalf of the
movie, "Anonymous."

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:39.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:40.650 align:middle line:90%
That's not accurate.

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:41.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: We don't know for sure.

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:43.038 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We don't
know if he tried

00:22:43.038 --> 00:22:44.130 align:middle line:90%
to discourage her from it.

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:46.230 align:middle line:84%
But something
happened that seemed

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:48.370 align:middle line:84%
to have put distance
between them.

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:51.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, there was some
distance because apparently,

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.955 align:middle line:84%
from this affair,
she was impregnated.

00:22:53.955 --> 00:22:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, I mean,
that's what the story is,

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:57.180 align:middle line:90%
the story we're talking about.

00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And she apparently
took a little time off.

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:03.720 align:middle line:84%
Went away for a while until
the child came into the world.

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: They would do these
things called progress.

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:05.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:06.900 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Go on progress.

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:07.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Go on progress.

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:08.850 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Very large hoop skirts.

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:09.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:09.540 align:middle line:90%
You couldn't tell.

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:10.230 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: And waved.

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:10.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:11.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Right?

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And then they go off
somewhere and have--

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:12.930 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:14.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it a matter
of historic record

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:16.980 align:middle line:84%
that she went on progress
or is this speculation?

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:17.490 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Absolutely.

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:17.700 align:middle line:90%
No--

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:18.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She did?

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:20.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: Historical record
that matches with the times

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:22.450 align:middle line:90%
we think she had a child.

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:23.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:27.510 align:middle line:84%
But again, being careful, I
can't say I can prove that.

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:29.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: None of
this is in stone.

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:32.460 align:middle line:84%
These are at this point
beyond speculation, only

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:35.140 align:middle line:84%
in that certain of
your codes do seem

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:38.450 align:middle line:84%
to match up with certain
historical evidence.

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:39.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Yeah.

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:40.210 align:middle line:90%
That's the point.

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:41.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: And when the codes are
literally redundant here, here,

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:47.000 align:middle line:90%
here, here, here.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.210 align:middle line:84%
Then you have a map
for saying, well,

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:52.640 align:middle line:84%
whoever wrote these codes is
trying to tell us something

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.430 align:middle line:84%
and then making sure we get the
message very loud and clear.

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And the codes are not
just random things.

00:23:57.950 --> 00:23:59.250 align:middle line:90%
If you watch the show--

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:01.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You'll see
exactly very, very specific.

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:05.420 align:middle line:84%
So now, the queen has
gone on progression

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:08.660 align:middle line:84%
but somehow, it seems
the renderings of it

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:11.540 align:middle line:84%
are that she and de
Vere are pushed apart.

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:13.198 align:middle line:90%
They did not marry.

00:24:13.198 --> 00:24:14.240 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: No, they didn't.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.040 align:middle line:90%
And this is the tragic story.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:19.697 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They seemed to love
each other, or she loved him.

00:24:19.697 --> 00:24:21.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: I am absolutely
convinced that this

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:22.670 align:middle line:90%
was a deep love affair.

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:24.180 align:middle line:90%
She was trapped by her job.

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:24.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:27.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: She's got
to be-- first of all,

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:31.220 align:middle line:84%
she has stated that she
will never marry because she

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.260 align:middle line:90%
doesn't want to marry men.

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:34.790 align:middle line:84%
Oh, now, we'll
take it from here.

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:35.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:36.050 align:middle line:90%
Don't blame her on that one.

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:36.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: You go to the kitchen.

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:37.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:38.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Right.

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.930 align:middle line:90%
So she doesn't want that.

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She wanted
to express herself.

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:41.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Right.

00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:44.410 align:middle line:90%
But besides that, there's--

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:49.630 align:middle line:84%
well, de Vere makes
a point of writing

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:53.020 align:middle line:84%
a beautiful public
letter to her.

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:57.990 align:middle line:84%
He has his page announce it
during the tilts at the yard.

00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:59.830 align:middle line:84%
Remember, he was 21
years old when he first

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:01.450 align:middle line:84%
comes into her life,
or at least when

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:04.755 align:middle line:84%
he's first jousting
and sword fencing.

00:25:04.755 --> 00:25:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And she's looking at him going,
"Well, he's a darn good dancer.

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:08.360 align:middle line:90%
He's a very nice poet."

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He's brilliant.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: Pretty
brilliant writer.

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.020 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, he was
hated, of course.

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:12.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:12.790 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Right.

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:13.550 align:middle line:90%
That's clear.

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:13.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:14.320 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Right.

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:15.490 align:middle line:90%
And he wins everything.

00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:15.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:17.020 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: So even worse, right?

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:21.550 align:middle line:84%
So 10 years later in 1581,
he's back to defend his title

00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:23.730 align:middle line:90%
as it were.

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:26.490 align:middle line:84%
This is the one part that
Roland did not get in the movie

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:29.040 align:middle line:84%
and I wish he had because
it's the most beautiful scene

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:29.840 align:middle line:90%
imaginable.

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:30.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tell us.

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.020 align:middle line:90%
I want to hear it.

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:33.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: Well, this is
a historical record.

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:37.288 align:middle line:84%
The tilts 620 odd yards
long, all the knights

00:25:37.288 --> 00:25:38.580 align:middle line:90%
are wanting to beat him, right?

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:40.788 align:middle line:84%
This time because
they don't like him.

00:25:40.788 --> 00:25:43.080 align:middle line:84%
There's the Green Knight,
the Black Knight, Red Knight,

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:43.560 align:middle line:90%
Yellow Knight.

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:44.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He shows up everyone.

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:45.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Right.

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:47.730 align:middle line:84%
They're all at one end
but he's the champion

00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:50.890 align:middle line:84%
so he has the privilege of
coming from the other end.

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:56.170 align:middle line:84%
Overnight, he has his people
decorate a large bay tree

00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:59.820 align:middle line:84%
at this end of the
court of the tiltyard.

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:01.800 align:middle line:84%
Covered in gold,
not painted gold.

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.540 align:middle line:90%
Covered in gold leaf.

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:04.982 align:middle line:90%
He's very rich, remember.

00:26:04.982 --> 00:26:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And they cover the
trunk and the branches

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:08.460 align:middle line:90%
and the leaves in gold leaf.

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And he comes out at the sunrise
out of this gold colored tent

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:19.360 align:middle line:90%
on a gold caparisoned horse.

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:23.560 align:middle line:84%
Holding a golden lance, dressed
in gold armor with a gold--

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:24.910 align:middle line:90%
everything gold.

00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:25.710 align:middle line:90%
He's saying--

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
is historical record?

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:27.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: Oh, this is
historical record.

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And he's saying--
what is he saying?

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:31.150 align:middle line:90%
He's saying he's Muhammad Ali.

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:32.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, right.

00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:34.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: He's saying,
"I am the greatest."

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:35.013 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I am, yes.

00:26:35.013 --> 00:26:36.346 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: You want a piece of me?

00:26:36.346 --> 00:26:38.513 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you don't do that
if you're a little nervous

00:26:38.513 --> 00:26:39.670 align:middle line:90%
about how it's going to go.

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:41.128 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He's
confident, it seems.

00:26:41.128 --> 00:26:43.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: Comes out
and goes, "Yeah."

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And then they have
12 bouts and he wins

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:47.380 align:middle line:90%
every single one for his queen.

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:50.680 align:middle line:84%
He has his page come out and
read a document to something

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:54.130 align:middle line:84%
he wrote for her called the
Knight of the tree of the sun.

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:56.740 align:middle line:84%
And he says, "This tree,
this golden shining tree

00:26:56.740 --> 00:27:02.590 align:middle line:84%
that I'm emerging from is
emblematic of our family tree."

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:03.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:05.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: It's heavy.

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:05.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:08.027 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: And he's saying,
he is the root of the tree

00:27:08.027 --> 00:27:12.130 align:middle line:84%
and she is the vestal virgin
at the top of the tree.

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:17.150 align:middle line:84%
He's telling the world that
he's her child and her love.

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:17.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:22.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: Either romantic
or pure noble love

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:24.140 align:middle line:84%
of a courtier poet
for his monarch.

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:25.663 align:middle line:90%
It's utterly beautiful.

00:27:25.663 --> 00:27:27.080 align:middle line:84%
It's a brilliant
piece of theater.

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.640 align:middle line:84%
It's Shakespeare in
the Park before there

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:29.180 align:middle line:90%
was a Shakespeare--

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:30.888 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm surprised
he left that out.

00:27:30.888 --> 00:27:31.880 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: Oh, Roland
should have had that in.

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, he should have.

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:35.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:35.780 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Brilliant, brilliant.

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:36.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:38.302 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: I mean, the idea
that I am the greatest.

00:27:38.302 --> 00:27:39.650 align:middle line:90%
So he comes out and says that.

00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:43.970 align:middle line:84%
But the bottom line is he's
saying to the world and to her,

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:46.550 align:middle line:84%
"I understand that you have
to be the vestal virgin."

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:48.500 align:middle line:84%
He actually uses the
expression vestal virgin.

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:49.850 align:middle line:90%
You have to be the Virgin Queen.

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:50.650 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:54.320 align:middle line:84%
Because you are being
courted by all these--

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:57.410 align:middle line:84%
you're the most eligible woman
in the world, on the planet.

00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And France wants to marry her,
and Rome wants to marry her,

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:01.500 align:middle line:84%
and blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:02.510 align:middle line:90%
They all come over.

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:05.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, she plays it
like, "Oh yes, there's

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:06.740 align:middle line:90%
no Instagram, right?"

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:09.590 align:middle line:84%
It's like, "Oh, paint me
a portrait of yourself

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:11.000 align:middle line:90%
and I'll see if I fancy you."

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And like a year and
a half later, they

00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:14.390 align:middle line:84%
send over the ships
and a portrait.

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:15.770 align:middle line:90%
No, I don't think so.

00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:18.890 align:middle line:84%
She's using her
virginity as bait

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:21.530 align:middle line:84%
because so long as
she's available,

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:23.728 align:middle line:84%
she might marry one of them
and they can avoid war.

00:28:23.728 --> 00:28:24.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:26.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: And just
install a king.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:26.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Makes perfect sense.

00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:27.380 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:29.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: So long as she does,
and she's doing this all along.

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.835 align:middle line:84%
All the while, John de
Vere behind the scenes

00:28:31.835 --> 00:28:34.000 align:middle line:90%
is saying, "Keep this going.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:34.800 align:middle line:90%
Keep it going.

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.800 align:middle line:84%
We've got to build up our
armaments because the Spanish

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:38.420 align:middle line:84%
Armada is going
to come eventually

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:41.298 align:middle line:84%
when you're no longer of
childbearing age, by the way."

00:28:41.298 --> 00:28:42.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So position well now.

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:44.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: This is only
going to last for a while.

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:45.807 align:middle line:90%
And that's what she's doing.

00:28:45.807 --> 00:28:47.810 align:middle line:84%
But de Vere is saying
in this message,

00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:51.620 align:middle line:84%
"I understand you need to be
a virgin queen for them and I

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:54.530 align:middle line:84%
understand therefore that our
love cannot be acknowledged

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:56.840 align:middle line:84%
and our child cannot
be acknowledged.

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.430 align:middle line:90%
But I love you."

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did he know that
she was mom at the time?

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:01.310 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Oh, yeah.

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:01.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He knew.

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:02.770 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:05.520 align:middle line:84%
So it appears they may
have both been in the know.

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.320 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: There are
hints in the sun.

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:07.460 align:middle line:90%
It's all--

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:07.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There are hints.

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:08.770 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:12.870 align:middle line:90%
So now, we get to Shakespeare.

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Shakespeare who
certainly in the film

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:18.740 align:middle line:84%
was portrayed as an absolute
buffoon who can't even write.

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:20.930 align:middle line:90%
So he's a fellow in Stratford.

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:26.030 align:middle line:84%
Why is de Vere trying to
get these plays that we all

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:27.440 align:middle line:90%
know from our school days?

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:29.210 align:middle line:84%
Why is he trying
to get these out

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:30.890 align:middle line:84%
through this person
that ultimately

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:33.050 align:middle line:90%
was named William Shakespeare?

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:34.370 align:middle line:90%
This nom de plume.

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:36.320 align:middle line:84%
Why was he trying to
get this information out

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:37.567 align:middle line:90%
to the public at all?

00:29:37.567 --> 00:29:38.900 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: There is a distinction.

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:42.180 align:middle line:84%
The man born in Stratford
was baptized Shackspere.

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:42.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Shacks.

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:43.430 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:44.805 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: It's a
minor distinction

00:29:44.805 --> 00:29:46.880 align:middle line:84%
but it is important
because the name was common

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.890 align:middle line:84%
but it was never
ever spelt with an E.

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:49.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:50.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: And it was
never ever hyphenated.

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:51.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:52.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: Which a lot
of Shakespeare stuff

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:56.690 align:middle line:84%
was hyphenated, Shake-spear
As in basically,

00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:59.150 align:middle line:84%
Minerva coming out of
Zeus's head shaking a spear.

00:29:59.150 --> 00:29:59.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:01.278 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: The goddess
of art and all that.

00:30:01.278 --> 00:30:03.290 align:middle line:90%
So it's a metaphor.

00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:05.780 align:middle line:84%
He happens to have a
convenient name but who knows?

00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:07.230 align:middle line:90%
Maybe even that was fixed.

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:09.020 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't be surprised
at this point.

00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:12.537 align:middle line:84%
But definitely, his
baptism was fixed.

00:30:12.537 --> 00:30:14.120 align:middle line:84%
Can I just give you
a few numbers that

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:15.410 align:middle line:90%
will help us to understand it?

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:16.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:21.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: Angels in 1584,
channel a document,

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:23.000 align:middle line:84%
a sacred document
a doctor John Dee.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.067 align:middle line:90%
He liked to do seances.

00:30:24.067 --> 00:30:25.400 align:middle line:90%
He would like to talk to angels.

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: John Dee was the
Queen's personal astrologer

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:29.900 align:middle line:90%
but he was much more.

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:30.890 align:middle line:90%
He talked to angels.

00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:31.920 align:middle line:90%
He was a mathematician.

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:34.260 align:middle line:84%
He was a mystic, great
mystic of the day.

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:35.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: Thank you for
catching up on that

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.290 align:middle line:90%
because we hadn't mentioned him.

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:36.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:39.173 align:middle line:84%
And we have to get him in there
because it's key to your work.

00:30:39.173 --> 00:30:41.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: So John Dee
is literally that

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:43.010 align:middle line:90%
and he's the Queen's astrologer.

00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And he's one of her
leading advisors as far

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:46.590 align:middle line:90%
as psychic phenomenon.

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:48.230 align:middle line:84%
You can say he's
007 for God's sake.

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:49.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Right.

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:51.770 align:middle line:84%
He's a spy in Europe and
that's his code number.

00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:53.757 align:middle line:84%
Ian Fleming knew this
and built James Bond

00:30:53.757 --> 00:30:54.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 007 on it.

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:55.010 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:56.840 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: So he's a
magnificent character

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:58.207 align:middle line:90%
once you get to understand him.

00:30:58.207 --> 00:30:59.540 align:middle line:90%
The kids are going to love this.

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:01.490 align:middle line:84%
After Dumbledore,
he's the next one.

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:02.780 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Really?

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:04.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, John Dee
is a real wizard.

00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: But he's having
a seance with angels.

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:09.522 align:middle line:84%
And the Angels dictate
this message to him

00:31:09.522 --> 00:31:11.480 align:middle line:84%
and it is brought through
as a sacred document.

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:16.740 align:middle line:84%
And it has 624 squares
in it and 624 characters.

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's delivered
on June 24, 624.

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:24.810 align:middle line:84%
20 years later to the
day Edward de Vere,

00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:26.280 align:middle line:84%
one of the
shakespeares, and I say

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:28.080 align:middle line:84%
one of because Bacon's
part of it as well.

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:28.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:31.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: One of-- he
is Edward de Vere.

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:35.740 align:middle line:84%
He supposedly dies
on June 24, 624.

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:38.420 align:middle line:84%
20 years prior,
the man we're told

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:40.450 align:middle line:84%
was Shakespeare,
Shackspere of Stratford,

00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:45.070 align:middle line:84%
he's supposedly baptized
on April 26, 426.

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:47.380 align:middle line:90%
The exact opposite of 624.

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:49.720 align:middle line:84%
The Shakespeare
sonnets dedication

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:52.640 align:middle line:84%
is six lines, two
lines, and four lines.

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And when you count the six
words, second four, six,

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:57.250 align:middle line:84%
through to the end,
it reveals a cipher.

00:31:57.250 --> 00:32:01.400 align:middle line:84%
It says these
sonnets all by evere.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:04.340 align:middle line:84%
Evere, a contraction of
the name Edward de Vere.

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:07.120 align:middle line:84%
Oh, Edward de Vere
is six letters,

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:08.410 align:middle line:90%
two letters, four letters.

00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:13.540 align:middle line:84%
He's also the Earl of Oxford
which is four, two, six, right?

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:18.520 align:middle line:84%
In the church where supposedly
the fake Shakespeare is buried,

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:24.630 align:middle line:84%
there's a monument that has
freemasonic symbols on it

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:26.190 align:middle line:90%
and Hebrew codes.

00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's in a pattern of
six, two, four, or four, two,

00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:32.767 align:middle line:90%
six this way.

00:32:32.767 --> 00:32:34.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
where really, you

00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:35.993 align:middle line:84%
were able to put
the pieces together.

00:32:35.993 --> 00:32:37.410 align:middle line:84%
When they watch
your show, they're

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:41.110 align:middle line:84%
going to see how carefully
you put them all together.

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:45.760 align:middle line:84%
So the question is,
who was Dee to de Vere?

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:46.930 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Cryptographer.

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:50.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He was-- so
when de Vere was writing,

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:54.490 align:middle line:84%
and he was writing in an
encrypted fashion, right?

00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:55.978 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: Well, they
would have to--

00:32:55.978 --> 00:32:58.270 align:middle line:84%
they would have had to have
combined on certain aspects

00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:00.790 align:middle line:84%
because the cryptography--
the cryptography

00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:02.975 align:middle line:90%
involves like your page.

00:33:02.975 --> 00:33:04.600 align:middle line:84%
You've got a page of
text on it, right?

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:07.120 align:middle line:84%
You've got to be able to put it
into a grid, which means just

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:09.245 align:middle line:84%
put all the letters, one
after the other like this.

00:33:09.245 --> 00:33:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And they reveal
vertically messages.

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:13.490 align:middle line:84%
That's what in
its simplest form.

00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:15.930 align:middle line:84%
It's a bit deeper than
that but its simplest form.

00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they would
have collaborated?

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:19.222 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: They would
have collaborated

00:33:19.222 --> 00:33:23.470 align:middle line:84%
on integral things that involved
wording in a sonnet or wording

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:24.610 align:middle line:90%
in some of the plays.

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:27.020 align:middle line:84%
So there's no doubt that they
collaborated in that sense.

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:27.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:29.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: But he is not
known as a poet at all.

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:31.570 align:middle line:84%
He wrote some
poetry that was bad.

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:31.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:34.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: But he was the
most brilliant mathematician

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:36.640 align:middle line:84%
of the time, and
cryptographer of the time.

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:38.658 align:middle line:90%
And he passed the mantle on to--

00:33:38.658 --> 00:33:40.450 align:middle line:84%
he was the leading--
he was the grandmaster

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:41.680 align:middle line:90%
of the Rosicrucians.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And he passed that mantle
on to Francis Bacon, who

00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:47.480 align:middle line:84%
later is pretty much known
by the Rosicrucian fraternity

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:51.662 align:middle line:84%
and the Freemasons as being
their guy of the time.

00:33:51.662 --> 00:33:53.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, the Hermetics
also acknowledged Bacon

00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:54.620 align:middle line:90%
as one of the shakespeares.

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:54.890 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Of course they do.

00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:55.765 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:33:55.765 --> 00:33:57.920 align:middle line:84%
So we can assume that
that story is not--

00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.480 align:middle line:90%
this doesn't debunk that story.

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:00.280 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: No.

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:03.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It brings in another
author in a very intimate way.

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And so why again,
what I wonder is

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:09.170 align:middle line:84%
because it was so
dangerous in the day,

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:12.860 align:middle line:84%
why would this information
need to-- why did de Vere even

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:16.219 align:middle line:84%
want his place to be
passed through Shakespeare

00:34:16.219 --> 00:34:18.139 align:middle line:90%
and presented before the public?

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:19.820 align:middle line:90%
What was the advantage?

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:21.710 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just
sheerly entertainment.

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:25.250 align:middle line:84%
It was telling stories that had
some meaning personally to he

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:26.719 align:middle line:90%
and Elizabeth and depth.

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:27.554 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Yeah.

00:34:27.554 --> 00:34:29.179 align:middle line:84%
First of all, he
couldn't help writing.

00:34:29.179 --> 00:34:30.020 align:middle line:90%
He's a great artist, right?

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:30.920 align:middle line:90%
He's going to write.

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:31.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:31.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:31.850 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't stop himself.

00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: And like
all great art, it

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:36.620 align:middle line:84%
will meet you on whatever level
you can receive it at, right?

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:39.409 align:middle line:84%
So I might see this, a
Titian painting and go,

00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:42.050 align:middle line:84%
that's beautiful but I might
not know the symbology in it

00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:43.530 align:middle line:90%
or the geometry in it.

00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:46.850 align:middle line:84%
It's the same with everybody
that does great art.

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:49.679 align:middle line:84%
So he's writing it
on multiple levels.

00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:50.880 align:middle line:90%
So it's just fine.

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:54.395 align:middle line:84%
If you want entertainment
and swashbuckling, and lots

00:34:54.395 --> 00:34:56.270 align:middle line:84%
and lots of writers have
written all this up.

00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:58.402 align:middle line:84%
We know Shakespeare
deep on that level.

00:34:58.402 --> 00:35:00.860 align:middle line:84%
He's the greatest writer ever,
whether you like him or not,

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:02.160 align:middle line:90%
doesn't matter.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:03.260 align:middle line:90%
It's damn good stuff.

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:03.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:03.920 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Right.

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:04.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's good stuff.

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:04.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Get into it.

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:06.963 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Hey, you have
to read it in junior high.

00:35:06.963 --> 00:35:10.020 align:middle line:84%
So it has to have some storyline
plot, emotions, something

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:10.820 align:middle line:90%
naughty.

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:10.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Yeah.

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:13.730 align:middle line:84%
And it really contains all the
beauty, and all the horror,

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:15.830 align:middle line:84%
and everything imaginable
that happens on Earth.

00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:18.590 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
there's this deepest,

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:21.150 align:middle line:84%
deepest spiritual message
that is coming through,

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:22.743 align:middle line:90%
which only comes through.

00:35:22.743 --> 00:35:23.660 align:middle line:90%
Well, it doesn't only.

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:25.950 align:middle line:84%
You can read the spiritual
message in the works.

00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:30.430 align:middle line:84%
But in the codes, he
is literally saying,

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:32.890 align:middle line:90%
"I am that I am."

00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:37.000 align:middle line:84%
The name of God that is
forbidden by King James

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.880 align:middle line:84%
writes a law in
1606, law of abuses.

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:41.720 align:middle line:90%
Can't say the name of God.

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:42.520 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:43.750 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:44.950 align:middle line:90%
They can't do it.

00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:48.280 align:middle line:84%
In sonnet 121, he just
says, "No, I am and I am."

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, he should have
been hung drawn and quartered

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:52.150 align:middle line:90%
several times for that.

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:53.690 align:middle line:90%
But he just says it.

00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:56.403 align:middle line:84%
And as I show in
the series, it's

00:35:56.403 --> 00:35:58.570 align:middle line:84%
everywhere in the beginning
and end of all his works

00:35:58.570 --> 00:35:59.370 align:middle line:90%
and in the middle.

00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:01.570 align:middle line:84%
He's obviously got a
very, very clear notion

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:03.940 align:middle line:84%
of wanting to give a
straightforward message.

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And the message is that name
of God, the I am, he's saying,

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:10.980 align:middle line:90%
"It's you."

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:14.190 align:middle line:84%
"I am an enlightened
being," he's saying.

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:15.120 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he has to be.

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:16.330 align:middle line:90%
He's up there, right?

00:36:16.330 --> 00:36:17.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:17.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: So is Dee.

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:18.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, indeed.

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: So is Bacon.

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:19.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:22.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: They're all in whatever
level that is, whatever.

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:23.820 align:middle line:90%
Yes, Elizabeth.

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:27.750 align:middle line:84%
They're all here on this
other level to deliver.

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:29.190 align:middle line:90%
It's a scripture.

00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:31.030 align:middle line:84%
I can only refer to
it as a scripture.

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:31.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:34.038 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: But different from
any other scripture where

00:36:34.038 --> 00:36:36.990 align:middle line:84%
they tell you to believe
by faith, Kingdom of God

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:38.812 align:middle line:84%
is within you as
all scriptures say.

00:36:38.812 --> 00:36:40.020 align:middle line:90%
And all of them, that's fine.

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:40.920 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful.

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:44.400 align:middle line:84%
But he's now in a new age,
and he adds mathematics to it.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:47.662 align:middle line:84%
He hides on the
surface of the poetry

00:36:47.662 --> 00:36:48.870 align:middle line:90%
like on the cover of the sun.

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:51.300 align:middle line:84%
It's pointing into the
Great Pyramid of Giza,

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:52.600 align:middle line:90%
for God's sake.

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:53.400 align:middle line:90%
What's that doing?

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:57.190 align:middle line:84%
He's telling you history
is a lot more mysterious

00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.990 align:middle line:90%
than you think.

00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:59.430 align:middle line:84%
There's deep
knowledge hidden here

00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:00.998 align:middle line:84%
and we were helped
by greater beings

00:37:00.998 --> 00:37:02.040 align:middle line:90%
to build these monuments.

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:02.840 align:middle line:90%
He's saying that.

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:05.130 align:middle line:84%
But the overall thing
that I love most of all

00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:09.460 align:middle line:84%
is he comes to the end and he's
saying, this much misunderstood

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:11.800 align:middle line:90%
"to be or not to be."

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.240 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean?

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:16.430 align:middle line:84%
It's the most well known
line in all of literature.

00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And he's really saying, you can
be or not be who you truly are.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.530 align:middle line:84%
We can keep on
wearing this mask.

00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:25.360 align:middle line:90%
I love drama.

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.580 align:middle line:84%
All the world's a stage, and
all the men and women, right?

00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:28.240 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:28.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:29.707 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Don't get me wrong.

00:37:29.707 --> 00:37:31.720 align:middle line:90%
You can be that.

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:33.250 align:middle line:84%
We can keep on
wearing these masks

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:35.440 align:middle line:84%
and play every role
we want to forever.

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:37.550 align:middle line:90%
That's creation.

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:44.710 align:middle line:84%
Or you can take the mask off and
be who we truly are, the I am.

00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:46.240 align:middle line:90%
And thus, his ultimate message.

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:48.190 align:middle line:90%
And it's very compelling.

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:49.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's very compelling.

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And I just-- I can't help
but look at it cyclically.

00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:54.220 align:middle line:84%
Where there are
periods of history

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:57.130 align:middle line:84%
where the doors are open, so to
speak for information to begin

00:37:57.130 --> 00:37:58.150 align:middle line:90%
flowing forward.

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And then I mean, going as far
back to Lemuria, Atlantis,

00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:06.290 align:middle line:84%
Egypt, ancient Egypt, forward
Greece, Rome, now here.

00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And so I can't help but think
about the characters whose

00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:16.750 align:middle line:84%
destiny has always been to
reinforce or help humanity

00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:22.560 align:middle line:84%
remember these critical messages
at the time the door is open

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:23.820 align:middle line:90%
and they reincarnate.

00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:24.762 align:middle line:90%
That's what I was--

00:38:24.762 --> 00:38:26.220 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean to
say anything to you

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.290 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not supposing
anything or anyone.

00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:31.020 align:middle line:84%
But when people come through
with such unique talents

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:33.420 align:middle line:84%
and skills, with such
a unique message,

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:35.730 align:middle line:84%
I can't help but think,
they're here again

00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:39.010 align:middle line:84%
and they keep coming
at the right time.

00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel that what you've
done is here at the right time?

00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:43.680 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Yes, definitely.

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:45.412 align:middle line:84%
There is a timing
to it that is clear.

00:38:45.412 --> 00:38:46.620 align:middle line:90%
You see it everywhere, right?

00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:48.430 align:middle line:90%
All the openings of--

00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:52.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so you're part of
the message is, I am that I am.

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:53.670 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:54.760 align:middle line:90%
To be or not to be.

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:55.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: It's
accepting it, you see.

00:38:55.890 --> 00:38:56.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:58.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: What I came to--
what I started with earlier.

00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:00.780 align:middle line:84%
I'd done this whole almost
another incarnation,

00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:02.610 align:middle line:84%
it feels to me, like
these five record

00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:05.000 align:middle line:90%
labels and going look at me.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just getting--

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:06.510 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: I'm going--

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Playing with power--

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:09.698 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: Why am I doing
silly pub songs, right?

00:39:09.698 --> 00:39:13.260 align:middle line:90%
And then I went to, oh, must be.

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:14.760 align:middle line:90%
Don't even express anything.

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:19.350 align:middle line:84%
You're just less than a
speck on this table, right?

00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And I swear, it took me a long
time to get comfortable with it

00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:25.982 align:middle line:84%
because I had still this
block of, you must--

00:39:25.982 --> 00:39:26.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes, yes.

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:27.740 align:middle line:90%
Be humble.

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:32.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: I finally did recognize
that of course, we all have

00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:34.790 align:middle line:90%
our journey and our mission.

00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:38.572 align:middle line:84%
It's a big word, our own
purpose in coming here.

00:39:38.572 --> 00:39:39.780 align:middle line:90%
And I know it was my purpose.

00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:40.580 align:middle line:90%
I understood.

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:42.330 align:middle line:90%
I was shown it various ways.

00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:44.250 align:middle line:84%
But I had to get
over this idea, "I

00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:47.760 align:middle line:84%
don't want to become
this razzle dazzle."

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:51.060 align:middle line:84%
But why did I learn
how to razzle dazzle?

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:51.860 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:53.815 align:middle line:84%
Why was I-- why was I
given that opportunity?

00:39:53.815 --> 00:39:55.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think to have
the strength of character

00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:58.460 align:middle line:84%
for when the time came to
deliver the message you really

00:39:58.460 --> 00:39:59.430 align:middle line:90%
came here to do.

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:00.680 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: And we are all there.

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:00.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We are.

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: It's the
same for all of us.

00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And being able to say it
and own it gives, I believe,

00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:09.050 align:middle line:84%
other people permission
to recognize and go,

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:11.018 align:middle line:84%
"Yeah, he's talking
about-- yeah,

00:40:11.018 --> 00:40:13.310 align:middle line:84%
I have that feeling sometimes
but I can't talk about it

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:14.720 align:middle line:84%
in case what will
the friends say

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:16.305 align:middle line:90%
and my neighbors and my family."

00:40:16.305 --> 00:40:17.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, sure.

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:18.097 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: It's natural.

00:40:18.097 --> 00:40:20.750 align:middle line:84%
That is more real
than our everyday life

00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:21.890 align:middle line:90%
here that we're going.

00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:22.880 align:middle line:90%
How about them Lakers?

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:23.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:24.737 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, how about them Lakers?

00:40:24.737 --> 00:40:26.570 align:middle line:90%
So one final question then.

00:40:26.570 --> 00:40:31.190 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think that message,
I am that I am or to be or not

00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:34.220 align:middle line:84%
to be, why do you think it
was so important that message

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:37.040 align:middle line:84%
couldn't be said
expressly in the day?

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:38.510 align:middle line:90%
Why did it have to be buried?

00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:39.427 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: You couldn't.

00:40:39.427 --> 00:40:40.630 align:middle line:90%
Church.

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:41.630 align:middle line:90%
We'll take care of that.

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:46.118 align:middle line:84%
No, you can't even have
the mass in English.

00:40:46.118 --> 00:40:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And keep it in Latin so you
don't really understand it.

00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:49.580 align:middle line:90%
We're in charge.

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:50.997 align:middle line:90%
Keep donating to us.

00:40:50.997 --> 00:40:52.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's kind of
a rhetorical question

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:53.010 align:middle line:90%
but exactly.

00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:54.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: You can't
talk to angels.

00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:55.130 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:56.760 align:middle line:90%
That's our provenance, right?

00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:59.490 align:middle line:84%
Whilst we're doing unspeakable
things in the name of religion.

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:00.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:03.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: So we're at--
we're about to explode out

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:07.320 align:middle line:84%
of that old, I'm not
criticizing anyone's faith

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:11.460 align:middle line:84%
who has a sincere deep belief
in their religion, right?

00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:14.850 align:middle line:84%
But all of the various
religions, really

00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:16.830 align:middle line:84%
some of the great
masters of our time

00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:18.962 align:middle line:84%
have all come to
tell us it's all one.

00:41:18.962 --> 00:41:19.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's all one.

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:20.530 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: It's all the same.

00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:21.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're
just trying to let

00:41:21.330 --> 00:41:23.092 align:middle line:90%
go of the dogmas of control.

00:41:23.092 --> 00:41:24.300 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: So why at that time?

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:25.925 align:middle line:84%
It was the-- it was
a that time because

00:41:25.925 --> 00:41:28.470 align:middle line:90%
of tremendous oppression.

00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Hey, burning people
at the stake.

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:31.937 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:31.937 --> 00:41:33.270 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Of course, we have to--

00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:35.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the
message is, I am

00:41:35.490 --> 00:41:40.080 align:middle line:84%
that I am, or a choice to
be you truly, the true you

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:40.980 align:middle line:90%
or not to be.

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:41.970 align:middle line:90%
To wear the mask.

00:41:41.970 --> 00:41:44.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: Or to wear the
mask and be good at it.

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:46.410 align:middle line:84%
It's not even judging
the first one.

00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:46.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:46.770 --> 00:41:48.000 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Because he's saying.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.375 align:middle line:84%
An interesting
thing about this I

00:41:49.375 --> 00:41:53.610 align:middle line:84%
only realized a few days ago, he
says, "All the world's a stage,

00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:55.410 align:middle line:84%
and all the men and
women merely players.

00:41:55.410 --> 00:41:58.610 align:middle line:84%
They have our exits
and our entrances."

00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:00.098 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, why did?

00:42:00.098 --> 00:42:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Did he get that the
wrong way around?

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:04.790 align:middle line:84%
It should be we have our
entrances and exits on stage.

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:06.230 align:middle line:90%
Oh, they came in, they went out.

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:08.090 align:middle line:90%
He says, "Exits and entrances."

00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:09.680 align:middle line:84%
He never did
anything by mistake.

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:10.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:12.860 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: Exiting to
get on to the stage.

00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:16.380 align:middle line:84%
Oh, we have our exits
from the divine to come.

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And now we have our
exits to go back home.

00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:22.130 align:middle line:84%
Pretty well, our
entrance is back home.

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:23.630 align:middle line:90%
Pretty brilliant.

00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:24.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely brilliant.

00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And you're such a
wonderful storyteller.

00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, just natural
Bard, but also it's

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:33.900 align:middle line:84%
your abilities that I feel
you have brought through.

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:37.700 align:middle line:84%
So I want to say thank you
for coming back metaphorically

00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:40.650 align:middle line:90%
and figuratively both.

00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:43.520 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for coming back
and laying this out for us

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:45.230 align:middle line:84%
because as we said
in the beginning,

00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:46.920 align:middle line:90%
truth actually does matter.

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:50.010 align:middle line:84%
This is-- we're at a
time where yes, it does

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:51.260 align:middle line:90%
matter who wrote these things.

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:53.070 align:middle line:84%
It does matter that
we're not having things

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:56.933 align:middle line:84%
passed off and of something one
dimensional and entertaining

00:42:56.933 --> 00:42:58.350 align:middle line:84%
when actually
there's beauty in it

00:42:58.350 --> 00:43:00.180 align:middle line:84%
that we need to be
reminded of now.

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:01.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: Because then we
can understand it even more.

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:04.320 align:middle line:84%
When you know the life of the
person who did the writing,

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:07.070 align:middle line:84%
it all comes to technicolor
in Wizard of Oz.

00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:09.570 align:middle line:84%
It's like moment of just, oh,
because we don't know anything

00:43:09.570 --> 00:43:10.370 align:middle line:90%
about Shakespeare.

00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And they teach in school,
don't bother about that.

00:43:13.410 --> 00:43:14.500 align:middle line:90%
We have the works.

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:15.570 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:18.750 align:middle line:84%
When you actually tie
the life to the works,

00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:20.910 align:middle line:84%
you realize, oh,
that he's right.

00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:23.490 align:middle line:84%
All writers write about their
own personal experience, right?

00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And it comes to
life and then you

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:29.322 align:middle line:84%
can go, "Oh, I have this much
more comprehensive view."

00:43:29.322 --> 00:43:30.780 align:middle line:84%
"Oh, and that's
referring to that."

00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:32.500 align:middle line:84%
It becomes immensely
more interesting.

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:33.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh yeah, absolutely.

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:34.840 align:middle line:90%
Let me ask you.

00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:37.380 align:middle line:84%
Was it de Vere that
wrote "Romeo and Juliet?"

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:40.230 align:middle line:84%
Is that the belief rather
than Bacon or someone else?

00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:41.430 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: I don't know.

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:44.640 align:middle line:84%
Again, I can't say
exactly who wrote what.

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:48.330 align:middle line:84%
Look, if I were a betting
person, I'd say it's de Vere.

00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:51.000 align:middle line:84%
But when I get to the astral
and find out for sure, I'll--

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:51.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let us know.

00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: Or if you get
there first, let me know.

00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:55.578 align:middle line:90%
Honestly, I don't care.

00:43:55.578 --> 00:43:56.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, just wondering.

00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:57.150 align:middle line:90%
It was just out of curiosity.

00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:58.067 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: I don't care.

00:43:58.067 --> 00:43:59.070 align:middle line:90%
I think it's de Vere.

00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:02.680 align:middle line:84%
I think Bacon was more towards
the cryptographic stuff.

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:03.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:05.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: But that's
also borne out

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:07.980 align:middle line:84%
by the codes that repeat
his name over and over.

00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:10.290 align:middle line:84%
But really, honestly,
I say I say, now,

00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:13.950 align:middle line:84%
look, I'm a non-Freudian and
whatever you want to call it.

00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:14.920 align:middle line:90%
I don't care.

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:17.160 align:middle line:84%
I just want the truth
because the world deserves

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:19.800 align:middle line:84%
the truth and these people,
whoever they were collectively,

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:23.880 align:middle line:84%
they all put-- they put a lot
of effort into telling us this.

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And getting us a new kind of
scripture that is interesting,

00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:29.940 align:middle line:90%
mathematics, it's provable.

00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:32.790 align:middle line:90%


00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:34.770 align:middle line:90%
Math is provable, poetry isn't.

00:44:34.770 --> 00:44:36.630 align:middle line:10%
You can't prove
anything with poetry.

00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:38.340 align:middle line:10%
As beautiful as it
is, you can't prove.

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:39.780 align:middle line:90%
Can you prove that's beautiful?

00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:40.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I agree with you.

00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:41.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GREEN: Can you prove love?

00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:42.050 align:middle line:90%
No, you can't.

00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:42.850 align:middle line:90%
That's mystic.

00:44:42.850 --> 00:44:43.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:43.650 --> 00:44:45.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GREEN: The other
side, it's a balance

00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:46.580 align:middle line:90%
of left and right brain.

00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:47.380 align:middle line:90%
It has to be.

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:49.037 align:middle line:84%
It's alchemy, the
pure balance of both.

00:44:49.037 --> 00:44:50.370 align:middle line:90%
And that's what he's telling us.

00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's why he hid
the math in it as well.

00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Alan,
what an absolutely,

00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:58.620 align:middle line:84%
just not just scintillating
story but useful story

00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:00.190 align:middle line:90%
for our own development.

00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:01.708 align:middle line:90%
And again, I say thank you.

00:45:01.708 --> 00:45:03.250 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for the
series you've done.

00:45:03.250 --> 00:45:04.708 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
coming on with me

00:45:04.708 --> 00:45:07.270 align:middle line:84%
so I could just get wrapped
into the story with you myself.

00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:08.070 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:10.200 align:middle line:84%
You can watch the
details of the code Alan

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:12.120 align:middle line:84%
has discovered on
his series with Gaia

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:13.452 align:middle line:90%
called Shakespeare Decoded.

00:45:13.452 --> 00:45:15.910 align:middle line:84%
You've already heard a little
bit of what's going on there.

00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:18.320 align:middle line:84%
It's very meaty and
very intriguing.

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:22.550 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Open Minds.

00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:28.000 align:middle line:90%
