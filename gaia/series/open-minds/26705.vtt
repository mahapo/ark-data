00:00:20.055 --> 00:00:22.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: If you're one
of the fortunate people who've

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.860 align:middle line:84%
been to the great
sites in Egypt,

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.810 align:middle line:84%
you may have been
struck by the largeness

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.590 align:middle line:84%
and majesty of the
pyramids and statues.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.530 align:middle line:84%
But did you ever stop and wonder
how this artisanship could've

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.297 align:middle line:84%
been produced thousands of years
before any mechanical tools?

00:00:36.297 --> 00:00:38.130 align:middle line:84%
Christopher Dunn could
think of nothing else

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.180 align:middle line:84%
as he stood before
Ramesses II at Luxor.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Dunn came to the conclusion
that the absolute symmetry

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.720 align:middle line:84%
and perfection of
Ramesses' face could only

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.680 align:middle line:84%
have been done with advanced
engineering and tools.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.440 align:middle line:84%
I was able to meet up with
Christopher at the Yuga Cycles

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.530 align:middle line:84%
Conference in Nevada
City recently where

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.600 align:middle line:90%
he shared his story.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Christopher, what's
so interesting to me

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.430 align:middle line:84%
is that not thousands, not even
hundreds of thousands, millions

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.310 align:middle line:84%
of people have walked by and
through the same edifices,

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.720 align:middle line:84%
past the same beautiful face
of Ramesses that you have,

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.027 align:middle line:84%
and yet, they don't ask some
really essential questions

00:01:17.027 --> 00:01:17.860 align:middle line:90%
that you have asked.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And now in this
field, you're being

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.070 align:middle line:84%
heralded as having done some
incredible work because you're

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.820 align:middle line:84%
bringing the proofs to the table
that these incredible statues

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.252 align:middle line:84%
were not just random
works by primitives.

00:01:34.252 --> 00:01:35.271 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRIS DUNN: No.

00:01:35.271 --> 00:01:37.477 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not.

00:01:37.477 --> 00:01:39.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going
to go into that,

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.320 align:middle line:84%
but before we go into
your work on the geometry

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.940 align:middle line:84%
and the perfection, the
mechanical perfection

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.180 align:middle line:84%
of these famous not only
dwellings, but also statues,

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.940 align:middle line:84%
works of stone
art, I want to talk

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.110 align:middle line:84%
about the civilizations--
disappearance of civilizations.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.770 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems that we're left
with so little after the time

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:01.630 align:middle line:90%
passes.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.960 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us how an
entire civilization simply

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.310 align:middle line:90%
disappears, disintegrates?

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.600 align:middle line:84%
Even what would happen
with our own civilization

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.030 align:middle line:84%
with what we have
in it right now?

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.960 align:middle line:90%
How's that work?

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Well, you know it's an
interesting question, actually

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.420 align:middle line:84%
central to the whole discussion
of ancient civilizations

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.720 align:middle line:84%
and what level of technology
they may have had.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.830 align:middle line:84%
We don't have any
problem discussing

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.380 align:middle line:84%
end of the world
scenarios today.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.220 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we say that it's not a
matter of if something is going

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.515 align:middle line:84%
to happen, an earthquake
or some major disturbance,

00:02:41.515 --> 00:02:44.140 align:middle line:84%
a super volcano,
something like that,

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.900 align:middle line:84%
because they have
happened in the past.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.610 align:middle line:84%
It's a matter of when they're
going to happen again.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a part of
the modern narrative,

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.260 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what may
lie ahead in the future.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:03.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we look into the past
and we discuss the destruction

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.960 align:middle line:84%
of civilizations in the
past, several methods

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.090 align:middle line:90%
have been proposed.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And either one of
them-- any of them

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.290 align:middle line:84%
could actually take our
civilization down and send us

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.405 align:middle line:84%
back to a medieval
primitive society

00:03:21.405 --> 00:03:23.590 align:middle line:90%
with a lot of destruction.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.710 align:middle line:84%
So if we go back to
75,000 years ago,

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.860 align:middle line:84%
when the volcano
Toba was released--

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.930 align:middle line:84%
it released a massive
amount of energy--

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.020 align:middle line:84%
there was a destruction of
humanity on a very, very

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:45.610 align:middle line:84%
large scale and what they call
an extinction event, where

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.920 align:middle line:84%
the people on the
planet were reduced

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.410 align:middle line:84%
to just a few thousand
people around the globe,

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.170 align:middle line:90%
and then they had to build back.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.240 align:middle line:90%
But that was 75,000 years ago.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.910 align:middle line:84%
Now when it comes to
looking at ancient sites

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.600 align:middle line:84%
and looking at the, say,
the pyramids and the temples

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.880 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt and some of the
marvelous architecture,

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.670 align:middle line:84%
and the statues, there
is a huge disconnect

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:21.570 align:middle line:84%
between what we know that's
in the archaeological record,

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.360 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the tools that
were available at that time,

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.580 align:middle line:90%
and what we see.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And as an engineer, when
I look at the tools that

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.910 align:middle line:84%
are offered by
Egyptologists in museums

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.540 align:middle line:84%
and also that they
describe in books,

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.780 align:middle line:84%
and when I compare
that to the artifacts

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.440 align:middle line:84%
that I'm studying as an
engineer, the two don't fit.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Because it would be impossible
to create, say, a Ramesses

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.100 align:middle line:84%
statue with a stone chisel and
a wooden hammer or just grinding

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.520 align:middle line:84%
it out with sand and bone
or something like that.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just a ridiculous
notion to think of it that way.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.111 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet, that's
what is still being taught.

00:05:06.111 --> 00:05:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: That's what
kids have been taught.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what's being
taught in our universities.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: That's what
is being taught, yes.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at the era
where these ideas were actually

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.600 align:middle line:84%
presented and then handed down
through the education system,

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.100 align:middle line:84%
you have to go back to the
early days of Egyptology, which

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:28.680 align:middle line:84%
is back in the 1800s, when
William Flinders Petrie was

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.920 align:middle line:90%
in Egypt and his studies.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, you go back
to that period,

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.710 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at a
Victorian mindset.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And so without actually having
to replicate the most difficult

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.920 align:middle line:84%
aspects of the work, which is
really-- the real challenge is

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.840 align:middle line:84%
to actually take those tools
and replicate what the ancient

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.180 align:middle line:90%
Egyptians did.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.715 align:middle line:90%
And nobody's been able to do it.

00:05:51.715 --> 00:05:52.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Even today.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:53.130 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Even today.

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.546 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With the
sophisticated--

00:05:54.546 --> 00:05:56.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Not with the
tools-- not with the tools

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.990 align:middle line:84%
that were in the
Egyptian's toolbox.

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Now, I know it seems
to be a very popular idea

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.820 align:middle line:84%
that the tools to do this
work are not available today,

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.190 align:middle line:84%
but that's because
a lot of people

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.540 align:middle line:84%
don't really understand what
tools are available today

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.040 align:middle line:90%
to perform the work.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And there are tools,
very sophisticated tools.

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And there's also
simple tools that

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.210 align:middle line:84%
could be applied to recreate
some of these artifacts.

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.110 align:middle line:84%
It would stretch our
capabilities to do that.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:35.710 align:middle line:84%
But certainly we could
employ our modern tools

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.120 align:middle line:84%
to perform a lot of the work
that the ancient Egyptians did.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, but we're
talking modern tools.

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.680 align:middle line:90%
Not tools from 5,000 years ago.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Or 3,000 or 4,000
or 5,000 years ago,

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.720 align:middle line:84%
which is what we're looking
at in the case of most

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.720 align:middle line:90%
of this work, right?

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Yes.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.660 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Egyptian toolbox
had copper chisels, copper adze,

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:01.030 align:middle line:84%
stone chisels, stone balls
for bashing the stone.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.050 align:middle line:84%
And then just what we
know primitive people did

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.070 align:middle line:84%
to shape materials, which is
take some sand, a piece of bone

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.430 align:middle line:84%
or a piece of wood or another
stone and just rub it away.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.830 align:middle line:84%
Just keep rubbing, rubbing,
rubbing until you come

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.235 align:middle line:90%
to the final shape.

00:07:17.235 --> 00:07:18.735 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What
stands-- also, you're

00:07:18.735 --> 00:07:21.210 align:middle line:84%
talking granite
and quartzite, some

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:23.347 align:middle line:84%
of the toughest
materials on the planet.

00:07:23.347 --> 00:07:23.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Right.

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And the ancient
Egyptians were actually

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:30.090 align:middle line:84%
cutting the igneous
rocks, granite, basalt,

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:35.230 align:middle line:84%
and they were cutting it with
efficiency and precision.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And the geometry, the perfection
is cut into the stone.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And also the geometry,
which is remarkable.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And some of it's
almost as smooth as glass,

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:51.980 align:middle line:84%
when you're looking at the
lack of imperfections in it,

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:56.440 align:middle line:84%
which we will go into once we
start getting into Ramesses'

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.920 align:middle line:84%
headdress and Ramesses'
face, the crown and so forth.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.890 align:middle line:84%
It's fascinating what
you've come up with.

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And you've been many
times over there,

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:06.157 align:middle line:84%
you've taken lots
of measurements,

00:08:06.157 --> 00:08:07.740 align:middle line:84%
lots of photographs
because you wanted

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.500 align:middle line:84%
to nail this thing
once and for all

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.130 align:middle line:84%
and get this story of
primitives off the table.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:15.050 align:middle line:84%
Not that it's off the
table in academic circles.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is a big fight
with you, Robert Schoch,

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:19.060 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the other
presenters here

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.070 align:middle line:84%
and many conferences
I've been to.

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:22.630 align:middle line:84%
The big question
is what is it going

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:27.216 align:middle line:84%
to take before academia will
open up to the new evidence.

00:08:27.216 --> 00:08:28.590 align:middle line:84%
But meanwhile,
when we're looking

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:31.140 align:middle line:84%
at disappearing technologies
and civilizations,

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.820 align:middle line:84%
there was one quirky little
fact in your book I just loved.

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.929 align:middle line:84%
And it was about
the-- I believe it

00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:38.059 align:middle line:84%
was about the
engine, the starting

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:42.049 align:middle line:84%
mechanism on the engine in
the original space missions

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:42.960 align:middle line:90%
to the moon.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:43.460 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Yes.

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.920 align:middle line:84%
That was written by
Dr. Alan Andrews,

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.490 align:middle line:90%
who is a mechanical engineer.

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And he worked at the White
House for a few years.

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:54.910 align:middle line:84%
He wrote the forward to-- one
of the forwards to my book.

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And he was meeting
with a NASA scientist

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:00.550 align:middle line:84%
and they were talking
about lost technologies.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And we talk about lost
technologies of the past,

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:04.760 align:middle line:84%
and he referred to
the lost technologies

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.640 align:middle line:84%
of the present, where the
Saturn V engine, there's

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.340 align:middle line:84%
nobody around that actually
knows the starting sequence

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.700 align:middle line:90%
or how to do it.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.057 align:middle line:84%
Evidently, they took it
to the grave with them.

00:09:16.057 --> 00:09:17.140 align:middle line:90%
And there's a lot of that.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:21.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a lot of modern
technologies that are obsolete.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:23.960 align:middle line:84%
Or relatively modern,
that have been

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:29.730 align:middle line:84%
created since the start of
the Industrial Revolution.

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:33.450 align:middle line:84%
They've become obsolete and
we employ new technologies.

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:36.050 align:middle line:90%


00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:38.040 align:middle line:90%
The pace is dizzying in a way.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It is dizzying now,
and so we are perpetually

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:44.441 align:middle line:90%
looking for these missing links.

00:09:44.441 --> 00:09:46.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Yes, the missing links.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And today though, when
we look into the past,

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.375 align:middle line:84%
our tools are more
sophisticated and we

00:09:53.375 --> 00:09:56.770 align:middle line:84%
are better-equipped to
actually study the past

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:59.210 align:middle line:84%
and actually gather
that information.

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:03.950 align:middle line:84%
So I think there
should be-- I'm not

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:08.170 align:middle line:84%
saying that academic
Egyptologists would not

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.610 align:middle line:84%
eventually come around to
it or what it would take.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.970 align:middle line:84%
If they don't-- usually they
will follow the crowd or follow

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:14.680 align:middle line:90%
the money.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And when you're actually
following a particular path

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:21.946 align:middle line:84%
and you look behind you and you
find out nobody's behind you

00:10:21.946 --> 00:10:24.610 align:middle line:84%
following you, I think
that's when they'll probably

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:26.455 align:middle line:90%
get the picture.

00:10:26.455 --> 00:10:27.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.360 align:middle line:90%
Very good point.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Now what's interesting, I
find, about all of this,

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:34.290 align:middle line:84%
and I think in some of
Edgar Casey's work, which

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:38.870 align:middle line:84%
went fairly deeply into what
the times and life in Egypt

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:41.350 align:middle line:84%
were like, and even more
ancient civilizations

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:43.170 align:middle line:90%
than that, which is fascinating.

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And through another
source I was once told,

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.860 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptians didn't
do anything, especially

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.010 align:middle line:84%
in what was left
behind, that did not

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:55.120 align:middle line:84%
have very specific
purpose behind it.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:11:00.470 align:middle line:84%
These aren't random,
willy-nilly pieces of artwork.

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Every one of these
things has purpose

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:06.810 align:middle line:84%
that we're walking by thinking,
oh, isn't that special?

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:09.040 align:middle line:84%
This beautiful
40-foot tall statue,

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.370 align:middle line:90%
wonder what that was all about?

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's how the average
tourist goes under it.

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:15.420 align:middle line:10%
Now, you have
studied Ramesses II

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:19.030 align:middle line:10%
in particular over and
over and over again as

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:22.140 align:middle line:10%
kind of a hallmark
or a touchstone

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:25.460 align:middle line:10%
into this new field
of understanding.

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:27.350 align:middle line:10%
Talk about your
personal experience,

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.710 align:middle line:10%
how this began,
and then let's go

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:31.382 align:middle line:10%
into what you
started discovering.

00:11:31.382 --> 00:11:33.715 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNN: Well, if you consider
that the temples are there

00:11:33.715 --> 00:11:38.550 align:middle line:10%
to educate, they educate
on many different levels.

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:43.430 align:middle line:84%
And the education I
received was, originally

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:45.460 align:middle line:84%
I went to the temples
without much interest

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.730 align:middle line:84%
in what the temples
were about, because I

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:50.710 align:middle line:84%
was more interested
in engineering stuff.

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.620 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't go to the
temples when I first

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.360 align:middle line:90%
went to Egypt in 1986.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:58.970 align:middle line:84%
But I do go to Memphis,
there, the Saqqara,

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:00.360 align:middle line:90%
and I saw the Ramesses there.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.765 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
that's a well-made statue.

00:12:02.765 --> 00:12:04.572 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:12:04.572 --> 00:12:08.870 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
really was significant to me

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:10.810 align:middle line:84%
was that the nostrils
were identical.

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:12.750 align:middle line:84%
If you look down the
length of it and you say,

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:14.246 align:middle line:84%
well, those nostrils
are identical.

00:12:14.246 --> 00:12:15.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Probably the only
person that ever thought that.

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:16.281 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Yeah.

00:12:16.281 --> 00:12:17.945 align:middle line:84%
Why would I be talking
about nostrils?

00:12:17.945 --> 00:12:21.620 align:middle line:84%
But it seemed significant to
me, because nobody's nostrils

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:24.440 align:middle line:90%
are identical or symmetrical.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.940 align:middle line:90%
So I filed that away.

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:32.130 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was just something
that I noted and that was it.

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And then the next time it
became more relevant was in 2004

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:40.440 align:middle line:84%
and I was going into
the Luxor Temple, which

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:45.600 align:middle line:90%
is-- that is very experiential.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.310 align:middle line:84%
You are overcome when you
go into the Luxor Temple

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:53.470 align:middle line:84%
because of the grandeur,
the majesty of the statues,

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:56.240 align:middle line:84%
the columns and the way
they actually present

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.380 align:middle line:84%
the whole temple at
night when it's lit up

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.876 align:middle line:90%
and it's absolutely gorgeous.

00:13:01.876 --> 00:13:03.980 align:middle line:90%
But I was distracted.

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:07.630 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptologist was talking
about the history of Ramesses

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:10.550 align:middle line:84%
and the kings and
the hieroglyphs

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:13.840 align:middle line:84%
on the wall and the reliefs and
what they meant symbolically.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:18.100 align:middle line:84%
My interest was more-- was drawn
towards some granite artifacts

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:21.570 align:middle line:84%
that were kind of
shining in the dusk.

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:26.868 align:middle line:84%
And I walk over to one and I ran
my hand over the surface of it.

00:13:26.868 --> 00:13:28.576 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That must
have been in the days

00:13:28.576 --> 00:13:29.992 align:middle line:84%
when you could
touch things still.

00:13:29.992 --> 00:13:31.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Yes, it was.

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And I just ran my hand over it
and I said, this is perfect.

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:39.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it just felt
really, really smooth.

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:43.640 align:middle line:84%
Almost like I can
recall in manufacturing,

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:49.060 align:middle line:84%
making manufacturing dies
to make different objects.

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And they have to be very
precise, very smooth.

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And it was just like
running my hand over a die.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.440 align:middle line:90%
But it was made out of granite.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And what they were was a
white crown of upper Egypt.

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:04.040 align:middle line:84%
And these are conical
shaped crowns.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.960 align:middle line:84%
These things,
though, were large.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:10.270 align:middle line:84%
The raw block probably
would've weighed about a ton,

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:12.340 align:middle line:84%
and they sit on the
top of the statues.

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, these had obviously
fallen off in antiquity

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:20.210 align:middle line:84%
and now they sit in front of the
statues in the Ramesses Hall.

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:24.640 align:middle line:84%
So that was my first hint that
there was something special

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:28.010 align:middle line:84%
about the Ramesses statue,
because the quality of the work

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:33.670 align:middle line:84%
was-- not only were they
incredibly beautiful,

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:38.510 align:middle line:84%
mysterious in a way, but the
engineer's side of my brain

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:42.080 align:middle line:84%
wanted to know more from
a factual perspective,

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:45.550 align:middle line:84%
and to actually take
some measurements

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.500 align:middle line:84%
and study them more so
I could find out just

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:53.070 align:middle line:84%
exactly how the ancient
Egyptians made these things.

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:57.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, that stayed with
me for a couple of years.

00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:59.040 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have time to go back.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.730 align:middle line:84%
We were on a tour and
I didn't have time

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:03.560 align:middle line:84%
to go back and do
any further studies.

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:08.760 align:middle line:84%
But I went back in 2006
and I took a digital camera

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.290 align:middle line:90%
this time.

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And as a side note, I would
say that digital cameras,

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.030 align:middle line:84%
the way they have
evolved today--

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:19.040 align:middle line:84%
I've been employed
in manufacturing

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.080 align:middle line:84%
and they are very
prolific in manufacturing.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.700 align:middle line:84%
So we use them in
manufacturing to examine

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.690 align:middle line:90%
artifacts of modern day.

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And we can measure them through
digital data that we acquire

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:32.580 align:middle line:90%
and computers.

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And we can also take them
and send to customers

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:39.550 align:middle line:84%
if there is a question
about a particular feature.

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:43.340 align:middle line:84%
So the digital camera has become
a real force in manufacturing

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.830 align:middle line:90%
for metrology and measurement.

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And so I took a digital camera
the next time and my laptop.

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:54.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, the thing I
wanted to do was

00:15:54.950 --> 00:16:00.170 align:middle line:84%
to take photographs of
the statue, the crowns,

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:03.890 align:middle line:84%
and take the photograph
on the central axis

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:08.140 align:middle line:84%
so I could determine the
symmetry and the geometry.

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And what I found was perfect
symmetry, and perfect geometry.

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
slide that shows

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:16.610 align:middle line:84%
that, it's really quite
shocking because what

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:18.390 align:middle line:84%
are we talking about
dimension-wise,

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:23.310 align:middle line:84%
say from one cheekbone
to another in feet?

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:29.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Well, I estimated that
the Ramesses face is probably

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:31.230 align:middle line:90%
about 30-inches across.

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And I could only do
that by comparing

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:38.150 align:middle line:84%
a photograph and a
person standing by it

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:40.770 align:middle line:84%
and knowing the width
of a human head.

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And then scaling it
up to the Ramesses

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:49.410 align:middle line:84%
and then determining
what the dimension was.

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:53.580 align:middle line:84%
But to get a really accurate
measure, a definitive measure,

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.200 align:middle line:84%
you'd have to have
physical tools

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.525 align:middle line:90%
and actually take measurements.

00:16:56.525 --> 00:16:57.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just rough--yeah.

00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:59.566 align:middle line:84%
That's what I was looking
just kind of roughly

00:16:59.566 --> 00:17:01.070 align:middle line:90%
to get the idea of scale.

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: It's roughly six times
the size of a human head.

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:09.369 align:middle line:84%
But the Ramesses
face itself, as you

00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:13.670 align:middle line:84%
know-- when you go through a
museum, you'll see statues,

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:17.200 align:middle line:84%
you'll see art,
you'll see sculptures

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.505 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of
things of beauty

00:17:20.505 --> 00:17:22.940 align:middle line:90%
that are there for you to enjoy.

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:28.180 align:middle line:84%
In three dimension, as you walk
around them, the point of view

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.550 align:middle line:90%
is constantly changing.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And so, the Ramesses statue,
as you walk around it,

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:37.490 align:middle line:84%
you get a different perspective
at each step around it.

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:41.020 align:middle line:84%
But you're not looking at
it the way the engineers

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.640 align:middle line:90%
or the designers were.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Because encoded in the
statue, I discovered,

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:48.710 align:middle line:90%
was a specific geometry.

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And because they had made so
many of the Ramesses statues,

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.900 align:middle line:84%
over 100, that
geometry would have

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.660 align:middle line:84%
had to have been applied
on every single one

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.050 align:middle line:90%
in order to make the face.

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:01.591 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So these
were manufactured.

00:18:01.591 --> 00:18:04.354 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Manufactured
statues, yeah.

00:18:04.354 --> 00:18:05.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:06.980 align:middle line:90%
And the same geometry?

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:08.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: The same geometry.

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:12.740 align:middle line:84%
The same geometric
protocol that was

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:16.560 align:middle line:84%
carried from one statue to the
next to the next to the next,

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:22.500 align:middle line:84%
not left to the whims of
a sculptor and a hammer

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:23.370 align:middle line:90%
and chisel.

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:28.300 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, clearly
disciplined and precise

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:31.080 align:middle line:90%
reproduction of each statue.

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:32.379 align:middle line:90%
Quite incredible.

00:18:32.379 --> 00:18:33.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
absolutely incredible.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.564 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's
incredible particularly

00:18:35.564 --> 00:18:37.480 align:middle line:84%
because we're looking
through the lens of what

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:40.250 align:middle line:84%
is being taught to this
point in terms of the source.

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:42.190 align:middle line:84%
The source materials,
the source skills

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:44.220 align:middle line:84%
and talents and
aptitudes of people

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:47.660 align:middle line:84%
back in that period of time,
which is obviously not correct.

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:48.710 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Not correct, no.

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:50.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not correct at all.

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:52.722 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk a little
bit about the headpieces

00:18:52.722 --> 00:18:55.180 align:middle line:84%
that you're talking about, the
crowns you're talking about,

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:57.720 align:middle line:84%
just to give people an
idea of what these are,

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.900 align:middle line:84%
what they're called,
what they represent,

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:02.210 align:middle line:84%
and why they're
historically thought

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:05.530 align:middle line:84%
to be on the head of
the kings and Pharaohs.

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:09.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Well, the crowns
of upper and lower Egypt

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:15.320 align:middle line:84%
are actually combined
in some of the crowns

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.370 align:middle line:90%
on the statues of Ramesses.

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:20.820 align:middle line:84%
So you would have the white
crown and the red crown

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:22.350 align:middle line:90%
of lower Egypt together.

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:24.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When we see
the really tall ones

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:25.670 align:middle line:90%
that have the the ball on top?

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:26.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Right.

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:29.460 align:middle line:10%
And the interesting
thing about those

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:34.380 align:middle line:10%
crowns as I found out as
I started to delve deeper,

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.210 align:middle line:10%
it was like peeling an onion.

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:40.420 align:middle line:10%
You've got one layer after
another, so you do an analysis.

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:42.690 align:middle line:90%
That gives you certain data.

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And then you ask
further questions

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.180 align:middle line:84%
and then you go a little
deeper, a little deeper.

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And through that process,
I was able to determine

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:55.630 align:middle line:84%
that those crowns are
actually ellipsoids,

00:19:55.630 --> 00:20:00.162 align:middle line:84%
physical ellipsoids, tilted
back on the head of Ramesses.

00:20:00.162 --> 00:20:02.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, tell us
the significance of this

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:05.110 align:middle line:84%
if we don't understand
as lay people.

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Because the ellipse,
just the concept of the ellipse

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:11.070 align:middle line:84%
was not discussed
until the Greeks,

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:13.810 align:middle line:90%
according to our history.

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And so, the Greeks were the
first to actually present

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:22.900 align:middle line:84%
an ellipse and discuss
the math behind it

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:24.030 align:middle line:90%
and the design behind it.

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And so here you have
in Egypt a prolific use

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:32.950 align:middle line:84%
of not just an ellipse, which
is a 2-dimensional drawing,

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:36.910 align:middle line:84%
but an ellipsoid which
is a 3-dimensional solid.

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And the elements
of the ellipse is--

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:41.950 align:middle line:84%
ellipsoids that are
in the white crowns

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:47.990 align:middle line:84%
can marry to the red crown
are quite clear once you're

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:52.120 align:middle line:84%
able to study it in a
CAD Cam or CAD program

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:57.190 align:middle line:84%
and define the geometry of
it, which is what I did.

00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:01.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's an amazing testament
to the ancient Egyptians

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:04.760 align:middle line:84%
and it was an
inspiring discovery.

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Aren't
we finding, though,

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:09.560 align:middle line:84%
through a lot of
different sciences

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.190 align:middle line:84%
that are approaching looking
at our historical roots

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:13.980 align:middle line:84%
and the history of
knowledge and what

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:16.500 align:middle line:84%
we have on the planet
today, aren't they

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:20.940 align:middle line:84%
beginning to discover that it
didn't start with the Greeks.

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:23.880 align:middle line:84%
More and more evidence
is coming to the surface

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:28.770 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of what has been
given credit to the Greeks

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:31.980 align:middle line:84%
was actually from a
previous time handed down

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.010 align:middle line:90%
to them from the Egyptians.

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Yeah.

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:38.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean it is--
Pythagoras was supposed

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:41.160 align:middle line:84%
to have entered the
Egyptian Mystery Schools

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:45.940 align:middle line:84%
and he probably learned
the 3-4-5 triangle

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.720 align:middle line:90%
from the Egyptians.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And so the information
may have been discussed

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:58.430 align:middle line:84%
in cloistered rooms where
just the high priest had

00:21:58.430 --> 00:21:59.600 align:middle line:90%
that knowledge.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:03.440 align:middle line:84%
It may have been handed down
through the oral tradition

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.950 align:middle line:84%
or from generation
to generation,

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:08.090 align:middle line:84%
like a guild or
something of that nature,

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:11.940 align:middle line:84%
but not available to
the general public.

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:16.910 align:middle line:84%
But when you actually
understand the geometry

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:21.980 align:middle line:84%
and you understand
how things are made,

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:26.020 align:middle line:84%
you can see that all the
elements that we credit

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:27.660 align:middle line:84%
the Greeks with
being the first--

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:31.590 align:middle line:84%
the geometry that we credit
the Greeks with inventing--

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:33.172 align:middle line:84%
were already known
by the Egyptians.

00:22:33.172 --> 00:22:35.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Those are thousands
of years prior to that.

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:35.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Thousands of
years before that.

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:37.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so now
let's get into it

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:42.470 align:middle line:84%
from a mechanical
engineering point of view.

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:45.460 align:middle line:84%
How would you guess they
were able to achieve

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:47.410 align:middle line:90%
this kind of perfection?

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And when you're looking
at the face, as you said,

00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:52.540 align:middle line:84%
the symmetry of
every single feature

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:55.460 align:middle line:84%
on the face right
down to the nostrils,

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.600 align:middle line:84%
and the symmetry
of the nostrils.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.420 align:middle line:84%
If you were trying to
kind of-- if you could

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:02.710 align:middle line:84%
be a fly on the
wall back then, how

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:05.790 align:middle line:84%
would you guess they
went about that?

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:06.620 align:middle line:90%
Through what means?

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:09.610 align:middle line:90%


00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: If I was an
engineer, say 50 years ago,

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:19.680 align:middle line:84%
with the tools that were
available to us 50 years ago,

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.000 align:middle line:84%
and we were looking
at these statues

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.010 align:middle line:84%
and talking about them like
we are now, we'd have to say,

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:30.190 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, obviously they were
using some kind of templates

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:32.200 align:middle line:84%
and they had an
arrangement of templates.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And they were fitting
these templates

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:38.570 align:middle line:84%
on the face to make sure
that the symmetry was there,

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:42.815 align:middle line:84%
and then blending between where
they had cut to the template.

00:23:42.815 --> 00:23:44.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Would
that be a stretch

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:46.300 align:middle line:84%
to assume that there was
a template of some kind?

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.410 align:middle line:84%
Or would that just be the
best you could come up

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:50.450 align:middle line:84%
with considering it
was 50 years ago?

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:55.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: That would be something
that an engineer 50 years ago

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:56.665 align:middle line:90%
would probably discuss.

00:23:56.665 --> 00:23:59.540 align:middle line:90%


00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:03.600 align:middle line:84%
But, however, when
you get into examining

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:07.780 align:middle line:84%
tool marks and the difference
between hand-working

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:12.340 align:middle line:84%
or sculpting, or hand-working
and then machine-working,

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:18.610 align:middle line:84%
you have distinct differences in
the tool marks that they leave.

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:21.440 align:middle line:84%
Because a machine
would leave a path,

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:25.810 align:middle line:84%
there would be a precise
path that the tool followed.

00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:30.900 align:middle line:84%
So when you combine the geometry
and you combine the precision

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:36.340 align:middle line:84%
with the evidence of a tool mark
that follows in parallel paths

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:40.370 align:middle line:84%
down a particular object, then
you've got all the evidence,

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:41.960 align:middle line:84%
you've got these
ghost marks, you've

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:46.415 align:middle line:84%
got the precision, geometry,
and you're actually

00:24:46.415 --> 00:24:52.940 align:middle line:84%
removing from the equation
the craftsman with a chisel.

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:54.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that
was what it wasn't.

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: So that's
what it wasn't.

00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:00.600 align:middle line:84%
So they actually had to
have been using machines

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:04.300 align:middle line:90%
to create these things.

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:05.890 align:middle line:84%
But that's not
the only evidence.

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:08.320 align:middle line:84%
We're just talking about
Ramesses right now.

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.090 align:middle line:84%
But then you start
looking elsewhere,

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:12.830 align:middle line:84%
and you find clearer
evidence of machines.

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:15.870 align:middle line:90%
But it's mind blowing.

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost
unbelievable in a sense

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:28.020 align:middle line:84%
that you can
conclude very clearly

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:32.460 align:middle line:84%
that the ancient Egyptians were
so advanced that they would

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:34.930 align:middle line:84%
have used very,
very precise machine

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:38.385 align:middle line:90%
tools in making statues.

00:25:38.385 --> 00:25:40.930 align:middle line:90%


00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:42.005 align:middle line:90%
Just in statues.

00:25:42.005 --> 00:25:43.505 align:middle line:84%
And that is an
incredible statement.

00:25:43.505 --> 00:25:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To say nothing of the
temples and the great edifices.

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:48.228 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: And then when you start
looking at everything else,

00:25:48.228 --> 00:25:50.900 align:middle line:84%
I was impressed
with the pyramids.

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:52.360 align:middle line:90%
And I still am, of course.

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, yes.
"Giza Power Plant."

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:59.050 align:middle line:84%
I saw you in a lecture, I
think, in 2006 in Sedona

00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:00.596 align:middle line:90%
presenting on that subject.

00:26:00.596 --> 00:26:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And we're going
to get into that.

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:03.810 align:middle line:90%
In fact, launch into it.

00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Well, anyway, the theory
I presented in "The Giza Power

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Plant" was very, very radical
and explosive, nonconventional.

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:18.300 align:middle line:84%
It made some people happy,
a lot of people mad.

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:24.820 align:middle line:84%
But it was a very, very
nonconventional theory.

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:27.280 align:middle line:84%
The idea that the
ancient Egyptians

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:30.340 align:middle line:84%
had machine tools of such
a high order of precision

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:34.720 align:middle line:84%
and efficiency has not
really settled well

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:38.460 align:middle line:84%
with even the general population
because there are no machines.

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:40.570 align:middle line:84%
People say, well,
where are the machines?

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is
is the engineers

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:47.840 align:middle line:84%
who look at this, who they can
visualize the machine tools,

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:50.230 align:middle line:84%
they can visualize the
tools that were actually

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:52.520 align:middle line:84%
used to make them,
and they can look

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:55.890 align:middle line:84%
at the ancient Egyptian
toolbox and they can say,

00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:57.240 align:middle line:90%
oh no, there's no way.

00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:02.600 align:middle line:84%
But the lay person, and
it's no fault of anybody,

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:06.380 align:middle line:84%
haven't even been around a
machine, so they don't know.

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:11.550 align:middle line:10%
And so we visualize the machines
actually doing this work,

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:16.940 align:middle line:10%
and we can recreate
machines, according

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:19.710 align:middle line:10%
to the technologies
that we have today.

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:23.000 align:middle line:10%
Some people may think that
the ancient Egyptians were

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.960 align:middle line:10%
even more advanced than we are.

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.810 align:middle line:90%
And that may be.

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:29.635 align:middle line:84%
But it would be a
stretch for-- it

00:27:29.635 --> 00:27:32.130 align:middle line:90%
would stretch our capabilities.

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:34.230 align:middle line:84%
Who would actually sit
down and decide, oh,

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:37.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to build this statue
that's going to weigh 600 tons,

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:41.940 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to be
ultra-precise and the granite

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:45.634 align:middle line:84%
is going to cost
about $500,000--

00:27:45.634 --> 00:27:46.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:48.008 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: -by the time
you got it quarried.

00:27:48.008 --> 00:27:51.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're going
to do about 100 of them.

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:54.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: So even though right
now the Ramesses statues

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:56.350 align:middle line:84%
are priceless, if we
had to recreate them,

00:27:56.350 --> 00:28:00.820 align:middle line:84%
it'd probably cost half a
billion dollars to do it.

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:01.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And in addition, you
have to start looking at,

00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:09.720 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's say we can accept now
that everybody watching this

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.120 align:middle line:84%
is beginning to understand
what we've been told

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.490 align:middle line:84%
and what we're being
told in academic circles

00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:17.150 align:middle line:84%
about the world history
and the history of Egypt

00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:18.689 align:middle line:90%
is no longer accurate.

00:28:18.689 --> 00:28:19.230 align:middle line:90%
It's invalid.

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:21.540 align:middle line:84%
We need to start
moving beyond that.

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:22.540 align:middle line:90%
We have a new story.

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:25.590 align:middle line:84%
This was a highly
advanced civilization

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:27.920 align:middle line:84%
that had mechanical
tools to build

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:33.980 align:middle line:84%
very precise buildings,
temples, artwork.

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:37.360 align:middle line:84%
Then you start looking at a
really more esoteric question,

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:38.870 align:middle line:90%
which is why?

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:41.880 align:middle line:84%
All this was left
behind for purpose.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.790 align:middle line:84%
What would happen if we
disappeared right now,

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:48.830 align:middle line:84%
everything in digital files,
what would be left of us

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:51.630 align:middle line:84%
besides a rusted out Chevy
truck here and there.

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:54.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really, what
would be left of us?

00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:55.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Nothing.

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:57.050 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Very little
would be left of us,

00:28:57.050 --> 00:28:59.950 align:middle line:10%
and we're considered kind of
the height of sophistication

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:01.680 align:middle line:10%
in many people's minds still.

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:06.525 align:middle line:10%
They left behind information
that is so deeply embedded

00:29:06.525 --> 00:29:09.090 align:middle line:10%
and encoded within
the hieroglyphics,

00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:13.190 align:middle line:10%
within the statues, within the
dimensions, the elliptoids,

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:17.132 align:middle line:10%
doesn't all of this start
relating to something larger?

00:29:17.132 --> 00:29:18.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're at a
Yuga Cycle Conference,

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:22.370 align:middle line:84%
which is the cycles of
awareness and consciousness.

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:26.120 align:middle line:84%
How does this start
fitting in the why?

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:28.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: That is one of
the deepest questions.

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:30.970 align:middle line:90%
The why.

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:35.360 align:middle line:84%
Our civilization, much
of what we've created

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:38.270 align:middle line:84%
would disappear over
a period of time.

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:42.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, our concrete roads,
asphalt roads, and automobiles.

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:47.350 align:middle line:84%
The show "Life After People,"
was a very good description.

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:48.719 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I haven't seen it yet.

00:29:48.719 --> 00:29:49.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I'd like to see it.

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:52.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: I mean, it's
another of those--

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:55.730 align:middle line:84%
it's part of the dialogue about
end of the world scenarios

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:57.826 align:middle line:84%
where, if something happens
to our civilization,

00:29:57.826 --> 00:29:59.300 align:middle line:90%
this is what's going to happen.

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:03.080 align:middle line:84%
This started out in the 1970s,
the Office of Technology

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:04.800 align:middle line:90%
Assessment at the White House.

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.025 align:middle line:84%
They wondered what would
happen after a nuclear war,

00:30:07.025 --> 00:30:08.780 align:middle line:90%
and they did a study on that.

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And we'd essentially be returned
back to a medieval society.

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:16.350 align:middle line:84%
We'd have machine tools
that we couldn't operate

00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:18.131 align:middle line:84%
because we wouldn't
have any electricity.

00:30:18.131 --> 00:30:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No paper
trail, that's all dust.

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:20.463 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Right.

00:30:20.463 --> 00:30:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And then what would we do
with the machine tools?

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:25.770 align:middle line:84%
We'd cut them up,
tear them down.

00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:27.540 align:middle line:90%
We'd use them for other stuff.

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:29.722 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, they
would rust away.

00:30:29.722 --> 00:30:31.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you're
saying what happened

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:33.500 align:middle line:90%
in ancient civilizations too.

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:37.130 align:middle line:84%
As our consciousness devolved,
a lot of what was lying about

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:41.000 align:middle line:84%
would be, as you say, melted
down, reused, re-purposed.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: And the
ancient Egyptians,

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.820 align:middle line:90%
though, they built for eternity.

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:49.675 align:middle line:84%
And they built in hard
igneous rock and, you know,

00:30:49.675 --> 00:30:55.920 align:middle line:84%
massive elements: massive blocks
of granite, diorite, limestone.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:59.573 align:middle line:84%
All stones they built
with are just-- they're

00:30:59.573 --> 00:31:02.030 align:middle line:90%
incredible, incredible.

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And so much of it
all over the country.

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:08.310 align:middle line:84%
They're finding
more every day, too.

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:14.920 align:middle line:84%
So they did the two scenarios,
and I think you touched on one,

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:18.880 align:middle line:84%
and that was did they
create this intentionally

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.610 align:middle line:84%
because they knew the
world was going to end

00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:24.690 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted to leave
something for the future?

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:25.790 align:middle line:90%
That is one question.

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:30.680 align:middle line:84%
The other one is, was it
just that their civilization

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:35.990 align:middle line:84%
and what was
important to them, it

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:39.210 align:middle line:84%
was important enough
that they would actually

00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:44.451 align:middle line:84%
create something that would
last, that was impervious.

00:31:44.451 --> 00:31:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And so, which scenario
would you go with?

00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:54.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if the ancient
Egyptians were building

00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:57.590 align:middle line:84%
for the benefit of
future civilizations.

00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:59.519 align:middle line:84%
I think they were--
it may be both.

00:31:59.519 --> 00:32:00.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It may be both.

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:03.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: It may be both.

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:07.100 align:middle line:84%
Everybody needs to think
about the next generation,

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:10.150 align:middle line:84%
because we do carry
on into the future.

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:13.317 align:middle line:84%
And what do we leave
future generations?

00:32:13.317 --> 00:32:14.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, yes.

00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's been suggested
that if we truly

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:20.200 align:middle line:84%
understood what was in those
hieroglyphics, what they

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:24.790 align:middle line:84%
actually mean, that that's a
pathway back to our future.

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:25.850 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Yes.

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:29.400 align:middle line:84%
The hieroglyphics, that's a
totally different subject.

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.814 align:middle line:84%
And I am not an expert
on hieroglyphics.

00:32:31.814 --> 00:32:32.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know you're not.

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:35.340 align:middle line:84%
I know you're not, but
you've been around enough.

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And you've certainly been around
enough of these other players.

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: There's some-- Yeah.

00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:42.627 align:middle line:84%
I have another
collection of photographs

00:32:42.627 --> 00:32:44.960 align:middle line:84%
that I haven't published yet,
and I'm probably not going

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:47.920 align:middle line:84%
to talk about it right now, but
they are taken in the temples.

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And they are, when
viewed a certain way,

00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:53.110 align:middle line:90%
they are quite interesting.

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:54.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you
have a mind that

00:32:54.610 --> 00:32:57.540 align:middle line:90%
views things in a certain way.

00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And I know you
can't talk about it

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:02.980 align:middle line:84%
too much, because it may
be the work that you want

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:05.360 align:middle line:84%
to put together and really
think about and assemble

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.810 align:middle line:84%
for your next book,
but can you give us

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:12.640 align:middle line:84%
just a glimpse of your
feelings or your impressions

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:17.460 align:middle line:84%
of what you were looking at
when viewed a certain way?

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:20.650 align:middle line:84%
I know that's a little
sneaky, but that's the juice.

00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:26.700 align:middle line:90%


00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:29.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Just like the
statues, the physical objects,

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:34.220 align:middle line:84%
when you look at them in a
particular and very specific

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:38.030 align:middle line:84%
way, they have
another story to tell.

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And then some of the reliefs,
not necessarily hieroglyphs

00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:47.700 align:middle line:84%
because there are reliefs on
some temple walls that really

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:52.980 align:middle line:84%
have a very loose, murky
interpretation, not a very

00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:54.860 align:middle line:90%
clear interpretation.

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:59.930 align:middle line:10%
But if you look at those
in a particular way,

00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:03.050 align:middle line:10%
then they provide another story.

00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:05.820 align:middle line:10%
And that's all I
can say right now.

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:07.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, a
couple of other people

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:09.110 align:middle line:84%
that we've interviewed
in the past

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:12.650 align:middle line:84%
have indicated that
some of these images

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:15.639 align:middle line:84%
may even point to advanced
technology devices that

00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:17.870 align:middle line:90%
may have existed at that time.

00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:19.670 align:middle line:84%
There's the famous
one you see floating

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:24.446 align:middle line:84%
about that appears
to be a helicopter.

00:34:24.446 --> 00:34:28.730 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of these
anomalous things like--

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: I went to Abydos and I
photographed the famous Abydos

00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:35.929 align:middle line:90%
helicopter.

00:34:35.929 --> 00:34:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And I used a telephoto
lens, so that I

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.159 align:middle line:84%
could get a really good
close-up image of it,

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:47.130 align:middle line:84%
and then look at it,
examine it in my computer.

00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not afraid
to say, I must

00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:54.320 align:middle line:84%
say that the
Egyptologists are correct.

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:58.330 align:middle line:84%
That it is a combination--
they call it a palimpsest.

00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:04.770 align:middle line:84%
So it's a combination of an
earlier relief or inscription

00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:07.507 align:middle line:84%
and then it's been changed
and added over time.

00:35:07.507 --> 00:35:08.465 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And added to.

00:35:08.465 --> 00:35:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you see from
an engineering point of view.

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:14.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: And even from an
engineering point of view,

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:17.060 align:middle line:84%
or even an aerospace
engineering point of view,

00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:20.680 align:middle line:84%
if you look at it, it would
never work as a helicopter

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:23.362 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't have
a tail rotor on it and--

00:35:23.362 --> 00:35:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, some
missing pieces.

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:28.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: -and the
horizontal rotor

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:30.184 align:middle line:84%
would clip off the
stabilizer at the back.

00:35:30.184 --> 00:35:31.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:34.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's nice to clear that
up because that's something

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:36.900 align:middle line:84%
that-- everybody
throws that picture up.

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:38.190 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Yes.

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:41.400 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I think you have
to call it the way you see it.

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Because the one
thing that we don't want

00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:46.850 align:middle line:90%
is confusion.

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:49.730 align:middle line:84%
And everybody has a
right to be wrong,

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:53.380 align:middle line:84%
and everybody has the
opportunity to be reeducated.

00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:57.320 align:middle line:84%
So I'm happy to take
anything on board

00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:59.420 align:middle line:84%
that would improve my
knowledge of the subject.

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:00.294 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:36:00.294 --> 00:36:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's juicy and fun to
think that that's a helicopter.

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:05.170 align:middle line:84%
Everybody loves
speculating about that.

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And there are some other
genuinely intriguing images

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:11.560 align:middle line:84%
that point to things that
could indicate what's coming up

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:15.170 align:middle line:84%
for us in the future with some
of our technologies and devices

00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:16.050 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:17.184 align:middle line:90%
But I agree with you.

00:36:17.184 --> 00:36:18.850 align:middle line:84%
The whole point of
doing the work you're

00:36:18.850 --> 00:36:22.560 align:middle line:84%
doing so meticulously is
to dispel misperceptions

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:26.010 align:middle line:84%
about the past, so you've
got to be fair about it.

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And if it means you take
away our little helicopter,

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:30.310 align:middle line:90%
well, fine.

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:31.250 align:middle line:90%
That's just fine.

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:33.064 align:middle line:90%
That's one small thing.

00:36:33.064 --> 00:36:34.480 align:middle line:84%
So anyone that was
really attached

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.684 align:middle line:84%
to the helicopter, bye-bye
for now on that one

00:36:36.684 --> 00:36:38.350 align:middle line:84%
unless there's other
evidence presented.

00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:43.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Well, that's
just my analysis of it.

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:45.872 align:middle line:84%
Other people may disagree
with me, that's fine.

00:36:45.872 --> 00:36:46.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:48.950 align:middle line:90%
This is an open dialogue.

00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:51.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, one area you
opened up a lot--

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:53.900 align:middle line:84%
and we just touched on it
before in "The Giza Power

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:56.130 align:middle line:84%
Plant," which was
your previous work,

00:36:56.130 --> 00:37:02.560 align:middle line:84%
was your very close examination
of the King's Chamber,

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:05.640 align:middle line:84%
the Queen's Chamber, the
Great Pyramids at Giza.

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And you came to some rather
startling conclusions

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:13.080 align:middle line:84%
as you really went--
you went through this.

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And some of it is
being now validated,

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:20.050 align:middle line:84%
from what I heard you
say even this morning.

00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:21.340 align:middle line:90%
We have time.

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:24.930 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what you discovered
in your work at the pyramids

00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:29.360 align:middle line:84%
and what's been validated, and
what they may have actually

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.970 align:middle line:90%
been built for to begin with.

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:33.560 align:middle line:90%
Let's just put this aside.

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:36.080 align:middle line:90%
These were not elaborate tombs.

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:37.490 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Right.

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:41.310 align:middle line:84%
So if we take it
from the ground up.

00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:44.690 align:middle line:84%
"The Giza Power Plant"
was published in 1998,

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:47.900 align:middle line:84%
and it proposed a theory that
the great pyramid was not

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:48.570 align:middle line:90%
a tomb.

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:50.660 align:middle line:84%
None of the pyramids
were tombs originally.

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:52.680 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were used
later to be tombs,

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:55.200 align:middle line:84%
but there were no original
burials in pyramids.

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.880 align:middle line:90%
So the pyramids are not tombs.

00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:00.110 align:middle line:10%
And I focused particularly
on the Great Pyramid because

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:03.800 align:middle line:10%
of the design that
was available,

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:11.280 align:middle line:10%
and most information available
is about the Great Pyramid.

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:13.920 align:middle line:84%
So in examining that
question, if they

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:19.860 align:middle line:84%
weren't tombs, what were they,
I focused on all the evidence.

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And the test that I had for
myself was every single feature

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:30.150 align:middle line:84%
in the Great Pyramid has
to have an explanation

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:33.640 align:middle line:84%
for a theory in order
for the theory to fit.

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:36.630 align:middle line:84%
And any information that was
forthcoming in the future

00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:39.080 align:middle line:84%
had to either
support the theory,

00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:42.425 align:middle line:84%
or the theory must be
changed or thrown out.

00:38:42.425 --> 00:38:44.216 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were
doing it scientifically.

00:38:44.216 --> 00:38:45.030 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Yes.

00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:48.460 align:middle line:84%
You've got to follow the
scientific method, yes.

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:53.620 align:middle line:84%
And so the basic hypothesis
was that the Great Pyramid

00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:56.250 align:middle line:84%
was a coupled
oscillator that vibrated

00:38:56.250 --> 00:38:57.617 align:middle line:90%
in sympathy with the Earth.

00:38:57.617 --> 00:38:59.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And explain
what that means,

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:01.890 align:middle line:84%
a coupled oscillator
that vibrates in sympathy

00:39:01.890 --> 00:39:03.320 align:middle line:90%
with the Earth to us.

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:05.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Well, a
coupled oscillator

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:10.390 align:middle line:84%
would be a vibrating
body, like a tuning fork.

00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And if you put a tuning
fork on a vibratory object,

00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:18.590 align:middle line:84%
then the tuning fork would
vibrate in sympathy with it.

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And the transfer
of energy would be

00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:24.180 align:middle line:84%
maximized if the frequencies
were matched harmonically.

00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:28.100 align:middle line:90%


00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:33.130 align:middle line:84%
So it's like striking
a C on the piano,

00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:41.390 align:middle line:84%
and an octave higher, you
have two harmonic frequencies.

00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And if you would strike
one note on the piano,

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:50.370 align:middle line:84%
other strings would vibrate
in sympathy with that one note

00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:53.190 align:middle line:84%
if you left the
strings undampened.

00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:54.460 align:middle line:90%
So it's a transfer of energy.

00:39:54.460 --> 00:40:01.030 align:middle line:84%
But the coupled oscillator
is a vibrating body

00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:04.450 align:middle line:84%
that is attached to a
larger vibrating body.

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And as long as the larger
vibrating body continues

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:11.690 align:middle line:84%
to give up energy, then
that coupled oscillator

00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:14.180 align:middle line:84%
will absorb it and vibrate
in sympathy with it.

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:17.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the larger
entity was the Earth.

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:23.000 align:middle line:84%
So you have the Earth and you
have the pyramid vibrating

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.330 align:middle line:84%
at roughly the same
frequency and the same tone.

00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:30.280 align:middle line:84%
There's a tone that's affiliated
with this on this scale, right?

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:31.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Yes.

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:34.650 align:middle line:90%
The Earth has many frequencies.

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it was
in, I think, 1997

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:41.670 align:middle line:84%
when they discovered
that the Earth had a hum.

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:47.880 align:middle line:84%
But the hum was detected
through seismic frequencies

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:52.910 align:middle line:84%
because we have many seismic
events in the Earth every day,

00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:56.480 align:middle line:84%
but those seismic events
were causing the Earth

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:57.970 align:middle line:90%
to ring like a bell.

00:40:57.970 --> 00:41:00.560 align:middle line:90%
So they have these frequencies.

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And they were plumbed
out of a lot of data

00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:04.860 align:middle line:90%
and say, oh, this has a hum.

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:09.880 align:middle line:84%
And the hum is, I think, between
2 and 10 Hertz or something

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:10.460 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:11.751 align:middle line:90%
It's very infrasonic frequency.

00:41:11.751 --> 00:41:14.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the sound
is an F sharp, right?

00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:15.700 align:middle line:84%
Or that's the sound
of the pyramid.

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:18.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: The F sharp, F
sharp is the frequency

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:21.780 align:middle line:90%
inside the King's Chamber.

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing
about that frequency

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:31.990 align:middle line:84%
is that Tom Danley, who
is an acoustics engineer,

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:35.110 align:middle line:84%
did some studies in the
Great Pyramid in 1995,

00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:41.480 align:middle line:84%
and he detected a chord, an F
sharp chord that was actually

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:45.650 align:middle line:84%
still resonant
within that chamber.

00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:50.430 align:middle line:84%
With all external sources
of energy or sound

00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:53.080 align:middle line:84%
turned off that
would stimulate that,

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:58.150 align:middle line:84%
his equipment detected a
very, very low F sharp chord.

00:41:58.150 --> 00:42:00.310 align:middle line:84%
Infrasonic between
2 and 9 Hertz,

00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:03.240 align:middle line:90%
but it was still humming.

00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:06.539 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when you
showed in your presentation,

00:42:06.539 --> 00:42:08.080 align:middle line:84%
as I recall-- I
don't have the notes.

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:10.640 align:middle line:90%
It was six years ago.

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:14.880 align:middle line:84%
But I remember the
photographs of the shafts.

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And I think there was
even some baffling

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:18.980 align:middle line:90%
of some kind in those shafts.

00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:22.570 align:middle line:84%
How do those shafts
play acoustically?

00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:26.860 align:middle line:84%
How does that play into the
acoustic theory of the chamber?

00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: I think the baffling
that you are referring to,

00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:33.730 align:middle line:84%
or the resonate, is
in the Grand Gallery.

00:42:33.730 --> 00:42:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And the Grand Gallery is--
it's a passageway that

00:42:38.650 --> 00:42:40.930 align:middle line:84%
is about 82-inches
wide at the bottom,

00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:42.550 align:middle line:90%
42-inches wide at the top.

00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:45.930 align:middle line:90%
It's about 28-feet high.

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And so that passageway,
which is about 175-feet long,

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:52.675 align:middle line:90%
it has two slots on both sides.

00:42:52.675 --> 00:42:55.357 align:middle line:84%
And there's 27 pair of
these slots going up

00:42:55.357 --> 00:42:56.440 align:middle line:90%
the length of the gallery.

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.370 align:middle line:84%
But there are some
characteristics

00:42:58.370 --> 00:43:02.415 align:middle line:84%
of the gallery that other
researchers have detected.

00:43:02.415 --> 00:43:06.620 align:middle line:10%
And it has acoustic
properties in that

00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:10.290 align:middle line:10%
any sound that's generated
within that space

00:43:10.290 --> 00:43:12.880 align:middle line:10%
is directed through
the passageway

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:16.090 align:middle line:10%
and it resonates in the King's
Chamber, the so-called King's

00:43:16.090 --> 00:43:17.300 align:middle line:10%
Chamber.

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:23.500 align:middle line:84%
So that was a clue that this was
a very, very specially-designed

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:24.940 align:middle line:90%
space.

00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:28.300 align:middle line:10%
And with the slots and the
Giza power plant theory,

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:32.280 align:middle line:10%
I proposed they had resonators
that absorbed the energy coming

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:36.440 align:middle line:10%
through the pyramid
and turned that energy

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:38.504 align:middle line:10%
into airborne sound.

00:43:38.504 --> 00:43:39.420 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:44.440 align:middle line:10%
So it was generating sound
from-- the external aspect

00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:46.950 align:middle line:10%
of the pyramid was generating
sound, or only internally?

00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:48.245 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNN: Internally.

00:43:48.245 --> 00:43:50.550 align:middle line:10%
Yes, internally.

00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:54.160 align:middle line:10%
And the Grand Gallery, the
King's Chamber, itself,

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:57.280 align:middle line:10%
would actually absorb
those frequencies

00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:02.570 align:middle line:10%
when the pyramid was functioning
properly, or functioning

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:03.186 align:middle line:10%
properly.

00:44:03.186 --> 00:44:04.560 align:middle line:84%
Because there was
other equipment

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:06.780 align:middle line:84%
that was necessary
for it to do that.

00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:10.590 align:middle line:84%
But the Grand Gallery
with all the resonators

00:44:10.590 --> 00:44:15.130 align:middle line:84%
was picking up those
vibrations from the pyramid

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:19.240 align:middle line:84%
and actually converting them
and increasing the amplitude

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:22.600 align:middle line:84%
of the energy and
stepping the frequency up,

00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:27.320 align:middle line:84%
and then driving the
granite to resonance.

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:29.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now then, you
have to say why again?

00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:31.910 align:middle line:84%
We keep coming back to the
what can this be used for?

00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:33.430 align:middle line:90%
What was this designed for?

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
there's been discovery

00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:40.020 align:middle line:84%
in other pyramids, some
interesting information coming

00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:42.130 align:middle line:84%
out of the pyramids
in Bosnia, which we're

00:44:42.130 --> 00:44:43.980 align:middle line:84%
going to be going
to in a few months.

00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:46.020 align:middle line:84%
Even what's happening
underneath having

00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:48.520 align:middle line:84%
to do with catacombs,
for example,

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:50.260 align:middle line:90%
underneath a structure.

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And there are
particular properties

00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:57.921 align:middle line:84%
that seem to regenerate people
very, very quickly, in terms

00:44:57.921 --> 00:44:58.420 align:middle line:90%
of health.

00:44:58.420 --> 00:44:59.480 align:middle line:90%
Negative ions.

00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:00.760 align:middle line:90%
All of the above.

00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:06.620 align:middle line:84%
So after you looked
at this acoustic piece

00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:08.990 align:middle line:84%
to the King's
Chamber, what did you

00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:12.240 align:middle line:84%
come to in terms
of possible uses

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:14.110 align:middle line:84%
for that energy and
those acoustics?

00:45:14.110 --> 00:45:16.740 align:middle line:90%
What was this being used for?

00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:18.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Well, in
order to explain

00:45:18.590 --> 00:45:20.560 align:middle line:84%
that, you have to
explain everything else.

00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:22.187 align:middle line:84%
We talked about
the Grand Gallery.

00:45:22.187 --> 00:45:22.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Well, there are still
some unanswered questions

00:45:26.810 --> 00:45:29.220 align:middle line:90%
about certain features of it.

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And other evidence is probably
going to be forthcoming,

00:45:31.850 --> 00:45:35.350 align:middle line:84%
as it has been since
I wrote the book.

00:45:35.350 --> 00:45:38.460 align:middle line:10%
But the function that
I propose in the book

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:44.270 align:middle line:10%
was that the-- to explain the
subterranean chamber, which

00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:46.920 align:middle line:10%
is the lowest chamber
down the descending

00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:49.520 align:middle line:10%
passage-- about a
350-foot passage,

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:54.160 align:middle line:10%
and then you come into this
rough pit really it looks like.

00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:56.830 align:middle line:84%
I propose that
that-- in that pit,

00:45:56.830 --> 00:46:01.730 align:middle line:84%
there was the equipment
necessary to drive

00:46:01.730 --> 00:46:04.570 align:middle line:90%
the pyramid to resonance.

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:08.120 align:middle line:84%
So they've actually
primed-- to actually

00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:09.720 align:middle line:90%
prime the pump, so to speak.

00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:13.740 align:middle line:84%
They allow it to couple
with the Earth's vibration.

00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:16.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Am I mistaken,
or was there water?

00:46:16.830 --> 00:46:20.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Well, that's
an interesting question

00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:23.920 align:middle line:84%
because I had assumed
that there was

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:29.620 align:middle line:84%
some kind of mechanical
device that was being used.

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:34.750 align:middle line:84%
But there is another, I
think probably more efficient

00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:43.390 align:middle line:84%
and actually quite
an incredible method

00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:46.340 align:middle line:84%
of driving the
pyramid to resonance.

00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:48.280 align:middle line:90%
And it's been demonstrated.

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:51.980 align:middle line:84%
So this work has been
performed by an engineer

00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:54.650 align:middle line:90%
by the name of John Cadman.

00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And he was fascinated with
the subterranean chamber

00:46:58.570 --> 00:47:01.190 align:middle line:84%
and the Pharaoh's
pump theory that

00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:05.180 align:middle line:90%
was proposed by Edward Kunkel.

00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to actually
replicate Kunkel's experiment.

00:47:08.810 --> 00:47:12.000 align:middle line:84%
He found that the experiment
in the upper chambers

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.410 align:middle line:90%
did not work very well.

00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:19.110 align:middle line:84%
But he could make it work with
just the subterranean chamber.

00:47:19.110 --> 00:47:26.240 align:middle line:84%
But if he eliminated one
thing in Kunkel's design,

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:29.110 align:middle line:84%
it functioned like
a pulse generator.

00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:35.240 align:middle line:84%
And so it would just
drive a pounding pulse

00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:37.880 align:middle line:90%
through the Earth.

00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:40.530 align:middle line:84%
He was emailing me
for quite a while.

00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And because my mind was
turned to something different,

00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:47.720 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really pick
up on it that well.

00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:52.730 align:middle line:84%
But he was pretty persistent in
trying to get me to look at it.

00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:57.830 align:middle line:84%
So I flew out to
Washington, where

00:47:57.830 --> 00:48:00.500 align:middle line:84%
he lives, to
actually witness it.

00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And he had it set up on the
side of his hill near his house.

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, he
had created a model

00:48:07.830 --> 00:48:10.260 align:middle line:90%
of the subterranean chamber.

00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:18.020 align:middle line:10%
And he had piping coming from a
pond, which actually simulated

00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:19.630 align:middle line:10%
the descending passage.

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:21.750 align:middle line:10%
Water flowed
through that chamber

00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:25.930 align:middle line:10%
and then out to a waste gait
with a flapper valve on it.

00:48:25.930 --> 00:48:29.830 align:middle line:84%
So he turns a few valves, the
water starts flowing through.

00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And I'm walking around
and suddenly I'm

00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:36.486 align:middle line:84%
hearing, ba-boom,
ba-boom, ba-boom.

00:48:36.486 --> 00:48:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And the whole
ground-- the ground

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:41.814 align:middle line:90%
started to shake with this beat.

00:48:41.814 --> 00:48:43.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Almost
like a heartbeat.

00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:44.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: It was a heartbeat, yes.

00:48:44.810 --> 00:48:47.920 align:middle line:90%
It was incredible.

00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And it kind of like opened my
mind and my eyes, and I'm like,

00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:54.710 align:middle line:90%
this guy is onto something.

00:48:54.710 --> 00:49:00.890 align:middle line:84%
He's got something here that
would really do the job.

00:49:00.890 --> 00:49:04.425 align:middle line:84%
And this is a part of
the integral-- actually,

00:49:04.425 --> 00:49:10.030 align:middle line:84%
the prime part of the Great
Pyramid as a coupled oscillator

00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:13.100 align:middle line:90%
theory is making it work.

00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:13.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:19.590 align:middle line:84%
So what are the implications
of this, this pulse generator,

00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:22.230 align:middle line:84%
this heartbeat,
this resonance up

00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:24.050 align:middle line:84%
above in the chambers,
the acoustics.

00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:25.720 align:middle line:84%
What's the implication
of all this?

00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:29.060 align:middle line:90%
How does this come together?

00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:31.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: It comes together.

00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:34.022 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're not there yet.

00:49:34.022 --> 00:49:35.930 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:41.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: OK, so we gather
the energy from the Earth.

00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And really, the pyramid
is a perfect function.

00:49:46.590 --> 00:49:50.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was designed
and placed on the planet,

00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:51.870 align:middle line:90%
and represents the planet.

00:49:51.870 --> 00:49:54.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean Mother
Earth is definitely

00:49:54.830 --> 00:49:58.100 align:middle line:84%
encoded into the Great
Pyramid by its dimensions

00:49:58.100 --> 00:49:59.810 align:middle line:90%
and by the way it was designed.

00:49:59.810 --> 00:50:02.990 align:middle line:84%
So you have energy coming in
and you have a signal coming in

00:50:02.990 --> 00:50:10.540 align:middle line:84%
through the northern
shaft, and that is actually

00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:13.200 align:middle line:90%
bombarding our planet 24/7.

00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's the signal
from the universe that's

00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:17.310 align:middle line:90%
atomic hydrogen in the universe.

00:50:17.310 --> 00:50:20.390 align:middle line:84%
21 centimeters comes
through that northern shaft,

00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:23.040 align:middle line:84%
goes across to the
southern shaft.

00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:25.230 align:middle line:84%
But along the way,
something happens.

00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:29.110 align:middle line:84%
It collects energy and
it builds in energy

00:50:29.110 --> 00:50:32.110 align:middle line:84%
as it crosses to
the southern shaft.

00:50:32.110 --> 00:50:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And to explain
that, then we have

00:50:34.070 --> 00:50:38.150 align:middle line:90%
to say, oh, well, hydrogen.

00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:40.520 align:middle line:90%
Hydrogen microwave frequency?

00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:42.480 align:middle line:90%
Well, do we have hydrogen?

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:44.770 align:middle line:84%
Then you go to the
Queen's Chamber.

00:50:44.770 --> 00:50:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And then the whole subject of
the Queen's Chamber opens up,

00:50:48.690 --> 00:50:51.614 align:middle line:84%
and this is where they
produced the hydrogen.

00:50:51.614 --> 00:50:52.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:50:52.530 --> 00:50:55.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: You have the southern
shaft and the northern shaft.

00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:57.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now we
have the power plant.

00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: So now you
have your power plant.

00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:03.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, this certainly
was a multi-purpose device,

00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:04.020 align:middle line:90%
obviously.

00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:06.456 align:middle line:84%
But the degree of
technology that

00:51:06.456 --> 00:51:08.330 align:middle line:84%
would have to go into
building something that

00:51:08.330 --> 00:51:12.080 align:middle line:84%
could be utilized in
these ways, would we

00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:13.890 align:middle line:84%
be able to do that in
the same way today?

00:51:13.890 --> 00:51:16.465 align:middle line:84%
Do we have the knowledge
to do this today?

00:51:16.465 --> 00:51:19.405 align:middle line:90%


00:51:19.405 --> 00:51:20.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: You know,
I was contacted

00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:26.590 align:middle line:84%
by a physicist who specializes
in vibrational physics

00:51:26.590 --> 00:51:27.180 align:middle line:90%
in solids.

00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:35.065 align:middle line:10%
And he's working on
analysis of the acoustics.

00:51:35.065 --> 00:51:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And he read "The
Giza Power Plant,"

00:51:37.590 --> 00:51:42.025 align:middle line:84%
but he is a very intuitive
and creative physicist.

00:51:42.025 --> 00:51:46.020 align:middle line:90%
He's like Albert Einstein.

00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:47.870 align:middle line:84%
You usually find
that physicists are

00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:51.380 align:middle line:84%
more open-minded
than Egyptologists.

00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:56.990 align:middle line:84%
He's looking at the acoustics of
the Great Pyramid, particularly

00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:59.410 align:middle line:84%
the Grand Gallery and
the King's Chamber.

00:51:59.410 --> 00:52:02.940 align:middle line:84%
But he pointed out certain
acoustic signatures

00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:04.630 align:middle line:90%
within the King's Chamber.

00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:07.490 align:middle line:84%
So I'm hoping that he
will continue his research

00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:08.690 align:middle line:90%
and eventually publish.

00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:10.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I hope
you continue yours.

00:52:10.650 --> 00:52:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And I want to hear
about these things

00:52:13.390 --> 00:52:16.390 align:middle line:84%
that you've noticed from a
"certain perspective" when

00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:17.740 align:middle line:90%
we talk next time.

00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And until then, thank
you so much, Christopher.

00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:22.917 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: You are
more than welcome.

00:52:22.917 --> 00:52:25.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To learn more about
Christopher's discoveries,

00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:26.970 align:middle line:84%
you can pick up a
copy of his book,

00:52:26.970 --> 00:52:29.050 align:middle line:84%
"Lost Technologies
of Ancient Egypt,"

00:52:29.050 --> 00:52:31.270 align:middle line:84%
or visit his website,
which is gizapower.com.

00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:34.240 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, you might
also find my interviews

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:37.470 align:middle line:84%
with John Anthony West and
Robert Schoch very interesting

00:52:37.470 --> 00:52:38.586 align:middle line:90%
along the same line.

00:52:38.586 --> 00:52:40.710 align:middle line:84%
They can be found under
the Conscious Media Network

00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:42.170 align:middle line:90%
tab on Gaiam TV.

00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:43.280 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:46.080 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
us here on Gaiam.
