00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.560 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN SLATTER: From
an energetic viewpoint,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.540 align:middle line:84%
an allergy is an attempt
upon the part of the body

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.740 align:middle line:84%
to protect you against something
it thinks is going to harm you.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.910 align:middle line:84%
The question is, can we
change the body's mind?

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.250 align:middle line:84%
We have the subtle
bodies, we have chakras,

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.390 align:middle line:84%
we have meridians, but the one
that people rarely ever talk

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.259 align:middle line:90%
about is the mind of the body.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.230 align:middle line:84%
If this body's being
threatened, I'll

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.953 align:middle line:84%
do what I have to do
to protect myself.

00:00:36.953 --> 00:00:38.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Even if someone

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.560 align:middle line:84%
who hasn't been
hanging out on Earth

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.960 align:middle line:84%
comes and does a little
fly by incarnation,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.140 align:middle line:84%
you still inherit all of that
and it feels like your own.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.660 align:middle line:90%
Let's address ancestral memory.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.930 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: You would never
associate that with an allergy,

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.700 align:middle line:84%
and yet any symptom can be
related to an allergy based

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.260 align:middle line:90%
on the meridian.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.620 align:middle line:84%
For more than 20
years, she would hardly

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.570 align:middle line:90%
get out of her pajamas.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.790 align:middle line:84%
She went out and
got her hair done.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.480 align:middle line:84%
She made a beautiful
dinner, got her makeup on,

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.810 align:middle line:84%
wore a pretty dress, had
a candlelight dinner,

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.550 align:middle line:84%
and her husband
walks in the door.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And she says, notice
anything different.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.860 align:middle line:90%


00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.380 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: How's this for
an outrageous question.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.450 align:middle line:10%
Can we be allergic to love?

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.970 align:middle line:10%
How about money, even God?

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.370 align:middle line:84%
These are the questions
we'll be proposing today

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.920 align:middle line:84%
as we're back with Jean
Slatter, our master douser.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.830 align:middle line:84%
The crux of the conversation
is that every day we're

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.920 align:middle line:84%
being affected by our body's
own intelligence, which

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.110 align:middle line:84%
has its own programs
and its own preferences.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.910 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:46.990 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Absolutely.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.547 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so excited to talk
about this subject, because--

00:01:49.547 --> 00:01:50.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.040 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: It's a
fascinating idea that you

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.940 align:middle line:84%
could be allergic to concepts
like love, money, success,

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.090 align:middle line:90%
power, even God.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.530 align:middle line:90%
Who would ever have thought?

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.260 align:middle line:10%
But by the end of
this conversation,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.160 align:middle line:10%
not only are you going to
understand how such thing could

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.770 align:middle line:10%
happen but it's also
going to explain

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.140 align:middle line:10%
the missing piece
to describe some

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.840 align:middle line:10%
of the bizarre symptoms
and behavioral reactions.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
they're layers down.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.500 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Yes.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.655 align:middle line:90%


00:02:25.655 --> 00:02:26.455 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:26.455 --> 00:02:28.630 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: And when you
find yourself going,

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.200 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what came over me.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.380 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why
I acted like I did

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.010 align:middle line:84%
and things like that,
you're going to understand

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.330 align:middle line:90%
why that would happen.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And furthermore,
you'll get the key

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.672 align:middle line:84%
to reversing it and undoing
it in an at home process.

00:02:45.672 --> 00:02:47.380 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we're
going to cover here.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.172 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just a little
thing and the thing

00:02:49.172 --> 00:02:52.150 align:middle line:84%
is when we're reacting
to life around us--

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.690 align:middle line:84%
and everybody's
reacting right now.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:54.490 align:middle line:90%
Oh my God.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you listen to some
of the astrologers we've had on

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.490 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, we're in a period
of deconstruction and chaos

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.160 align:middle line:84%
as we're preparing to
advance our consciousness

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.630 align:middle line:84%
and enter into a new
agreement, humanity itself,

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.250 align:middle line:90%
a new agreement with itself.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.800 align:middle line:84%
Doing things to a
higher level hopefully.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.020 align:middle line:84%
But in the interim,
it's just chaos,

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.460 align:middle line:84%
and people don't
know who to trust

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.560 align:middle line:90%
and what to trust anymore.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying,
look to the body.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:23.960 align:middle line:90%
It never lies.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.760 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.920 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the nature
of this body intelligence.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: OK.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.920 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about the
anatomy of our energy field,

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.970 align:middle line:84%
we describe all sorts of
terms like our conscious mind,

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.370 align:middle line:84%
our subconscious mind,
our higher conscious.

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.050 align:middle line:84%
We have the subtle
bodies, which is

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.510 align:middle line:84%
our physical, mental,
emotional, spiritual.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:44.620 align:middle line:90%
We have chakras.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:45.850 align:middle line:90%
We have meridians.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.900 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about
all those divisions,

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.950 align:middle line:84%
and people are
familiar with them.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.210 align:middle line:84%
But the one that people
rarely ever talk about

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.920 align:middle line:90%
is the mind of the body.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.680 align:middle line:84%
The body actually
has its own mind.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.990 align:middle line:84%
And it governs this animal
nature body that we have here.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And its primary
program is survival.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.440 align:middle line:84%
Just like nature,
it has to survive.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.240 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And all of nature
is seeking to find

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.610 align:middle line:84%
what is threatening
my survival and what

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.839 align:middle line:90%
is friendly to my survival.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And so this intelligence
that we have in the body

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.710 align:middle line:84%
is always checking
our environment,

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.010 align:middle line:84%
what is safe for me, and
what isn't safe for me.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And that will supersede
even the conscious mind,

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.810 align:middle line:84%
the subconscious mind,
even our soul's desire.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.640 align:middle line:84%
If this body is
being threatened,

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.650 align:middle line:84%
it'll take over and
say, I'll do what

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.060 align:middle line:90%
I have to do to protect myself.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And now, you and I have
a slightly different view

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.840 align:middle line:84%
of the subconscious mind
and let's talk about that.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Because you say even
beyond the subconscious.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.360 align:middle line:84%
So I view it as a
very simple thing.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.900 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious as a repository
for everything that's ever

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.430 align:middle line:90%
been, every trauma, everything.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.390 align:middle line:84%
But that is translated
into the physical body.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.030 align:middle line:84%
All of that information
is translated

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.400 align:middle line:90%
to the physical matrix.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.650 align:middle line:90%
So in a sense, we're agreeing.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying that
the subconscious is also

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.030 align:middle line:84%
programming that trauma into
the body to remember like, oh,

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.320 align:middle line:84%
don't like blue things
or whatever it is.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.920 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Right.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.220 align:middle line:90%
Everything affects everything.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.020 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.940 align:middle line:84%
Can our emotions affect
our physical health?

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.400 align:middle line:84%
Can the subconscious
affect our physical health?

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.200 align:middle line:84%
Everything is
intertwined, everything

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.750 align:middle line:84%
affects everything
else, except it's

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.250 align:middle line:90%
important to differentiate.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.760 align:middle line:90%
And here's why.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.600 align:middle line:84%
We have to know
where an injury has

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.360 align:middle line:90%
occurred in order to heal it.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.440 align:middle line:84%
So a perfect example is if
you have an emotional heart,

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.710 align:middle line:90%
you just had a heart break.

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.490 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to do any good to
put a Band-Aid over your heart.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.490 align:middle line:84%
Or you just had a significant
argument with someone,

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.050 align:middle line:90%
and there's a misunderstanding.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.420 align:middle line:84%
It won't do any good to put
a Band-Aid on your forehead.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.220 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.870 align:middle line:84%
So you have to address
it where the injury

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.740 align:middle line:90%
and imbalance occurred.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.940 align:middle line:84%
So knowing that the body
has a mind of its own,

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.540 align:middle line:84%
if you can identify that that's
where the injury, the imbalance

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.340 align:middle line:90%
occurred.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ultimately lands.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:17.950 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Yes.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.610 align:middle line:90%
Then it can be addressed.

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And so since we're
so complex and we

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.100 align:middle line:84%
have all these differentiated
aspects of ourselves,

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.927 align:middle line:84%
how do we get to where
did that injury occur?

00:06:30.927 --> 00:06:33.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
important, because we usually

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:36.100 align:middle line:84%
never get to it, and people run
around with chronic illness.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.060 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: We guess.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:40.720 align:middle line:84%
So the only way we do that
is through higher guidance.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.820 align:middle line:84%
Because your higher guidance
is the umbrella that

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.390 align:middle line:84%
just has access to every
aspect of ourselves

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:48.590 align:middle line:84%
and is the umbrella
that can say,

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.630 align:middle line:84%
OK, this is actually
where the injury occurred.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And yet, maybe the
timing isn't right,

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.150 align:middle line:84%
or maybe we have to
do something first.

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.760 align:middle line:84%
We have to go through the
subconscious to first get

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.810 align:middle line:90%
to the mind of the body.

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:09.400 align:middle line:84%
So having access to your higher
guidance, which is something

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:14.110 align:middle line:84%
that you've had me on before
so many times to discuss,

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.770 align:middle line:84%
that is the most important
thing is having access to that

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.330 align:middle line:84%
so that you can
understand where to start.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.683 align:middle line:84%
And the tool that I
like using the most

00:07:22.683 --> 00:07:24.100 align:middle line:84%
is, of course, the
pendulum, which

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:25.230 align:middle line:90%
we've talked about before.

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:26.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're
going to show that again.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:27.570 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Yeah.

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.460 align:middle line:84%
And because it's the quickest
and most accurate way

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.980 align:middle line:84%
to get to where
do I go with this.

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.980 align:middle line:84%
I know I have a bizarre
symptom or reaction

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.090 align:middle line:90%
that I want to address.

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:38.530 align:middle line:90%
What's the root of it?

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:40.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I've known
you for a lot of years now,

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.270 align:middle line:84%
and I've known different
people you've worked with.

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And it is always amazing how
someone comes in and thinks

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.350 align:middle line:84%
they have an issue, and
you go through the layers

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.910 align:middle line:84%
and layers has nothing
to do with that.

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:56.350 align:middle line:84%
So let's say something has
happened that just struck you

00:07:56.350 --> 00:08:00.910 align:middle line:84%
as almost a traumatic
insult to your mind,

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:04.270 align:middle line:84%
then to your emotions,
translating into the etheric.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:07.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is the subtle
field around the body.

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:09.880 align:middle line:84%
And now, boom, it's
going into your field,

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.530 align:middle line:84%
say it's going
into your stomach,

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.733 align:middle line:90%
or it's going into your heart.

00:08:13.733 --> 00:08:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And you think, God,
did I eat something?

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.090 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:21.440 align:middle line:84%
Because really, that's
how we approach it.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.090 align:middle line:84%
I better take some Tums
instead of winding back

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:27.970 align:middle line:84%
what happened that made my
stomach cramp up and made

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:29.380 align:middle line:90%
me feel so awful.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:30.180 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Right.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:30.980 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:31.180 align:middle line:90%


00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:31.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, this gets even
more complicated,

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:36.480 align:middle line:84%
because we're talking
about epigenetics.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.270 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
ancestral memory

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:44.350 align:middle line:84%
that is carried within the DNA
that we're also inheriting.

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:48.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a body of
dysfunction, pain, joy,

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:52.990 align:middle line:84%
everything from generations
past that were born with.

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Even a newbie, even if someone
who hasn't been hanging out

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:59.110 align:middle line:84%
on Earth comes and does a
little fly by incarnation,

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:00.980 align:middle line:90%
you still inherit all of that.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.290 align:middle line:90%
And it feels like your own.

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:05.200 align:middle line:90%
Let's address ancestral memory.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: That is an important
aspect of allergies,

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:14.110 align:middle line:90%
because allergies are inherited.

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:19.060 align:middle line:84%
So it's part of that
survival program of nature.

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And nature says, OK, what
has threatened my survival

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:23.890 align:middle line:90%
in the past.

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:27.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, if I have learned
that valuable information,

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:30.730 align:middle line:84%
I want to make sure
my next generation is

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:33.460 align:middle line:84%
privy to that information
because it'll save them.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:34.820 align:middle line:90%
It'll save their life.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And so we pass that
information on.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:41.170 align:middle line:84%
Allergies are often
inherited, and we'll

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:42.310 align:middle line:90%
talk about that later.

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:44.170 align:middle line:84%
I have a great
example of something

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:47.020 align:middle line:84%
that I saw in my
daughter and in myself

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.160 align:middle line:90%
that was clearly inherited.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:49.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:50.380 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.290 align:middle line:90%
We'll get to that.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:54.130 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
Star Trek lessons.

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:56.620 align:middle line:84%
The mind of the body is
always assessing everything

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:57.010 align:middle line:90%
as a threat.

00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:58.302 align:middle line:90%
But let's talk about Star Trek.

00:09:58.302 --> 00:10:00.850 align:middle line:84%
Because you relate
something, you're a Trekkie.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:02.800 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: I am.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And forgive me if
some of these details

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.380 align:middle line:84%
are wrong, because this is way
back when I was a kid watching

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.090 align:middle line:90%
this Star Trek trek episode.

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:11.680 align:middle line:90%
But here's what I remember.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:16.030 align:middle line:84%
An ambassador was welcomed
on board the enterprise,

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:21.130 align:middle line:84%
and she wore this gorgeous
black gown that was covered

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:24.100 align:middle line:90%
with sequins, very sparkly.

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.830 align:middle line:84%
No one knew it,
but she was blind.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:29.870 align:middle line:84%
Only Spock was able
to figure it out.

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:33.700 align:middle line:84%
So these sequins,
instead of being sequins,

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.500 align:middle line:90%
were actually sensors.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And because they were all
checking out the environment

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.000 align:middle line:84%
and sensing how far
away was something,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.130 align:middle line:84%
what was the expression
on your face,

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:47.830 align:middle line:84%
and constantly
giving her feedback,

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:51.670 align:middle line:84%
she could walk around
as if she was fully

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.020 align:middle line:90%
functioning and seeing.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And no one could
tell the difference.

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what our
energy field is like.

00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:00.580 align:middle line:84%
Our energy field is
constantly sensing

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:03.010 align:middle line:90%
both external and internal.

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:07.210 align:middle line:84%
Is this vibration that I'm
bumping up again friendly to me

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:09.580 align:middle line:90%
or is it a threat to me?

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And we're always
making that assessment,

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:17.050 align:middle line:84%
and that's what I learned from
Star Trek all those years ago.

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:20.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As you know, when I
saw the prequel about probably

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:22.570 align:middle line:84%
18 years ago now that
the prequel came out

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:27.580 align:middle line:84%
with Chris Pine showing the
young William Shatner and then

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:30.430 align:middle line:84%
also young Spock and what
happened when his father was

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:32.530 align:middle line:84%
advising him before
he came to Earth,

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:36.350 align:middle line:84%
I had so such deep
emotional reaction.

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:38.740 align:middle line:84%
I kept crying through
the whole film.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking
at how the mind--

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.510 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just bringing
this in out of the blue

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:46.560 align:middle line:90%
and see what you do with it--

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:51.830 align:middle line:84%
how for me the emotions are so
deep that the mind is tasked

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:54.230 align:middle line:84%
with being able to
use logic, so you

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:57.920 align:middle line:84%
can make sense of all this
stuff that comes at you.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.240 align:middle line:90%
Because it makes no sense.

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.220 align:middle line:90%
It's not rational.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very deeply
emotional, but I use logic.

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And so to some people, it's
like, you seem very cut

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:09.350 align:middle line:90%
and dry about this.

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:13.820 align:middle line:84%
No, this is a matter of
my attempt to have my body

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.780 align:middle line:90%
and my mind feel calm again.

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And I know you talk about the
mind's body always looking

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:22.400 align:middle line:90%
to find that place of calm.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.540 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: We're built to handle
stress, whether it's emotional,

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:29.660 align:middle line:84%
mental, our immune
systems encounter

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:31.130 align:middle line:90%
a bacterial infection.

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:34.310 align:middle line:84%
No matter what it is, we're
built to handle stress.

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:39.020 align:middle line:84%
And we have a normally
functioning system

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:40.100 align:middle line:90%
to take care of that.

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:44.270 align:middle line:84%
We see the lion, and our
heart begins to race,

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:45.950 align:middle line:84%
and the adrenaline
starts pumping,

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:47.160 align:middle line:90%
and we're out of there.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.560 align:middle line:90%
And then we calm down.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's natural and
normal and important.

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.555 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that's not
happening anymore, Jean.

00:12:53.555 --> 00:12:54.680 align:middle line:90%
People aren't calming down.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.120 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: They aren't
calming down.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:01.310 align:middle line:84%
So what happens though
is occasionally,

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:02.780 align:middle line:90%
the wires get crossed.

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And instead of us being able to
take a situation where there's

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:13.850 align:middle line:84%
stress and reason through it and
calm down, the mind of the body

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:18.860 align:middle line:84%
can make an association
and then say, OK, this

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:20.810 align:middle line:90%
is part of my stress here.

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I
can't calm down.

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't even have
to make logical sense.

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:31.520 align:middle line:84%
It could be something as simple
as eating an apple as a child,

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.160 align:middle line:84%
and your mom came in
and said, I'm sorry,

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.400 align:middle line:84%
but someone just
ran over your dog.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And the stress, emotional stress
that you feel inside your body

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:47.570 align:middle line:84%
is saying, OK, what is
causing this pain, and said,

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:49.220 align:middle line:90%
it must be this apple.

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:53.055 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's not logical but
to the mind of the body,

00:13:53.055 --> 00:13:53.855 align:middle line:90%
the body, says--

00:13:53.855 --> 00:13:55.105 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's an association.

00:13:55.105 --> 00:13:55.905 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Yeah.

00:13:55.905 --> 00:13:56.720 align:middle line:90%
Apples come from--

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A permanent
association.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.660 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: And from that
point on, the child

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:02.307 align:middle line:90%
is now allergic to apples.

00:14:02.307 --> 00:14:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
way you term that is

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:07.200 align:middle line:84%
a stuck threat that creates
a hyper reaction, right?

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.000 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: It does.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.500 align:middle line:84%
The body thinks it has
the brick on the gas pedal

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.640 align:middle line:90%
and won't let up.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And it needs to be in constant
alert toward that vibration.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.130 align:middle line:84%
Remember, your energy
field is always sensing.

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:23.630 align:middle line:84%
So the next time it comes into
the proximity of an apple,

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:26.360 align:middle line:90%
it begins to react.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.203 align:middle line:90%
And some of the strangest--

00:14:28.203 --> 00:14:30.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, we're going to
go into some strange stories.

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:32.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, we already
did it in the lead

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:36.290 align:middle line:84%
in talking about how could you
be allergic to love, money,

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:37.490 align:middle line:90%
God, all of that.

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:37.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:38.680 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk.

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.570 align:middle line:84%
You have a little drip line
analogy here, a little garden

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:42.470 align:middle line:90%
analogy.

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:43.270 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Right.

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:45.920 align:middle line:84%
This will help you to
understand how allergies

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:49.880 align:middle line:84%
are created and
then furthermore,

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:53.360 align:middle line:84%
how it can create
such bizarre symptoms.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Because an allergy
is far beyond drippy

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:00.350 align:middle line:84%
nose, watery eyes, and
a rash on the skin.

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:01.490 align:middle line:90%
Far beyond that.

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:06.420 align:middle line:84%
It literally can manifest as
any symptom you can think of,

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:12.470 align:middle line:84%
including behavioral
disorders, including headaches.

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:16.520 align:middle line:84%
Beyond the physical, just
freaking out over something,

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.470 align:middle line:90%
having panic attacks.

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:24.950 align:middle line:84%
It can be even into fibromyalgia
and rheumatoid arthritis.

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:26.330 align:middle line:90%
You name it.

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:30.010 align:middle line:84%
An allergy can result in any
of those symptoms, anything

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:30.810 align:middle line:90%
you can name.

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:32.150 align:middle line:90%
So here's why.

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:37.220 align:middle line:84%
Imagine a garden and drip
lines down the garden.

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:42.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is analogous
to the meridian system.

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:46.460 align:middle line:84%
There are 12 meridians
that run through the body,

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:49.290 align:middle line:84%
their pathways of energy that
feed the internal organs.

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:51.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And people would
be familiar with that

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:52.130 align:middle line:90%
through acupuncture.

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:53.540 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Absolutely.

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:58.130 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that's our drip
lines of energy that are

00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:00.438 align:middle line:90%
feeding our internal garden.

00:16:00.438 --> 00:16:02.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you're walking in
your garden one morning

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.200 align:middle line:84%
and you notice that one
of the plants is drooping,

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.380 align:middle line:84%
you know there's a
blockage in that drip head.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.320 align:middle line:84%
So you'd come along, you'd pull
the drip head off, clean out

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.390 align:middle line:84%
the dirt, and get the
water going again,

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:12.800 align:middle line:90%
and revive that plant.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:17.210 align:middle line:84%
But that blockage didn't
just happen that instant.

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:19.550 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's been there for
probably two or three days

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:23.030 align:middle line:84%
and just now you're noticing
that plant is having trouble.

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:28.280 align:middle line:84%
Or let's say, there's a pinch
in the hose for the entire line.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:32.960 align:middle line:84%
You might not notice it for
years that this row of trees

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.460 align:middle line:84%
never quite grew as
high as this row.

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:36.260 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.860 align:middle line:84%
Because over the years, it never
got the same amount of water

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:41.300 align:middle line:90%
as the other row did.

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:45.740 align:middle line:84%
And so here, we're back
to our internal garden.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:50.760 align:middle line:84%
An allergy affects the
meridian system of the body.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And it begins to close
down the flow of energy

00:16:54.860 --> 00:17:00.780 align:middle line:84%
to either a drip head feeding
an organ or the entire line.

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And so you can see that
how a symptom shows up

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:08.760 align:middle line:84%
depends on which
meridian is affected.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:14.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, most allergies, a lot of
ones that we're familiar with,

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:16.760 align:middle line:84%
are inhaled or
something that we eat.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.119 align:middle line:84%
And that affects the lung and
the large intestine meridian.

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:23.569 align:middle line:84%
And so you have symptoms that
are associated with the lungs

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:27.530 align:middle line:84%
and the large intestine, which
is why you get either the upset

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:31.220 align:middle line:84%
stomach or the rash, which
both the large intestine

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:34.300 align:middle line:84%
and the lungs govern the
skin, or the asthma attack

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:35.100 align:middle line:90%
and all that.

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:38.840 align:middle line:84%
But what happens if it's
affecting your pancreas,

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:42.380 align:middle line:84%
and it's causing low self
esteem or an inability

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:43.950 align:middle line:90%
to stand up for yourself?

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:47.240 align:middle line:84%
You would never associate
that with an allergy.

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And yet, any symptom
can be related

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.270 align:middle line:84%
to an allergy based
on the meridian

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:54.690 align:middle line:90%
that it's associated with.

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:56.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you say there
are three different ways that

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:57.650 align:middle line:90%
start showing itself here.

00:17:57.650 --> 00:18:00.198 align:middle line:84%
Sensitivity, intolerance,
and then allergies.

00:18:00.198 --> 00:18:01.240 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:04.430 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: So when
we have a reaction

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:07.670 align:middle line:84%
on the part of the
body, it shows up,

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:09.920 align:middle line:90%
one, could be a sensitivity.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:13.070 align:middle line:84%
A sensitivity, it means
that you are being

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:15.590 align:middle line:90%
overexposed to a frequency.

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:17.270 align:middle line:90%
And this is easy to see.

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:22.700 align:middle line:84%
It's like the torture of a
drip of water on your forehead.

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:24.792 align:middle line:84%
You can withstand
that no problem

00:18:24.792 --> 00:18:26.000 align:middle line:90%
for a certain amount of time.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.940 align:middle line:84%
But over time, it
can drive you crazy.

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:33.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be visiting
my mom in Minnesota.

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:35.340 align:middle line:90%
She's 100 years old.

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:38.660 align:middle line:84%
My brother has warned me that
because she's hard at hearing,

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.940 align:middle line:90%
she has the TV blasting.

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:44.420 align:middle line:84%
He said, the first couple
of weeks, it's fine.

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:47.970 align:middle line:84%
But after that,
you're driven crazy.

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And so that causes you
to become sensitive

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:57.800 align:middle line:84%
to a certain vibration, and
this can truly drive you insane.

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.450 align:middle line:90%
What's the remedy?

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:01.730 align:middle line:90%
You reduce the frequency.

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:02.660 align:middle line:90%
Simple as that.

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And it could mean you have
to completely remove yourself

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:09.470 align:middle line:84%
from the situation and
that particular vibration

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:12.830 align:middle line:84%
for a long period of time to
let the mind of the body calm

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:14.590 align:middle line:90%
back down.

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:17.180 align:middle line:84%
The second thing
is an intolerance.

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:20.210 align:middle line:84%
An intolerance is
quite different.

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:22.600 align:middle line:84%
It says, I just can't
tolerate something.

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.580 align:middle line:90%
How does that show up?

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:27.400 align:middle line:84%
In the body, when we talk
about a food intolerance,

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.480 align:middle line:84%
it means that we're
missing an enzyme.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.960 align:middle line:84%
For example, you
can't process gluten,

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.970 align:middle line:84%
because you don't have
the enzyme for it.

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:36.910 align:middle line:84%
Or you can't process
dairy, because you

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:38.950 align:middle line:90%
don't have the enzyme for it.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:42.100 align:middle line:84%
But take it to an
energy level, it

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.530 align:middle line:84%
means you don't have
an understanding

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:48.340 align:middle line:84%
to process the information
that's coming at you.

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:51.790 align:middle line:84%
An example would be of
an acquaintance that

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:53.650 align:middle line:84%
was in our circle
of friends years

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:59.800 align:middle line:84%
ago that started telling us
about a new boyfriend she had.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:04.910 align:middle line:84%
He was everything,
handsome and rich.

00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:05.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And he talked
constantly with her

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:10.870 align:middle line:84%
about the places
they wanted to visit

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:16.120 align:middle line:84%
around the world and the
homes they were going to buy.

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.590 align:middle line:90%
They even went down to a truck.

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:20.280 align:middle line:84%
Lot they were going to
pay cash for a truck.

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.390 align:middle line:90%
Didn't happen.

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:26.672 align:middle line:84%
But she just totally
got swept up into this--

00:20:26.672 --> 00:20:27.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Into a dream world.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:28.880 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: --a dream world.

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.540 align:middle line:84%
She had everything she
could possibly imagine.

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:34.570 align:middle line:90%
He asked her to marry him.

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:36.370 align:middle line:84%
The rest of us were
a little bit jealous,

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:39.160 align:middle line:84%
because it was too
good to be true.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.270 align:middle line:90%
And it was.

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:42.620 align:middle line:90%
He was a pathological liar.

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And none of what he talked
about was true at all.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.870 align:middle line:84%
And then when she
started to catch on,

00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:54.380 align:middle line:84%
he did what a lot of liars
will do, he gaslit her.

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:55.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:57.370 align:middle line:84%
Turned it back on
her like, you're

00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:58.750 align:middle line:90%
the one that's not trusting me.

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:02.950 align:middle line:84%
You're the one that's
falsely accusing me.

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:08.520 align:middle line:84%
But over time, what we
saw is her whole sense

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:13.230 align:middle line:84%
of self diminished
and be eroded away.

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:17.160 align:middle line:84%
She had no way of
processing this information.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.620 align:middle line:84%
She had never come
across someone that

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:21.480 align:middle line:90%
was a pathological liar before.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:24.360 align:middle line:84%
Did not know how
to deal with it.

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.220 align:middle line:90%
Didn't know how to process it.

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And instead, it started
eating away at who she was

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.953 align:middle line:90%
and who she thought she was.

00:21:32.953 --> 00:21:35.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did it have physical
symptoms that went with it?

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:37.470 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Oh, her
energy went down.

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:40.810 align:middle line:90%
She began to have anxiety.

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:41.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:44.070 align:middle line:10%
She became a shadow of herself.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:47.790 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, she came
across some counselors

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:50.680 align:middle line:84%
that helped her to
understand what was going on

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.830 align:middle line:90%
so that she could process it.

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And this is no small thing,
because mood disorders are not

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:00.780 align:middle line:90%
uncommon at all.

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And when you encounter
someone that either

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:10.110 align:middle line:84%
is a pathological liar, has
different mood disorders

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:14.805 align:middle line:84%
like could be
borderline personality.

00:22:14.805 --> 00:22:15.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Psychotic breaks.

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:17.070 align:middle line:90%
You're not even aware of it.

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:17.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:17.910 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Right.

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:18.710 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:21.930 align:middle line:84%
If you have no
previous awareness

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:25.890 align:middle line:84%
of how that manifests
and you buy into that,

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:30.820 align:middle line:84%
it can completely disrupt
your own energy field

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:34.270 align:middle line:84%
and cause a threat to
the mind of the body.

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how does that play
into then an allergic response?

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:40.030 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: So this isn't
an allergic response.

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Like an intolerance, the
body just cannot process it.

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:48.310 align:middle line:84%
So what's needed there
is understanding.

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, when I'm
working with clients,

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.650 align:middle line:84%
that's where my
pendulum will take

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:57.370 align:middle line:84%
me is to help that
person understand

00:22:57.370 --> 00:22:59.680 align:middle line:84%
what is the situation
they're in and how

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.900 align:middle line:84%
is it that they can process
the information that's

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:03.440 align:middle line:90%
coming at them.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.240 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.090 align:middle line:90%
Then the last of the three is--

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:08.215 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Flat out allergy.

00:23:08.215 --> 00:23:08.500 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: --a flat out allergy.

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.600 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's redefine an allergy.

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:15.220 align:middle line:84%
So from an energetic
viewpoint, an allergy

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:18.700 align:middle line:84%
is an attempt upon
the part of the body

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:24.280 align:middle line:84%
to protect you against something
it thinks is going to harm you.

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And this is the important
secret of this whole thing

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:30.310 align:middle line:84%
and how it is that I'm going to
show you how you can completely

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:31.520 align:middle line:90%
undo an allergy.

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:32.320 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:36.340 align:middle line:84%
Because an allergy is
about how the body thinks.

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:39.220 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have anything
to do with the substance

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:43.420 align:middle line:84%
itself but rather
what the body thinks.

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:46.180 align:middle line:84%
For an example, is there
anything about pollen

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:47.692 align:middle line:90%
that's going to kill you?

00:23:47.692 --> 00:23:48.544 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:23:48.544 --> 00:23:51.250 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything about dust
that's going to kill you?

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:54.520 align:middle line:84%
Why do so many
people have allergies

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:57.160 align:middle line:90%
to pollens and to dust?

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was really
a mystery to me

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:04.810 align:middle line:84%
until one day, when I
listened to a program on TV

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:06.820 align:middle line:90%
about the Dust Bowl days.

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea
how deadly dust was.

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:16.990 align:middle line:84%
People were dying with an
inch thick layer of dust

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:19.660 align:middle line:84%
in their lungs and they
were doing everything

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:23.560 align:middle line:84%
that they could to protect
themselves from dust,

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:27.070 align:middle line:84%
boarding up their windows and
putting towels around so that

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:31.270 align:middle line:84%
hopefully to keep any speck of
dust from entering their homes.

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:33.310 align:middle line:90%
Because dust would kill you.

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:36.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, guess what
information gets passed on?

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And when you think
about it, you're

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:43.000 align:middle line:84%
talking about in Sahara
Africa and other arid parts

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.590 align:middle line:84%
of the world, including
even the West in America,

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:48.970 align:middle line:90%
dust is a threat.

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:50.570 align:middle line:90%
It is a threat to people.

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And so here, you're
talking about, again,

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:55.180 align:middle line:84%
these ancestral
patterns, maybe going

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:59.710 align:middle line:84%
back further generationally
than we can understand

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:01.340 align:middle line:90%
that dust is a threat.

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:05.230 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just like from one
or two generations ago even.

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:06.100 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Right.

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:09.470 align:middle line:84%
So what's the difference
between my body,

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:12.190 align:middle line:84%
which does not have
an allergy to dust,

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:14.110 align:middle line:90%
and somebody else's body?

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:18.670 align:middle line:84%
The difference is my body
doesn't think there's a threat.

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:21.010 align:middle line:90%
The other person's body does.

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:25.340 align:middle line:84%
So if it's just about how the
body thinks, the question is,

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:28.750 align:middle line:90%
can we change the body's mind?

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:29.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:32.800 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Can we get
it to unthink that?

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.560 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is yes, we can.

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And we do it in the same way
that allergies are created.

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:43.750 align:middle line:84%
So an allergy, again,
is created under stress,

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:45.670 align:middle line:84%
where the body
perceives a threat

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:49.630 align:middle line:84%
and begins to shut down the
meridian system in an effort

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:52.150 align:middle line:84%
to protect you from
something that it

00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:53.530 align:middle line:90%
thinks is going to harm you.

00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:54.400 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.140 align:middle line:90%
So how do we undo that?

00:25:56.140 --> 00:26:01.870 align:middle line:84%
We put our body back in the
presence of that substance.

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:04.420 align:middle line:84%
I usually just write
it on a piece of paper

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:06.640 align:middle line:84%
and I say, here,
hold that thought.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:09.410 align:middle line:84%
Because the thought
is a vibration.

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:10.210 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And so you hold the
thought of dust,

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:18.190 align:middle line:84%
and then you open the meridian
system and show the body, look,

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:19.960 align:middle line:90%
you're in the presence of this.

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.720 align:middle line:84%
You thought it was going to
hurt you, but you're open,

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.950 align:middle line:84%
and you're flowing,
and you're fine.

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:25.750 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:27.730 align:middle line:84%
I guess it wasn't the
problem after all that

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:29.500 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was.

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:30.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:32.020 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about the woman.

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:35.170 align:middle line:84%
There's a woman, I remember,
you told me about her daughter

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:36.910 align:middle line:90%
was allergic to water.

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'm bringing this
up for a reason too.

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:42.410 align:middle line:84%
Because you think, everything
is dependent on water

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:43.210 align:middle line:90%
for survival.

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:45.040 align:middle line:84%
How can anyone be
allergic to water?

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.030 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Exactly.

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:46.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:48.790 align:middle line:84%
So that question
came up for me when

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:50.350 align:middle line:84%
I was giving a
presentation one time,

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:51.725 align:middle line:84%
and someone in
the audience says,

00:26:51.725 --> 00:26:53.710 align:middle line:90%
my daughter's allergic to water.

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:55.090 align:middle line:90%
How could that even be possible?

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:56.020 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well--

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:58.437 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, was she trying
to con her into having soda

00:26:58.437 --> 00:27:00.380 align:middle line:90%
instead?

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:01.180 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: No.

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:07.150 align:middle line:84%
But the first response or my
first logical response to that

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:11.410 align:middle line:84%
would be, well, let's just
say in a past generation,

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:14.800 align:middle line:84%
there was a
near-drowning episode.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:19.300 align:middle line:84%
What message would get
passed on about water?

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.910 align:middle line:90%
It will kill you.

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:26.560 align:middle line:84%
And surprisingly,
there are a lot of--

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:30.880 align:middle line:84%
I've heard of a lot of kids
that are allergic to cold water.

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:32.980 align:middle line:90%
So then I think of hypothermia.

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:33.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And again, the message
gets passed on down,

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:39.060 align:middle line:90%
cold water will kill you.

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was funny,
because recently, I

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:43.140 align:middle line:84%
was trying to figure
out some things.

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:46.530 align:middle line:90%
And I had this book.

00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:49.470 align:middle line:84%
How many people have
bought Dale Olsen's book?

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Because we've talked
about it on this show.

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:53.772 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, this is very complete.

00:27:53.772 --> 00:27:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And so I was going through
all these different things

00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:58.140 align:middle line:84%
and what could be the
cause of this response?

00:27:58.140 --> 00:27:59.700 align:middle line:90%
And water came up.

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And now, I didn't go
into it any further.

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:03.780 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
that's impossible.

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And then you and I had
talked about this situation

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:07.450 align:middle line:90%
with water.

00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:09.990 align:middle line:84%
So I'll go back and
peel the layer back.

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:14.790 align:middle line:84%
But this is interesting, because
if you don't have something

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:16.350 align:middle line:84%
like this that
has all this stuff

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:18.630 align:middle line:84%
lined up for you to
identify, and you

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:21.840 align:middle line:84%
don't know how to douse,
then how are you ever going

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.030 align:middle line:90%
to unravel this?

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:25.870 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: It can be
very difficult.

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's why people
spend years and years

00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:30.630 align:middle line:84%
and years and
thousands of dollars

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:33.240 align:middle line:84%
trying to get at
a root issue, when

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:36.750 align:middle line:84%
if they would learn how to
access their higher guidance

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:40.990 align:middle line:84%
and let their higher guidance
direct what is going on

00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:43.860 align:middle line:84%
and get to the root issue,
they can save themselves

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:45.220 align:middle line:90%
tons of frustration.

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They can.

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:48.343 align:middle line:10%
And almost all my
friends have this book,

00:28:48.343 --> 00:28:50.010 align:middle line:10%
because you turned
me on to it ages ago.

00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:52.110 align:middle line:10%
You know a lot of them
actually, and they all

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:53.160 align:middle line:10%
play with this book.

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:56.605 align:middle line:10%
And what's interesting
is your higher mind

00:28:56.605 --> 00:28:58.980 align:middle line:10%
could give you this information
directly if you were that

00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:01.330 align:middle line:10%
clear a channel to yourself.

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:02.430 align:middle line:90%
But most people are not.

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:03.455 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: No, no.

00:29:03.455 --> 00:29:04.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
very difficult

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:07.650 align:middle line:84%
to get that amount of
refined information

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:08.830 align:middle line:90%
from the higher mind.

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:12.180 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: And I always say you
need a way to verify, trust

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:13.320 align:middle line:90%
but verify.

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I have
found that that is true.

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:16.990 align:middle line:90%
And so everyone's different.

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:19.270 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about this,
because we brought it up.

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:21.400 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about allergies
to money and allergies

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:22.200 align:middle line:90%
to God in a minute.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:24.690 align:middle line:84%
But let's just talk about some
of the practical elements.

00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:26.315 align:middle line:84%
So if you're doing
this book and you're

00:29:26.315 --> 00:29:28.620 align:middle line:84%
looking for, say,
allergic reactions

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:31.650 align:middle line:84%
to things, the
way I do it, which

00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:34.170 align:middle line:84%
is a little different,
because I want to make

00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:35.610 align:middle line:90%
sure I'm not fooling myself--

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:40.350 align:middle line:84%
some of the stuff is really
very specific about even

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:41.400 align:middle line:90%
amino acids.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And here's one about
different kinds

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:45.660 align:middle line:90%
of normal allergens and such.

00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:50.140 align:middle line:84%
What I do when I'm using it is
I don't give it my attention.

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:53.460 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm dowsing,
you have to stay loose.

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And I close my eyes, and I let
the book sit in front of me,

00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:58.200 align:middle line:90%
and I just do this.

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.510 align:middle line:84%
I just check out,
and then I wait

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:03.300 align:middle line:84%
until I feel a
strong steady pulse,

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:06.270 align:middle line:84%
lower it, and see what
it's dragging over.

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:07.860 align:middle line:90%
And it is shocking.

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:11.040 align:middle line:84%
It's always shocking to me
that your higher mind has

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.290 align:middle line:90%
hit on the exact right thing.

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:14.980 align:middle line:90%
It's like, how is that possible?

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:15.810 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: How is that possible?

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:16.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:18.660 align:middle line:84%
Because recently, just
as a small example,

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:22.650 align:middle line:84%
I thought, OK, if there's some
underlying viral pattern going

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:24.030 align:middle line:90%
on, I wonder what it could be.

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't have at my contacts
in, so I couldn't see anything.

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:30.400 align:middle line:84%
It was all a blur to begin with,
and then I did this process.

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And the first one
that came up was SARS.

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.153 align:middle line:90%
Well, of course, I had COVID.

00:30:34.153 --> 00:30:35.570 align:middle line:84%
I thought, OK,
that's interesting.

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:37.782 align:middle line:84%
And each thing it went
through was right on.

00:30:37.782 --> 00:30:39.240 align:middle line:84%
There were things
that had actually

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.830 align:middle line:90%
been diagnosed in the past.

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And so it's showing the
old stuff hanging around

00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:47.765 align:middle line:84%
underneath, which we forget
about as you go through life.

00:30:47.765 --> 00:30:50.140 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of things
compromising our immune system,

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:50.940 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:53.190 align:middle line:84%
So that's how I do
it, because just

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:56.550 align:middle line:84%
so I know I'm not getting
my mind involved in it.

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:59.250 align:middle line:90%
How do you do it?

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:02.310 align:middle line:84%
You do it so much and so often
to, you know to trust yourself.

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:06.090 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: I always start with
the broadest question possible,

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:09.990 align:middle line:84%
and that is there something
my higher guidance wants

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:11.590 align:middle line:90%
me to clear at this time.

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:13.410 align:middle line:90%
So you start with the broadest.

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And if it says, OK,
this is an imbalance

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:17.920 align:middle line:90%
in the mind of the body.

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:19.770 align:middle line:84%
Then I know it's one
of those three things.

00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:20.700 align:middle line:90%
Then I narrow it down.

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:22.440 align:middle line:90%
OK, is it a sensitivity?

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:27.600 align:middle line:84%
Then I know that I just have
to reduce my frequency to it.

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.120 align:middle line:84%
If it's an intolerance, there's
something I need to know

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:32.700 align:middle line:84%
and an understanding
I need to come to.

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And if it's an allergy, I need
to show the body that it's

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:37.290 align:middle line:90%
safe with that frequency.

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:40.470 align:middle line:84%
But here's the thing that is
important about what you're

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:45.000 align:middle line:84%
doing is that because you're not
allowing that logic mind to get

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.700 align:middle line:84%
in there by closing your
eyes and just letting it go,

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:49.885 align:middle line:84%
it can go to
something like water.

00:31:49.885 --> 00:31:51.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It went to water.

00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:52.135 align:middle line:90%
That's why I brought it up.

00:31:52.135 --> 00:31:55.560 align:middle line:84%
It was water, I have
to talk to Jean.

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:57.930 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Because if
you were looking,

00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:00.780 align:middle line:84%
your logic mind would have
said, it can't be that

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:02.140 align:middle line:90%
and you would have dismissed it.

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:02.940 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's important is to get
the logic mind out of the way

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.940 align:middle line:84%
and learn techniques
to do that so

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:10.440 align:middle line:90%
that you don't dismiss things.

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:15.660 align:middle line:84%
Because you can literally be
allergic to anything at all.

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:19.860 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite stories
is about a gentleman that

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:22.570 align:middle line:84%
called me and said, I want
my wife to come and see you,

00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:25.530 align:middle line:90%
which isn't really a good sign.

00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough,
she walks in, you

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:30.610 align:middle line:84%
could clearly at least see
she didn't want to be there.

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:31.410 align:middle line:90%
She was sullen.

00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:33.327 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She was allergic
to the whole thing.

00:32:33.327 --> 00:32:34.240 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Yeah.

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.230 align:middle line:90%
She was sullen.

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:37.810 align:middle line:90%
She didn't want to talk to me.

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:40.180 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know it
but her husband had

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:43.180 align:middle line:84%
sent her to doctor after
doctor to figure out

00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:44.440 align:middle line:90%
what was going on.

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:47.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was she
allergic to him?

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:50.470 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: That didn't come
up, but that is possible.

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:51.340 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:53.060 align:middle line:84%
Because she can be
allergic to anything.

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:56.890 align:middle line:84%
So she really didn't
want to talk to me

00:32:56.890 --> 00:32:59.350 align:middle line:90%
or tell me what was going on.

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:00.580 align:middle line:90%
Then I thought, OK.

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, fortunately, I don't
really need to talk to you.

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:04.480 align:middle line:84%
I just need to
talk to your body,

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:06.105 align:middle line:84%
I need to talk to
your higher guidance.

00:33:06.105 --> 00:33:07.730 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:11.110 align:middle line:84%
So her higher guidance said
to do an allergy clearing

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:16.175 align:middle line:84%
for two things, the drop in
barometric pressure and cold.

00:33:16.175 --> 00:33:16.975 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:33:16.975 --> 00:33:17.340 align:middle line:90%


00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:18.140 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: OK.

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:20.960 align:middle line:84%
So I do this little
thing on her.

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.580 align:middle line:90%
We get the meridians flowing.

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:24.680 align:middle line:84%
With that thought,
the drop, I literally

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:27.200 align:middle line:84%
wrote it on a piece of paper,
said here, hold this thought.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:30.800 align:middle line:84%
The drop in barometric
pressure and cold.

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:32.570 align:middle line:84%
Then she walked
out of the office.

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:39.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, again, unbeknownst
to me, for over 20 years,

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:41.952 align:middle line:84%
she had suffered with
seasonal affective disorder.

00:33:41.952 --> 00:33:43.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I was going to say.

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:43.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:44.960 align:middle line:84%
It's a drop in
barometric pressure.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.820 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: And it
would begin as soon

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:48.650 align:middle line:84%
as the rains would
start in the fall

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:52.930 align:middle line:84%
and wouldn't let up
until springtime.

00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:57.190 align:middle line:84%
For more than 20
years, she would hardly

00:33:57.190 --> 00:34:03.530 align:middle line:84%
get out of her pajamas
for that entire time.

00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:05.350 align:middle line:84%
So you can see why
her husband would

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:08.260 align:middle line:84%
want to send her to place
to place to place to try

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:10.030 align:middle line:90%
to figure out what's going on.

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:14.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, she felt like
a new woman when

00:34:14.050 --> 00:34:17.040 align:middle line:90%
she walked out of the office.

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.929 align:middle line:84%
I thought, what is
going on with me?

00:34:18.929 --> 00:34:21.100 align:middle line:84%
I've got all this crazy
energy flowing through me.

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:21.900 align:middle line:90%
Oh my God.

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:22.929 align:middle line:90%
I feel good.

00:34:22.929 --> 00:34:25.260 align:middle line:84%
She went out and
got her hair done.

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:27.960 align:middle line:84%
On the way home, she buys
a bunch of groceries.

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:31.670 align:middle line:84%
It just so happened to
be their anniversary.

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:35.300 align:middle line:84%
She made a beautiful
dinner, got her makeup on,

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:38.690 align:middle line:84%
wore a pretty dress, had
a candlelight dinner.

00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And her husband
walks in the door,

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:43.727 align:middle line:84%
and she says, notice
anything different?

00:34:43.727 --> 00:34:44.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like everything.

00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:48.679 align:middle line:84%
I'm not in my fuzzy
slippers and my sweats.

00:34:48.679 --> 00:34:52.451 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: And it was permanent.

00:34:52.451 --> 00:34:54.409 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's interesting
about that was I'm

00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:55.280 align:middle line:90%
listening to this.

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.800 align:middle line:84%
This is what's flowing
in, because you know me,

00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.390 align:middle line:90%
you know reincarnation.

00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:02.300 align:middle line:84%
I can't see life except for
cycles and cycles of lives.

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know, that
could come from another time

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:08.480 align:middle line:90%
that we're not aware of.

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:11.300 align:middle line:84%
It could come
ancestrally, either one.

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:12.993 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
which one it is.

00:35:12.993 --> 00:35:15.410 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is you're probably
not going to figure it out

00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:16.520 align:middle line:90%
with the conscious mind.

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:17.540 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: No, no.

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:18.340 align:middle line:90%
You won't.

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And things can be
just completely

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.960 align:middle line:90%
illogical, make no sense at all.

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:27.320 align:middle line:84%
But to the mind of
the body, it made

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:31.020 align:middle line:84%
some sense somewhere along
the line and an association

00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:31.820 align:middle line:90%
was made.

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:32.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about being
allergic to money.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.560 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: OK.

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:41.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, so here's the thing is
that the very thing that you

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:42.500 align:middle line:90%
desire--

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:47.300 align:middle line:84%
love, success, money-- if
you find yourself pushing

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:50.330 align:middle line:84%
that vibration away,
almost like you

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:54.530 align:middle line:84%
are physically allergic to it
and you're sabotaging yourself,

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:58.040 align:middle line:84%
then the very thing you
desire will elude you.

00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:03.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, talk about money, I have
never watched the show Ozark,

00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:07.520 align:middle line:84%
but I know it's about a
lot of money laundering.

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:12.650 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine the
high stress environment

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:14.330 align:middle line:90%
of dealing with money?

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:16.970 align:middle line:84%
Money can literally
get you killed.

00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:17.930 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:19.520 align:middle line:90%
So can love.

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:21.350 align:middle line:90%
Love can get you killed.

00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:22.910 align:middle line:90%
And so anything at all.

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:25.110 align:middle line:90%
Power, power can get you killed.

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:28.440 align:middle line:84%
So how does that register
in the mind of the body?

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:33.900 align:middle line:84%
Let's keep ourselves as far
away from that as possible.

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:34.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:37.370 align:middle line:84%
Because there may have been
a circumstance from the past

00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:40.200 align:middle line:84%
or through your ancestral
line that led to exactly that.

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.000 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Exactly.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:41.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:45.990 align:middle line:84%
So again, we don't know why
we're having these feelings.

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:51.170 align:middle line:84%
So let's say, you're
allergic to love,

00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:55.170 align:middle line:84%
because there was something, a
passionate tryst that you ended

00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:57.170 align:middle line:84%
up being murdered over,
say, in another lifetime

00:36:57.170 --> 00:36:58.430 align:middle line:90%
or your grandmother.

00:36:58.430 --> 00:37:00.650 align:middle line:90%
So let's make it ancestral.

00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:04.370 align:middle line:84%
How would you go about
then defining that?

00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:07.190 align:middle line:84%
Dale Olsen isn't murdered
over love or a tryst.

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:09.830 align:middle line:90%


00:37:09.830 --> 00:37:11.810 align:middle line:84%
How do you go
about drilling down

00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:15.690 align:middle line:84%
to that level when it's a heavy
emotional ancestral or past

00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:16.490 align:middle line:90%
life issue?

00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:17.948 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Trust your
higher guidance.

00:37:17.948 --> 00:37:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Use your higher guidance
and the pendulum

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:27.710 align:middle line:84%
to point you to the words,
whatever it is that your higher

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:31.760 align:middle line:84%
guidance is saying, this
is the root of this allergy

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:33.890 align:middle line:84%
and what you're trying
to protect yourself from.

00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:36.110 align:middle line:84%
Remember, everything
is a vibration,

00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:39.950 align:middle line:84%
and literally, anything
can be an allergy.

00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:45.200 align:middle line:84%
So suspend your logic mind,
because something may come up

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.905 align:middle line:90%
that will make absolute no--

00:37:46.905 --> 00:37:49.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're suddenly afraid
of money, you get a job offer.

00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot more
money, and you tense up

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:53.060 align:middle line:90%
and you're nervous.

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:54.470 align:middle line:90%
That would be an example, right?

00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:55.820 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: It would be an example.

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:57.530 align:middle line:84%
It would be an
example if you even

00:37:57.530 --> 00:37:59.240 align:middle line:84%
thought about
winning the lottery,

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:02.810 align:middle line:84%
and you start going into
it in your imagination

00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:04.160 align:middle line:90%
and start having a panic attack.

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:04.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:05.570 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:06.695 align:middle line:90%
So there's something there.

00:38:06.695 --> 00:38:07.495 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Yeah.

00:38:07.495 --> 00:38:09.140 align:middle line:84%
That's the mind and
your body saying,

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:11.930 align:middle line:84%
that's a vibration we need
to protect ourselves from.

00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And it could be money
plus something else.

00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:18.120 align:middle line:84%
It could be love
plus something else.

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And the most important thing
is just suspend your logic mind

00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:23.210 align:middle line:90%
and just go with it.

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:27.710 align:middle line:84%
Because see, here's the thing,
it's not going to hurt you,

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:29.720 align:middle line:84%
even if you got it
wrong, it's certainly not

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:31.400 align:middle line:84%
going to hurt you
to clear an allergy.

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:33.903 align:middle line:84%
If you write down a thought,
like you write down love.

00:38:33.903 --> 00:38:34.820 align:middle line:90%
You go, what the heck?

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:36.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do it.

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:39.680 align:middle line:84%
If you're opening up
the flow of energy

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:41.720 align:middle line:84%
through the meridians
to the energy of love,

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:43.670 align:middle line:84%
how would that
possibly hurt you?

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:48.920 align:middle line:84%
So allergy, clearing
any kind of allergy is--

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:51.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But this is a big one.

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:53.780 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the biggest
ones for all of humanity,

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:55.520 align:middle line:90%
the fear of abandonment.

00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:56.630 align:middle line:90%
And this goes deep, deep.

00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to get
into the big one, fear of God.

00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:59.510 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Yes.

00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:00.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:01.550 align:middle line:90%
The fear of abandonment.

00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:01.722 align:middle line:90%


00:39:01.722 --> 00:39:02.522 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Yes.

00:39:02.522 --> 00:39:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And so if you feel
that that is something

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:06.980 align:middle line:84%
that you have
either in your past

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:12.320 align:middle line:84%
or you're recognizing I
have a knee jerk reaction--

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:14.360 align:middle line:84%
people talk about
in relationships,

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:17.120 align:middle line:84%
when they just meet somebody
new or that person has baggage

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:19.820 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, and they
actually know it.

00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Because the person
can say something

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.450 align:middle line:84%
and they meant it in a very
harmless way, and the person

00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:30.440 align:middle line:84%
will go off on them
in a bizarre reaction.

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:38.150 align:middle line:84%
That is an allergic
reaction to that frequency.

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:41.960 align:middle line:84%
For an example, I
mentioned about the lady

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:45.170 align:middle line:84%
that was in a relationship
with a pathological liar.

00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:48.830 align:middle line:84%
You can bet that if she
met somebody else that

00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:52.860 align:middle line:84%
even told us a slight white
lie, she would overreact.

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:53.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:53.930 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:54.730 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:58.610 align:middle line:84%
So what this does
in my mind is we're

00:39:58.610 --> 00:40:01.190 align:middle line:84%
able to look at each other
with compassion, because we

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:05.060 align:middle line:84%
understand these are areas
that our being has perceived

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:08.780 align:middle line:84%
our survival on some
level was under threat.

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And every one of us comes
with a different package.

00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:12.110 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And so to learn to
be a little more

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.400 align:middle line:84%
accepting and compassion
with each other

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:18.980 align:middle line:84%
with these bizarre
reactions to life.

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:21.290 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: And clear
those allergies.

00:40:21.290 --> 00:40:24.590 align:middle line:84%
Because it will do
absolutely no harm at all.

00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:28.425 align:middle line:84%
Even if you had no allergy
to love, if you clear it,

00:40:28.425 --> 00:40:29.550 align:middle line:90%
it's not going to harm you.

00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what's it sound
like if you've gone through,

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:32.480 align:middle line:90%
now you've dowsed this and that.

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:33.410 align:middle line:90%
And oh, goodness.

00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:33.920 align:middle line:90%
This is weird.

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:35.212 align:middle line:90%
It pairs them allergic to love.

00:40:35.212 --> 00:40:37.940 align:middle line:84%
What do you say to yourself
when you're doing the clearing?

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:40.250 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: So the easiest
way to do it to open up

00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:41.990 align:middle line:84%
that meridian
flow, first of all,

00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:44.300 align:middle line:84%
write the thought down
on a piece of paper.

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And then things like
the tapping method.

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:49.700 align:middle line:84%
People are familiar
with tapping.

00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:50.900 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty popular.

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:52.940 align:middle line:84%
That's opening up the
flow of meridians.

00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:56.315 align:middle line:84%
But even simpler than
that is rubbing your ears.

00:40:56.315 --> 00:40:57.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:58.820 align:middle line:84%
Interesting, because
all the meridian endings

00:40:58.820 --> 00:40:59.620 align:middle line:90%
are in your ears.

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:00.500 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Or your feet.

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:01.340 align:middle line:90%
Get yourself a--

00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:02.465 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A foot rub, yeah.

00:41:02.465 --> 00:41:03.740 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Yeah, a foot massage.

00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:05.720 align:middle line:84%
So holding that piece
of paper, or you

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:08.000 align:middle line:84%
could put it next to
your navel, and then

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.780 align:middle line:84%
just keep rubbing your feet
or rubbing your ears until you

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:12.980 align:middle line:90%
feel a sense of calm.

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:15.980 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I've
seen it so many times.

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:19.790 align:middle line:84%
You can tell when it's
done because the person

00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:22.603 align:middle line:90%
involuntarily goes [SIGH].

00:41:22.603 --> 00:41:24.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you're
holding your pendulum too,

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:25.770 align:middle line:90%
it'll tell you when it's done.

00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:27.010 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Yeah, that too.

00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:30.640 align:middle line:84%
So that's the simplest way
to do it, and believe me,

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:33.430 align:middle line:84%
it's permanent which is
just the craziest thing.

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:34.990 align:middle line:84%
Here you could
have been allergic

00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:40.060 align:middle line:84%
to something for 25 years,
and in a matter of minutes,

00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:40.930 align:middle line:90%
it's over.

00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:44.020 align:middle line:84%
Because it's almost
like a corrupted file.

00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:46.270 align:middle line:84%
Once you correct
the corrupted file,

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:48.070 align:middle line:84%
there's no reason for
the mind and the body

00:41:48.070 --> 00:41:49.960 align:middle line:84%
to go back and
say, wait a minute,

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:51.240 align:middle line:90%
where was that corrupted file?

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:52.990 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back and pull
that back up again.

00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:55.210 align:middle line:84%
There's no reason for
the body to do that.

00:41:55.210 --> 00:41:59.250 align:middle line:84%
The body says, oh, I see
that I'm fine with this,

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:01.380 align:middle line:90%
it's safe, OK.

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:02.530 align:middle line:90%
And it just says that, OK.

00:42:02.530 --> 00:42:03.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: God.

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:04.530 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: God.

00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:06.240 align:middle line:90%
The mother allergy of all.

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:07.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, God.

00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:08.970 align:middle line:90%
Interesting topic.

00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:11.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing a lot of work
around the perceptions

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:15.060 align:middle line:84%
of what the whole story, and
particularly the Old Testament,

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:15.975 align:middle line:90%
has done to humanity.

00:42:15.975 --> 00:42:16.945 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Oh my.

00:42:16.945 --> 00:42:19.362 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you and I
were both raised with religion

00:42:19.362 --> 00:42:21.060 align:middle line:90%
and subjected to those stories.

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:25.350 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: I used to, as a
child, read stories of the Old

00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:26.590 align:middle line:90%
Testament and scared--

00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh my
god, just horrible.

00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:31.440 align:middle line:84%
Seeing some with a dagger
over their baby's heart--

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:33.675 align:middle line:90%
just traumatizing to children.

00:42:33.675 --> 00:42:34.680 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Traumatizing.

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And now think, here's
the worst of it.

00:42:37.410 --> 00:42:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And this-- I don't know about
other religions, but let's

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:43.740 align:middle line:90%
just talk typical Christianity.

00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:46.650 align:middle line:84%
We're told that we
have this loving God.

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:50.820 align:middle line:84%
Now if there was a
serial killer out there

00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:54.285 align:middle line:84%
that was lighting people
on fire, we would--

00:42:54.285 --> 00:42:55.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: By the thousands.

00:42:55.410 --> 00:42:56.910 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: --give him
the chair, right?

00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:57.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:57.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:01.530 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: But we're told
there's a god that

00:43:01.530 --> 00:43:04.110 align:middle line:90%
will light you on fire.

00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, will
suspend your life and your soul

00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:12.285 align:middle line:84%
so that you burn not
just for a day or a week.

00:43:12.285 --> 00:43:13.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But for eternity.

00:43:13.410 --> 00:43:15.720 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: For eternity.

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:18.135 align:middle line:84%
And just not-- for not
knowing the name of Jesus.

00:43:18.135 --> 00:43:20.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:23.340 align:middle line:84%
This sounded fishy to me
by the time I hit five,

00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:26.340 align:middle line:84%
but nonetheless, the damage
is already done by then.

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:27.930 align:middle line:90%
What it does to our psyche.

00:43:27.930 --> 00:43:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And now-- and a lot of
people that are watching this

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:34.380 align:middle line:84%
were also raised with religion
at one time in their lives

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:36.720 align:middle line:84%
and now have almost
an allergic reaction

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:39.750 align:middle line:90%
to hearing the word "God."

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:41.730 align:middle line:90%
And it has to be completely--

00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:43.740 align:middle line:84%
but yet open to the
notion that there's

00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:48.330 align:middle line:84%
some beautiful, creative
force and beautiful blueprint

00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:52.320 align:middle line:84%
and template behind a rose, and
the planets, and everything.

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:54.745 align:middle line:84%
But you better not
say the word God.

00:43:54.745 --> 00:43:55.620 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: That's right.

00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:56.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:59.340 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: And you better
watch your Ps and Qs,

00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:02.492 align:middle line:84%
because if you do the least,
the slightest offense--

00:44:02.492 --> 00:44:03.575 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Gonna to get ya.

00:44:03.575 --> 00:44:04.375 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Yes.

00:44:04.375 --> 00:44:06.810 align:middle line:90%
Yes, and there's that fear.

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:11.730 align:middle line:84%
So of course on an unconscious
level the mind and the body

00:44:11.730 --> 00:44:13.380 align:middle line:90%
is allergic to God.

00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:17.160 align:middle line:84%
So it is one of the
allergies that I-- again,

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:18.690 align:middle line:90%
I call the mother allergy--

00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:22.380 align:middle line:84%
that I have all my
students clear right away.

00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:25.770 align:middle line:84%
Because after having
the allergy to God,

00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:30.036 align:middle line:84%
the next one is the
allergy to being God.

00:44:30.036 --> 00:44:33.870 align:middle line:84%
OK, we're told that we are
spiritual beings having

00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:35.280 align:middle line:90%
a human experience, right?

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:38.280 align:middle line:84%
We have a soul, we
have a divine aspect

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:41.010 align:middle line:84%
that is an individuated
aspect of God.

00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:45.570 align:middle line:84%
But how dare you
say that you're God

00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:47.490 align:middle line:84%
or that you're part
of that God energy?

00:44:47.490 --> 00:44:48.570 align:middle line:90%
How dare you?

00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And you can imagine in past
generations, that would

00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:54.495 align:middle line:90%
definitely get you killed.

00:44:54.495 --> 00:44:55.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh yeah, absolutely.

00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:57.173 align:middle line:84%
You'd be hung for
that one, or burned.

00:44:57.173 --> 00:44:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Right.

00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:01.710 align:middle line:84%
So you do the allergy clearing
for God, then to being God.

00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:05.280 align:middle line:84%
But here's how it now
translates even further.

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:09.480 align:middle line:84%
It translates into an
allergy to authority

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:12.310 align:middle line:84%
and an allergy to
inner authority.

00:45:12.310 --> 00:45:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And here's the story I have to
tell you about my daughter that

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:18.820 align:middle line:90%
was so amazing.

00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:20.670 align:middle line:84%
We recently had
lunch, and she says,

00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:22.980 align:middle line:84%
mom, you have to clear
my allergy to authority.

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:26.880 align:middle line:84%
I know I have it because every
time I would go in and talk

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:29.730 align:middle line:84%
to my previous boss,
I would get so nervous

00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:31.980 align:middle line:90%
before I would talk to him.

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:36.030 align:middle line:84%
Even if I knew I was right,
I'd almost have a panic attack

00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:40.200 align:middle line:84%
and I'd end up crying before
going into the office.

00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And as she's telling
me, you can see

00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:46.320 align:middle line:84%
she's almost having an allergic
reaction as she's talking.

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:50.010 align:middle line:84%
She's getting all red,
her eyes are getting wide,

00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:51.870 align:middle line:84%
and she's breathing
really shallow.

00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:56.730 align:middle line:84%
And then it reminded me
that's how I used to be.

00:45:56.730 --> 00:46:00.840 align:middle line:84%
I can remember when I was so
allergic to authority that

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:04.890 align:middle line:84%
to question a doctor,
to question a dentist,

00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:07.047 align:middle line:84%
to question anybody that
was speaking-- like,

00:46:07.047 --> 00:46:08.047 align:middle line:90%
I'd be at a conference--

00:46:08.047 --> 00:46:09.225 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You didn't
dare question authority.

00:46:09.225 --> 00:46:09.840 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: You didn't dare--

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a big
one for a lot of people.

00:46:11.110 --> 00:46:12.165 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: You'd have
your head chopped off.

00:46:12.165 --> 00:46:13.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lot of people
who are listening right now,

00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:14.310 align:middle line:90%
big one.

00:46:14.310 --> 00:46:15.120 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Right.

00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:19.080 align:middle line:84%
And I would get so
nervous that just

00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:24.030 align:middle line:84%
anticipating raising my hand
and formulating my question,

00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:27.340 align:middle line:84%
I would-- my heart would
start beating out of my chest.

00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:30.310 align:middle line:84%
I would feel faint
and I'd wonder,

00:46:30.310 --> 00:46:32.010 align:middle line:84%
am I even going to
be able to speak?

00:46:32.010 --> 00:46:35.500 align:middle line:84%
Because my throat
would be closing up.

00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:37.330 align:middle line:90%
She clearly inherited from--

00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:38.470 align:middle line:90%
inherited it from me.

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:39.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: From you, yeah.

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:42.297 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: So I had done
the allergy clearing--

00:46:42.297 --> 00:46:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And your mother
was a God-fearing woman.

00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:45.910 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Oh, yes she was.

00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:50.380 align:middle line:84%
So I had almost forgotten that
till I witnessed it in her,

00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:54.640 align:middle line:84%
and since I had done my allergy
clearing to God and to being

00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:57.970 align:middle line:84%
God, I realized I don't
have that anymore.

00:46:57.970 --> 00:47:00.580 align:middle line:84%
I feel so calm with
authority, so calm

00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:06.170 align:middle line:84%
about standing up for myself
and expressing my point of view,

00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:09.220 align:middle line:84%
even if it questions what
the dogma is out there

00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:11.410 align:middle line:84%
and what the
authority is saying.

00:47:11.410 --> 00:47:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And so of course, we
did that for my daughter

00:47:14.050 --> 00:47:17.530 align:middle line:84%
and she couldn't stop
calling afterwards

00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:20.410 align:middle line:84%
to tell me all the ways she was
noticing things were different.

00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:23.255 align:middle line:84%
She's called, said mom, I
even told somebody on the bus

00:47:23.255 --> 00:47:24.055 align:middle line:90%
to move over.

00:47:24.055 --> 00:47:25.270 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:27.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good for her.

00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:29.890 align:middle line:90%
So we're out of time right now.

00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:33.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've-- wow, we could go
for quite a while on this one.

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:35.740 align:middle line:84%
But thank you for
sharing that final story.

00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:36.745 align:middle line:90%
Any final thought?

00:47:36.745 --> 00:47:39.370 align:middle line:84%
First of all, we have to do this
because people will be asking,

00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:40.170 align:middle line:90%
what was that?

00:47:40.170 --> 00:47:44.230 align:middle line:10%
So this is the pendulum
charts by Dale Olson--

00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:47.410 align:middle line:10%
O-L-S-O-N. So you
can get it on Amazon.

00:47:47.410 --> 00:47:49.240 align:middle line:10%
So anyway, that's the book.

00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:51.880 align:middle line:10%
You buy pendulums anywhere,
make your own if you have to.

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:53.747 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, any final
thoughts, Jean, on this?

00:47:53.747 --> 00:47:55.330 align:middle line:84%
This has been very,
very helpful and I

00:47:55.330 --> 00:47:57.790 align:middle line:84%
think it helps people have
more empathy for themselves

00:47:57.790 --> 00:47:58.645 align:middle line:90%
and each other, too.

00:47:58.645 --> 00:47:59.445 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Yeah.

00:47:59.445 --> 00:48:02.080 align:middle line:10%
If you find that you're having
a bizarre reaction to something,

00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:03.070 align:middle line:10%
check to see.

00:48:03.070 --> 00:48:06.940 align:middle line:10%
Ask your higher guidance,
do I have a mind

00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:09.870 align:middle line:10%
of the body imbalance here?

00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:13.030 align:middle line:84%
And if so, which is it
and what do I do about it?

00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:14.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Here here.

00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:15.210 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:16.270 align:middle line:90%
As always very, very--

00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:17.070 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:48:17.070 --> 00:48:18.450 align:middle line:90%
Always very useful.

00:48:18.450 --> 00:48:20.960 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, Jean, and
we'll be seeing you again.

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:23.390 align:middle line:10%
As always, an enlightening
conversation, and one that's

00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:26.210 align:middle line:10%
coming up in a lot of research
from a variety of authors

00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:28.790 align:middle line:10%
now-- to listen to the
body as it's always

00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:30.380 align:middle line:10%
trying to tell us the truth.
