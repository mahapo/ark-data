>>GRACE LIU: SIBO stands for
a small intestinal bacteria

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.770 align:middle line:90%
overgrowth.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.570 align:middle line:84%
The root problem
is these pathogens

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.110 align:middle line:84%
that are stealing the energy
and driving the fire down.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.182 align:middle line:84%
Bloating, burps, gas,
heartburn, reflux.

00:00:21.182 --> 00:00:22.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Yep.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: When people feel healthy
and they have lots of fiber,

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.630 align:middle line:90%
they don't crave things.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.150 align:middle line:84%
Their neurotransmitters
are back.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.310 align:middle line:90%
Adrenaline is more normal.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.310 align:middle line:90%
Cortisol is more normal.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.540 align:middle line:90%
They're fertile again.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.540 align:middle line:90%
It's like, oh, my gosh.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.498 align:middle line:90%
I'm sitting in the car.

00:00:32.498 --> 00:00:34.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm not depressed anymore,
and I don't crave sugar.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:35.900 align:middle line:90%
So the disruptions come from--

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.015 align:middle line:90%


00:00:40.015 --> 00:00:41.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I don't think
we have to deliberate

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.860 align:middle line:84%
too hard to realize when there's
something off in our guts.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.820 align:middle line:10%
We're bloated, mentally slow,
inflamed, and so much more.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.940 align:middle line:84%
There's a plethora of diets
and books that show us the way.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.970 align:middle line:84%
But when the way doesn't work,
we're even more discouraged

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.170 align:middle line:90%
and then give up.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.150 align:middle line:84%
According to Dr.
Grace Liu, there

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.700 align:middle line:84%
are actually some basic tenants
that determine our health

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.880 align:middle line:90%
from the gut set.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.040 align:middle line:84%
So we do have to pay
attention to the guts.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Absolutely.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:04.629 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it is.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:05.800 align:middle line:90%
I've given up many times.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.900 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.275 align:middle line:90%
I'm one of those people.

00:01:08.275 --> 00:01:10.670 align:middle line:90%
Try it for a week, I give up.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.380 align:middle line:90%
So thank you for joining us.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.060 align:middle line:90%
This is a really big topic.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.510 align:middle line:84%
So many people have
messed up guts now.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.610 align:middle line:90%
It is really almost--

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.230 align:middle line:90%
it's almost epidemic.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.435 align:middle line:84%
Because now even kids are
having food sensitivities

00:01:25.435 --> 00:01:28.165 align:middle line:84%
and their own kind of
brain fog and issues.

00:01:28.165 --> 00:01:31.030 align:middle line:84%
When I was a kid and running
around, no one got sick.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.140 align:middle line:90%
No one had allergies.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.780 align:middle line:84%
It was just very rare,
but it's changed.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:35.780 align:middle line:90%
The world has changed.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.643 align:middle line:84%
So you wrote the book,
"7 Steps to Heal SIBO."

00:01:38.643 --> 00:01:40.060 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
start with SIBO.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yes.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.472 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So first of all,
I think, why don't you

00:01:42.472 --> 00:01:45.110 align:middle line:84%
tell us what SIBO is and why
we're starting at this point?

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Exactly.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.140 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for having me on.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.333 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: It's such an honor.

00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:53.020 align:middle line:10%
So SIBO stands for a small
intestinal bacteria overgrowth.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And I actually teach
clinicians and coaches

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.385 align:middle line:84%
how to assess the
gut microbiome,

00:01:58.385 --> 00:01:59.260 align:middle line:90%
because it's so huge.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.530 align:middle line:84%
It's a 100 trillion
microorganisms

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.800 align:middle line:84%
living within our terrain,
let's say, our landscape.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And including our GI tract,
the biggest place, the gut.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.420 align:middle line:10%
And SIBO is interesting.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.420 align:middle line:10%
We can do various testing,
gastroenterology tests.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.640 align:middle line:84%
But they're all proxies, like
breath tests or stool testing.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.140 align:middle line:84%
But none really show us
really what's going on.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.220 align:middle line:84%
And there are more
advanced tests now,

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.320 align:middle line:84%
that we can actually
genetically look

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.180 align:middle line:90%
at the microbes sitting there.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.430 align:middle line:90%
And small intestines is funny.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.760 align:middle line:90%
It's higher up in our gut.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.130 align:middle line:90%
It's not near our stools.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.960 align:middle line:84%
It's not where our
stools are produced.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.270 align:middle line:84%
They're produced in the
colon, the large intestine.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.775 align:middle line:84%
It's not the small
intestines, and--

00:02:38.775 --> 00:02:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
many people have

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.092 align:middle line:84%
upset in the upper
digestive tract, which

00:02:43.092 --> 00:02:44.050 align:middle line:90%
is the small intestine.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Right.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.713 align:middle line:84%
Bloating, burps, gas, heartburn,
reflux, a little nausea

00:02:48.713 --> 00:02:49.630 align:middle line:90%
and a little vomiting.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.625 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Even like asthma.

00:02:54.625 --> 00:02:55.870 align:middle line:90%
Even a postnasal drip.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.350 align:middle line:84%
It actually ascends
up to a higher level.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.770 align:middle line:10%
So we actually do a metabolomic
test, organic acid test.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.180 align:middle line:10%
Several companies offer it.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.500 align:middle line:90%
We love one from Great Plains.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.370 align:middle line:90%
They're really awesome.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.780 align:middle line:84%
We use them all, but that
one's pretty tremendous.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, tell
me about that test

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.210 align:middle line:84%
first, because it's
something most people

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.810 align:middle line:90%
haven't heard about.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:11.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yeah.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.540 align:middle line:84%
So just like-- what kind of
car do you drive, Regina?

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A Tesla.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:15.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: OK.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.090 align:middle line:90%
So you have a dashboard, right?

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.320 align:middle line:84%
You can tell where
your mechanic--

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No dashboard.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.950 align:middle line:84%
Just a computer screen,
but close enough.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:20.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yeah, close enough.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: So if lights
go off, you could tell

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:23.840 align:middle line:90%
your Tesla mechanic, oh, hey.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.310 align:middle line:90%
I need help.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: You wouldn't take
it to a Honda mechanic.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.570 align:middle line:10%
You wouldn't take it
to a Hyundai mechanic.

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.340 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't really
know what to do.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.980 align:middle line:90%
What the heck, right?

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:31.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.882 align:middle line:10%
>>LIU: And if they
try to work on it,

00:03:32.882 --> 00:03:35.050 align:middle line:10%
if they're not trained with
the electrical and ga--

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.780 align:middle line:10%
they could probably potentially
mess up your beautiful Tesla.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.460 align:middle line:90%
So I kind of am the same.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.090 align:middle line:84%
We do certain testing because
some testing won't actually

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.090 align:middle line:90%
tell us what's going on.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.230 align:middle line:10%
We're blind to really
what's going on.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.160 align:middle line:84%
So the metabolomic test
means the metabolites

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.348 align:middle line:84%
from our GI tract,
microbes that live

00:03:50.348 --> 00:03:51.640 align:middle line:90%
there, go into our bloodstream.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.780 align:middle line:90%
Then they're refined.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.780 align:middle line:84%
They go through our kidney
and they're filtered,

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.613 align:middle line:84%
and then we could pick
them up in the urine.

00:03:57.613 --> 00:04:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And urine is really an
awesome medium to collect.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.690 align:middle line:90%
Not that stool isn't.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.590 align:middle line:84%
Stool is only the last meter
and a half of our GI tract.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.090 align:middle line:84%
The colon, the large intestine,
is only the last meter half,

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.760 align:middle line:84%
so we're missing a lot
of information upstream.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.938 align:middle line:90%
So it's like a dashboard.

00:04:10.938 --> 00:04:13.480 align:middle line:84%
But let's say you're trying to
see how much gas you have left

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.813 align:middle line:84%
but someone's looking at the
windshield wiper indicator.

00:04:15.813 --> 00:04:18.063 align:middle line:10%
Well, you're going to miss
a whole lot of information,

00:04:18.063 --> 00:04:18.970 align:middle line:10%
if not everything.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's like a-- it's
our gut portfolio,

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.130 align:middle line:84%
like small intestines is
like a wealth portfolio.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Explain the
metabolomic part to us.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.780 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's what we're
not familiar with.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:29.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Absolutely.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.880 align:middle line:84%
So metabolomic measures in
our urine all the different,

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.470 align:middle line:84%
potentially
different, metabolites

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.290 align:middle line:84%
coming from the organisms
that live anywhere

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.990 align:middle line:84%
in our body, any
part of our terrain.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.680 align:middle line:84%
So it could be for women,
vagina area, our gut area,

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.200 align:middle line:84%
even our ear, nose, throat if
we have tremendous overgrowths

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.000 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.080 align:middle line:84%
They'll show up on this
test, so it's fabulous.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.967 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so that's
done through urine?

00:04:51.967 --> 00:04:53.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Urine testing, yes.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Urine testing.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:54.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yeah.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: Because we're
looking at the output.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.880 align:middle line:84%
Someday, it'll be so advanced,
Regina, we'll do a breath test,

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:58.630 align:middle line:90%
like on "Star Trek."

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:59.050 align:middle line:90%
Whoo!

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.092 align:middle line:84%
And we'll know exactly
what's living in the body,

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:04.870 align:middle line:84%
because they make volatile acids
and volatile materials that can

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.223 align:middle line:90%
be detected with just the air.

00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:08.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So because
people are paying--

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.520 align:middle line:84%
they're paying attention
and taking notes here.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.145 align:middle line:84%
So what is the name
of that urine test?

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: We love the
organic acid test.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.540 align:middle line:84%
We call it an OAT,
organic acid test.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.580 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
companies that are awesome.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And the one we love
is Great Plains Labs.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:21.673 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:05:21.673 --> 00:05:23.590 align:middle line:84%
And did you have to have
a prescription or can

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:24.090 align:middle line:90%
anybody order that?

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: They can.

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.370 align:middle line:84%
We can order it from our
website, thegutinstitute.com,

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.070 align:middle line:84%
or from their naturopathic
or health coach.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so this is going
to give you what information?

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And then what you do
with that information?

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: It gives us a dashboard
of the organisms that

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:38.090 align:middle line:90%
live there.

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.880 align:middle line:84%
So it focuses on two kingdoms
of life that live in the gut.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.760 align:middle line:84%
We actually have
many, five or six.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.600 align:middle line:84%
Archaea viruses,
fungi, bacteria,

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.310 align:middle line:90%
eukaryotes like parasites.

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.740 align:middle line:84%
But these only focus on
two kingdoms, so bacterial

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:54.540 align:middle line:90%
and fungal.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.530 align:middle line:90%
And it's amazing.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.230 align:middle line:84%
There's over 12
markers for fungal.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.230 align:middle line:90%
No other test does that.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:02.650 align:middle line:90%
That's why we love it a lot.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And then it's got nine
markers for bacterial.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And so when we see SIBO,
small intestinal bacterial

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.870 align:middle line:84%
overgrowth, what I have observed
seeing thousands of these tests

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.720 align:middle line:84%
and on our concierge
clients, everyone also

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.440 align:middle line:84%
has a condition known as
SIFO, small intestinal fungal

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.240 align:middle line:90%
overgrowth.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.910 align:middle line:84%
I was going to ask
you about that next.

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:22.710 align:middle line:90%
So please, share.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: You're so advanced
and sophisticated.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.260 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.440 align:middle line:84%
So our gut, if we're losing
our firewall, our protection

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.440 align:middle line:84%
and our allies, we're
vulnerable for all kinds

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.450 align:middle line:90%
of microbial invasion.

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.420 align:middle line:84%
Parasites, viruses,
fungal, mold.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.100 align:middle line:90%
Not just bacteria.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.440 align:middle line:84%
So this test is
hugely illuminating,

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.870 align:middle line:84%
because all of it's present
when the firewalls are gone.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And what we do at
my Gut Institute,

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.068 align:middle line:84%
we reinstall the
firewalls for people.

00:06:47.068 --> 00:06:48.360 align:middle line:90%
People get their body temps up.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.390 align:middle line:84%
They feel happy and their
moods are sustained again.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.190 align:middle line:84%
Their neurotransmitters
are back.

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:54.540 align:middle line:90%
Adrenaline is more normal.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:55.560 align:middle line:90%
Cortisol is more normal.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.600 align:middle line:84%
All the hormones--
they're fertile again.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.910 align:middle line:84%
So literally, we see so many
changes and improvements--

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: SIBO is
knocking out all of that?

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:02.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: SIBO can.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.380 align:middle line:84%
SIBO puts out a
lot of metabolites

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.420 align:middle line:90%
that are carcinogenic.

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:07.470 align:middle line:90%
They're proinflammatory.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.910 align:middle line:84%
They make us fat, brain
fogged, and fatigued.

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:10.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:12.342 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: And that's
hard to recover.

00:07:12.342 --> 00:07:13.800 align:middle line:84%
It's like a house
full of asbestos,

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.210 align:middle line:84%
and you can't just rip
it all out overnight.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:16.690 align:middle line:90%
It may take time in stages.

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:18.180 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to leave
your pets or kids in there.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:18.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: You've got to protect
them all or take them out,

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:20.110 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:20.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: And all the
staff that go in

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:22.880 align:middle line:90%
have to wear protective gear.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:23.760 align:middle line:90%
So the same thing with the gut.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.380 align:middle line:84%
We get a couple of nasties in
there, but they're not hard.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.810 align:middle line:90%
We can gently remo--

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:31.680 align:middle line:84%
gently have botanicals
to help them come out.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.830 align:middle line:84%
And then our key is to bring
back in the probiotics.

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:35.952 align:middle line:90%
These are our true allies.

00:07:35.952 --> 00:07:37.410 align:middle line:84%
So I actually
formulate probiotics.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:38.400 align:middle line:90%
That's a disclaimer.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.720 align:middle line:90%
Because I love them so much.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.650 align:middle line:90%
These are allies and friends.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:41.483 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I do, too.

00:07:41.483 --> 00:07:43.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: Yeah, and we
need to transplant them.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.770 align:middle line:90%
They're like an organ.

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:45.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: Yeah, they're like a
bank account for us, even.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:48.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:48.888 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: And they help
us digest gluten.

00:07:48.888 --> 00:07:50.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But there's so
many different strains.

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:51.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: True.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then people have
to figure out, oh, my gosh.

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:54.070 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what to do.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:55.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't know which
strain to take.

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:59.970 align:middle line:84%
The education curve
is there on trying

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:02.580 align:middle line:84%
to figure out the match for
your body and your probiotic.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.130 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can educate us a
little bit on that right now.

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:05.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Absolutely.

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:08.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm a fan of all probiotics, so
I'm pretty nonbiased about it,

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:08.970 align:middle line:90%
agnostic.

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:09.240 align:middle line:90%
They're all good.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But are there are
certain symptoms in people

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:12.940 align:middle line:90%
that need a certain strain?

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:14.605 align:middle line:84%
More the bacillus
strain versus--

00:08:14.605 --> 00:08:14.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yeah.

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:15.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:15.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yes.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about that.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: OK.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.753 align:middle line:84%
So just like every car has a
steering wheel and four wheels,

00:08:19.753 --> 00:08:22.170 align:middle line:84%
if they're missing them, they're
not going to get too far.

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:24.420 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to, for
sure, drive down the street.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.402 align:middle line:84%
They for sure won't
finish an F1 race, right?

00:08:26.402 --> 00:08:28.860 align:middle line:84%
So what we help them to do is
bring back the right steering

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.450 align:middle line:84%
wheel and bring
back the right make

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:32.549 align:middle line:90%
and model of the other wheels.

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:36.240 align:middle line:84%
Some clients come to us and
they've got only one wheel on,

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.752 align:middle line:90%
some three.

00:08:37.752 --> 00:08:39.460 align:middle line:84%
So we've got to bring
back the wheels on.

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.630 align:middle line:84%
So what we do is we profile
the gut a little bit

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:44.880 align:middle line:84%
from the urine organic
metabolomic test, we--

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's kind of
where you start with the--

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:48.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: We can see what
the overgrowths are, yeah.

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:49.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:51.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: And because humans have
a set amount of keystone--

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:53.980 align:middle line:90%
we call them keystone species.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Many of these come in
probiotics, by the way.

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:58.890 align:middle line:84%
They track us at birth
all the way till we're

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:00.360 align:middle line:90%
centenary, over 100 years old.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.260 align:middle line:90%
Or Methuselah, 120.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.560 align:middle line:84%
We have tons of data now,
metabolomic as well as

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.360 align:middle line:90%
metagenomics.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:10.080 align:middle line:84%
We know the species that
belong in healthy guts,

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.160 align:middle line:90%
healthy microbiomes.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.040 align:middle line:84%
These are the wealth accounts
of human beings, Homo sapiens.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.380 align:middle line:90%
We know what belongs there.

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And what we do is we
help bring them back.

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:18.645 align:middle line:90%
And we anchor them with fiber.

00:09:18.645 --> 00:09:21.540 align:middle line:84%
We call that a fancy
name called prebiotics.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.700 align:middle line:84%
So we need probiotics and
then we need their fuel.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.970 align:middle line:84%
The super fuel is really
fantastic fiber for them.

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:30.270 align:middle line:90%
Like psyllium, inulin, flaxseed.

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:34.680 align:middle line:84%
I love some commercial--
we have extracts now.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.300 align:middle line:84%
They're creamy
and sweet tasting,

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.620 align:middle line:90%
but they don't have calories.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.620 align:middle line:84%
But like GOS, which
is found in dairy.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't eat dairy much, but
we can find it in dairy.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.740 align:middle line:84%
But XOS and many
other ones, FOS.

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And they come in more like
roots and fruits and greens.

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:54.810 align:middle line:90%
And this ROS even comes from--

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:58.530 align:middle line:84%
raffinose oligosaccharide
comes from lentils and beans.

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:01.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the prebiotics are
foods that have fiber in them?

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:02.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yes.

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:03.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.078 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: And our species
might have eaten as much

00:10:05.078 --> 00:10:09.000 align:middle line:84%
as, Paleolithic studies seem
to show, even 100 to 120 grams

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.200 align:middle line:90%
of fiber a day.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.360 align:middle line:84%
Right now, we're at
barely 5 to 10 grams a day

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:17.380 align:middle line:84%
for most people in the modern,
sad, sad standard American

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:18.180 align:middle line:90%
diet.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:18.780 align:middle line:90%
And that's a--

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:19.988 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, which is sad.

00:10:19.988 --> 00:10:23.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: --probably a reason why
we miss our protective allies.

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.800 align:middle line:84%
They need to be fed or
they starve, they go away.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:30.870 align:middle line:90%
And so you start with the test.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And then once you
kind of have an idea

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:37.060 align:middle line:84%
of what spectrum of fungus
and bacteria are in there--

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:37.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yes.

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:41.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --then you start
on the reduction of them,

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:42.650 align:middle line:84%
or do you just start
with prebiotics?

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:45.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: So I like to
layer protocols together.

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:47.660 align:middle line:84%
We see the most rapid
recovery for people.

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.910 align:middle line:84%
We have tons of people able
to say, oh, my God, Grace.

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:51.493 align:middle line:84%
In two months, I can
eat gluten again.

00:10:51.493 --> 00:10:53.330 align:middle line:84%
Or, oh, I feel myself
again, for women

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:54.890 align:middle line:90%
who are trying to get fertile.

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:57.320 align:middle line:84%
We see their progesterone
go up three or four times.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:00.560 align:middle line:84%
I also do supplement
programs for MMA fighters.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And usually in just two
to three weeks or less,

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.460 align:middle line:84%
they have endless
energy and endurance.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:08.330 align:middle line:84%
Whereas before, they have these
little lapses or hit a wall.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:09.830 align:middle line:84%
So there's a
researcher in Australia

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:13.460 align:middle line:84%
who did a fascinating study how
our hormones and our fertility

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:16.940 align:middle line:84%
and our fecundity and
vigor is really to our gut,

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:18.260 align:middle line:90%
actually, and the microbiome.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:19.385 align:middle line:90%
So he did an amazing study.

00:11:19.385 --> 00:11:22.730 align:middle line:84%
He took really healthy young
men, 18 to 40 years old,

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:26.450 align:middle line:84%
gave them a small dose
of pathogenics bacteria,

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:27.920 align:middle line:90%
but only their cell wall.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.380 align:middle line:90%
And it is inflammatory a bit.

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:33.140 align:middle line:84%
So he gave them a dose,
0.8 nanograms per kilo.

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:37.545 align:middle line:84%
Within six hours, he saw
their testosterone tank.

00:11:37.545 --> 00:11:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And they were, of course,
really healthy men.

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:40.770 align:middle line:90%
And so it came back up again.

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:43.603 align:middle line:84%
So when I work with
men or women, when we--

00:11:43.603 --> 00:11:45.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us
the implication,

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:48.530 align:middle line:84%
what that test was, what it was
showing, what it was proving,

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:50.410 align:middle line:84%
and-- yeah, so we
can understand it.

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:50.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yeah.

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.520 align:middle line:84%
A lot of our vigor and
energy and endurance

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.433 align:middle line:84%
comes from who we are
and our hormone profile.

00:11:55.433 --> 00:11:56.600 align:middle line:90%
So we do a lot of profiling.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.130 align:middle line:90%
We do hormone testing.

00:11:58.130 --> 00:11:59.840 align:middle line:90%
We do gut testing.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.510 align:middle line:84%
We do a variety of
different testing,

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:05.600 align:middle line:84%
because we will see things get
better, even 3x better or even

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.950 align:middle line:90%
5x better.

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:09.620 align:middle line:84%
So when I work with different
athletes or executives or moms,

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:12.380 align:middle line:84%
really smart moms, we want
to help them feel better.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:15.950 align:middle line:84%
More themselves, what they were
when they were 17 or 27 or 37.

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:17.180 align:middle line:90%
Whatever they want, right?

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.010 align:middle line:84%
We want to restore
that, and we can

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:22.730 align:middle line:84%
when we restore our allies again
by healing and sealing the gut

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:25.880 align:middle line:84%
lining, balancing those
pathogenic flora so

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.310 align:middle line:84%
that we have the firewall, the
firewall of the probiotics.

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:31.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So essentially
healing leaky gut first.

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: Yeah, but there's
a host of other things

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:35.240 align:middle line:90%
that can be occurring too.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:36.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:37.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Exactly.

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:38.543 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All right.

00:12:38.543 --> 00:12:43.680 align:middle line:84%
So then do we begin
looking at-- first of all,

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.830 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about some of
the offending things that

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:47.930 align:middle line:84%
are causing the
problem to begin with.

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:50.090 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a
good place to start.

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:52.700 align:middle line:84%
We've got an idea now
of what the test is.

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:53.600 align:middle line:90%
We can look at it.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.180 align:middle line:84%
Then we have to start looking
at how we're going to approach

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:58.310 align:middle line:90%
this thing strategically, OK?

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:01.280 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you have
essentially the symptoms

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.260 align:middle line:84%
of SIBO, and your labs are kind
of pointing towards that as

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:05.060 align:middle line:90%
well.

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:05.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yes.

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:07.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what's
the first thing we do?

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:08.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: OK.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.950 align:middle line:84%
So if someone has either
silent SIBO, where

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:13.160 align:middle line:84%
they have no symptoms except
maybe fatigue or brain fog

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.380 align:middle line:84%
or slow mental clarity
or an obvious one,

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:19.580 align:middle line:84%
where it's autoimmune disease or
cancer risks or cancer or aches

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:23.070 align:middle line:84%
and pains, fibromyalgia, we
one of the first things, tests,

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.350 align:middle line:84%
I do is to look at
their organic acid test.

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually, we'll
look at a stool test.

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:29.090 align:middle line:84%
We want to see what's
remaining after we

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:30.800 align:middle line:90%
do some initial weeding.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.590 align:middle line:90%
I call it weeding.

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:33.950 align:middle line:90%
Or it's like staging a house.

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:36.950 align:middle line:84%
We're doing some initial
cleanup, housekeeping.

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:38.180 align:middle line:90%
We also look at hormones.

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:41.900 align:middle line:84%
We want to see how low
someone's adrenal and cortisol

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:42.890 align:middle line:90%
dysregulation is.

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:44.930 align:middle line:84%
Because the flora, when
they're pathogenic,

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:46.370 align:middle line:90%
they wear everything down.

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:47.850 align:middle line:90%
The reserves go down.

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:50.060 align:middle line:84%
So we look at where they
start, because we're

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:53.270 align:middle line:84%
going to help them boost it
where they need boosting.

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And they feel more
energy and endurance just

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:57.300 align:middle line:84%
within two to four weeks
or less by doing so.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:01.610 align:middle line:84%
So some people have three to
five levels of, we call it,

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:03.480 align:middle line:90%
adrenal insufficiency.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:07.640 align:middle line:84%
So one of our primary glands,
it literally motors and--

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.560 align:middle line:90%
it's the engine for our energy.

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And we have-- we can
restore function there

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:15.560 align:middle line:84%
if it's kind of
poopy, not so great.

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:18.620 align:middle line:84%
I look at centenarian
studies and men and women who

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:21.170 align:middle line:84%
are really healthy, chronic
disease-free, cancer-free,

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:25.950 align:middle line:84%
living 80, 90, 100 years, they
have robust adrenal glands.

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:27.540 align:middle line:90%
So we can restore a lot.

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.047 align:middle line:84%
So some of the
testing we'll do is

00:14:29.047 --> 00:14:31.130 align:middle line:84%
like to ask them, oh, do
you feel wired but tired?

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:33.650 align:middle line:90%
Do you wake up refreshed?

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:34.865 align:middle line:90%
Are you able to work out?

00:14:34.865 --> 00:14:36.350 align:middle line:90%
Do you feel tired all the time?

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:37.770 align:middle line:90%
Just basic questions like that.

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:40.395 align:middle line:84%
So then depending on where they
score and some other testing we

00:14:40.395 --> 00:14:42.740 align:middle line:84%
might do to look at
coritsol dysregulation

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:45.293 align:middle line:84%
and their adrenaline,
then we give them

00:14:45.293 --> 00:14:46.460 align:middle line:90%
different levels of support.

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:48.980 align:middle line:84%
That's really key, because
we check core temperatures.

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.980 align:middle line:84%
A lot of clients who come
in, they're really ill.

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.340 align:middle line:84%
They've got the SIBO and
the SIFO and they're tired.

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:58.490 align:middle line:84%
Their core temperatures may
only be 95.0, believe it or not,

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:00.105 align:middle line:90%
Fahrenheit, or 97.0.

00:15:00.105 --> 00:15:00.980 align:middle line:90%
It's not appropriate.

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:02.330 align:middle line:90%
This is our primary--

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.460 align:middle line:84%
our thermostat and the
temperatures we sustain

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:08.470 align:middle line:84%
are our primary way
we fry the microbes

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:10.720 align:middle line:84%
and prevent fungal
overgrowth, viral overgrowth,

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.720 align:middle line:90%
or bacterial overgrowth.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.110 align:middle line:90%
So when we lose that.

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:16.640 align:middle line:84%
So when we lose our friends, our
allies, and we lose our fire,

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:18.240 align:middle line:90%
we're going to look at diseases.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.910 align:middle line:84%
So we have to restore
both, actually.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:22.310 align:middle line:84%
So some of our protocols
are restoring all that

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:23.363 align:middle line:90%
simultaneously.

00:15:23.363 --> 00:15:24.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I have a question.

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:26.210 align:middle line:90%
This came up during COVID.

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:28.580 align:middle line:84%
People were having their
temperature taken everywhere

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:28.970 align:middle line:90%
they went.

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.680 align:middle line:84%
They have that little
gun and their forehead.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.390 align:middle line:84%
I'd have them do my
wrist, if possible.

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:32.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yeah.

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:34.273 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But
nonetheless, doing that.

00:15:34.273 --> 00:15:39.140 align:middle line:84%
But the numbers that they put
up as the acceptable spectrum

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.510 align:middle line:84%
were considerably
lower than you think

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:43.370 align:middle line:84%
of as the average
human temperature.

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:47.840 align:middle line:84%
Has there been a drop en
masse in our core temperature

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:48.680 align:middle line:90%
in humanity?

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:49.240 align:middle line:90%
That's what it looks like.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.657 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: Regina, you are just
so sophisticated and advanced.

00:15:51.657 --> 00:15:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there has been few reports
about it, but it's super legit.

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And I see it across the board
with all my clients as well,

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:56.370 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:58.495 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's why I'm
asking, because this thing

00:15:58.495 --> 00:16:01.220 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about,
this constant fatigue,

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.980 align:middle line:84%
trying to jack ourselves up
with, whether it's caffeine--

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Caffeine.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:04.220 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.025 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --or
something stronger.

00:16:05.025 --> 00:16:05.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yeah.

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:08.215 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What is that a
little tiny can, Red Bull?

00:16:08.215 --> 00:16:09.015 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yes.

00:16:09.015 --> 00:16:09.410 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:10.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or
something like that.

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Exactly.

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:12.882 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Trying to
jack ourselves back up.

00:16:12.882 --> 00:16:15.620 align:middle line:84%
But this lack of fire which
you're seeing as people

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.630 align:middle line:84%
become more and more
kind of static or--

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:19.422 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: Anyone on the
standard American diet

00:16:19.422 --> 00:16:20.690 align:middle line:90%
or that Western civilization.

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:23.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and
more time in the chair.

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.450 align:middle line:90%
Tell us.

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
this for a moment

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:27.840 align:middle line:84%
since this core temperature
is so important.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.900 align:middle line:90%
Why is our temperature lowering?

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: I think it's
the same disruptions

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:33.590 align:middle line:90%
that we want to change, right?

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:36.320 align:middle line:10%
Like you're finding for
your audience to bring note,

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.300 align:middle line:10%
but people may be
on high sugar diets,

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:42.130 align:middle line:10%
low fiber diets, not feeding
their flora well, antibiotics.

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:42.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Aha.

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:44.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yeah.

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:45.980 align:middle line:90%
We didn't know they were so bad.

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:49.513 align:middle line:84%
They saved lives, prevented
death from pneumonia, and--

00:16:49.513 --> 00:16:51.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But no one
knew what they were

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:52.105 align:middle line:90%
going to do to our gut health.

00:16:52.105 --> 00:16:53.605 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: No one knew
the damage, yeah.

00:16:53.605 --> 00:16:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And our collateral
damage is our gut health.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:58.340 align:middle line:84%
Like if something happened and
all Teslas lost their steering

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:00.720 align:middle line:84%
wheel in three cars, you'd
think it's a travesty.

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.330 align:middle line:84%
But no one's
screaming, like, hey.

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:05.089 align:middle line:84%
Silent SIFO and
SIBO is a problem.

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:09.290 align:middle line:84%
People living with body
aches and horrible pain

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:11.030 align:middle line:90%
and depression.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.619 align:middle line:90%
It's not great.

00:17:12.619 --> 00:17:14.077 align:middle line:84%
That's silent SIFO
and silent SIBO.

00:17:14.077 --> 00:17:14.877 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:14.877 --> 00:17:16.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: And we can reverse that.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.710 align:middle line:84%
So the disruptions come from
antibiotics, high sugar diets,

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:20.839 align:middle line:90%
stress.

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:23.435 align:middle line:90%
How many of us are--

00:17:23.435 --> 00:17:25.230 align:middle line:84%
if you're an introvert,
maybe you're OK.

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:27.390 align:middle line:84%
But if you're an
extrovert, being isolated

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:28.190 align:middle line:90%
is very damaging.

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:28.796 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The COVID this has
been very, very challenging

00:17:28.796 --> 00:17:29.596 align:middle line:90%
for extroverts.

00:17:29.596 --> 00:17:33.315 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: It's literally causing
depression and suicides

00:17:33.315 --> 00:17:34.190 align:middle line:90%
all across the board.

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I read a recent report
in the US population 18 to 25,

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:45.530 align:middle line:84%
1/4 in this report have
seriously considered suicide.

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:46.860 align:middle line:90%
One in four.

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:47.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yeah.

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:48.380 align:middle line:90%
My kids are social.

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:49.200 align:middle line:90%
They're in that age group.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we worry about them.

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:51.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:52.735 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So stress.

00:17:52.735 --> 00:17:53.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yeah.

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:53.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
stress is a big one.

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: Any kind of stress,
like too much light stress,

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.287 align:middle line:90%
not getting UV light.

00:17:57.287 --> 00:17:59.370 align:middle line:84%
Some people aren't going
outdoors in the sunlight.

00:17:59.370 --> 00:17:59.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:01.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: Please go out
and get some sunlight.

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:01.675 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, get some sun.

00:18:01.675 --> 00:18:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: Your microbes
and your flora love it.

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.370 align:middle line:90%
See friends.

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:07.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:08.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: See really happy faces.

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:08.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really important.

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:09.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yeah.

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Eating together,
breaking bread together,

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:13.720 align:middle line:90%
sharing in our communities.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:16.015 align:middle line:84%
This is a huge disruption
to Homo sapiens.

00:18:16.015 --> 00:18:20.410 align:middle line:84%
We're wolf pack type,
and we live among tribes.

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:22.875 align:middle line:90%
It's wildly abnormal.

00:18:22.875 --> 00:18:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So all
of this combined

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:28.510 align:middle line:84%
is literally kind of turning
the flame down at our core.

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:30.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: I believe
so, and our flora

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:33.230 align:middle line:84%
are kind of being
sacrificed in the end.

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:34.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:35.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: It's almost like
an antibiotic effect.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:36.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:38.510 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's what we
shouldn't be doing so--

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:39.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yeah.

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:40.840 align:middle line:90%
Also extreme exercise.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.070 align:middle line:90%
I work with athletes.

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Endurance athleticism
is highly shown,

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:47.500 align:middle line:84%
right after a heavy, heavy,
heavy event or workout,

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:48.700 align:middle line:90%
their flora goes down.

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:49.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:50.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: And they're more
prone to infections.

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:50.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:51.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: And there's
a lot of studies,

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:53.352 align:middle line:84%
not-- they're not
all great studies,

00:18:53.352 --> 00:18:55.810 align:middle line:84%
but if you have a high enough
dose and the right probiotic,

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:58.030 align:middle line:84%
you can protect from
pneumonia or upper respiratory

00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:00.238 align:middle line:84%
or other type of infections
after an endurance event,

00:19:00.238 --> 00:19:03.530 align:middle line:84%
that they're highly
performance-altering

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:04.330 align:middle line:90%
components.

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Probiotics are great,
but you're right.

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:08.320 align:middle line:84%
You have to have the right
dose, the right species.

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:09.610 align:middle line:84%
There's certain
species we don't do.

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:11.200 align:middle line:84%
For instance, we
don't do any Espalier.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.180 align:middle line:84%
It's very popular and
functional medicine land.

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:13.980 align:middle line:90%
It's not great.

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:15.580 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has
reactions to it if you

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:18.520 align:middle line:84%
measure at a sublevel
with appropriate testing.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.680 align:middle line:84%
We check antibodies
against saccharomyces.

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.070 align:middle line:84%
Usually people
are lit up for it,

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:24.010 align:middle line:84%
so you don't want to give
something-- just like gluten.

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:25.120 align:middle line:84%
Like if someone's
allergic for gluten,

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.277 align:middle line:84%
they show antibodies
to gliadin and gluten.

00:19:27.277 --> 00:19:29.110 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to give
them gluten all day.

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:30.490 align:middle line:84%
Espalier is not
a great probiotic

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:31.775 align:middle line:90%
for our dysbiotic clients.

00:19:31.775 --> 00:19:32.575 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:32.575 --> 00:19:32.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yeah.

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:34.702 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, what
about supplementation?

00:19:34.702 --> 00:19:36.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: It's a yeast,
saccharomyces.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:36.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:37.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yeah.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:38.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:41.980 align:middle line:84%
What about supplementation if
you're looking at SIBO or SIFO

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.100 align:middle line:90%
in the upper GI tract?

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:43.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yes.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.442 align:middle line:10%
So there are a
variety of supplements

00:19:45.442 --> 00:19:46.810 align:middle line:10%
that are shown to help this.

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:48.550 align:middle line:10%
We are fans of all
of them, actually.

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:50.890 align:middle line:10%
So sometimes, even probiotics
can have adverse effects.

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:52.182 align:middle line:90%
You have to start low, go slow.

00:19:52.182 --> 00:19:53.980 align:middle line:90%
Find the right ones and test.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:55.480 align:middle line:90%
Test, don't guess.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.160 align:middle line:84%
Second, we love all kinds
of anti-inflammatories.

00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:58.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:19:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yeah.

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.500 align:middle line:84%
So one of my favorite
is called Metagenics.

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:07.660 align:middle line:84%
It's called SPM, specialized
pro-resolving mediators.

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:09.963 align:middle line:84%
When we look at studies,
people who are stressed

00:20:09.963 --> 00:20:11.380 align:middle line:84%
or they're not
meditating, they're

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:15.430 align:middle line:84%
not in a vagal tone, a
parasympathetic strong nervous

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:19.060 align:middle line:84%
system drive, studies show they
have low levels of resolvins

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:20.650 align:middle line:90%
in their tissues.

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:23.000 align:middle line:84%
In Japan, studies show that
when they IV resolvins,

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.880 align:middle line:84%
they can put cancer
into remission.

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.235 align:middle line:90%
It's super fantastic.

00:20:26.235 --> 00:20:27.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Interesting,
though, is

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:29.270 align:middle line:84%
this is resolvins
you're speaking of.

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:30.370 align:middle line:90%
But that's SPM?

00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:30.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: SPM.

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:32.220 align:middle line:84%
It's a powerful
anti-inflammatory,

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:34.840 align:middle line:84%
and there are at least four
or five colitis studies.

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:39.220 align:middle line:84%
So human gut inflammatory
conditions, disorders, they're

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.508 align:middle line:90%
highly improved using resolvins.

00:20:41.508 --> 00:20:42.800 align:middle line:90%
And it helps with chronic pain.

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.008 align:middle line:84%
So if some of our clients
come, they have some aches,

00:20:45.008 --> 00:20:49.520 align:middle line:84%
we help to reduce that pain
that may be stealing away

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.320 align:middle line:90%
their drive.

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.450 align:middle line:84%
So we can get their adrenals
back on track faster.

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:55.587 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So is that only taken
on like an as-needed basis?

00:20:55.587 --> 00:20:57.920 align:middle line:84%
Or is it something people
would take on a regular basis?

00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: Well, for us in our
protocols, we do it regularly.

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:00.730 align:middle line:84%
It's part of our
leaky gut protocol.

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:01.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yeah.

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:02.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:04.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: Yeah, and there's
amazing other things we do.

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:06.715 align:middle line:84%
And then the key is to
get to the root problem.

00:21:06.715 --> 00:21:08.770 align:middle line:84%
The root problem
is these pathogens

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:12.160 align:middle line:84%
that are stealing the energy
and driving the fire down.

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And then the second
root problem is,

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:16.195 align:middle line:84%
everyone has some degree
of adrenal insufficiency.

00:21:16.195 --> 00:21:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And I would say
even more so now,

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:19.265 align:middle line:84%
because we live
in the COVID era.

00:21:19.265 --> 00:21:21.640 align:middle line:84%
It's probably not likely to
end in the next three to five

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.807 align:middle line:84%
years, so this is going to
be going out for a while.

00:21:23.807 --> 00:21:26.800 align:middle line:84%
So seeing what we can do, we
have some special exercises.

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm a big fan of oxytocin.

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: It's a neurotransmitter
and a signaler.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:32.800 align:middle line:90%
It's healing.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: We give-- they say a kiss
for a boo-boo is more healing

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:39.335 align:middle line:90%
than a Band-Aid or--

00:21:39.335 --> 00:21:40.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:42.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: Yeah, or like antibiotic
cream for little children,

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:45.640 align:middle line:84%
because a mom's kiss it
elicits so much oxytocin.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:48.280 align:middle line:84%
When we see faces,
our oxytocin goes up.

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.860 align:middle line:84%
When we see humans
interacting with trust,

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:52.520 align:middle line:90%
that drives our oxytocin.

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.380 align:middle line:84%
So also, running
and sex increase it.

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:55.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:55.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: And guess what?

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:57.310 align:middle line:84%
Probiotics are shown
to improve it, too.

00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:57.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:58.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yes.

00:21:58.090 --> 00:21:59.770 align:middle line:84%
They help with wound
healing and it's

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:03.280 align:middle line:84%
associated with a statistical
increase in oxytocin.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:06.340 align:middle line:84%
For autistic kids, we'll
have them do nasal sometimes,

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:09.640 align:middle line:84%
and it's shown to help
increase eye gazing and eye

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:13.280 align:middle line:84%
contact and a lot of the
other neuroatypical signs.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:14.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.490 align:middle line:84%
You just said nasal, and
you're talking about nasal--

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:17.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: It's a squirter.

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:17.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Nasal probiotics.

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: It's an
oxytocin nasal spray.

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:20.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, oxytocin.

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:22.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: It doesn't
work for everybody.

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:22.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: But we do
exercises to elicit it.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.920 align:middle line:84%
So one is we have them
exercise 10,000 steps a day,

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:29.925 align:middle line:84%
if possible, unless they
have chronic fatigue.

00:22:29.925 --> 00:22:31.300 align:middle line:84%
We have them, with
their partner,

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:35.030 align:middle line:84%
do mutual 20-minute
massage with each other.

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And even if possible, some
people's love language

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:41.320 align:middle line:84%
is verbal, so we ask
them to give each other

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:42.250 align:middle line:90%
some affirmations.

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:44.572 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh, I love
you because xyz.

00:22:44.572 --> 00:22:46.780 align:middle line:84%
You're so wonderful and make
me coffee every morning.

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:51.830 align:middle line:84%
Or oh, I love how I feel seen
and safe and heard by you,

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:53.260 align:middle line:84%
and it just makes
me feel so good.

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:55.010 align:middle line:84%
So while they're doing
the mutual massage.

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:55.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:58.310 align:middle line:10%
>>LIU: And we have seen
huge healing for the gut,

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:00.550 align:middle line:10%
because love is the best
magic on Earth, right?

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:01.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:03.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: And love is our
building block of our universe.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:07.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when we look
at the quality of information

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:10.580 align:middle line:84%
that's moving through our
atmosphere all the time

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:12.870 align:middle line:84%
and we're being exposed
to all the time,

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:15.615 align:middle line:84%
it's really the antithesis
of love for the most part.

00:23:15.615 --> 00:23:16.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yeah, exactly.

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:18.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I've been
thinking about that recently.

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:20.030 align:middle line:84%
I'll do another
show with someone

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:22.400 align:middle line:90%
that does this subject of 5G.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.440 align:middle line:84%
But I thought, it's not
just the frequencies,

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:29.720 align:middle line:84%
but the information and data
load and the low quality

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:34.400 align:middle line:84%
of information and data that's
being projected and passed

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.970 align:middle line:90%
through these frequencies.

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:39.620 align:middle line:84%
I think the low consciousness
of it has much to do with it.

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:41.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: There are
changes to DNA, yeah.

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you had super high
frequency information being

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:48.950 align:middle line:84%
projected, constantly broadcast
through these EMF fields,

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:51.410 align:middle line:84%
I think we'd be seeing
a very different thing.

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:54.030 align:middle line:84%
Because it's unconscious,
but our cells recognize it.

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: Do you think,
Regina, that's

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:56.720 align:middle line:84%
why people feel so much
better, differently,

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.490 align:middle line:84%
in Europe or other
places outside of us

00:23:58.490 --> 00:23:59.510 align:middle line:90%
compared to the USA?

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:01.220 align:middle line:84%
I've had a lot of
clients tell me that.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:02.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:03.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: I have felt
it as well, too.

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:04.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I have, too.

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:04.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yeah.

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:05.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When I go to
Europe, I feel refreshed,

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.180 align:middle line:84%
even if I'm in a big city
and then come back into it.

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:08.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yeah.

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:10.863 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But in my case,
it's slightly different,

00:24:10.863 --> 00:24:13.940 align:middle line:84%
because I live in a fairly
isolated environment on a farm.

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:17.210 align:middle line:84%
No 5G around, and really
not many neighbors.

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a little more
peaceful than normal,

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:20.467 align:middle line:90%
but I go out of that.

00:24:20.467 --> 00:24:22.550 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you're out of
it and in normal spectrum

00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:24.315 align:middle line:90%
or in a hotel, you can feel it.

00:24:24.315 --> 00:24:25.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yeah, exactly.

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:27.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I'm thinking
it's a combination.

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:30.875 align:middle line:84%
As you say, these overt things
that we can choose to do

00:24:30.875 --> 00:24:32.750 align:middle line:84%
and that we have the
capacity as human beings

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:35.730 align:middle line:84%
to do and share with one
another are fabulous.

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:38.480 align:middle line:84%
But we do have this other
stuff passing through us

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.710 align:middle line:84%
without our permission,
all the time.

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:41.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yes, that's right.

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:42.095 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:42.095 --> 00:24:43.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: You're hitting it
without our permission.

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:43.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:44.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yeah.

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:45.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So there we go.

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:47.152 align:middle line:90%
So oxytocin production.

00:24:47.152 --> 00:24:48.860 align:middle line:84%
OK, now I have another
little-- go ahead.

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:50.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: Oh, so just
to tack onto that.

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:53.270 align:middle line:84%
There are studies that
show the EMF of 3G,

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:55.050 align:middle line:84%
4G, or some of
the higher levels,

00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:57.380 align:middle line:84%
especially they also
alter our viruses.

00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:00.190 align:middle line:84%
They get unhappy and they're
under siege and they come out.

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:01.440 align:middle line:90%
They're chronically activated.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:04.430 align:middle line:84%
Just like someone who gets
shingles from herpes virus,

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:06.000 align:middle line:90%
the varicella, they're--

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.240 align:middle line:84%
it's like a mini shingles,
but neurologically.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:08.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:09.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Not even being seen.

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.507 align:middle line:84%
So we see a lot of
chronically-activated

00:25:11.507 --> 00:25:14.750 align:middle line:84%
Epstein-Barr, cytomegalovirus,
HHV-6, 7, parvo, all of them.

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:16.390 align:middle line:90%
And lyme co-infections, so--

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:17.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is so important
for people to understand.

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: This is why the
goal is to hard and why

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:19.837 align:middle line:90%
people get frustrated.

00:25:19.837 --> 00:25:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And then they get very
tired of trying to try

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:23.398 align:middle line:90%
these random Google protocols.

00:25:23.398 --> 00:25:24.440 align:middle line:90%
They don't work for them.

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:26.150 align:middle line:84%
They're not customized
and they're not really

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:27.983 align:middle line:84%
getting to the root
issue of a lot of things

00:25:27.983 --> 00:25:29.100 align:middle line:90%
in a sequential, safe way.

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:29.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:32.840 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I'll go back where I was
going to hop a little bit ago,

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:35.900 align:middle line:90%
seemingly tangential.

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do
with the nasal passages

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:43.190 align:middle line:84%
and kind of chronic nasal stuff
or low-grade nasal infections

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:45.410 align:middle line:84%
and their affiliation
with the guts.

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:46.460 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:47.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yes.

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:51.020 align:middle line:84%
So we do a full terrain
rehaul, overhaul.

00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:53.030 align:middle line:84%
Because every part of
our body is connected.

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:54.950 align:middle line:84%
Just like on
Facebook or you and I

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:57.550 align:middle line:90%
are three or six degrees away.

00:25:57.550 --> 00:25:59.940 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's connected, whether
they believe it or not.

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's same with
all our organ systems.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.580 align:middle line:84%
They are all connected
through the lymph.

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:06.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so our lymph--

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:08.180 align:middle line:84%
like for instance, breast
milk has fiber in it.

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:09.847 align:middle line:84%
It's called human
milk oligosaccharides.

00:26:09.847 --> 00:26:12.020 align:middle line:84%
The baby gets it to
feed the bacteria there.

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:14.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, our lymph
carries, guess what?

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:15.920 align:middle line:84%
Poop bacteria up
into mom's breast

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.085 align:middle line:84%
milk so that she can anchor an
immune system into the baby.

00:26:19.085 --> 00:26:22.460 align:middle line:84%
It's the probiotics in
her body, as well as

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:23.840 align:middle line:90%
going through the birth canal.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.850 align:middle line:84%
The vaginal birth canal
is the amazing place

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:28.250 align:middle line:84%
where babies get inoculated
with all their immune system,

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:29.747 align:middle line:90%
the bacteria from mom.

00:26:29.747 --> 00:26:30.830 align:middle line:90%
So everything's connected.

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:34.183 align:middle line:84%
And when we do protocols, we're
doing sinus rinses, throat.

00:26:34.183 --> 00:26:35.600 align:middle line:84%
Because as we're
sleeping, there's

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.090 align:middle line:84%
always a little postnasal
drip, all night.

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:40.250 align:middle line:84%
7% of our life, we
have low postnasal drip

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:42.960 align:middle line:84%
or a little regurge
from our esophagus.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.660 align:middle line:84%
So we have to look
at that terrain,

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:47.160 align:middle line:84%
because we don't want to do
all this overhaul in the gut

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.482 align:middle line:84%
but then have every night a
little reinoculation again.

00:26:49.482 --> 00:26:51.232 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
what I'm wondering.

00:26:51.232 --> 00:26:53.720 align:middle line:84%
Is sinus rinsing a good idea
as a daily practice anyway?

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:56.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: Well, we have
some botanicals we use,

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:58.280 align:middle line:90%
and they're very safe and great.

00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:59.897 align:middle line:84%
But you have to be
careful with water.

00:26:59.897 --> 00:27:00.980 align:middle line:90%
People think it's sterile.

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:01.970 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not.

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:05.900 align:middle line:84%
There actually can be some
small parasites or intracellular

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:07.490 align:middle line:84%
parasites we want
to be careful about.

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:08.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you want
really clean water.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:09.125 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yeah, boiled.

00:27:09.125 --> 00:27:10.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It has to pure water.

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:10.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yeah, absolutely.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:11.843 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, pure water.

00:27:11.843 --> 00:27:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And then what about saline
and saline and baking soda

00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:16.866 align:middle line:90%
or sodium bicarbonate?

00:27:16.866 --> 00:27:18.366 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: I haven't
used that too much,

00:27:18.366 --> 00:27:22.550 align:middle line:84%
but we do more botanicals, so
we do like olive leaf extract

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:25.580 align:middle line:90%
or grapefruit seed extract.

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:27.420 align:middle line:84%
There's a variety of
nasal preps that we do.

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:28.220 align:middle line:90%
Even xylitol.

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:30.560 align:middle line:84%
It's a sugar, but then
also, it breaks biofilms

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:36.000 align:middle line:84%
and it helps with MRSA, MARCoNS,
and biofilms and lyme biofilms.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.700 align:middle line:90%
So we start there.

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And then we harbor different
pathogens in our mouth.

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:44.490 align:middle line:84%
So again, we swallow or
have that postnasal drip,

00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:47.340 align:middle line:84%
particularly pathogenic
strep and fungal elements.

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:48.952 align:middle line:90%
They may be in the mouth.

00:27:48.952 --> 00:27:50.660 align:middle line:84%
If people have pets,
sometimes we to work

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:51.930 align:middle line:90%
on their pets a little bit.

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:52.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:52.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: [LAUGHS] Yeah.

00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:54.515 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you live
and sleep with pets.

00:27:54.515 --> 00:27:54.825 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Exactly.

00:27:54.825 --> 00:27:56.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So some
whole other level.

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:56.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so--

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:59.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: Studies show we make
the same flora that they

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:01.470 align:middle line:84%
have within us, and they
also have some of our flora

00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:02.270 align:middle line:90%
within them.

00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:04.770 align:middle line:84%
It's very funny and uncanny,
because we're all connected.

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:05.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:07.278 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: We share a
microbial cloud, right?

00:28:07.278 --> 00:28:08.278 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's--

00:28:08.278 --> 00:28:10.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: So we just work a
little bit, inch by inch.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And then for women, we also
have a vaginal protocol.

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:13.303 align:middle line:90%
It's very important.

00:28:13.303 --> 00:28:17.000 align:middle line:84%
Because just like sinuses, it's
this huge, 3-dimensional space

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.030 align:middle line:84%
where the babies live and
hibernate and incubate.

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:21.270 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge area.

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:22.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yeah.

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:25.940 align:middle line:84%
So what we'll see usually
within two months or less, women

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:28.370 align:middle line:84%
with cysts or fibroids or
polycystic ovarian disease,

00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:32.850 align:middle line:84%
PCOS, they'll be
symptom free, no PMS

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:36.940 align:middle line:84%
and no more aches, no pain,
endometriosis and discomfort

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:37.740 align:middle line:90%
are gone.

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And when they try to size a
cyst or fibroid with their OB,

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:42.630 align:middle line:84%
within two or three months,
they can't even find it.

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:45.540 align:middle line:84%
It's entirely gone, so
the body can melt it away

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:49.470 align:middle line:84%
when we rehab these areas for
them and bring back the flora.

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:50.970 align:middle line:84%
The flora help to
break it all down.

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:52.012 align:middle line:90%
I'm so grateful for them.

00:28:52.012 --> 00:28:54.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's exciting, but
it's a commitment for people.

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:58.200 align:middle line:84%
You have to at least be aware
and then stay with something.

00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm one of those
classic failures,

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:02.340 align:middle line:84%
because I'll try something
for a week and well, that

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:02.800 align:middle line:90%
didn't work and--

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:03.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: I'll try for one day.

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:03.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:04.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: I'm bad.

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:05.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm worse than you.

00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:05.920 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:06.340 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my God.

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:06.870 align:middle line:90%
It's not working.

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:08.703 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, maybe
I'm flattering myself.

00:29:08.703 --> 00:29:11.003 align:middle line:84%
Probably closer to
five days average.

00:29:11.003 --> 00:29:12.420 align:middle line:84%
I'll try for a
little bit and then

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:13.980 align:middle line:84%
say, eh, I'm not feeling
anything, and let go.

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:15.990 align:middle line:84%
But really, once you
strike on something

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:21.430 align:middle line:84%
that has some traditionally
useful elements,

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:24.110 align:middle line:84%
it's a good idea to stick
with it for a while, isn't it?

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:24.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yeah.

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:25.952 align:middle line:90%
You can take some breaks.

00:29:25.952 --> 00:29:29.180 align:middle line:84%
It's OK, to see how the
body holds that resilience.

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:29.980 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And then, the deeper the
dysbiosis usually, these things

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:34.690 align:middle line:90%
don't happen overnight, right?

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:36.608 align:middle line:84%
So then they're stuck
in there for a while.

00:29:36.608 --> 00:29:38.650 align:middle line:84%
It takes a little time to
kind of bring them out.

00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:39.760 align:middle line:90%
But they do.

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:43.620 align:middle line:84%
People have unrelenting
genetics and resolve.

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:45.495 align:middle line:84%
They can get through
so many things.

00:29:45.495 --> 00:29:47.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, our bodies
are miraculous that way,

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:49.780 align:middle line:84%
if we don't just feed it total
garbage and stress it out

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:50.110 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:51.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Exactly, yes.

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let me ask you the
whole thing about consumption

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:54.180 align:middle line:90%
of sugar.

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:55.910 align:middle line:90%
And you said this earlier.

00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:57.670 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
things that has to go,

00:29:57.670 --> 00:29:59.710 align:middle line:84%
because all these things
feed on it, right?

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:02.252 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: Yeah, I'm not the biggest
fan of the restricted diets.

00:30:02.252 --> 00:30:04.285 align:middle line:84%
That kind of gets people
into these weird--

00:30:04.285 --> 00:30:05.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
especially sugar.

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:06.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yeah.

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You remember,
we were talking about it

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.720 align:middle line:84%
before we came on, the
movie "Elf," the main food

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.730 align:middle line:84%
groups, sugar, maple syrup,
candy canes, and something

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:14.530 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:14.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yeah.

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:15.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I thought, oh, that--

00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:16.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Gingerbread houses.

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:16.750 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, who knows?

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:17.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Gingerbread houses.

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:18.400 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.210 align:middle line:90%


00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:22.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: OK, so I was looking at
a lot of centenarian studies,

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:24.580 align:middle line:84%
and all of them, they had
great high-fiber diets.

00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:26.830 align:middle line:84%
Maybe 30, even 50 grams
of fiber every day

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:33.430 align:middle line:84%
and dirt probiotics from their
gardens and being outdoors

00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:35.350 align:middle line:90%
and just living off the land.

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:37.330 align:middle line:90%
Nothing was cleaned or sterile.

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:38.350 align:middle line:90%
They lived off the land.

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:41.030 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't-- in some places,
no toilets or running water,

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:41.830 align:middle line:90%
even.

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:43.413 align:middle line:84%
So these centenarians
are fascinating.

00:30:43.413 --> 00:30:47.800 align:middle line:84%
To me, they also did have
ceremonies and even festivals

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.792 align:middle line:84%
and had some sugar
and they were fine.

00:30:49.792 --> 00:30:50.750 align:middle line:90%
They were totally fine.

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:52.542 align:middle line:84%
So I think when we're
healthy, when we have

00:30:52.542 --> 00:30:53.770 align:middle line:90%
good bacteria, particularly--

00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:54.870 align:middle line:90%
I like the photobacteria.

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:56.980 align:middle line:84%
So when I formulate probiotics,
I always have a lot in there,

00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.230 align:middle line:84%
and it's the highest strength
in the market, actually,

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:00.520 align:middle line:90%
in our industry.

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.920 align:middle line:84%
Bifidobacteria that are
good, that eat fiber,

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:03.850 align:middle line:90%
they create food.

00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:04.710 align:middle line:90%
They're so generous.

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:05.510 align:middle line:90%
They're so kind.

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:08.170 align:middle line:84%
They create food on
their outside cell wall

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:09.950 align:middle line:84%
to feed other flora
to eat during meals.

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:10.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:11.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yeah.

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And they take--
you know what they?

00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:13.390 align:middle line:90%
Take they take sugar.

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:16.120 align:middle line:84%
They take monosaccharides,
which is sugar,

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:19.000 align:middle line:84%
and disaccharides,
which is sugar.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.333 align:middle line:84%
These food groups that get
clipped off of complex carbs.

00:31:21.333 --> 00:31:22.133 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:22.133 --> 00:31:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: Yeah, even our beans,
lentils, and complex carbs

00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:26.305 align:middle line:90%
in starchy tubers.

00:31:26.305 --> 00:31:27.550 align:middle line:90%
They can break them down.

00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:29.260 align:middle line:84%
Or our enzymes start
working on them

00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:31.060 align:middle line:84%
and then the bacteria
break them down.

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And then they clip off
these little special foods

00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:37.837 align:middle line:84%
and can consolidate them
for the rest of the hive.

00:31:37.837 --> 00:31:40.420 align:middle line:84%
But if we're missing them, then
people will get a fatty liver.

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:42.600 align:middle line:84%
They get liver
fibrosis of the organs.

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:43.600 align:middle line:90%
They get calcifications.

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Because when they're not
around, then now the sugar

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.700 align:middle line:84%
is being used by pathogenic
flora and yeast and Candida,

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:50.500 align:middle line:90%
so--

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:52.208 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're
a big fan of Bifidus?

00:31:52.208 --> 00:31:53.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: I sure am, yes.

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:53.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, that's good.

00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:54.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yes.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:54.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We've got one--

00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: More particularly,
Bifidobacterium longum,

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.580 align:middle line:84%
which is seen in
centenarians at high numbers.

00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:58.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:31:58.060 --> 00:31:59.435 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: That's a
very special one.

00:31:59.435 --> 00:32:02.080 align:middle line:84%
It's in babies and all the way
up through our whole lifespan.

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:03.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Longum, right.

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.702 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: Yeah, and
it's also associated

00:32:04.702 --> 00:32:07.390 align:middle line:84%
with reducing-- helping
calm, increasing

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:09.970 align:middle line:84%
feelings of wellness, and
it's an antidepressant

00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:11.440 align:middle line:90%
in human trials.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.540 align:middle line:84%
Those test like kids in
college or med students,

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:14.470 align:middle line:84%
because they're
all stressed out.

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:14.800 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:15.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:17.755 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: And they give them these
probiotics and it's like, whoa.

00:32:17.755 --> 00:32:20.140 align:middle line:84%
They score much higher
on the Ham Depression

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:22.270 align:middle line:90%
scores and other scores.

00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:23.200 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.655 align:middle line:84%
Cool OK, let's-- we're still
on the subject of sugars,

00:32:26.655 --> 00:32:28.780 align:middle line:84%
so let's go to the other
sugars, the ethanol sugars

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:29.580 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:30.610 align:middle line:90%
Monk fruit and all that.

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:31.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: OK, yeah.

00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:33.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, what's the
deal with those in our body?

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:36.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: So sugar alcohols,
we sense them as sweet

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:37.652 align:middle line:90%
and they're--

00:32:37.652 --> 00:32:39.860 align:middle line:84%
but we don't get too many
calories usually from them,

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:40.930 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:43.313 align:middle line:84%
Like xylitol and all the
sugar alcohols, manitol--

00:32:43.313 --> 00:32:44.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Monk fruit--

00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:44.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: And monk, yes.

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:45.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and red
fruital and so forth.

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:47.474 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: Yes, and--
stevia is an herb,

00:32:47.474 --> 00:32:48.932 align:middle line:84%
so it's not really
a sugar alcohol.

00:32:48.932 --> 00:32:49.732 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:49.732 --> 00:32:52.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: But it comes from an
herb for the sweet flavor.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.675 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How are they for
our guts, the sugar alcohols?

00:32:54.675 --> 00:32:56.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: So for our gut,
sometimes they're prebiotic.

00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.142 align:middle line:84%
They're fiber to
feed certain flora.

00:32:58.142 --> 00:32:58.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I've read that.

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:00.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: Yeah, so
they're a little better

00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:02.005 align:middle line:84%
than the artificial
sweeteners, which are all

00:33:02.005 --> 00:33:03.700 align:middle line:84%
shown to be antimicrobial
and terrible

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:05.140 align:middle line:90%
and raise pathogens in the gut.

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And related, actually, to more
metabolic syndrome, obesity,

00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:09.775 align:middle line:90%
and diabetes, believe it or not.

00:33:09.775 --> 00:33:10.840 align:middle line:90%
All those diet sodas.

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:11.575 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We don't want those.

00:33:11.575 --> 00:33:12.375 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yeah.

00:33:12.375 --> 00:33:13.660 align:middle line:90%
So I believe in balance.

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:15.950 align:middle line:84%
We didn't quite evolve with
the sugar alcohols around.

00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:16.230 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:17.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm, right.

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:19.090 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm
thinking about, is

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:21.093 align:middle line:84%
this is new technology,
relatively speaking.

00:33:21.093 --> 00:33:22.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yeah, new technology.

00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:23.885 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
introduce a lot of it

00:33:23.885 --> 00:33:26.770 align:middle line:84%
into the body at one time, like
do a one-for-one replacement

00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:28.145 align:middle line:84%
if you're going
to make something

00:33:28.145 --> 00:33:30.310 align:middle line:84%
with ethanol sugars
for sugar, our body is

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:33.470 align:middle line:84%
accustomed to old-fashioned
organic cane sugar or honey.

00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:34.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yeah.

00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:36.728 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've wondered about
that, because a lot of people

00:33:36.728 --> 00:33:40.220 align:middle line:84%
actually have somewhat of
an adverse response to it.

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:41.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yeah.

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:43.345 align:middle line:84%
They may have a FODMAP allergy,
but that's because they're--

00:33:43.345 --> 00:33:45.370 align:middle line:84%
when studies drill down, they
have pathogens and yeasts

00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:47.590 align:middle line:84%
in the gut and they're missing
the Bifido longum and other

00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:48.640 align:middle line:90%
consortia, their friends.

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:49.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:49.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yeah.

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:51.617 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if you had
that in place, it might be--

00:33:51.617 --> 00:33:54.010 align:middle line:84%
it's not as difficult or
challenging for the body

00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:55.052 align:middle line:90%
to do the ethanol sugars?

00:33:55.052 --> 00:33:57.177 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: Yeah, we'll see them
recover that tolerance.

00:33:57.177 --> 00:33:58.060 align:middle line:90%
But I'm like you.

00:33:58.060 --> 00:33:59.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm a fan of Weston A. Price.

00:33:59.650 --> 00:34:01.990 align:middle line:84%
He was a big
anthropologist and dentist,

00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:07.000 align:middle line:84%
and he studied different
groups and civilizations

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.080 align:middle line:90%
across the world.

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:13.225 align:middle line:84%
And sugars immediately
cause the palate to change.

00:34:13.225 --> 00:34:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And even their bone structures
got wonky and a lot of cavities

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:18.600 align:middle line:84%
and of course, skeletal
structure problems.

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:19.980 align:middle line:90%
They were having gut dysbiosis.

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:20.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:22.363 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: So when we see
people get healthier and eat

00:34:22.363 --> 00:34:26.310 align:middle line:84%
the right fiber, with or
without sugar alcohols, more

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:27.750 align:middle line:84%
fiber and the right
probiotics, we

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:30.449 align:middle line:84%
see people become like
vampires, "Twilight" vampires.

00:34:30.449 --> 00:34:33.840 align:middle line:84%
Their cheekbones pop out,
great skin, symmetry finally

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:37.290 align:middle line:84%
in their face, and glowing
and healthy and high

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:38.969 align:middle line:90%
fecundity, high fertility.

00:34:38.969 --> 00:34:40.110 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're into.

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:41.610 align:middle line:84%
So sugar alcohols,
sometimes they're

00:34:41.610 --> 00:34:44.201 align:middle line:84%
a good crutch when people
are weaning off of sugar.

00:34:44.201 --> 00:34:45.659 align:middle line:84%
They say it's as
strong as cocaine,

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:48.750 align:middle line:84%
so I'm not into cold
withdrawal for people.

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:50.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm still kind of
a fan for caffeine

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:52.620 align:middle line:84%
unless someone's
adrenals are poopy poopy

00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:54.490 align:middle line:84%
and we can't get
their cortisol fixed.

00:34:54.490 --> 00:34:55.290 align:middle line:90%
We're like, oh, OK.

00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:56.340 align:middle line:90%
Maybe just half a cup.

00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:57.300 align:middle line:90%
We negotiate that.

00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:57.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:57.590 --> 00:34:59.048 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: Yeah, so
the sugar alcohols,

00:34:59.048 --> 00:35:01.480 align:middle line:84%
sometimes they're a
little bridge until they--

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:04.992 align:middle line:84%
when people wean off
and they feel healthy

00:35:04.992 --> 00:35:07.200 align:middle line:84%
and they have lots of fiber,
they don't crave things.

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.532 align:middle line:84%
We hear within two months or
three months, oh, my gosh.

00:35:09.532 --> 00:35:10.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm sitting in the car.

00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:13.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm not depressed anymore, and
I don't crave sugar or alcohol

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:15.780 align:middle line:90%
or drugs or marijuana or--

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:17.370 align:middle line:90%
not that any of these are bad.

00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:19.870 align:middle line:84%
They're good crutches for
self-medication and soothing

00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:20.670 align:middle line:90%
and raise GABA.

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:21.810 align:middle line:90%
But we want to do it naturally.

00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:23.190 align:middle line:90%
Our flora can help us do that.

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:24.695 align:middle line:84%
They make these
neurotransmitters

00:35:24.695 --> 00:35:26.070 align:middle line:84%
for us, actually,
believe or not,

00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:29.270 align:middle line:84%
and they get all stored in
the enteric nervous system.

00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:30.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.520 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to a few other things.

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:34.925 align:middle line:84%
Ancient grains and
purple potatoes.

00:35:34.925 --> 00:35:37.550 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about a few
things that can be really good.

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:37.920 align:middle line:90%
Your body--

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: Yeah, these are
all ancestral foods that

00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:40.680 align:middle line:90%
come from all around the world.

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:42.638 align:middle line:84%
So you might want to look
at your own ethnicity

00:35:42.638 --> 00:35:47.990 align:middle line:84%
and see where your kind had
great diets, ancestral diets.

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And it could be millet
or steel-cut oats.

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And for others, it's like a
wide rainbow color of starches,

00:35:56.330 --> 00:36:00.800 align:middle line:84%
like purple tubers,
purple rice or red rice.

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:03.680 align:middle line:84%
It's great to get whole,
diverse, different colors,

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:05.180 align:middle line:84%
especially if you
know your ancestry

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:07.775 align:middle line:84%
to go back and see what foods
they really ate a lot of,

00:36:07.775 --> 00:36:09.083 align:middle line:90%
or what produce and vegetables.

00:36:09.083 --> 00:36:10.250 align:middle line:90%
And mimic that a little bit.

00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:13.820 align:middle line:84%
You'll find that
those pro-anthocyanins

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:16.430 align:middle line:84%
and antioxidants, they
may jive with your DNA

00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:19.680 align:middle line:84%
at an epigenetic
level that's even

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:22.610 align:middle line:84%
more super epic than
just normal Whole Foods,

00:36:22.610 --> 00:36:24.110 align:middle line:90%
whatever, selections.

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:25.100 align:middle line:90%
I love Whole Foods.

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:26.570 align:middle line:90%
Don't get me wrong.

00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:29.680 align:middle line:84%
But we can kind of dial it in
if you get curious, I think.

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:30.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:31.490 align:middle line:90%
I hear what you're saying.

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:32.865 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the
things you said--

00:36:32.865 --> 00:36:34.920 align:middle line:84%
because the way some
people have done it,

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:37.340 align:middle line:84%
they've been very successful
with the paleo diet, which

00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:40.160 align:middle line:84%
is primarily vegetables
with also fats and proteins.

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:42.240 align:middle line:90%
Animal proteins included.

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:44.500 align:middle line:84%
There are paleo diets that
are vegetarian as well.

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Absolutely.

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:47.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So but paleo
basically cuts down

00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:48.680 align:middle line:90%
on a lot of the carbs.

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And so this is
something you said.

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:52.940 align:middle line:84%
When I was reading, you
said, "The paleo diet

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:54.800 align:middle line:90%
is insufficient, though."

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to ask
what that means.

00:36:56.610 --> 00:36:57.902 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: So although I'm a huge--

00:36:57.902 --> 00:36:59.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm the hugest
fan of paleo diet.

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:01.100 align:middle line:84%
It really helped me
to ramp my health up

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:04.430 align:middle line:84%
after my various health crises
and become a really great

00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:06.050 align:middle line:90%
athlete, a pseudo-athlete.

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:07.220 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:11.360 align:middle line:84%
But for some genetics, I
found that the paleo diet

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:16.700 align:middle line:84%
without grains, sans grains,
a major starch group,

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:18.380 align:middle line:90%
relying only on tubers.

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:22.430 align:middle line:84%
Tubers are OK in paleo
diet, generally speaking.

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:25.860 align:middle line:84%
Certain genetics are actually
adapted to the Agricultural

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:26.660 align:middle line:90%
Age.

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:31.640 align:middle line:84%
So we had genetic evolution,
maybe 10,000, 20,000 years ago

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:34.740 align:middle line:84%
when the agricultural
domestication revolution

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:35.540 align:middle line:90%
occurred.

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And for me, for
instance, I have alleles.

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:39.970 align:middle line:90%
I have APOE2 and E3.

00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:41.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So what's that mean?

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: So these are
alleles that help identify

00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:47.550 align:middle line:84%
how ancient our kind is, or
even you can go with blood types

00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:48.350 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And APOE2 is believed to be
probably agriculture-adapted.

00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:53.150 align:middle line:90%
And I'm Asian, you know.

00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And when I took rice out of
my diet during the paleo diet,

00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:58.160 align:middle line:84%
and I was doing a lot of
exercise, endurance exercise,

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:01.040 align:middle line:84%
in fact, half marathons
and triathlons,

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:03.680 align:middle line:84%
I actually had some of the
worst health in my life.

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:06.920 align:middle line:84%
I just was not
having the carbing

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:09.900 align:middle line:84%
up enough to fuel and create
glycogen for the muscles

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:10.700 align:middle line:90%
that I needed.

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:12.800 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't refill
them to the level.

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:15.830 align:middle line:84%
You need 400 grams
in your muscles

00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:17.900 align:middle line:90%
and then 200 grams elsewhere.

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And I just could not do that
for my races and training.

00:38:22.290 --> 00:38:25.100 align:middle line:84%
So I think for some people, it
may be really a great healing

00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:25.900 align:middle line:90%
diet.

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And then looking at genetics,
if they're more northern and not

00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:30.860 align:middle line:84%
equatorial, they're
probably more

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:33.720 align:middle line:84%
adapted for the true
Paleolithic diet.

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:36.320 align:middle line:84%
But I'm an equatorial
evolutionary product,

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:39.140 align:middle line:84%
and my kind likely ate a lot
of fruits, a lot of carbs,

00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:40.310 align:middle line:90%
less so--

00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:41.780 align:middle line:84%
probably a lot of
protein, but not

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:43.360 align:middle line:84%
to the degree as the
Northerners, Northern Europe

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:43.520 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:45.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're saying
like Northern Europeans,

00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:45.910 align:middle line:90%
for example?

00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:47.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: Yeah, or
Mongolians and-- yeah.

00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:49.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They do really
well on paleo in general?

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:49.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: I seem to see so, yeah.

00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:50.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:52.406 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: But they also do tubers,
and that jives well with them.

00:38:52.406 --> 00:38:52.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:53.645 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yams and sweet potatoes.

00:38:53.645 --> 00:38:53.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, potatoes.

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:54.760 align:middle line:90%
Lots of potatoes.

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:55.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: A lot of potatoes.

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:55.403 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:38:55.403 --> 00:38:56.445 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: And potatoes are--

00:38:56.445 --> 00:38:59.330 align:middle line:84%
when we have plenty of acid
in the gut, hydrochloric acid

00:38:59.330 --> 00:39:01.070 align:middle line:84%
in the gut, we can
achieve more health

00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:03.410 align:middle line:84%
when we achieve a pH of 1
or 2, believe it or not,

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:04.400 align:middle line:90%
in the stomach.

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And this fries all the
pathogens, COVID, pneumonia,

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:08.773 align:middle line:90%
everything, streps, fungi.

00:39:08.773 --> 00:39:10.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you're saying
potato eating does that?

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:13.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: Then when we add
acid to cook potatoes,

00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:15.920 align:middle line:84%
it becomes instantly
a form of fiber.

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:18.945 align:middle line:84%
We get no-- almost very low
amniotic glycemic index.

00:39:18.945 --> 00:39:20.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And like
you say, it's really

00:39:20.570 --> 00:39:23.060 align:middle line:84%
good if we go with the
colored potatoes, ideally.

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:23.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yes.

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:25.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The sweet potatoes,
purple potatoes, and so forth

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:27.050 align:middle line:84%
even better than the
standard white potatoes.

00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:29.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: We're more ancestral,
like smaller Yukon or--

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:29.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:30.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Not necessarily the--

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:32.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that's what we grow.

00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:37.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: The spud-inhibiting,
chemical-covered, big Idaho.

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:38.695 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So wanted
to get to that one,

00:39:38.695 --> 00:39:40.653 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people
would be thinking that.

00:39:40.653 --> 00:39:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I felt my best,
was on a pretty classic paleo

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:44.270 align:middle line:90%
diet.

00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:44.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:46.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: And your ancestry
is Northern European?

00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Northern European.

00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:47.246 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yeah, that makes sense.

00:39:47.246 --> 00:39:47.300 align:middle line:90%
A lot--

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:48.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Scottish,
Irish, English, German.

00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: Yeah, and you're
very light-skinned,

00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:50.750 align:middle line:90%
so you need sunlight.

00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:53.240 align:middle line:84%
But if you OD on it, you
can burn yourself, too,

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:54.200 align:middle line:90%
and create cancerous--

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: Unless you have
the good reserves.

00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:57.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I have olive skin.

00:39:57.690 --> 00:39:57.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Oh, so--

00:39:57.980 --> 00:39:58.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oddly,
no one else does.

00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:00.060 align:middle line:84%
No one knows who had sex
with someone special.

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:01.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: You might be
part Italian and--

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:01.760 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:02.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Don't know.

00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:03.860 align:middle line:84%
It just doesn't
show up genetically,

00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:04.610 align:middle line:90%
but my son and I look like this.

00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:06.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: So you've got the
best of both sides, yes.

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But basically,
our-- yeah, our family's

00:40:07.610 --> 00:40:08.410 align:middle line:90%
Northern European.

00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And they all do well when
they do more of a paleo diet.

00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:12.890 align:middle line:90%
Everyone feels better.

00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:14.780 align:middle line:84%
Brain fog goes
away, lose weight.

00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:17.510 align:middle line:84%
So for that group, and
you say Mongolian as well,

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:19.020 align:middle line:84%
northern climes
around the world.

00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:19.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yes.

00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
that, that may be E4.

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:22.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:24.908 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: And E4 is one of the
smartest carriers of it.

00:40:24.908 --> 00:40:27.200 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, they're also
associated with more type 3

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.620 align:middle line:84%
diabetes, type 2
diabetes, Alzheimer's.

00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:31.690 align:middle line:84%
But that's because
if they overdose

00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:35.943 align:middle line:84%
on sugar and modern carbs,
refined simple carbs, not so

00:40:35.943 --> 00:40:37.360 align:middle line:84%
great for them or
their gut flora.

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:39.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:42.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've gotten
through the detection,

00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:44.380 align:middle line:90%
the tests, the proper tests.

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:44.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Mm-hmm.

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:46.847 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've given us
some wonderful information

00:40:46.847 --> 00:40:50.215 align:middle line:84%
about various types of
supplements that we can take.

00:40:50.215 --> 00:40:52.090 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about the
foods and the problems

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:54.520 align:middle line:84%
in our society that's
turning the flame down

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.350 align:middle line:84%
and is really
allowing overgrowth

00:40:56.350 --> 00:41:00.070 align:middle line:84%
of these not-so-beneficial
bacteria and fungus,

00:41:00.070 --> 00:41:02.060 align:middle line:90%
SIBO, SIFO, and so forth.

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:06.200 align:middle line:84%
Some of the foods that we can
eat, love, touching, oxytocin.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:08.770 align:middle line:90%


00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:12.100 align:middle line:84%
Like you said, a diet
that's right for our type

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:16.180 align:middle line:84%
in terms of geographically,
our historical type.

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:17.260 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what else--

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:19.740 align:middle line:84%
in wrapping this up, tell
us some other final--

00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:22.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: Yeah, there are a couple
of things people should just

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:23.040 align:middle line:90%
start doing now.

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.130 align:middle line:90%
Look at probiotics.

00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:25.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.458 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: I'm a fan of all of,
them and we have Bifido maximus

00:41:27.458 --> 00:41:28.300 align:middle line:90%
on our website.

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:31.053 align:middle line:84%
Second, some people
who are struggling,

00:41:31.053 --> 00:41:33.470 align:middle line:84%
they probably aren't having
as much acid in their stomach.

00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:35.320 align:middle line:84%
So we can mimic that a little
bit, unless they're allergic--

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:36.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Would you do HCG--

00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:37.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Yes, exactly.

00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:38.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --as hydrochloric
acid drops or--

00:41:38.350 --> 00:41:40.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: No, more naturals
are probably OK.

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:42.550 align:middle line:84%
Like lemon juice in
their water with meals.

00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:42.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, that's good.

00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:44.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: Preferably warm
water, because then you're

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:46.080 align:middle line:84%
warming up the belly,
warming up all the enzymes

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:47.530 align:middle line:90%
to be more active.

00:41:47.530 --> 00:41:50.410 align:middle line:84%
Every degree we lose, we're
losing activity, like epic.

00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:52.012 align:middle line:90%
Like 1,500% of our activities.

00:41:52.012 --> 00:41:54.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So just the habit
of having lemon in water.

00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:56.193 align:middle line:84%
>>LIU: Right, or ACV,
apple cider vinegar.

00:41:56.193 --> 00:41:57.610 align:middle line:84%
There is some
histamines in there.

00:41:57.610 --> 00:41:59.277 align:middle line:84%
Some people may be
histamine intolerant,

00:41:59.277 --> 00:42:01.840 align:middle line:84%
so you want to go with maybe
more lemon, if that's OK.

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And then third is walking,
more low exercise.

00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:05.500 align:middle line:90%
Nothing too extreme.

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:07.000 align:middle line:10%
I'm not talking
marathons every day.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.170 align:middle line:10%
But like 10,000.

00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:10.480 align:middle line:10%
If you're trying to lose
weight, 20,000 steps a day.

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:12.713 align:middle line:84%
Maybe evolutionarily,
we're used to that.

00:42:12.713 --> 00:42:13.630 align:middle line:90%
And same with our gut.

00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:17.050 align:middle line:84%
Our gut flora may like that
churning and the heat generated

00:42:17.050 --> 00:42:18.802 align:middle line:84%
and all the fun
that goes with that.

00:42:18.802 --> 00:42:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just the
heat alone seems

00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:21.970 align:middle line:84%
as though it would be
worth it just to get

00:42:21.970 --> 00:42:23.178 align:middle line:90%
the fire stoked a little bit.

00:42:23.178 --> 00:42:24.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Exactly, exactly.

00:42:24.850 --> 00:42:26.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's all
very practical.

00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:27.640 align:middle line:90%
It's all very complex.

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:29.440 align:middle line:90%
It's all highly individual.

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.510 align:middle line:90%
But it can all be done.

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Absolutely.

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:34.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, OK.

00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:37.000 align:middle line:84%
So thank you so much for
taking the time to be with us.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.010 align:middle line:84%
My brain is kind of
on fire, overwhelmed

00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:41.230 align:middle line:90%
with information in a good way.

00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:43.540 align:middle line:84%
You've given us a lot
of tools to work with.

00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:45.100 align:middle line:84%
There's some really
basic principles

00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:46.750 align:middle line:84%
to work with, which
I super appreciate.

00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:48.175 align:middle line:84%
And I know our
audience does, too.

00:42:48.175 --> 00:42:49.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Oh, I'm so grateful.

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:51.130 align:middle line:84%
I love educating and
entertaining a little.

00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:51.550 align:middle line:90%

00:42:51.550 --> 00:42:52.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're wonderful.

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:53.410 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Grace.

00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:55.165 align:middle line:90%
>>LIU: Thank you so much.

00:42:55.165 --> 00:42:57.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again, the
name of Dr. Grace's book

00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:00.460 align:middle line:84%
is "7 steps to Heal SIBO," and
you can also visit her website

00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:02.530 align:middle line:90%
at thegutinstitute.com.

00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:04.480 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:06.250 align:middle line:90%
on "Open Minds."
