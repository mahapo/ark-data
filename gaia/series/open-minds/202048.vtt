00:00:19.697 --> 00:00:21.780 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: We have
Sonia Barrett, producer

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.840 align:middle line:10%
of the documentary "The
Business of Disease," talking

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.020 align:middle line:10%
about the need to maintain
authority over our own body

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.090 align:middle line:10%
and mind, which is
a really big task

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.560 align:middle line:10%
amid the current challenges.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.369 align:middle line:90%
Sonia, welcome.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.244 align:middle line:90%
It's good to see you.

00:00:33.244 --> 00:00:35.400 align:middle line:84%
I haven't interviewed
you for about a decade.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.025 align:middle line:84%
>>SONIA BARRETT: Oh,
it's been a while,

00:00:37.025 --> 00:00:38.520 align:middle line:84%
and I am so
delighted to be here.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.330 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.627 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:00:40.627 --> 00:00:43.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're going to start off
on a little bit of a grim topic,

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.743 align:middle line:84%
if you don't mind,
and the reason

00:00:44.743 --> 00:00:46.410 align:middle line:84%
is because there are
things that are not

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.740 align:middle line:90%
being talked about here.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.300 align:middle line:84%
One of them is alcoholism
and drug use is on the rise,

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.010 align:middle line:84%
suicides are on the rise,
and abuse, particularly

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.030 align:middle line:90%
domestic abuse.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.630 align:middle line:84%
A big uptick in domestic
abuse with people

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.190 align:middle line:84%
being quarantined with one
another in small spaces

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.470 align:middle line:84%
where they maybe didn't
get along to begin with,

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.630 align:middle line:84%
and we all have
our issues, right?

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.790 align:middle line:84%
And I bring this up because
it was really abuse originally

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.910 align:middle line:84%
that kind of spiked you
to an opening in yourself

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.102 align:middle line:84%
and the nature of your
perceptions of life.

00:01:21.102 --> 00:01:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought, because
it's not talked about much,

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.780 align:middle line:84%
let's just start the
conversation there,

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.197 align:middle line:84%
and then we're
going to go further

00:01:26.197 --> 00:01:28.140 align:middle line:90%
into the rest of the phenomena.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Well, you know what?

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.590 align:middle line:10%
That is a big subject.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.130 align:middle line:10%
Well, everything you
mentioned a few minutes ago,

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.510 align:middle line:10%
in terms of suicides
and domestic violence,

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.060 align:middle line:10%
so much that's going
on because people

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.835 align:middle line:10%
are obviously locked in
and trapped and so on.

00:01:44.835 --> 00:01:46.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they're not
really reporting on this.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:47.640 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: No.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not either
side, not any news.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: No.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.708 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
not reporting it.

00:01:50.708 --> 00:01:53.520 align:middle line:84%
You really have to go to
some pretty astute vloggers

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.293 align:middle line:84%
and bloggers to get any
information these days.

00:01:56.293 --> 00:01:57.210 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Absolutely.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think that's going to
be the huge fallout from all

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.568 align:middle line:84%
of this, and I don't
think people realize that.

00:02:01.568 --> 00:02:05.520 align:middle line:84%
But just in terms
of my own self,

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.680 align:middle line:84%
yes, in the very beginning
what pushed me or propelled me

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.480 align:middle line:84%
into wanting to discover more
about the nature of reality

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.020 align:middle line:84%
and life and so on
was my own experience,

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.690 align:middle line:90%
going through domestic violence.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.280 align:middle line:10%
And even then--
it's so interesting

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.670 align:middle line:10%
because I never really used
that word "domestic violence"

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.590 align:middle line:10%
because I never labeled myself.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.560 align:middle line:84%
However, looking back,
yes, it was an experience,

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.200 align:middle line:84%
but I also realized
the intensity

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.310 align:middle line:84%
of that kind of experience,
and people are going

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.750 align:middle line:90%
through that at this time.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:49.590 align:middle line:84%
For me, my situation had gotten
so severe that I ran away.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.080 align:middle line:84%
I ran away with two
children and slept in my car

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.510 align:middle line:90%
for almost two weeks.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I like to say to folks
who are probably experiencing

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.015 align:middle line:90%
some of these things.

00:03:04.015 --> 00:03:06.390 align:middle line:84%
There came a point for me
where I had to make a decision.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.960 align:middle line:90%
I had to make a choice.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't about trying
to figure out, well,

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.250 align:middle line:90%
how am I going to get by?

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.680 align:middle line:90%
That became secondary.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think people have
to start looking at,

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.540 align:middle line:84%
well, you know, my life,
my life is the value here.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And as long as
you are breathing,

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.080 align:middle line:84%
there is going to be
an opportunity to rise.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And so when I left,
of course I didn't

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.860 align:middle line:84%
leave with all of this
great thinking and thought

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:33.660 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.390 align:middle line:84%
I just knew I had to
go, and so we did that.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, just going past
all of that, because I

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.460 align:middle line:84%
won't get into all
the details of it.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.950 align:middle line:84%
But what happened is
there became a point,

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.950 align:middle line:84%
maybe shortly after I managed
to get myself together,

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.730 align:middle line:84%
and I was assisted by a church
because I left and I got

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.060 align:middle line:84%
cut off from money and
walked out on a business.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, it was what you
call a real walking away.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.875 align:middle line:90%
I remember the church that I--

00:04:06.875 --> 00:04:08.032 align:middle line:90%
I slept in a parking lot.

00:04:08.032 --> 00:04:09.240 align:middle line:90%
We slept in the parking lot--

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of the church?

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.490 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: No, it
wasn't the church,

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.060 align:middle line:84%
it was a supermarket
shopping center.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.779 align:middle line:84%
And the church that happened
to be across from it,

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:24.990 align:middle line:84%
eventually I would go there and
they would give me groceries,

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.760 align:middle line:84%
and I would clean the church for
15 bucks to get gas and so on.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.800 align:middle line:84%
So I'm bringing up
these things because I

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.090 align:middle line:84%
think it's important that people
realize that everybody doesn't

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.398 align:middle line:90%
really start out--

00:04:40.398 --> 00:04:41.940 align:middle line:84%
OK, they're an author
now and they're

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.260 align:middle line:90%
doing all these things--

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.020 align:middle line:84%
that everybody doesn't
just jump into it.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.240 align:middle line:84%
There are things that
happen in our lives that

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.380 align:middle line:84%
become the propulsion
for that kind of change.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it
was an opportunity

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.870 align:middle line:90%
to start to question.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.440 align:middle line:84%
So during that whole process,
once I got a bit more settled

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.870 align:middle line:84%
and we had some place
to stay, I thought,

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.850 align:middle line:84%
what on Earth was that, that
14 years of living that,

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.020 align:middle line:90%
and my own fear of leaving?

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: And that's very real.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.370 align:middle line:84%
People would say, well,
why do people stay

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.840 align:middle line:90%
when you're going through that?

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.940 align:middle line:90%
Why do you stay?

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.200 align:middle line:10%
Well, you have to understand
that your condition, when

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.440 align:middle line:10%
somebody says, I will
find you no matter what,

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.070 align:middle line:10%
and perhaps you have no
family, which, at the time

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.150 align:middle line:10%
I didn't have anybody.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.790 align:middle line:90%
My parents are deceased.

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:35.660 align:middle line:90%
Somebody says that.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.080 align:middle line:84%
You are thinking, if
I leave, if I run--

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.220 align:middle line:90%
those words are echoing--

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.260 align:middle line:84%
if I run, they're
going to find me.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.910 align:middle line:90%
He's going to find me.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're
already in a traumatized,

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:49.310 align:middle line:84%
extraordinarily vulnerable,
which means, very open state

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.140 align:middle line:84%
when you're receiving
these messages.

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: Absolutely,
absolutely.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And you have to keep two
other little people safe,

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.620 align:middle line:84%
so you eventually
get the courage

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.270 align:middle line:90%
and you say that one day--

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:06.320 align:middle line:84%
I remember I used to then pray
and I'd go, just show me a way.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.580 align:middle line:90%
Make something happen.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.430 align:middle line:84%
Two weeks before I
actually had said that,

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.510 align:middle line:90%
make something happen--

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:12.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What happened?

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: --to force
me to have to leave.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:16.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: And let me put
this disclaimer in right now.

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.090 align:middle line:84%
The person that I
was married to then,

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.000 align:middle line:84%
the father of my children, he
has gone through his change.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.050 align:middle line:90%
I want to say that.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.050 align:middle line:90%
He has gone through his changes.

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This was
when he was unhealed.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:30.577 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Absolutely.

00:06:30.577 --> 00:06:32.300 align:middle line:90%
So I want to say that.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.020 align:middle line:10%
But one day, when
there was something

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.020 align:middle line:10%
that he wanted me to do and
I didn't leave to do it,

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.290 align:middle line:10%
and then there was threats,
and there was 300 pound

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:44.690 align:middle line:10%
weights next to me
and somebody was

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.220 align:middle line:10%
threatening to drop them on
you, you know, it's time to go.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: So that day
he sent me to the store.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.370 align:middle line:84%
He said, you need to
go get whatever it is,

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.320 align:middle line:84%
and the kids were
outside playing.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.700 align:middle line:84%
That one day they just
happened to be there.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:00.950 align:middle line:90%
They were outside playing.

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.640 align:middle line:84%
I always parked the
car in the garage.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.930 align:middle line:84%
That day, something made
me park it on the street.

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:13.700 align:middle line:84%
And I walked out to the
kids and I said, let's go.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:14.660 align:middle line:90%
We are leaving now.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:15.800 align:middle line:90%
We are not coming back.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.230 align:middle line:90%
And we ran to that car.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And it felt like an
eternity, those few seconds

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.710 align:middle line:90%
of running to get in that car.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.960 align:middle line:90%
And that's how we left.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.110 align:middle line:90%
We just, we ran.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And there were so
many other things

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.605 align:middle line:84%
that was surrounding
that moment,

00:07:34.605 --> 00:07:36.230 align:middle line:84%
getting certain things
out of the house

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.660 align:middle line:90%
and finding somewhere to stay.

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:42.950 align:middle line:84%
Not contacting anybody, not
getting anybody involved.

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:47.510 align:middle line:84%
Driving 30 miles away to sleep
in a different little town

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:48.410 align:middle line:90%
in a parking lot.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And the happiest moment ever is
sleeping in that parking lot.

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:52.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.900 align:middle line:10%
>>BARRETT: So all of that, all
of that, you take all of that

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.820 align:middle line:10%
and you put it all together,
and that moment where

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:03.050 align:middle line:10%
you can honestly now sit
and go, what was that,

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.390 align:middle line:10%
that 14 years in this situation?

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's where my
launching pad began because I

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.140 align:middle line:90%
needed to understand life.

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.570 align:middle line:84%
I thought, what is this
thing we call life?

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I
started to branch off.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:17.750 align:middle line:84%
So people who are in those
situations at this time,

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.360 align:middle line:84%
I think it's important for
us to realize that there

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.160 align:middle line:90%
is an opportunity here.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.980 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of how
crazy things are,

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.590 align:middle line:84%
there is an incredible
opportunity here

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:32.630 align:middle line:84%
for us to examine
where we are right now

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:37.820 align:middle line:84%
and to make some decisions and
say, OK, this has to change.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.360 align:middle line:90%
This moment has to change.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.360 align:middle line:90%
I cannot continue to live this.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.799 align:middle line:90%
And there's always a way.

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:43.599 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:43.599 --> 00:08:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And what you're talking
about is very extreme.

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot of people
going through this same, very

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.470 align:middle line:84%
extreme circumstance
that you experienced,

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:52.770 align:middle line:90%
right now, all over the planet.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:53.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Mm-hmm.

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:55.237 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is not
location-specific.

00:08:55.237 --> 00:08:58.040 align:middle line:84%
It's people being thrust
into each other's lives

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.953 align:middle line:84%
in too close a way with
bad dynamics for too long.

00:09:00.953 --> 00:09:02.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: And it's anybody.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.245 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it's anybody.

00:09:03.245 --> 00:09:05.990 align:middle line:84%
It's surprising
the kind of people.

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:07.490 align:middle line:90%
So this crosses all boundaries.

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:09.875 align:middle line:84%
It's people's dysfunction,
and at this time,

00:09:09.875 --> 00:09:11.750 align:middle line:84%
it appears to be a
period of mirrors.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:14.430 align:middle line:84%
We all get to see ourselves
like we've never seen ourselves

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:15.230 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And some of the decisions
are more subtle, like,

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:21.563 align:middle line:84%
why do I want to go
back to that job I hate?

00:09:21.563 --> 00:09:22.480 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Absolutely.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I hate it.

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:24.860 align:middle line:84%
Where you're being
abusive to yourself

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:27.830 align:middle line:84%
by showing up for something
you hate every day

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:29.160 align:middle line:90%
to put food on the table.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.050 align:middle line:90%
Let's riff on that for a moment.

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:32.948 align:middle line:84%
This is many, many
levels of ourselves

00:09:32.948 --> 00:09:33.990 align:middle line:90%
being shown to ourselves.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Absolutely.

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:36.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's so
many different layers

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:39.080 align:middle line:90%
to this moment in time.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.900 align:middle line:84%
So this moment in
time is an opportunity

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.660 align:middle line:84%
for people to
upgrade themselves.

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:45.710 align:middle line:90%
And you're right.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:48.680 align:middle line:84%
People are struggling with
jobs they didn't like.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:53.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, they're not working them,
but the stress that many people

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.700 align:middle line:84%
experience going
into the same job,

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.690 align:middle line:84%
it's a different kind of
abuse, but it is abuse.

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:00.120 align:middle line:90%
Abuse Is abuse, to self--

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:00.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you may
have agreed to it,

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:05.870 align:middle line:84%
but nonetheless, it's an
abusive way to treat your life.

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:06.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Absolutely.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:07.670 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And so I think there's
that honesty factor where

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.160 align:middle line:84%
we have to stop and
say, OK, am I happy,

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.080 align:middle line:84%
whether it be with
the job, whether it

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:20.960 align:middle line:84%
be in the relationship, whether
it be with people that you're

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:25.100 align:middle line:90%
constantly complying with.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.460 align:middle line:84%
You're struggling
with-- what is it?

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.350 align:middle line:84%
What's the word
that we always use?

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:32.150 align:middle line:90%
Expectations.

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Living up to other
people's expectations.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.050 align:middle line:84%
So there's a tremendous
amount of stress,

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:40.530 align:middle line:84%
and that stress interrupts
the immune system.

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:43.320 align:middle line:84%
So everything that we've
talked about at this point,

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.250 align:middle line:84%
I think people really need
to understand the connection

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:51.680 align:middle line:84%
that all of these things have
to the very core foundation

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.880 align:middle line:90%
of health for the body.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.680 align:middle line:84%
So it means that
life isn't really

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.650 align:middle line:84%
about just trying to
run away or escape

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:03.052 align:middle line:84%
from a particular
thing, which is what

00:11:03.052 --> 00:11:04.260 align:middle line:90%
we're dealing with right now.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.290 align:middle line:90%
It's not about escaping.

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:08.060 align:middle line:90%
It's not about the fear.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:12.140 align:middle line:10%
It is about that moment
in truthfulness with self.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.510 align:middle line:10%
How am I caring for myself?

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:18.290 align:middle line:10%
And everything you said about
the job, the mental state.

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:19.090 align:middle line:90%
It's all that.

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
family dynamics.

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:24.950 align:middle line:84%
One thing that is talked
about some but not enough

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:26.823 align:middle line:84%
is what this is
doing to children.

00:11:26.823 --> 00:11:27.740 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Oh my gosh.

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:28.250 align:middle line:90%
There's tremendous--

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:30.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because now
they're exposed to this.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.150 align:middle line:84%
They're exposed to
the dysfunction.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:35.030 align:middle line:84%
So the spillover, if it's
not directly related to them,

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:36.780 align:middle line:84%
it's certainly
spilling over on them.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:37.580 align:middle line:90%
They're cloistered.

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:39.950 align:middle line:84%
They can't go out
and just run and play

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:42.200 align:middle line:84%
unless it's in their own
backyard, and a lot of people

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.000 align:middle line:90%
don't have backyards.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.430 align:middle line:84%
So what is this doing to their
emotional, mental, and physical

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:48.230 align:middle line:90%
health?

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:51.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've seen,
in some cases,

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:52.820 align:middle line:90%
where families are chubbing up.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.190 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is just
pounding down the carbs

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:57.518 align:middle line:84%
in order to feel a little
serotonin flowing through.

00:11:57.518 --> 00:11:59.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: It's the
rippling effects.

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:00.620 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're talking about.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's necessary,
as you just said,

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:06.530 align:middle line:84%
that these things are discussed
because they are completely

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:09.020 align:middle line:90%
left out of the media.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:10.790 align:middle line:90%
And this is the fallout.

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:12.740 align:middle line:10%
This is what we're
talking about.

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:17.060 align:middle line:10%
This is the fallout
from this one situation

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:21.110 align:middle line:10%
that is centered on
a particular fear.

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:22.880 align:middle line:10%
And we must
understand that, yes,

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.010 align:middle line:10%
there are children
who were already

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:28.350 align:middle line:10%
in homes that were
abusive, whether it

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:31.580 align:middle line:10%
be the parents are abusive
or abusive to the child.

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.350 align:middle line:10%
Now, they're stuck there.

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:38.210 align:middle line:10%
Now, everybody in the house is
going through major conflict.

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:41.270 align:middle line:10%
Children not being
able to, as you said,

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:44.000 align:middle line:10%
play and have normality.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.828 align:middle line:10%
It affects the actual
growth even of the body.

00:12:47.828 --> 00:12:49.370 align:middle line:10%
And I think people
need to understand

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:51.620 align:middle line:10%
how, all of these things
that we're talking about that

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:56.630 align:middle line:10%
seem to be more about the
emotional aspect, greatly

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:59.600 align:middle line:10%
impacts the actual
physical body, what

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.850 align:middle line:10%
happens with the
physical body, because it

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:06.170 align:middle line:10%
is a chemical factory,
and it is producing

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:10.130 align:middle line:10%
all kinds of chemicals,
all kinds of hormones,

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:14.150 align:middle line:10%
based on our feelings,
what we're going through.

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:16.020 align:middle line:90%
Based on all of these things.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:20.475 align:middle line:84%
And these things are actually,
it's like a fermentation,

00:13:20.475 --> 00:13:21.350 align:middle line:90%
like it's fermenting.

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:22.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:23.320 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Yeah.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And creating this upstir
in the body's ill health.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:29.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And this is a real
passion of yours,

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:33.590 align:middle line:84%
which is to find balance
through healthy living

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:35.600 align:middle line:84%
and our own authority
over our own bodies.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And in your documentary you have
this one quote that I really

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:43.220 align:middle line:84%
loved, I think
because of its source.

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:48.380 align:middle line:84%
It says, "unless we put medical
freedom into the Constitution,

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:50.270 align:middle line:84%
the time will come
when medicine will

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:54.020 align:middle line:84%
organize into an
undercover dictatorship."

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:57.650 align:middle line:84%
This was by Dr. Rush, a
signer of the Declaration

00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:59.120 align:middle line:90%
of Independence.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:03.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of what you're
doing is talking about,

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:06.080 align:middle line:84%
like Dr. Rush did,
there has to be

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.660 align:middle line:84%
some protection where we
can maintain authority

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:09.730 align:middle line:90%
over our own bodies.

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you to
riff on this for a bit

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:14.022 align:middle line:84%
because people are being talked
into all kinds of crazy stuff

00:14:14.022 --> 00:14:15.350 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: Well, I'm
going to say this.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.520 align:middle line:10%
I think one of the
things that we sort of

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:25.040 align:middle line:10%
talked about prior
to this was research,

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:29.480 align:middle line:10%
that this is all part of you
taking back responsibility

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:33.260 align:middle line:10%
for your own self and being
able to navigate around this.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.690 align:middle line:10%
Sure, it seems like
there is difficulty

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:39.740 align:middle line:10%
in navigating around many of
the rules and the mandates

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:40.710 align:middle line:10%
and so on.

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:42.960 align:middle line:10%
But I think that, more
than anything else,

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:50.280 align:middle line:10%
if we can do research on maybe
where to shop, what to buy,

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:56.270 align:middle line:10%
how to manage our
lives, our bodies, what

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:58.610 align:middle line:10%
are the things that
are available to you,

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:00.380 align:middle line:10%
that are accessible to you.

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:04.700 align:middle line:84%
To be able to navigate
around many of these things,

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:10.310 align:middle line:84%
so we have to find ways that
is not necessarily just based

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:12.767 align:middle line:90%
on adhering to the system.

00:15:12.767 --> 00:15:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
I'm not telling people

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.960 align:middle line:84%
to not adhere to the system,
but you have to understand.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.390 align:middle line:84%
The system it's
made up of people.

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:26.030 align:middle line:84%
These are other human beings,
and they are coming up

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:30.440 align:middle line:84%
with rules and regulations
not really based

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.840 align:middle line:84%
on understanding
each person's life.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.430 align:middle line:90%
It's not about that.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:42.440 align:middle line:84%
It's this one size fits all
and doing what they feel

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:46.230 align:middle line:84%
is necessary for
the good of all.

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:48.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that if
it's for the good of all

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:50.840 align:middle line:84%
or if it's for the good of
a particular group of people

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:51.930 align:middle line:90%
and a particular agenda.

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:52.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:54.350 align:middle line:90%
And this is the thing.

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:56.270 align:middle line:84%
One thing I have
stated, and this

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:59.080 align:middle line:84%
gets into a lot of
other information,

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:04.280 align:middle line:84%
but I want to bring this up
just to lay a foundation.

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:06.470 align:middle line:84%
I did an interview
recently, a couple of them,

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:07.770 align:middle line:90%
with a man named Carl Calleman.

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:09.650 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with
the Mayan calendar.

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:11.690 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with
waves of consciousness

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:13.910 align:middle line:90%
that civilization goes through.

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that
he talked about--

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.380 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just going to drill
down to this tiny piece--

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:22.760 align:middle line:84%
is that when we're in a
time of this particular sine

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.220 align:middle line:84%
wave of consciousness,
one of the things that

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:28.160 align:middle line:84%
becomes prevalent is
the notion to mistrust.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.880 align:middle line:84%
We begin mistrusting each
other, mistrusting institutions,

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:35.570 align:middle line:84%
depending on the age,
or in politics, church,

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:38.750 align:middle line:84%
whatever the day was,
we begin mistrusting.

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And through this
mistrust, we begin

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:44.030 align:middle line:84%
to develop conspiracy,
conspiratorial thought.

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And in doing so, this
can often, if it becomes

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:51.590 align:middle line:84%
the way of thinking en mass, it
can bring about and precipitate

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:52.790 align:middle line:90%
the end of civilizations.

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:57.290 align:middle line:84%
Literally, the end of a
civilization through a takeover

00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:59.690 align:middle line:90%
of conspiratorial thinking.

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:02.510 align:middle line:84%
This is what's so tricky
about these times.

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:05.900 align:middle line:84%
We're not being
properly informed

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.480 align:middle line:84%
because there seem to be,
no matter what you read

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.690 align:middle line:84%
for the most part in mainstream,
vested interests, vested

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:14.220 align:middle line:84%
positions in most
of the articles,

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:17.390 align:middle line:84%
so you can't get the truth of
what's really going on here.

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, you
don't want to become paranoid

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.750 align:middle line:84%
where you start then
thinking you're in the know

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:26.510 align:middle line:84%
and then latching onto the
latest conspiracy theory

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:28.760 align:middle line:84%
and saying, it's those
guys that are doing it,

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:31.700 align:middle line:84%
because it's a way more
complex story than that.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Absolutely.

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:36.450 align:middle line:84%
This is layers deep, and
it is very, very touchy

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:39.380 align:middle line:84%
because there's so many things
that, yes, we could talk about,

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:42.310 align:middle line:84%
and there's so many things
that we can't talk about

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:43.430 align:middle line:90%
on any platform.

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:44.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:45.980 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: But absolutely.

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:48.290 align:middle line:84%
We can say there's
different levels

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:50.240 align:middle line:90%
of the idea then of conspiracy.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.778 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm not even big
on that word anymore.

00:17:52.778 --> 00:17:53.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm not either.

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:54.910 align:middle line:90%
It's misused.

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:55.710 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Right.

00:17:55.710 --> 00:18:00.320 align:middle line:84%
It conjures up untruths
and all kinds of things.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.080 align:middle line:10%
But I think history,
even though history--

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:06.500 align:middle line:10%
yes, history has
been sort of reshaped

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.620 align:middle line:10%
to fit certain kinds of models--

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:14.680 align:middle line:10%
we can still see that
throughout history, politics

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:17.560 align:middle line:10%
and certain behaviors
of folks who

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:22.600 align:middle line:10%
have led countries and
people, there's always

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.360 align:middle line:10%
been a level of deception.

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:30.790 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not by all, but because
of human nature and human greed,

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:33.940 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to power and
when it comes to control,

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:39.400 align:middle line:84%
so we have to take this back
to some core human behavior.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:42.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's the point
that I keep trying

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:45.130 align:middle line:84%
to get at in my
interviews in my own work

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:49.420 align:middle line:84%
is, where do we find what
is true on an innate level

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.970 align:middle line:90%
and unshakably true, right?

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
we've wandered far

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:56.590 align:middle line:84%
from by listening to
all these other stories

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:58.480 align:middle line:90%
and having it create fear.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:01.600 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a note here because
this is really important to what

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:02.980 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about.

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:04.900 align:middle line:84%
When we end up in a
situation like that,

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:07.360 align:middle line:84%
where we think our own
survival is at stake,

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:12.323 align:middle line:84%
we then become vulnerable to
anyone who promises to save us.

00:19:12.323 --> 00:19:13.240 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Absolutely.

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.282 align:middle line:90%
We have a Savior program.

00:19:14.282 --> 00:19:17.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is not
a good place to be in.

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:20.530 align:middle line:84%
This whole notion, you and I are
exactly on the same page about,

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:22.820 align:middle line:84%
maintaining one's
own inner authority.

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:25.733 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the ways in
which we see this happening.

00:19:25.733 --> 00:19:26.650 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Absolutely.

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:29.710 align:middle line:84%
But I think I'd just like to
touch on what you just said.

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:33.160 align:middle line:84%
I think it's really important
that we understand the Savior

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:34.600 align:middle line:90%
program that we have.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.670 align:middle line:84%
It goes way, way way,
way, way, way back.

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:38.995 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very deep.

00:19:38.995 --> 00:19:40.870 align:middle line:84%
We are always looking
for someone to save us.

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:44.710 align:middle line:10%
Now, we have to also
understand that many systems,

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:50.300 align:middle line:10%
throughout the times that we
know of then on the planet,

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:53.650 align:middle line:10%
there's always been
conditions that

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:56.500 align:middle line:10%
make us believe that
somebody is coming to save us

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:57.940 align:middle line:10%
and will save us.

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:00.850 align:middle line:90%
So that's embedded in us.

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:04.180 align:middle line:84%
On top of the fact
that, as human beings,

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:07.750 align:middle line:84%
our core nature is
about surviving.

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:09.425 align:middle line:90%
We are designed to survive.

00:20:09.425 --> 00:20:10.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:12.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: And
because of that, we

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:14.980 align:middle line:84%
are looking to
anything that will

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:18.640 align:middle line:84%
anchor some sort of
survival, and so we then

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:19.550 align:middle line:90%
become vulnerable.

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:22.000 align:middle line:84%
So this is how people
begin to become vulnerable

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.380 align:middle line:84%
because we have to look
at survival from what?

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:26.980 align:middle line:84%
What is the core
thing that we fear?

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:28.060 align:middle line:90%
Death.

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:31.390 align:middle line:90%
Human beings fear non-existence.

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's really
important that we nail that

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:38.798 align:middle line:84%
and we see that at the root of
most fears, particularly now--

00:20:38.798 --> 00:20:40.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is being annihilated.

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:41.507 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: --is
being annihilated.

00:20:41.507 --> 00:20:43.190 align:middle line:90%
It's not existing.

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And so when you see that,
when you look at that,

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:48.790 align:middle line:84%
you realize why
it's always been so

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:56.740 align:middle line:84%
easy to take advantage of
people in their vulnerability.

00:20:56.740 --> 00:21:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And health is certainly an arena
that is a most vulnerable spot.

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:04.030 align:middle line:90%
Because without health, what?

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:05.260 align:middle line:90%
You fall apart.

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:07.120 align:middle line:84%
So there's all these
different layers,

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.540 align:middle line:84%
so it's not simply just
having to say, you know, well,

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:11.950 align:middle line:90%
it's conspiracy theories.

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:14.260 align:middle line:84%
If a person decides
that they are

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:17.950 align:middle line:84%
going to truly take a
deep, honest look at just

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:21.250 align:middle line:84%
the core makeup of a human
being and begin from there,

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:26.740 align:middle line:84%
I think you can begin to
better trace where we are

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:29.740 align:middle line:84%
and what could be possibly
true and what's not.

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:32.590 align:middle line:84%
The challenge that human
beings have right now is

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:35.140 align:middle line:84%
there's so many different
stories being thrown out.

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And not just now, but
throughout all different times.

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.750 align:middle line:84%
And because we're not
anchored, many times

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:45.040 align:middle line:84%
we're not anchored in a
foundation for ourselves.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.990 align:middle line:90%
We're not anchored in ourselves.

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:50.780 align:middle line:84%
We tend to navigate
to every next thing.

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And so an ability
to really assess,

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:58.180 align:middle line:84%
to add up what makes sense,
sometimes doesn't happen,

00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:00.320 align:middle line:90%
so we jump on to the next thing.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.080 align:middle line:84%
So I think we need to go
back to that core state

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:09.460 align:middle line:84%
in order to evaluate what is
being said, does it make sense?

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:10.810 align:middle line:90%
Put two and two together.

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:13.462 align:middle line:84%
I think it can be
really simple if fear

00:22:13.462 --> 00:22:14.670 align:middle line:90%
is removed from the equation.

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:16.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you have
to also have ownership.

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:17.230 align:middle line:84%
You have to take
self-responsibility.

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:18.188 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: You have to.

00:22:18.188 --> 00:22:19.647 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we
have been offering

00:22:19.647 --> 00:22:22.300 align:middle line:84%
that on others for a long time,
especially our physical health.

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:23.217 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Absolutely.

00:22:23.217 --> 00:22:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So just to kind
of back up a bit, again,

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:28.060 align:middle line:84%
kind of going a little esoteric,
backing up quite a bit.

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:30.580 align:middle line:10%
So you're talking about a
mindset around this planet

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:32.860 align:middle line:10%
where through
various religions--

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:36.040 align:middle line:10%
and we'll save the relatively
modern age, say the last 10,000

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.120 align:middle line:10%
years or so--

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:39.790 align:middle line:10%
have inspired us to give
our power over to something

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:42.670 align:middle line:10%
else, something else to save
us because we're unworthy,

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:44.230 align:middle line:10%
we're not enough.

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:47.170 align:middle line:84%
This has been
inculcated into our DNA

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:48.583 align:middle line:90%
now for thousands of years.

00:22:48.583 --> 00:22:49.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: It's coded in us.

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:51.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where you've
been incarnating,

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:53.450 align:middle line:84%
and where your
ancestors are from.

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:57.280 align:middle line:84%
It's encoded into us to give
our power away to the gods.

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.252 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Absolutely.

00:22:58.252 --> 00:22:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And these
are gods that I

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:03.353 align:middle line:84%
would say we're self-appointed,
so to speak, to begin with,

00:23:03.353 --> 00:23:04.270 align:middle line:90%
to influence humanity.

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:05.000 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Mm-hmm.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we
have a corruption

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:08.170 align:middle line:84%
in the program right there
of giving one's power away,

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:09.070 align:middle line:90%
period.

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:12.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, and because of
that, because this

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:16.260 align:middle line:84%
is so inculcated into us on
literally almost, I think,

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:19.170 align:middle line:84%
a cellular level, and
then you have the body

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:21.540 align:middle line:90%
striving for its own survival.

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:24.720 align:middle line:84%
Even if you go so far as
to say, well, you know,

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.490 align:middle line:90%
I've died many times before.

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:27.930 align:middle line:90%
If I die, it's just another.

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:28.780 align:middle line:90%
I'll be back.

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:32.355 align:middle line:84%
Reincarnation, right, which
I'm a firm believer in.

00:23:32.355 --> 00:23:33.690 align:middle line:90%
But that's all true.

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:36.930 align:middle line:84%
The body and the being
are still doing everything

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:40.950 align:middle line:84%
they can to survive because
it goes beyond any concepts

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:41.890 align:middle line:90%
and beliefs.

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:45.790 align:middle line:84%
This is something that owns
you on a cellular level, right?

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:46.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Mm-hmm.

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:50.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's somewhere
in that matrix of, it's OK.

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:51.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm OK with letting
go of this body.

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.860 align:middle line:90%
I'll be back.

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:55.140 align:middle line:84%
To oh my god, this
is all I have.

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:57.960 align:middle line:84%
It's one shot and I'm
going to turn to dirt.

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:00.420 align:middle line:84%
We're all living somewhere in
there on this fear spectrum,

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:01.220 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:01.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Right.

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:02.670 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:03.470 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And you said some
things there that I

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:08.740 align:middle line:84%
think we should look at is
the self-responsibility part.

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:09.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: Because it heavily
ties in with the survival

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:14.810 align:middle line:90%
program and the Savior program.

00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:15.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:18.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: That Savior
program has, to some degree,

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:24.810 align:middle line:84%
sort of disconnected that desire
to be responsible for self

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:29.430 align:middle line:84%
because someone else throughout
the ages continue to say,

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:33.900 align:middle line:84%
you are not capable of being
responsible for yourself.

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
we're seeing now,

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:37.320 align:middle line:90%
but it's the same old model.

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.220 align:middle line:90%
It's not a new model.

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:40.590 align:middle line:84%
It's the same old
model, different face.

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:45.540 align:middle line:84%
So a human being's
ability, or even

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:49.440 align:middle line:84%
being able to feel that they
have a responsibility to self,

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:52.380 align:middle line:84%
or that they're
capable, is so removed.

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:54.750 align:middle line:10%
It's removed and replaced
with-- and again, I'm

00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:56.430 align:middle line:10%
not knocking
religion-- but we're

00:24:56.430 --> 00:25:00.810 align:middle line:10%
looking at these models that
is the go-between, so we have

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:03.540 align:middle line:10%
a lot of go-betweens, whether
it be the doctor that's

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:07.620 align:middle line:10%
the go-between or the government
that's the go-between.

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:10.710 align:middle line:84%
We need to look at the
models in place that

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:15.870 align:middle line:84%
continue to support this
idea that we are not

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:18.850 align:middle line:84%
capable of knowing
what's good for us.

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:20.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And to your
point, which you bring up,

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:24.690 align:middle line:84%
and it's brought up in your
documentary, that in America,

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:27.900 align:middle line:84%
in particular, I don't know
how it is in other countries

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:30.030 align:middle line:84%
because this is
where I'm steeped,

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:32.607 align:middle line:84%
but disease becomes
part of our identity.

00:25:32.607 --> 00:25:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Oh, absolutely.

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:38.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have this disease,
restless leg syndrome or cancer

00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:40.470 align:middle line:90%
or I'm OCD.

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:42.330 align:middle line:84%
You know, people
identify themselves

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:45.690 align:middle line:84%
by what they have been
told their diseases are.

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:48.780 align:middle line:84%
That, to me, is
almost corruption

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:52.200 align:middle line:84%
at the highest level
perpetuated by the institutions,

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.600 align:middle line:84%
but for us, inside
ourselves, that we

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:57.300 align:middle line:84%
would allow
ourselves to identify

00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:59.130 align:middle line:90%
with our own life in such a way.

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:00.210 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Absolutely.

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:02.610 align:middle line:84%
Because I think the other
thing that we need to look at

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:05.550 align:middle line:84%
is our lives are
filled with stories.

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:07.780 align:middle line:90%
Each of our lives, right?

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:13.287 align:middle line:84%
Your 24 hours, excluding the
time that you're sleeping,

00:26:13.287 --> 00:26:14.745 align:middle line:84%
is nothing but a
series of stories.

00:26:14.745 --> 00:26:15.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:16.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: This
entire experience

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:19.000 align:middle line:84%
is nothing but a
series of stories,

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.410 align:middle line:84%
so I think we have to really
begin there to look at,

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:26.080 align:middle line:84%
what is the story that is
being spun at this time?

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:29.580 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of identity and
identifying with a disease

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:33.030 align:middle line:84%
or identifying
whatever it is is a way

00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:35.970 align:middle line:90%
to fill up those waking moments.

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And I found that fascinating
when I started to look at that.

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:40.470 align:middle line:90%
I thought, whoa.

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:42.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It almost
seems like it's being,

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:46.667 align:middle line:84%
but it's being foisted upon
society from a program.

00:26:46.667 --> 00:26:49.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: It is, but then
there's a series of programs.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:49.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And we take it up.

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:50.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Absolutely.

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:54.930 align:middle line:84%
That's because we're operating
on a foundation of lots

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:58.800 align:middle line:84%
of programs, old programs,
outdated programs, programs

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:03.300 align:middle line:84%
that are sort of
ignited and supported

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:05.790 align:middle line:84%
by the systems in
place, generally,

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:08.860 align:middle line:84%
through some sort of
marketing at this time.

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:11.353 align:middle line:90%
So this is such a huge picture.

00:27:11.353 --> 00:27:13.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want to throw this in
real quickly because I think,

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:16.350 align:middle line:84%
to me, this is important
to the conversation.

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:18.510 align:middle line:84%
I like to remind people
that the only thing you

00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:22.950 align:middle line:84%
know about the world is what's
happening in this moment.

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:24.390 align:middle line:84%
Everything else
is brought to you

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:28.080 align:middle line:84%
by videos and pictures and
films and somebody else's

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:28.920 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.590 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea what Japan
is unless I'm there.

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:37.320 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea what is happening
outside of this conversation,

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:40.770 align:middle line:84%
outside of this building, until
I'm out there interacting.

00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:42.720 align:middle line:90%
And this is how reality is.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.500 align:middle line:84%
It's all based on what is
going on in this moment.

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:48.570 align:middle line:90%
This is the only thing you know.

00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:51.360 align:middle line:84%
Everything else is
pictures and images

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:55.043 align:middle line:84%
and someone telling you what the
rest of the world looks like.

00:27:55.043 --> 00:27:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
real important.

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:58.283 align:middle line:84%
And somebody will
go, well, how do

00:27:58.283 --> 00:27:59.700 align:middle line:84%
you know that
there's things going

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.560 align:middle line:90%
on in the rest of the world?

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:02.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:03.330 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: You're told.

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:05.370 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's the logic of it.

00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:07.200 align:middle line:84%
We're told these
things, so we have

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:10.523 align:middle line:84%
concepts about what these
different places are

00:28:10.523 --> 00:28:12.940 align:middle line:84%
supposed to look like, because
that's how the brain works.

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:14.850 align:middle line:84%
The brain looks for
patterns, right?

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:18.090 align:middle line:10%
We've been thrown enough
patterns about reality,

00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:21.420 align:middle line:10%
day in day out, passed on
now through our genetics,

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:24.810 align:middle line:10%
through the collective,
through our families.

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:26.170 align:middle line:90%
We just don't get that.

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:28.820 align:middle line:84%
It's like a computer programmed
with a lot of information

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:29.620 align:middle line:90%
and data.

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:30.655 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And as some
would argue, a simulation.

00:28:30.655 --> 00:28:31.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:31.810 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Yeah.

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:32.680 align:middle line:90%
Oh, absolutely.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.990 align:middle line:84%
As to what reality is
supposed to look like.

00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:39.690 align:middle line:84%
So we have this
multi-level construct

00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:42.630 align:middle line:84%
that we're dealing with in this
conversation that we could talk

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:45.960 align:middle line:84%
about for hours because
it's so many layers

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:49.170 align:middle line:84%
deep as to the
human being and what

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:53.070 align:middle line:84%
is a human being
and this experience.

00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:54.670 align:middle line:90%
What is this experience?

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:55.470 align:middle line:90%
Reality.

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:57.000 align:middle line:90%
What is this reality?

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.130 align:middle line:84%
Are we all experiencing
the same thing?

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:01.770 align:middle line:90%
So many different factors.

00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And so it does go
back to the need,

00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:10.050 align:middle line:84%
the necessity of an individual
beginning to ask questions,

00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:13.230 align:middle line:84%
beginning to realize that
it's possible for them

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:14.970 align:middle line:90%
to take ownership of self.

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:18.880 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, you've
never lost ownership of self.

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:22.190 align:middle line:84%
What you have, though,
is the illusion

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:23.870 align:middle line:84%
of not being
responsible for yourself

00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:26.400 align:middle line:84%
because with your own power,
you've given your power away.

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:31.685 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: So it's this
really interesting human story

00:29:31.685 --> 00:29:33.560 align:middle line:84%
and human experience
that we're dealing with.

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:34.740 align:middle line:90%
It's just fascinating.

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And you talk about the
marketing of disease,

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.480 align:middle line:90%
giving our power away.

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:43.460 align:middle line:90%
Even the marketing of survival.

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:44.260 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Oh, yes.

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:45.980 align:middle line:84%
How old you're going
to live and all that.

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.740 align:middle line:84%
Let's go into that for a
little bit because, I mean,

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:51.440 align:middle line:84%
when you come down
to it, how we're each

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:53.900 align:middle line:84%
going to fare through
these challenging times

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:56.960 align:middle line:84%
and challenging times
beyond, it has so much

00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:00.560 align:middle line:84%
to do with the level of the
frequency we choose to live at.

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
that's internally

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:04.520 align:middle line:90%
chosen and generated.

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And we can live in the lower
spectrum, in abject fear of one

00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:13.670 align:middle line:84%
another, even starting to blame
and so forth, which really,

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:16.303 align:middle line:84%
literally, as you know,
that acidifies the blood.

00:30:16.303 --> 00:30:17.220 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Absolutely.

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:18.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Living
in fear acidifies

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:22.010 align:middle line:84%
the blood making you more prone
to anything that comes along

00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:24.920 align:middle line:84%
and any kind of dis-ease,
right, or imbalance.

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:29.030 align:middle line:84%
So we know that, but
we know opposite that.

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:30.710 align:middle line:84%
If you choose to
live in this state

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:34.790 align:middle line:84%
where, my body is perfectly
adapted to handling everything

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:38.118 align:middle line:84%
if I'm responsible and do the
responsible thing for myself,

00:30:38.118 --> 00:30:39.410 align:middle line:90%
that's a whole different thing.

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:40.993 align:middle line:84%
We'll get to that
because that's where

00:30:40.993 --> 00:30:44.430 align:middle line:84%
we're going to go in our
conversation, what we can do.

00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:47.202 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about the
marketing of survival first.

00:30:47.202 --> 00:30:48.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: The
marketing of-- there

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:50.720 align:middle line:84%
are so many things I'd like
to talk about, oh my goodness.

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:51.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Go for it.

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:51.840 align:middle line:90%
We've got some time.

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:52.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Well, the marketing--

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:54.500 align:middle line:84%
OK, we'll talk about the
marketing of survival.

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:57.050 align:middle line:84%
But I want to go back
real quickly to the reason

00:30:57.050 --> 00:30:59.120 align:middle line:84%
why it's necessary
for human beings

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.710 align:middle line:90%
to take back responsibility.

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:03.792 align:middle line:84%
You talk about the wheel,
the reincarnation wheel.

00:31:03.792 --> 00:31:05.750 align:middle line:84%
I know we're not going
to get into all of that,

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:10.190 align:middle line:84%
but they need to understand
that not owning your power

00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:12.863 align:middle line:84%
is how you are
kept in a certain--

00:31:12.863 --> 00:31:14.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In these patterns.

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: --in these patterns,
in this state of existence.

00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And to become aware, which
is why the system struggles

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:22.022 align:middle line:90%
with its design.

00:31:22.022 --> 00:31:23.730 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't say struggle
with its design.

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:27.560 align:middle line:84%
But the system presents
itself in a way that

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:32.363 align:middle line:84%
helps people to continue to not
believe that they are capable,

00:31:32.363 --> 00:31:33.780 align:middle line:84%
otherwise the game
doesn't change.

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:35.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To
disempower humanity.

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:35.977 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Absolutely.

00:31:35.977 --> 00:31:38.080 align:middle line:84%
The game would change
for the individual.

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:41.370 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not the whole construct,
but for the individual.

00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:44.240 align:middle line:84%
Every time you wake
up on that level,

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:46.170 align:middle line:90%
the game changes for you.

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And so this is really important
for people to understand.

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:54.380 align:middle line:84%
So the marketing is
part of that system that

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:57.290 align:middle line:84%
helps to keep the game
going a certain way,

00:31:57.290 --> 00:31:59.750 align:middle line:84%
the game of oppression,
the game of suppression,

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:04.190 align:middle line:90%
the game of not being capable.

00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:05.940 align:middle line:90%
All of those systems.

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:09.930 align:middle line:84%
The game of vulnerability,
of survival.

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:12.290 align:middle line:90%
The fear of not existing.

00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:15.770 align:middle line:84%
Marketing keeps that
going by basic things

00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:19.460 align:middle line:90%
like ads that tell you how old--

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:21.890 align:middle line:84%
well, when an ad
comes up and it says,

00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:26.750 align:middle line:84%
if you're between the
ages of 40 or 30 to 85,

00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:32.210 align:middle line:84%
that alone is so suggestive
as to how long you can live

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:34.880 align:middle line:84%
and what the boundaries
are and the cutoffs.

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:39.230 align:middle line:84%
We also see commercials
where a child

00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:42.970 align:middle line:84%
is talking to the grandfather,
and the grandfather

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:45.920 align:middle line:84%
or grandmother has
COPD or something.

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:50.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, the person is made to look
a certain way at a certain age.

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:53.720 align:middle line:90%
The child is being encoded.

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:55.880 align:middle line:84%
Children are being
encoded in that moment

00:32:55.880 --> 00:33:00.980 align:middle line:84%
to know that the journey
consists of this path.

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:02.870 align:middle line:84%
This is something we
need to understand

00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:07.160 align:middle line:84%
is how this encoding happens
from the very beginning on.

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:11.063 align:middle line:84%
So by the time the child gets to
a certain age or certain point,

00:33:11.063 --> 00:33:12.480 align:middle line:84%
they start thinking
a certain way.

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:15.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, I'm getting up
in age or this is happening.

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:17.210 align:middle line:90%
It becomes automatic.

00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:19.520 align:middle line:84%
So my question in
the very beginning

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:24.200 align:middle line:84%
was, even as a child, is,
what the heck is this?

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:26.570 align:middle line:90%
Because it made no sense to me.

00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:29.270 align:middle line:84%
We live life based
on suggestions,

00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:31.100 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think
we realize that.

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:34.790 align:middle line:84%
Life is suggested to us, and
that's what marketing is.

00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:37.880 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot of suggestions
that we take in.

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And over time, you have
layers of this suggestion that

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:47.150 align:middle line:84%
begins to form a particular
version of reality,

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:50.360 align:middle line:84%
a prescribed version of
reality for individuals,

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.578 align:middle line:84%
and we started living
by this prescription.

00:33:52.578 --> 00:33:54.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This starts from
the moment we're born.

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:55.703 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Oh, absolutely.

00:33:55.703 --> 00:33:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you're
welcomed into the world,

00:33:57.620 --> 00:33:59.510 align:middle line:84%
you're already in the
family mindset, which

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:01.430 align:middle line:84%
is in the cultural
mindset, that has all

00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:03.560 align:middle line:90%
the other submindsets in it.

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And so this is not a small
topic we're talking about.

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:08.777 align:middle line:90%
It's sovereignty of mind.

00:34:08.777 --> 00:34:09.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: It's big.

00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:11.030 align:middle line:10%
It's a very big topic.

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:17.440 align:middle line:10%
And I find that it
would be wonderful to be

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:20.889 align:middle line:10%
able to have this
kind of discussion

00:34:20.889 --> 00:34:23.230 align:middle line:10%
or this kind of
information, particularly

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:26.500 align:middle line:10%
when you have people living
in the space of fear.

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
throw this out there.

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:32.170 align:middle line:84%
When we're talking about
operating in the space of fear,

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:35.420 align:middle line:84%
there are people
who are considered

00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:39.380 align:middle line:84%
in a state of awareness,
and they themselves

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:43.040 align:middle line:84%
are operating in a
deep level of fear.

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:45.020 align:middle line:84%
There's different
kinds of fear, but I'm

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:50.340 align:middle line:84%
talking about fear in the sense
of what's going on right now.

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And we have to understand
that this moment, once again,

00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:58.860 align:middle line:84%
this moment in time
is transformative.

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:01.020 align:middle line:90%
It's two sides of a coin.

00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:05.450 align:middle line:84%
We've got the agenda
of the system,

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:07.710 align:middle line:84%
meaning the-- and
when I say the system,

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:10.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking the physical
people who run things--

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:13.280 align:middle line:84%
and then there is
the greater agenda

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:16.370 align:middle line:84%
of the evolution
of the human being,

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:18.230 align:middle line:90%
and this is where we are.

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:22.160 align:middle line:84%
This can be used as a
launching pad for people

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:25.095 align:middle line:84%
to begin to question and
to tap into themselves.

00:35:25.095 --> 00:35:25.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:28.430 align:middle line:84%
Because this is a period,
with everything slowed down

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:32.120 align:middle line:84%
as it has been, this is a
period for maybe the first time

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:35.250 align:middle line:84%
in our lives, collectively, we
actually have time to observe.

00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:36.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Yes.

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have time to
think, ask questions that we

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:39.800 align:middle line:84%
haven't bothered
answering because--

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:40.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: It's
the perfect time.

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:42.635 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we have
nothing better to do.

00:35:42.635 --> 00:35:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And I see it as a
very powerful time

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:46.830 align:middle line:84%
as well to say
nothing of the fact,

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:49.190 align:middle line:84%
it's quite conceivable,
that whatever

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:53.600 align:middle line:84%
this is that our
bodies are contending

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:56.210 align:middle line:84%
with might be something
that is having us adapt

00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:59.490 align:middle line:84%
on the level of DNA
toward some end result

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:01.690 align:middle line:84%
we're not aware of yet
that's positive even.

00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:02.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: That's right.

00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:05.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is quite
conceivable that this is,

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.100 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to use--

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:09.260 align:middle line:84%
it's too trite to use
the word upgrade--

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:11.300 align:middle line:84%
but an adaptation
or an evolution

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:13.340 align:middle line:84%
that needs to occur
because something else

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:15.990 align:middle line:84%
may be ready to occur down
the road at some point.

00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:17.630 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Absolutely.

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So our
bodies are contending

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:23.270 align:middle line:84%
with whatever this virus is,
whatever you think of it,

00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:24.290 align:middle line:90%
will mutate.

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:26.300 align:middle line:84%
No matter what its
source, it will mutate.

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:27.897 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: As many things have.

00:36:27.897 --> 00:36:29.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: As they all do, right?

00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Mm-hmm.

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:33.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's focus on
what the opportunity is here

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.840 align:middle line:84%
and what we need to do
by way of really taking

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:39.380 align:middle line:84%
our health into our hands, which
is what your documentary is

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:40.250 align:middle line:90%
talking about.

00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:41.167 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Absolutely.

00:36:41.167 --> 00:36:45.950 align:middle line:84%
And it goes back to that
idea of self-responsibility,

00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:49.010 align:middle line:84%
of self-truth, of
self-examination,

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:53.150 align:middle line:84%
of really looking at
how we live our life.

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And this has nothing to do with
guilt or blame or any of that.

00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:03.050 align:middle line:84%
It's just a moment in time
where you start thinking, well,

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:06.680 align:middle line:84%
you know, I have been
either carrying this around,

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:11.900 align:middle line:84%
my pain, my hurt from
a past relationship,

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:15.380 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is,
you've been carrying it.

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:20.030 align:middle line:84%
Can we just be honest and
say, I've been carrying this

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:22.460 align:middle line:84%
and I feel the
weight of this here,

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:24.740 align:middle line:84%
but I really am
ready to let it go.

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it might seem
like it's so simple to say that.

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:31.370 align:middle line:84%
But I tell you, this whole
being, this brain, this mind,

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:34.873 align:middle line:84%
is all about taking
commands from you,

00:37:34.873 --> 00:37:36.415 align:middle line:84%
from that greater
aspect of yourself.

00:37:36.415 --> 00:37:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you don't give
it to you, someone else will.

00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:39.600 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Someone else will.

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's basically
what happens.

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:46.010 align:middle line:84%
So I think that, yes,
this situation is--

00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:50.690 align:middle line:84%
I think people who have a lot
of underlying health conditions

00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:52.910 align:middle line:84%
are probably being
greatly affected.

00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:56.090 align:middle line:84%
But we also have
to look at, again,

00:37:56.090 --> 00:38:00.020 align:middle line:84%
what can we do to build
our immune system?

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:00.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:03.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: And yes, it's fruits,
vegetables, and all of that,

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:06.385 align:middle line:84%
but we must look at the
emotional part of it.

00:38:06.385 --> 00:38:07.185 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:38:07.185 --> 00:38:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And people don't look
at the immune system

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:13.220 align:middle line:84%
as anything other than
physical, but it's mental.

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:16.250 align:middle line:84%
We have a mental, emotional,
spiritual immune system.

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:17.763 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: It's a
holistic process.

00:38:17.763 --> 00:38:18.680 align:middle line:90%
It's a holistic thing.

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:20.138 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about that.

00:38:20.138 --> 00:38:22.670 align:middle line:84%
Because we talked earlier
about fear and anger

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:27.560 align:middle line:84%
acidifies the blood which makes
you more prone to disease,

00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:30.780 align:middle line:84%
especially internal inflammation
of all kinds, chronic disease.

00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:32.390 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at the
opposite of that.

00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:33.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Absolutely.

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think it is
wonderful, but it's

00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:42.380 align:middle line:84%
a fact that we do have to look
at the other side of the coin,

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:45.140 align:middle line:84%
which we did, which is
the feeling of frustration

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:47.468 align:middle line:84%
and, oh my gosh,
this is all going on.

00:38:47.468 --> 00:38:49.010 align:middle line:84%
But then, like you
said, now, we have

00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:50.840 align:middle line:90%
to look at the other side of it.

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea
of, yes, of being

00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:59.450 align:middle line:84%
in fear and of figuring out,
what can I now do with my body

00:38:59.450 --> 00:39:02.570 align:middle line:84%
to move myself beyond
this situation, I think

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:06.620 align:middle line:84%
needs to be the core
conversation with self.

00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to bring up
real quickly the food aspect.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:16.015 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're eating a lot
of processed foods and things

00:39:16.015 --> 00:39:18.390 align:middle line:84%
that people are picking up
because they want to make sure

00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:20.280 align:middle line:84%
they have things,
and you're picking up

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:22.440 align:middle line:84%
a lot of foods that are
processed with sodium

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:24.360 align:middle line:90%
and all kinds of preservatives.

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to eat
that, but you're sitting

00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:30.090 align:middle line:84%
in your house and you're
depressed, you're already down,

00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:36.270 align:middle line:84%
the impact of that food on your
body is perhaps going to be--

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:40.890 align:middle line:84%
not perhaps, it's going to
be a bit more severe than

00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:43.478 align:middle line:84%
if a person is in a
more content state--

00:39:43.478 --> 00:39:44.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Elevated state.

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:45.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: Elevated
state of mind.

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:46.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:47.075 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Absolutely.

00:39:47.075 --> 00:39:48.450 align:middle line:84%
Elevated state,
which is a higher

00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:52.888 align:middle line:84%
frequency of consciousness,
of awareness, of mind.

00:39:52.888 --> 00:39:54.930 align:middle line:84%
It's going to have a
completely different effect.

00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:57.450 align:middle line:84%
We have to understand
that the body is having

00:39:57.450 --> 00:40:02.610 align:middle line:84%
to fight to compensate and
to process the processed

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:06.990 align:middle line:84%
food along with processing
the emotions, the acidity

00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:08.130 align:middle line:90%
of the emotions.

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:11.820 align:middle line:84%
So your body is doing
overtime in trying to work

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:13.930 align:middle line:90%
with these two conditions.

00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:16.680 align:middle line:10%
And I think those things are
super important for people

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:20.340 align:middle line:10%
to understand how the body is
actually working and getting

00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:22.760 align:middle line:10%
through this.

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And eating those things
will actually also

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:27.720 align:middle line:90%
add to one feeling depressed.

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:31.200 align:middle line:84%
Because, as I said before,
the body's a chemical factory,

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:35.080 align:middle line:84%
and it's reacting to
what you're eating.

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:37.380 align:middle line:84%
So there's this whole
process that's going on.

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:38.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's true.

00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:39.060 align:middle line:90%
Hold that thought.

00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:39.580 align:middle line:90%
Continue.

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:41.130 align:middle line:84%
But this has
historically been true.

00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:43.610 align:middle line:84%
When you find yourself
in an emotional state,

00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:46.290 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of the world's
traditions you either fast

00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:48.360 align:middle line:84%
or you only have very,
very light foods,

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:51.180 align:middle line:84%
foods like fruits or
juices or something.

00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:54.060 align:middle line:84%
This is traditional
to start allowing

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:58.180 align:middle line:84%
for the immune system of the
emotional body to heal as well.

00:40:58.180 --> 00:40:59.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Absolutely.

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And all of that goes
back to-- and I'm

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:04.995 align:middle line:84%
going to use that term
again because I think

00:41:04.995 --> 00:41:06.870 align:middle line:84%
we have to look at this
from different ways--

00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:10.260 align:middle line:84%
but I refer to the body
as one of the highest

00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:12.120 align:middle line:90%
levels of technology.

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And technology not only in
the sense of our cell phones

00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:19.620 align:middle line:84%
and so on, but this incredible
level of technology.

00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And to remind people that
it is a sensory system which

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:27.240 align:middle line:84%
is how you're experiencing
this reality, life here.

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:28.920 align:middle line:84%
It's processing
all your emotions

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:31.320 align:middle line:84%
and all your feelings
as you interact

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.970 align:middle line:84%
and have a
relationship with what

00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:35.530 align:middle line:90%
we define as external reality.

00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:37.680 align:middle line:90%
So it's your processing system.

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And so with that
understanding, I

00:41:40.830 --> 00:41:43.680 align:middle line:84%
think a person can
start looking at, well,

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:46.650 align:middle line:84%
how am I caring for
this processing system?

00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:48.700 align:middle line:90%
What am I taking into it?

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:50.790 align:middle line:90%
How do I feel about me?

00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:54.060 align:middle line:84%
This is a great time
to assess those things

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:56.440 align:middle line:90%
and to be honest with yourself.

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:59.040 align:middle line:84%
How am I feeling
about me right now?

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:00.960 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times how we
feel about ourselves

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:05.490 align:middle line:84%
obviously is what is directing
us to the relationships

00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:08.470 align:middle line:84%
that we get to, to even
the jobs that we have.

00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:10.470 align:middle line:84%
I often tell people
that, you think

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:13.530 align:middle line:84%
you're working the job
because of the money.

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:14.700 align:middle line:90%
You're there for the money.

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:19.020 align:middle line:10%
But no, we are everywhere
we are because it supports

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:20.160 align:middle line:10%
the story, the inner story.

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And a lot
of this is self-worth,

00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:23.610 align:middle line:90%
comes back to self-worth.

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:26.460 align:middle line:84%
You take a job that's barely
acceptable because you

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:28.650 align:middle line:84%
feel that, well, that's
all you really deserve

00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:30.540 align:middle line:90%
on a subconscious level.

00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:35.160 align:middle line:84%
The same with relationships that
aren't offering us what we need

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:38.160 align:middle line:84%
or allowing us to contribute
what we have to give because

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:39.450 align:middle line:90%
of self-worth again.

00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:42.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: Self-worth,
and at the same time,

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:46.230 align:middle line:84%
we draw these people
and conditions

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:49.320 align:middle line:90%
that really are prompting us.

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:53.550 align:middle line:84%
But we instead, what we see
is, oh, I'm so upset with this.

00:42:53.550 --> 00:42:56.030 align:middle line:84%
My boss, my this
person, my that.

00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:57.403 align:middle line:90%
Actually, they are helping you.

00:42:57.403 --> 00:42:59.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is the
crazy part about it.

00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:00.540 align:middle line:84%
When I started to
understand this,

00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:05.190 align:middle line:84%
I realized that the only reason
why I'm here is because--

00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:09.660 align:middle line:84%
I say, read your life like a
data printout, like a printout.

00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And so everything that
you're interacting with,

00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:15.390 align:middle line:84%
the person on your job that
you just don't get along with,

00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:17.760 align:middle line:84%
and every time you leave a
job, you go to another job

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:19.900 align:middle line:84%
and you find somebody
else like that.

00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:21.425 align:middle line:90%
This is like reading a printout.

00:43:21.425 --> 00:43:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Mismatched
frequencies.

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:23.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Absolutely.

00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Until you lift the
frequency, it's the same thing.

00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:28.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: Till you choose
to examine it and take back

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:32.320 align:middle line:84%
control, as opposed to them,
them, them, them, them.

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:34.290 align:middle line:90%
That's what they're doing to me.

00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're
responding according

00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:38.340 align:middle line:84%
to the frequency,
the frequency that's

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:41.850 align:middle line:84%
coming from you, which
is the frequency of one's

00:43:41.850 --> 00:43:43.120 align:middle line:90%
belief about oneself.

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:45.870 align:middle line:90%
So this is all unmatched energy.

00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:47.640 align:middle line:84%
It's all, like you
said, frequencies

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:50.440 align:middle line:90%
that we're operating under.

00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:53.640 align:middle line:10%
And when we can start to
see that-- and it's OK.

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:54.780 align:middle line:90%
You can just own it.

00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:56.230 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you know how that feels.

00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:58.772 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But this is the thing
people are so afraid of this.

00:43:58.772 --> 00:44:01.980 align:middle line:84%
They're so afraid of owning it,
of just looking at the fact,

00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:04.560 align:middle line:84%
we don't have to
buy our sizzle reel.

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:07.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's been really
kind of the devastating act

00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:09.210 align:middle line:84%
of social media
is people putting

00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:11.820 align:middle line:84%
out all the bright, shiny
things about their lives

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:14.010 align:middle line:84%
and looking at each
other with envy

00:44:14.010 --> 00:44:16.500 align:middle line:84%
and awe at the amazing
life someone else

00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:18.788 align:middle line:84%
has when they're just putting
out their sizzle reel.

00:44:18.788 --> 00:44:20.580 align:middle line:84%
They're not talking
about the rest of life.

00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And so now people
have even had it

00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:24.930 align:middle line:84%
more reinforced to be
ashamed of the parts

00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:27.780 align:middle line:84%
that are unhealed or kind
of lagging a bit behind what

00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:29.032 align:middle line:90%
we would desire for ourselves.

00:44:29.032 --> 00:44:30.240 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Yeah, embarrassed.

00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:32.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you're
kind of embarrassed.

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:34.770 align:middle line:84%
To get out from that,
just knock it off.

00:44:34.770 --> 00:44:36.040 align:middle line:90%
That's a sizzle reel.

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:39.180 align:middle line:84%
That is not a reflective
of anyone else's life.

00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:42.842 align:middle line:84%
This whole hero worship
thing has got to go, right?

00:44:42.842 --> 00:44:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And I love what you had to say
a minute ago because I think

00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:47.400 align:middle line:90%
that's where you do take stock.

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:50.550 align:middle line:84%
If we know we're all here, we're
all learning, we're all flawed,

00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:54.360 align:middle line:84%
we all have problems, and we all
have an incredibly impeccable,

00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:58.260 align:middle line:84%
beautiful spiritual core,
then we can have the courage

00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:01.900 align:middle line:84%
to, like you said,
look at our life,

00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:04.717 align:middle line:90%
for now, as a data printout.

00:45:04.717 --> 00:45:06.300 align:middle line:84%
Where is it going
where we need it to?

00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:07.140 align:middle line:90%
Where am I off?

00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:08.370 align:middle line:90%
What have I done recently?

00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:11.710 align:middle line:84%
It really kind of put
things in a downward spiral.

00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And then respond to it
appropriately and honestly.

00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:16.020 align:middle line:84%
That's the beginning
of sovereignty

00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:18.602 align:middle line:84%
is being able to look at
your own data printout.

00:45:18.602 --> 00:45:20.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: Absolutely,
the stories.

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:20.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:21.240 align:middle line:90%
I love the way you said that.

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:22.410 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Absolutely.

00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And the stories are
shaped from that printout.

00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:28.020 align:middle line:84%
This is the interaction
we're having.

00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:29.770 align:middle line:90%
It's these stories.

00:45:29.770 --> 00:45:32.820 align:middle line:84%
So I think that the
other thing that people

00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:37.950 align:middle line:84%
need to be reminded of is,
we come here on this journey,

00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:44.370 align:middle line:84%
and to be a human being
is about exploring

00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:45.990 align:middle line:90%
all and any potential.

00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:50.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, you and I might not
explore the same potential

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:51.810 align:middle line:90%
that the other person might.

00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: But this
is about experiencing.

00:45:55.650 --> 00:45:57.925 align:middle line:84%
So everything that
you've lived--

00:45:57.925 --> 00:46:00.300 align:middle line:84%
and we have to look at it that
way-- everything that I've

00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:03.120 align:middle line:84%
lived, and everything
that I'm living right now,

00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:05.280 align:middle line:84%
and everything that I
will live in the future,

00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:07.500 align:middle line:90%
has all been my purpose.

00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:09.330 align:middle line:84%
There is no one thing
over here where,

00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:11.950 align:middle line:90%
this is finally my purpose.

00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:12.750 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:14.700 align:middle line:84%
Everything you've
lived have brought you

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:16.690 align:middle line:90%
right here to this moment.

00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And if you hadn't gone through
those particular things,

00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:23.100 align:middle line:84%
then you wouldn't have
arrived right here.

00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:24.750 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's
being able to look

00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:27.420 align:middle line:90%
at life differently and go, OK.

00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:29.910 align:middle line:84%
So where do I want
to launch from here?

00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:33.690 align:middle line:84%
If we can take that honest look
instead of beating ourselves up

00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:36.970 align:middle line:84%
about what happened and what
didn't happen and just realize,

00:46:36.970 --> 00:46:38.190 align:middle line:90%
wait a second.

00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:39.670 align:middle line:90%
That was just an experience.

00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:41.220 align:middle line:90%
I am an experiencer.

00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:42.270 align:middle line:90%
This is the mission.

00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:43.228 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:46:43.228 --> 00:46:46.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: I have come here
and I've done my experiencing.

00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:48.720 align:middle line:84%
I would like to
step it up, however.

00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:54.000 align:middle line:84%
I would like to move into a
new level of experiencing.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think, again, this
is that moment in time.

00:46:56.910 --> 00:46:58.980 align:middle line:10%
This is an incredible
opportunity

00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:02.850 align:middle line:10%
to step into new areas
of possibilities.

00:47:02.850 --> 00:47:04.710 align:middle line:90%
The possibilities don't end.

00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:05.640 align:middle line:90%
This is the thing.

00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:10.680 align:middle line:84%
There is no finality to the
game of life and experiencing.

00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:12.600 align:middle line:84%
There is just new
levels, and they

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:14.490 align:middle line:90%
have different frequencies.

00:47:14.490 --> 00:47:16.200 align:middle line:84%
You're vibrating at
different levels,

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:18.420 align:middle line:90%
not good, not bad, not better.

00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:20.060 align:middle line:90%
Just new frequencies.

00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:24.210 align:middle line:84%
The more elevated, where you no
longer need those experiences

00:47:24.210 --> 00:47:26.430 align:middle line:84%
anymore, you've gotten all
that you can out of that.

00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:28.060 align:middle line:90%
You've wrung it dry.

00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:30.030 align:middle line:90%
You've done with those stories.

00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:31.410 align:middle line:90%
Now, I'm ready to move forward.

00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And how did you get
to move forward?

00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:34.950 align:middle line:84%
Because you had
those experiences.

00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:35.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:38.400 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: So it is
very simple, but it's

00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:43.260 align:middle line:84%
getting ourselves to step away
from the shame and the guilt

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:47.750 align:middle line:84%
of what life presented
us over time.

00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:49.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, you're
absolutely right.

00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And having the courage to be
able to look at your life-- it

00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:55.270 align:middle line:84%
takes courage to
look at your life

00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:58.530 align:middle line:84%
honestly-- and take this moment
in time to look at our lives

00:47:58.530 --> 00:48:01.950 align:middle line:84%
honestly, which I think
every single human being that

00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:04.640 align:middle line:84%
has any cognitive
skills on this planet

00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:06.740 align:middle line:84%
should be doing right
now for ourselves.

00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:07.540 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Yes.

00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:09.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For our
own well-being.

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:11.290 align:middle line:90%
To have the courage to do that.

00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And then, to have that final bit
which is to take responsibility

00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:17.692 align:middle line:90%
for what you learn and say, OK.

00:48:17.692 --> 00:48:19.150 align:middle line:84%
This might require
a little effort.

00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:21.250 align:middle line:84%
It might require a
little discipline,

00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:23.750 align:middle line:84%
which a lot of people don't
like that word, right?

00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:25.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Mm-hmm.

00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:27.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the
opportunity, if I do that,

00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:32.780 align:middle line:84%
to do this personal upgrade
in our own reality is huge.

00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:35.287 align:middle line:84%
We have the moment
now to evaluate that.

00:48:35.287 --> 00:48:36.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Oh, absolutely.

00:48:36.370 --> 00:48:37.450 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:48:37.450 --> 00:48:41.340 align:middle line:90%
And the frequency changes.

00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:43.960 align:middle line:84%
When the frequency of thought
changes, believe it or not,

00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:45.740 align:middle line:90%
it lightens you.

00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:47.440 align:middle line:84%
It can actually
lighten your body

00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:50.980 align:middle line:84%
because the weight of
the, what should we say,

00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:52.438 align:middle line:84%
the lower frequencies
is just that.

00:48:52.438 --> 00:48:53.238 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah

00:48:53.238 --> 00:48:54.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: There is a lot more--

00:48:54.730 --> 00:48:57.930 align:middle line:84%
well, your cells aren't getting
the same amount of oxygen.

00:48:57.930 --> 00:49:00.310 align:middle line:84%
You have to understand that,
so that's what's happening.

00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:03.610 align:middle line:84%
The less oxygen you're
getting, the more vulnerable

00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:07.690 align:middle line:84%
you are to an illness
or to anything

00:49:07.690 --> 00:49:11.230 align:middle line:84%
that is an adverse
experience against the body.

00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:13.630 align:middle line:84%
So we need to realize
that you can actually

00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:15.220 align:middle line:90%
begin to look even younger.

00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:16.960 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is--

00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:17.860 align:middle line:90%
we take vacation.

00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:19.630 align:middle line:84%
Real quickly, just
to look at that.

00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:21.640 align:middle line:84%
People go on vacation
and then they come back

00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:26.230 align:middle line:84%
and people go, wow, you look
so young, so much younger.

00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:29.680 align:middle line:84%
That tells you, the
weight of life and the job

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:31.990 align:middle line:84%
and all of that,
for that moment,

00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:34.520 align:middle line:84%
for a week or two or
even a couple of days,

00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:37.690 align:middle line:84%
that person had a chance
to take that deep breath

00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:40.270 align:middle line:84%
and to release it
all, and that's

00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:41.880 align:middle line:90%
how pliable the brain is.

00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:43.990 align:middle line:90%
That's how pliable the body is.

00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:46.840 align:middle line:10%
Everything will
bend to our will.

00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:48.820 align:middle line:90%
We just have to understand that.

00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:50.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Including
the material.

00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:52.340 align:middle line:90%
Including the physical.

00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:53.140 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Yes.

00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:55.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's nothing
that we're being handed here

00:49:55.390 --> 00:49:59.420 align:middle line:84%
that's a death sentence for
society, for us as individuals.

00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:00.920 align:middle line:84%
It might feel like
it in the moment,

00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:02.945 align:middle line:84%
especially if you've
lost your line of work,

00:50:02.945 --> 00:50:05.320 align:middle line:84%
hopefully it's a line of work
that you didn't like anyway

00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:07.790 align:middle line:90%
so you can reinvent yourself.

00:50:07.790 --> 00:50:09.940 align:middle line:84%
But everything is
possible right now.

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:11.020 align:middle line:90%
I totally agree with you.

00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:11.820 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: I agree.

00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:12.245 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:12.245 --> 00:50:13.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're totally in sync.

00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:14.220 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Oh yeah.

00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Any final thought
before we say goodbye?

00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:18.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: The
biggest final thought

00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:24.050 align:middle line:84%
I always like to leave people
is to commit and give yourself

00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:24.850 align:middle line:90%
permission.

00:50:24.850 --> 00:50:27.160 align:middle line:10%
Most of all, give
yourself permission

00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:29.410 align:middle line:10%
to want to be more,
to want to tap

00:50:29.410 --> 00:50:31.780 align:middle line:10%
into a deeper level of self.

00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:35.950 align:middle line:10%
You must give your permission to
yourself first and then commit,

00:50:35.950 --> 00:50:39.850 align:middle line:10%
and then say, I'm
ready, and things

00:50:39.850 --> 00:50:42.190 align:middle line:10%
will begin to show up for you.

00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:43.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with that.

00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Sonia, it's been so lovely
being able to sit and chat again

00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:48.820 align:middle line:84%
after all of these
years, and I think

00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:51.370 align:middle line:90%
it's an important conversation.

00:50:51.370 --> 00:50:53.748 align:middle line:84%
Sovereignty of mind and
personal responsibility

00:50:53.748 --> 00:50:56.290 align:middle line:84%
are the words that I think are
going to bring every one of us

00:50:56.290 --> 00:50:58.120 align:middle line:84%
to a higher level out
of this challenge.

00:50:58.120 --> 00:50:59.037 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Absolutely.

00:50:59.037 --> 00:51:00.877 align:middle line:90%
>>BOTH: Thank you so much.

00:51:00.877 --> 00:51:03.460 align:middle line:84%

YouTube channel, The Expansion
