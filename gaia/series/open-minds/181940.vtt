00:00:20.497 --> 00:00:22.830 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MERIDITH: Glenn
Streeter is back with us again

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.710 align:middle line:10%
after your enthusiastic
response to his information

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.630 align:middle line:10%
on the subject of
energy healing.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And its accompanying
new technologies.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.700 align:middle line:84%
This is in the Gaia Archives,
our first interview.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.220 align:middle line:10%
Today, we'll dive deeper into
the history of energy healing

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.050 align:middle line:10%
devices and how
far they've come.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.550 align:middle line:84%
And we've got a
really exciting show

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.830 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of new
technologies to introduce you

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.300 align:middle line:90%
to and meet you as well.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.263 align:middle line:90%
So, Glenn, welcome.

00:00:44.263 --> 00:00:45.430 align:middle line:90%
Good to have you back again.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>> GLENN STREETER: Great
to be back, Regina.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You have a wonderful
little historical device with

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.130 align:middle line:90%
us.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.382 align:middle line:84%
And because there's so much
new that's on the horizon,

00:00:51.382 --> 00:00:53.340 align:middle line:84%
we're going to kind of
hop through the history.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.180 align:middle line:84%
Because as you said off camera,
this is not a linear story.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.040 align:middle line:90%
This is a circular story.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.230 align:middle line:84%
So why don't you just
jump in and tell everybody

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.430 align:middle line:90%
what you mean by that.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.120 align:middle line:10%
>> STREETER: So 1850s to late
1800s was a fascinating time.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.900 align:middle line:90%
We had the radio, the telegraph.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.560 align:middle line:84%
We had all these
incredible inventions

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.557 align:middle line:84%
and the birth of Tesla and
also the creation of the AMA.

00:01:16.557 --> 00:01:17.640 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And that's key.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.598 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Yes it is.

00:01:18.598 --> 00:01:19.950 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.636 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That kind of messed
with all the rest of it that

00:01:21.636 --> 00:01:22.436 align:middle line:90%
came before it.

00:01:22.436 --> 00:01:24.300 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: The
film camera as well--

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.400 align:middle line:90%
so a huge time of change.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.800 align:middle line:10%
And all these energy
medicine devices

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.730 align:middle line:10%
came out of that time like
the Lord Baltimore and Tesla's

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.190 align:middle line:10%
Violet Ray, Lakhovsky's
multi wave oscillator--

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.110 align:middle line:10%
just fascinating time and
they were efficacious.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.250 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They still are.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.880 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Absolutely.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean, I don't
know if you know Steven Ross.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:44.430 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Oh, for sure.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You know Stephen?

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:45.120 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Yes.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, so
Stephen has been using

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.940 align:middle line:84%
the Lakhovsky's oscillator for
hundreds of clients through

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:51.780 align:middle line:90%
the years.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And he never gave up on
the old technology, right?

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And he just gets phenomenal
results with people with this.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.720 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the Tesla Violet Ray

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.229 align:middle line:84%
because you have an original
model here with you today.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.100 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what
some of these technologies

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.590 align:middle line:84%
did in the day and throw
a couple more in there

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.850 align:middle line:84%
as well that had been lost
to time for the most part.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.308 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: OK,
so the Violet Ray,

00:02:17.308 --> 00:02:19.860 align:middle line:84%
the focus was on ozone
generating machine.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.420 align:middle line:90%
So it was used for aesthetics.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.370 align:middle line:84%
It was used for sore
throats and back pain.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And they sold thousands
of these units

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.920 align:middle line:84%
until the '50s
with great results.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so
it's called the Tesla?

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: The Tesla
Violet Ray but a multitude

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.310 align:middle line:84%
of manufacturers created
it and change the name,

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.690 align:middle line:90%
but he used his technology.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.306 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And this was
originally created when?

00:02:40.306 --> 00:02:41.820 align:middle line:90%
When did it first come out?

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.095 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Late 1800s.

00:02:43.095 --> 00:02:44.250 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Late 1800s--

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.660 align:middle line:84%
so this ozone generator could
heal a multitude of conditions,

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.905 align:middle line:90%
why?

00:02:49.905 --> 00:02:52.815 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Well, oxygen is
really our best antioxidant,

00:02:52.815 --> 00:02:53.615 align:middle line:90%
is it not?

00:02:53.615 --> 00:02:54.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.853 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: And ozone also has
the ability to kill pathogens.

00:02:56.853 --> 00:02:58.987 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of amazing
things came out of it.

00:02:58.987 --> 00:03:00.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And they're
using it today.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.260 align:middle line:84%
I know a progressive doc
in Sedona who uses ozone--

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.480 align:middle line:90%
for example, ozone injections--

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.020 align:middle line:84%
to reverse the
horrific debilitating

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.880 align:middle line:84%
effects of brown recluse
spider bites, for example.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.610 align:middle line:84%
So instead of the
tissue going necrotic

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.975 align:middle line:84%
or losing your finger or
your hand or something,

00:03:16.975 --> 00:03:17.850 align:middle line:90%
he just shoots it in.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.200 align:middle line:90%
They say it hurts like heck.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.800 align:middle line:84%
But after the sting is
over it, stops the damage.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.050 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's powerful stuff.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.675 align:middle line:10%
>> STREETER: The Four Pass Ozone
is something that your viewers

00:03:26.675 --> 00:03:29.160 align:middle line:10%
could look into if they're
suffering from Lyme or cancer

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.790 align:middle line:10%
or other types of--

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:30.840 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Four Pass Ozone?

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:31.300 align:middle line:10%
>> STREETER: Four Pass Ozone.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.950 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: What is that?

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: They take the blood
out of the body and run it past

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.460 align:middle line:84%
the ozone and back
into the body.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, yes, I
think he does that as well.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.055 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: It's a wonderful
adjunct to the proper

00:03:39.055 --> 00:03:42.960 align:middle line:84%
supplementation like safe
antibiotics and what have you--

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.850 align:middle line:84%
natural antibiotics,
I should say.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, let's go into
Lakhovsky's device and a couple

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.340 align:middle line:90%
others too.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.380 align:middle line:90%
What's been out there?

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.260 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: So the Lord
Baltimore was a big hit.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at the wave
form of the Lord Baltimore,

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.250 align:middle line:84%
it's identical to devices today
that are still efficacious.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now, tell us who
Lord Baltimore is and what

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.910 align:middle line:90%
the device is.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.813 align:middle line:84%
It's under electrical
healing devices.

00:04:03.813 --> 00:04:05.730 align:middle line:84%
There's not much you can
find on the internet.

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: You would hold
two stainless steel handles

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:08.660 align:middle line:90%
in your hand.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.237 align:middle line:84%
And they would put this similar
wave form through the body.

00:04:12.237 --> 00:04:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And they got good results
with that as well.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.649 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Well, people
get results from Hulda

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:18.170 align:middle line:10%
Clark's little bug device.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.570 align:middle line:10%
>> STREETER: The Zapper.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:19.945 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: The
little bug zapper.

00:04:19.945 --> 00:04:20.880 align:middle line:10%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.029 align:middle line:10%
It's the same thing.

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.350 align:middle line:10%
>> STREETER: They're great.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.000 align:middle line:10%
But they just take forever.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.320 align:middle line:10%
That's the problem.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.350 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: I have one
that's put in a cigar box.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.375 align:middle line:84%
Someone wired one
up in a cigar box.

00:04:27.375 --> 00:04:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And I just put the little
copper handles back

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.270 align:middle line:90%
in the cigar box when I use it.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.960 align:middle line:84%
And even though it's only
operating like, nine volts

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.880 align:middle line:90%
or something, it actually can.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.400 align:middle line:84%
Like at the first sign
of a cold or something,

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.160 align:middle line:84%
go through and
shift your body just

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.470 align:middle line:84%
enough electrically
in the charge so

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.970 align:middle line:84%
that you can kind of prevent
going any further in it.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:46.770 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Sure.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.990 align:middle line:84%
They're alkalizing, which
is their primary focus,

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.040 align:middle line:90%
and they're ionizing.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.098 align:middle line:90%
So ions are antioxidants.

00:04:52.098 --> 00:04:54.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's talk
about Lord Baltimore's device,

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.547 align:middle line:84%
which is more efficacious
than the bug zapper.

00:04:56.547 --> 00:04:57.630 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Well, no, no.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.043 align:middle line:90%
I didn't say that.

00:04:59.043 --> 00:05:00.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You said it
takes longer, actually.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:01.140 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Yeah.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.940 align:middle line:90%
It takes longer.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.570 align:middle line:84%
All of those devices
are fantastic.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.080 align:middle line:84%
But imagine if you had to go
back to California on a horse.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:07.945 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: You
could get there.

00:05:07.945 --> 00:05:08.970 align:middle line:90%
But it wouldn't be idea.

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:09.780 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't be efficient.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:10.580 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.595 align:middle line:90%


00:05:10.595 --> 00:05:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So Lord Baltimore's
device was very similar.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.890 align:middle line:84%
So it put this charge
through your body.

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And you say it
alkalized the body.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:17.010 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Mm hm.

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.760 align:middle line:90%
And there was ionizing.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And ionizing as well.

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:19.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:20.610 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: But what's
fascinating is the wave form.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.277 align:middle line:84%
We've actually looked
in the laboratory,

00:05:22.277 --> 00:05:24.450 align:middle line:84%
and it's identical to
modern scanner devices

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:25.915 align:middle line:90%
and certain PEMF machines.

00:05:25.915 --> 00:05:27.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So he had
already done that.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.580 align:middle line:90%
And what was his era?

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.220 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: That was in
the late 1800s as well.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So 120, 30 years
ago, these things were already

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:35.430 align:middle line:90%
happening.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.820 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Right.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.350 align:middle line:84%
But by the '30s
they were beginning

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.840 align:middle line:84%
to be under the
watchful eye of the AMA.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And the Rockefellers and big oil
and big pharma saw the threat

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.000 align:middle line:84%
and put the kibosh on
the energy medicine--

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.757 align:middle line:84%
the original movement--
very quickly.

00:05:48.757 --> 00:05:51.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Dinshaw, all his
beautiful color healing that

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.270 align:middle line:84%
was being adopted into
hospitals successfully with burn

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.150 align:middle line:84%
patients, in psychiatric
wards for people.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.260 align:middle line:90%
Rife and his technology.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.490 align:middle line:84%
He was driven to becoming
essentially a penniless

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.770 align:middle line:90%
drunkard when it was all over.

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.490 align:middle line:10%
This brilliant, brilliant human
being witch-hunted because he

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.500 align:middle line:10%
was curing cancer in the day.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.880 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: That's right.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean,
does that drive you?

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:19.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it really ticks
me off that these people

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.260 align:middle line:84%
have gotten away
with suppressing

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.740 align:middle line:84%
these technologies that served
humanity for all these years.

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, does any kind
of anger in that area

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.420 align:middle line:90%
drive you at all to--

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Absolutely.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --get it forward
again, because it does me.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.400 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Well, if everyone
remembers my story from

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.520 align:middle line:84%
the first episode, I really
have struggled with my health.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm grateful for anything
that can assist that.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:41.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:44.342 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: And to withhold
those from the public is a sin.

00:06:44.342 --> 00:06:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is a sin.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.890 align:middle line:90%
It's truly a sin, in my opinion.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.320 align:middle line:84%
So meanwhile, there
is all this genius

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.700 align:middle line:84%
that has been given birth
to in this day and age.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.012 align:middle line:84%
People are remembering, if
they're not resurrecting.

00:06:54.012 --> 00:06:55.470 align:middle line:84%
They're even
remembering and adding

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.350 align:middle line:84%
on to the technologies
that existed in the past.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:01.860 align:middle line:84%
They're even more available,
more potent, than in the past.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk
about some of them.

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:04.770 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.265 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look at
the Tesla violet ray tube.

00:07:07.265 --> 00:07:08.390 align:middle line:90%
Is that what it was called?

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:09.190 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Mm hm.

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:13.800 align:middle line:84%
This one's from the 1930s from
the Master Electric Company.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.450 align:middle line:90%
And I do apologize.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:16.440 align:middle line:90%
It is broken.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.140 align:middle line:84%
But we can get an idea
of what it looks like

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.530 align:middle line:90%
and how you would use it.

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.400 align:middle line:90%
So this plugs into any 120 AC.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And then let's say that
you sprained your wrist.

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.440 align:middle line:84%
You would simply
apply it like this.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.873 align:middle line:90%
And it would be going--

00:07:29.873 --> 00:07:31.773 align:middle line:84%
[MECHANICAL NOISE]
--like a neon bulb.

00:07:31.773 --> 00:07:32.573 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:07:32.573 --> 00:07:33.280 align:middle line:90%
[BUZZING SOUND]

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:33.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.130 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: With
a beautiful color.

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:36.672 align:middle line:84%
You can actually
watch it on YouTube.

00:07:36.672 --> 00:07:37.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So it's violet.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:38.760 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Right.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.410 align:middle line:84%
It's a specific
frequency to create

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:43.120 align:middle line:84%
as much ozone as possible
and to oxygenate the area.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:43.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.695 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Antioxidant
capabilities.

00:07:45.695 --> 00:07:46.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And that was it.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:47.862 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: That was it.

00:07:47.862 --> 00:07:49.170 align:middle line:90%
I mean, great stories.

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:51.350 align:middle line:84%
You can read about them, because
they sold thousands of these.

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And you can still
see it on YouTube?

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:54.900 align:middle line:84%
Just look under
Tesla violet ray?

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:55.400 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Yeah.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:55.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:56.410 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:58.920 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: And then
WeirdStuff.CA is a store

00:07:58.920 --> 00:07:59.760 align:middle line:90%
in Canada.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:00.600 align:middle line:90%
They deal with this stuff.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.450 align:middle line:90%
They're really neat folks.

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:02.440 align:middle line:90%
So check them out.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:02.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: All right.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:03.740 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.350 align:middle line:84%
As people are looking at
this Tesla violet ray device,

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:08.580 align:middle line:90%
what did he do with it?

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:09.530 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it looks really simple.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:11.072 align:middle line:84%
It's little cords,
little light bulb.

00:08:11.072 --> 00:08:14.925 align:middle line:90%
What did it-- how did it work?

00:08:14.925 --> 00:08:17.050 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Well, again,
being an ozone generator,

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:20.670 align:middle line:84%
you're treating in a
generalized fashion.

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:24.630 align:middle line:10%
But some of the newer ones
that have piggybacked on that

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:27.620 align:middle line:10%
are things like the
GB4000, which is actually

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.840 align:middle line:10%
the most legitimate Rife
device that we have right now,

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:34.650 align:middle line:10%
in my experience in
the laboratory testing.

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:35.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:38.320 align:middle line:84%
You know this is interesting
in and of itself.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.919 align:middle line:84%
Now the recreation
of old technologies

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:44.250 align:middle line:84%
and refashioning them
into something new--

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:48.330 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that was so
significant about Rife's work

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.730 align:middle line:84%
is that he had the
universal scope where

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:55.740 align:middle line:84%
he could watch the effect
of his frequencies--

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:59.910 align:middle line:84%
his frequency generator-- on
the actual condition itself

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.260 align:middle line:90%
under a microscope.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.080 align:middle line:84%
So he could see
exactly what worked

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.840 align:middle line:84%
for tuberculosis or
any other condition,

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.060 align:middle line:90%
because he could witness it.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:12.660 align:middle line:84%
That technology is
more or less gone.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:16.507 align:middle line:84%
Now I know there are hints that
other people have recreated

00:09:16.507 --> 00:09:18.840 align:middle line:84%
the universal scope and the
prismatic lens and all that.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.350 align:middle line:84%
But for all functional purposes
it's not really out there.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:26.070 align:middle line:84%
So how do they align
these new technologies

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:29.970 align:middle line:84%
without the ability to
see in that refined sense

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:32.058 align:middle line:84%
the effect of the
technology on the pathogen?

00:09:32.058 --> 00:09:33.850 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Well,
that's a great question.

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is that Rife's
technology was targeted.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.767 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, it was
meant to kill a pathogen.

00:09:40.767 --> 00:09:42.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, like at 3.88543.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:42.900 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Right.

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.610 align:middle line:84%
But if you get the
wrong frequency,

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:45.810 align:middle line:90%
you're going to miss out.

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And I know patients who have
spent years and gone nowhere

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:49.740 align:middle line:90%
on Rife technology.

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's not because
it doesn't work.

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:53.250 align:middle line:84%
It's because they didn't
have the right specificity.

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:53.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:55.140 align:middle line:84%
So you talk about--
what is this?

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:56.080 align:middle line:90%
The GB4000, right?

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:56.880 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Right.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.310 align:middle line:84%
That's still in the same
vein as a targeted device.

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:02.310 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually
much more refined

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.440 align:middle line:90%
than the devices of the past.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.665 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Well, how so?

00:10:05.665 --> 00:10:07.540 align:middle line:84%
Because people are always
thrilled with Rife.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to go and
start looking this up as soon--

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.160 align:middle line:90%
probably right now.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.620 align:middle line:84%
They probably pause
right now and look it up.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:17.100 align:middle line:84%
Why is it any different in
efficacy than the past Rife

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.340 align:middle line:90%
devices of recent years?

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Well, the
antenna is more precise,

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:23.795 align:middle line:90%
and so is the amplifier.

00:10:23.795 --> 00:10:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And they've done a
lot with electronics

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:29.173 align:middle line:84%
in that time in terms of
potency and what have you.

00:10:29.173 --> 00:10:31.840 align:middle line:84%
But what I wanted to say is that
targeted devices are not really

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.240 align:middle line:90%
the way of the future.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:37.150 align:middle line:84%
Generalized healing devices
or devices that are ionizing

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:40.210 align:middle line:84%
or deliver either light
or PEMF to the body,

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:41.930 align:middle line:90%
that's where things are headed.

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:44.340 align:middle line:10%
So bathing the body
in a floodlight,

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:47.140 align:middle line:10%
rather than having to kill with
a laser beam, so to speak--

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:48.400 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: So an
exact frequency range.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:48.550 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Right.

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:50.080 align:middle line:84%
It's really a
better methodology.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.830 align:middle line:84%
It's just an evolution
of the state of the art.

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:55.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That makes sense.

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:57.550 align:middle line:84%
So any other devices
of the past that you'd

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:59.890 align:middle line:84%
like to bring into
the conversation that

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:01.120 align:middle line:90%
are now being perfected?

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:01.240 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Sure.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:01.880 align:middle line:90%
One that's fun.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:02.920 align:middle line:90%
Oh, this one isn't perfected.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.750 align:middle line:84%
But Cal Wickstrom did
some brilliant work

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:07.690 align:middle line:84%
with what's called the Wimshurst
Machine, which is actually

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:11.410 align:middle line:84%
still used at MIT and
other laboratories today.

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:13.930 align:middle line:90%
It's an electrostatic generator.

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:16.790 align:middle line:84%
But he used it for what he
called persuasive exorcism.

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:17.590 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh.

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:20.287 align:middle line:90%
What's-- what does that mean?

00:11:20.287 --> 00:11:22.870 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: There seems to be
an amazing occult focus in late

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:24.970 align:middle line:84%
1800s in spiritism,
spirituality--

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:25.770 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh yes.

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:26.290 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Spiritism rites.

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:26.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Seances.

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:26.810 align:middle line:90%
All of it.

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:27.610 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Right.

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:31.510 align:middle line:84%
So Wickstrom and his wife
would actually go and eliminate

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:32.630 align:middle line:90%
these demons or spirits--

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:34.255 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, they
were ghost busters.

00:11:34.255 --> 00:11:35.055 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Yeah.

00:11:35.055 --> 00:11:36.040 align:middle line:90%
With this technology.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.330 align:middle line:90%
With some success, I might add.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:39.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:41.950 align:middle line:84%
So are any of those original
devices still around?

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:46.944 align:middle line:84%
I know a couple of ghosts that
could be busted right now.

00:11:46.944 --> 00:11:48.500 align:middle line:90%
Is it still being used?

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.300 align:middle line:90%
Do you know?

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:49.620 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Oh sure.

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:50.420 align:middle line:90%
For sure.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.280 align:middle line:84%
But maybe not for the
spiritual purposes.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:52.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:53.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.300 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Then there was
Mesmer, who had a battery.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.890 align:middle line:84%
Actually, Mesmer's
work was mostly

00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:59.130 align:middle line:84%
with the battery
rather than hypnosis.

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:00.490 align:middle line:90%
That's little known.

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:02.860 align:middle line:84%
He would actually bring
the aristocracy from Europe

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:05.680 align:middle line:84%
to his home and actually
have them place their hands

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.040 align:middle line:90%
on the battery.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And there was so
many profound changes

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:11.950 align:middle line:84%
that he developed
a real following.

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And placing
their hands on that battery,

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.890 align:middle line:84%
how was that different from
having your little copper

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:20.950 align:middle line:84%
or steel rods hooked
up to the battery?

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:23.800 align:middle line:84%
Like in the bug box where you
have a little battery-operated

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.870 align:middle line:84%
device where the battery's
sending out a signal--

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:27.700 align:middle line:84%
9 volts or whatever--
like we talked about

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.128 align:middle line:90%
through the bug zapper.

00:12:29.128 --> 00:12:31.670 align:middle line:84%
How is it different than putting
their hands on this battery?

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:33.010 align:middle line:90%
What did it do?

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:34.540 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: I think it was
more of a grounding thing,

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:36.370 align:middle line:84%
because it's really
not a proper circuit.

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:36.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:37.520 align:middle line:90%
I was going to say--

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:38.530 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't see.

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:40.430 align:middle line:84%
So the value is in
grounding energy?

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:41.230 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Yeah.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think there was
some placebo going on.

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:45.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:46.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:46.550 align:middle line:90%
Got ya'.

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:48.340 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: If the Count and
the Countess are getting good

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.470 align:middle line:84%
results, than the peasants
would love to follow, right?

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:50.890 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:51.210 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:52.050 align:middle line:90%
Gotcha.

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:52.850 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:55.470 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, so there was some
suggestion in there as well.

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:56.270 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:58.335 align:middle line:90%
Any more of these devices?

00:12:58.335 --> 00:12:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: That's
pretty much--

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:01.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They're just kind
of fun little tidbits from

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:01.690 align:middle line:90%
the past.

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:01.810 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Yeah.

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:02.610 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And again, the circle of
history-- here we go again,

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:05.120 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.662 align:middle line:84%
With the internet
and with the advent

00:13:06.662 --> 00:13:09.220 align:middle line:84%
of micro and
nanotechnologies we're

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.310 align:middle line:84%
able to make these devices
smaller and cheaper

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:13.060 align:middle line:84%
and get them into the
hands of more people

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:15.790 align:middle line:84%
and really be able to
study the efficacy of them

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:20.050 align:middle line:84%
and be able to throw away the
ones that are more snake oil

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:21.820 align:middle line:90%
than true science.

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:22.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that's
really beautiful about what's

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.700 align:middle line:84%
being offered
today is the number

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:32.140 align:middle line:84%
of devices that have
the ability to diagnose.

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:32.940 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Right.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:34.230 align:middle line:90%
We're heavily down that road.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:35.980 align:middle line:84%
We feel like we're at
the tip of the spear

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:37.300 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to biohacking.

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And we don't use
the diagnostic word.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.540 align:middle line:90%
We use testing and assessment.

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:42.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes,
testing and assessment.

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:45.370 align:middle line:84%
Because the biggest
problem is that when

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:48.850 align:middle line:84%
someone ends up in a state
and ends up in the hospital,

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:52.990 align:middle line:84%
they do not have
the proper matrix

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:55.810 align:middle line:84%
for evaluating what's up with
someone, for the most part.

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:56.650 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Well,
when you call your--

00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:58.233 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They can
look at one thing,

00:13:58.233 --> 00:14:01.090 align:middle line:84%
like your blood or maybe
your oxygen levels.

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:03.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really simple
stuff that does not even

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:04.945 align:middle line:84%
begin to dig down to
what inspired the event.

00:14:04.945 --> 00:14:07.487 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Well, when you call
a lumberjack to be your auto

00:14:07.487 --> 00:14:08.770 align:middle line:90%
mechanic, you have a problem.

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:09.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's more or
less what's happening

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.695 align:middle line:84%
when people are admitted to
the hospital with the quote--

00:14:13.695 --> 00:14:16.180 align:middle line:84%
all these sophisticated--
I mean, what can you get?

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.140 align:middle line:90%
An MRI?

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.780 align:middle line:84%
But beyond that, these
other technologies

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:24.880 align:middle line:84%
that are out there now
are much more refined.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.040 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
hospitals don't appear

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.170 align:middle line:90%
to be adopting any of them.

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:31.420 align:middle line:84%
Are there hospitals
that are now starting

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:34.120 align:middle line:84%
to bring in some of
these diagnostic devices?

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.950 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Well, it is
encouraging to see the overlap

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:41.710 align:middle line:84%
now between big biotech from the
big pharma corporations and big

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:44.800 align:middle line:84%
medicine moving in the
direction of energy medicine.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.390 align:middle line:84%
For example, heart
rate variability

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:47.750 align:middle line:90%
is now widely accepted.

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:48.795 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:14:48.795 --> 00:14:50.170 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER:
Certain frequencies,

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:52.330 align:middle line:90%
specific micro currents.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm encouraged to see PT
clinics using laser therapy

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:57.880 align:middle line:84%
and EMF now, finally, even
though the reimbursement is

00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:58.862 align:middle line:90%
poor.

00:14:58.862 --> 00:15:00.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Well, that's good.

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:01.330 align:middle line:90%
So the answer is yes.

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:02.483 align:middle line:90%
It is starting, slowly.

00:15:02.483 --> 00:15:03.400 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: For sure.

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.330 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:07.210 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
first about diagnostics,

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:10.750 align:middle line:84%
because part of the
problem is we usually

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:16.190 align:middle line:84%
can't trace back to the origins
of what any particular disease

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:19.240 align:middle line:84%
is going on in our
body, because they're

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.560 align:middle line:90%
kind of multi-layers of it.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.390 align:middle line:84%
It's almost
multidimensional in nature.

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:24.390 align:middle line:84%
You get into the
mind/body connection,

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:28.630 align:middle line:84%
its effect on what some call the
etheric body, which goes deeper

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:32.710 align:middle line:84%
into material expression
in the physical body.

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:37.520 align:middle line:84%
Yet some of these devices
can actually detect that.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.320 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Right.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.635 align:middle line:90%
It's really fascinating.

00:15:39.635 --> 00:15:41.510 align:middle line:84%
You could begin in a
lot of different places.

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:42.700 align:middle line:84%
But let's start
with the ONDAMED,

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:45.280 align:middle line:84%
for example, from Germany,
which is a brilliant device that

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:48.460 align:middle line:84%
actually tests the
heart rate, looking

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:51.610 align:middle line:84%
for an exact match for
a specific pathogen

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:54.230 align:middle line:84%
perhaps, or organ
function, or what have you.

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And then we can get into
holographic AI technologies

00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:00.550 align:middle line:84%
like the NuVision where
we can test for 130,000

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:03.640 align:middle line:90%
items and instantaneously.

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.650 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly
is that layering

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:06.760 align:middle line:90%
that you just mentioned.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.260 align:middle line:84%
We're not just
dealing in 3D, we're

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.170 align:middle line:84%
dealing in fourth and fifth
dimension and past lives

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:12.290 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And it does sound
kind of woo woo.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.170 align:middle line:84%
But the science behind
it is really stunning.

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And when you see the connection
when you talk to the patient

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:22.010 align:middle line:90%
and say, wow.

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:24.080 align:middle line:90%
They say, how did you know that?

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:24.880 align:middle line:90%
This happens a lot.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.213 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's dive into
one of those technologies,

00:16:27.213 --> 00:16:30.070 align:middle line:84%
that seeing you on a
multidimensional level

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:32.950 align:middle line:84%
extending into your own history,
which is all encompassed within

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:33.920 align:middle line:90%
the field.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.120 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Mm hm.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.240 align:middle line:84%
So an example would
be with NuVision

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:41.260 align:middle line:84%
we had a doubting
Nebraskan rancher who

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.510 align:middle line:84%
sat there in the corner with
his arms folded and said,

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:44.930 align:middle line:90%
this is hippie stuff.

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And I can't believe
I'm paying for it.

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:49.540 align:middle line:90%
NuVision said, loud explosion.

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:51.390 align:middle line:90%
Loss of digits.

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And he unfolded his
arms, and he said,

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.690 align:middle line:84%
I lost three fingers in Vietnam
when a hand grenade went off

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:56.490 align:middle line:90%
in my hand.

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:58.970 align:middle line:84%
So I will shut up and listen
to your vision right now.

00:16:58.970 --> 00:16:59.770 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Really?

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:00.790 align:middle line:90%
Seriously.

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:03.032 align:middle line:90%
So it shows to that degree.

00:17:03.032 --> 00:17:03.832 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Right.

00:17:03.832 --> 00:17:04.632 align:middle line:90%
It's astounding.

00:17:04.632 --> 00:17:07.510 align:middle line:84%
It's really spiritual
at a certain level,

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:09.700 align:middle line:90%
for lack of a better word.

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:12.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so give us a
couple of examples that would

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:17.200 align:middle line:84%
extend into other lifetimes that
particular imbalance or defect

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.490 align:middle line:90%
was brought forward from.

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:18.940 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Yeah.

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:19.740 align:middle line:90%
That's a good one.

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:24.130 align:middle line:84%
We've had a number of people who
were pursuing goals financially

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:27.730 align:middle line:84%
that really didn't
resonate with their heart.

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And what came up for them was
past lives, healer qualities,

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:34.750 align:middle line:90%
or past lives you were a shaman.

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And one of them began
to cry and realize

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:42.408 align:middle line:84%
that she wasn't living
out her purpose,

00:17:42.408 --> 00:17:44.450 align:middle line:84%
that she was supposed to
be a healer, cause she--

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:45.742 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And that literally--

00:17:45.742 --> 00:17:47.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the readout will
show you that specific?

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:48.590 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Mm hm.

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And this was over and
over again for her.

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:53.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So talk about what
it's reading and how it's doing

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:54.400 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.980 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Well, each
of us has an IP address,

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:59.410 align:middle line:84%
just like the phone
or the laptop.

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:01.060 align:middle line:90%
And we are a hologram.

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:07.270 align:middle line:84%
And we can be read by technology
that's high enough to do that,

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:09.967 align:middle line:84%
with an astounding
amount of accuracy.

00:18:09.967 --> 00:18:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's
talk about the inventors

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.228 align:middle line:90%
of the technology.

00:18:13.228 --> 00:18:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: One of the top
people who worked for DARPA

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:18.332 align:middle line:90%
left to create the technology.

00:18:18.332 --> 00:18:19.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well,
that's intriguing.

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:19.945 align:middle line:90%


00:18:19.945 --> 00:18:20.100 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Yeah.

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's
talk about that.

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:22.780 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: So it's not
all about dark things.

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:25.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We're going to talk
about the dark and the light

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:26.810 align:middle line:90%
of these.

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:30.670 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at how DARPA
might have been able to use

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:32.020 align:middle line:90%
that kind of technology.

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And then let's talk
about how this man came

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:36.760 align:middle line:84%
forward and decided to
use it the way he did.

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:41.290 align:middle line:10%
>> STREETER: Well, kind of in
a radionic fashion it would be

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:45.730 align:middle line:10%
possible to use the
NuVision in a nefarious way.

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:47.450 align:middle line:10%
We haven't necessarily
seen that yet.

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:51.490 align:middle line:84%
But we do have the capacity to
broadcast healing frequencies

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:54.940 align:middle line:84%
to people, like homeopathics
and herbs and good intentions

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:56.030 align:middle line:90%
and what have you.

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:59.500 align:middle line:84%
So theoretically it would
be possible to do that.

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:02.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, and it
has often been said that

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:05.180 align:middle line:84%
there's great knowledge
waiting for humanity,

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:07.960 align:middle line:84%
whether it's under the right
paw of the Sphinx or whether

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:10.990 align:middle line:84%
it's 100 yards and 100 feet
under the ground from the Great

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:15.760 align:middle line:84%
Pyramid, or somewhere in the
Yucatan that there are vaults

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:19.690 align:middle line:84%
of future knowledge
waiting to be remembered,

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:22.750 align:middle line:84%
waiting to be revealed to
us once there is a level

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:25.880 align:middle line:90%
of maturity in our own thinking.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why I ask about
the dark and the light of it,

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:31.060 align:middle line:84%
because I think everyone
watching this show

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:35.590 align:middle line:84%
understands that and is
also saddened by the fact

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:38.830 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of the highest, most
refined, beautiful technologies

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:42.170 align:middle line:84%
have been sequestered by the
military industrial complex.

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:45.250 align:middle line:84%
And that they're 50 to 100
years ahead in application

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:47.013 align:middle line:84%
and not always in
our best interest.

00:19:47.013 --> 00:19:49.180 align:middle line:10%
>> STREETER: Well, the
difference now is if you look

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:50.680 align:middle line:10%
at our great
grandparents, perhaps,

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.830 align:middle line:10%
they had many less vectors
than we have to deal with.

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:54.630 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:55.120 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.245 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Food was food.

00:19:56.245 --> 00:19:58.480 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't organic and
GMO and garbage food.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.050 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It was in the garden.

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And you went and you put
your scraps out there.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: They
didn't have chem trails.

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:03.850 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have EMFs.

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:06.190 align:middle line:84%
So although they didn't
have the medical technology

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:08.710 align:middle line:84%
that we have, they didn't
have as many vectors.

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:09.760 align:middle line:90%
But here's the good news.

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.370 align:middle line:84%
We have all of
these extra vectors,

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:16.260 align:middle line:84%
but we also have a solution,
theoretically, to each of them.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:17.060 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:18.310 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that is the good news.

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:22.450 align:middle line:84%
So this man that developed the
NuVision, what was he doing?

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:24.390 align:middle line:84%
Cause now I'm going
down that rabbit hole.

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:26.500 align:middle line:84%
So what was he originally
doing with DARPA?

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And what inspired him
to do the NuVision?

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And what was his
technological area

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.310 align:middle line:84%
of expertise that
allowed him to even

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:39.190 align:middle line:84%
be able to essentially develop
a multi-dimensional kind

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:41.320 align:middle line:90%
of imbalance detection device?

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.520 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Well, they're
a little vague about it.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:43.895 align:middle line:84%
But it's my
understanding that he

00:20:43.895 --> 00:20:46.450 align:middle line:84%
was a leader in
holographic AI technology,

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:51.190 align:middle line:84%
and wanted to use it
for positive purposes.

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And then he teamed
up with a team here--

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:56.050 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Gwen Foster and
others here in Boulder.

00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:58.655 align:middle line:84%
It's based on Hanna
Kroeger's database.

00:20:58.655 --> 00:21:00.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Tell us
about Hanna Kroeger.

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.430 align:middle line:10%
>> STREETER: Hanna was a real
feisty German woman who changed

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:05.000 align:middle line:10%
medicine forever in America.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.360 align:middle line:10%
She basically brought
the German new medicine

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.940 align:middle line:10%
or the German methodology here.

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And her great contribution is
the documentation of everything

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:15.940 align:middle line:84%
that she could
get her hands on--

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:19.668 align:middle line:84%
every homeopathic, every herb,
every nutritional supplement.

00:21:19.668 --> 00:21:21.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: She created
an organic database.

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:22.030 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Right.

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:23.600 align:middle line:84%
Huge notebooks
and what have you.

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.210 align:middle line:84%
So all that's been
put into NuVision.

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:28.060 align:middle line:84%
But it's not
limited to her work.

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:31.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The data is across
all platforms of emotions.

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:32.710 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Right.

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:34.510 align:middle line:84%
There's Dr. Hamer's
work from Germany

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:37.240 align:middle line:84%
with head trauma and head
space and what have you,

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:41.410 align:middle line:84%
and how the brain can affect the
organs and mood and you know--

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:43.420 align:middle line:84%
I fell off the
swings when I was 12

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:48.370 align:middle line:84%
and hit this spot of my brain
that deals with being happy.

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm depressed
all the time.

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:50.650 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:52.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just being able
to suss those things out

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:54.675 align:middle line:90%
for people is so life-changing.

00:21:54.675 --> 00:21:56.050 align:middle line:84%
So now they have
a reason, right?

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:57.040 align:middle line:90%
They know.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.907 align:middle line:84%
And we can't manage
what we don't measure.

00:21:58.907 --> 00:22:00.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This is
really encouraging,

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:01.823 align:middle line:90%
and it's fun for people as well.

00:22:01.823 --> 00:22:05.740 align:middle line:84%
We like to hear about surprising
stories and success stories.

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:08.350 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about a few
stories of NuVision

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:11.600 align:middle line:84%
where really someone thought
they came in for one thing,

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.260 align:middle line:84%
but there was something
entirely else going on.

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And where maybe it
even could've been

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:20.510 align:middle line:84%
a game changer or a lifesaver
to have this detected.

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:22.820 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: We had a little
girl from the Philippines.

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:24.520 align:middle line:84%
Some really strange
things-- readings--

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:29.540 align:middle line:84%
came up with bad
experience with older man.

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:30.340 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And so the family started
thinking the worst, right?

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:34.940 align:middle line:90%
So we started digging deeper.

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was she
actually had a tooth pulled

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:42.910 align:middle line:84%
outdoors in the Philippines
when she was 8 or 9, I believe.

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor was standing
on top of the chair

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:47.710 align:middle line:84%
and using a pair of pliers
and pulling the tooth out

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:49.690 align:middle line:90%
with no anesthesia.

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:52.000 align:middle line:84%
So what everyone thought
was the worst of the worst

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.980 align:middle line:84%
was actually a
dentist just trying

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:55.710 align:middle line:84%
to do his job in a
jungle situation.

00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:57.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: In a
jungle situation.

00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:57.790 align:middle line:90%
It was painful.

00:22:57.790 --> 00:22:58.640 align:middle line:90%
And she was scared.

00:22:58.640 --> 00:22:59.200 align:middle line:90%
And it was traumatic.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.330 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: But the Western
doctors got a hold of her

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:02.705 align:middle line:84%
and really made
a mess of things.

00:23:02.705 --> 00:23:05.410 align:middle line:84%
But with NuVision we were able
to sort it out and put her

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:06.493 align:middle line:90%
on a natural antipathogen.

00:23:06.493 --> 00:23:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So tell us about what
had happened with the Western

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:09.610 align:middle line:90%
doctors.

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:12.440 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Well, she was
close to having a stroke.

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:13.330 align:middle line:90%
And so they--

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:13.910 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Little girl?

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:14.710 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Yeah.

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:17.170 align:middle line:84%
Because the infection in
the jaw from the tooth

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:19.150 align:middle line:84%
actually occluded
blood flow to the brain

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:20.890 align:middle line:84%
and created an
infection up there

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:23.380 align:middle line:84%
that wasn't able
to drain properly.

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:26.587 align:middle line:84%
So using our methods, we
were able to bring her back.

00:23:26.587 --> 00:23:27.670 align:middle line:90%
And she's doing great now.

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:30.773 align:middle line:90%
And the family is ecstatic.

00:23:30.773 --> 00:23:31.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's beautiful.

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:33.310 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: And I got
to see her in September.

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:34.110 align:middle line:90%
So that was nice.

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:35.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so
she's on the mend.

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:36.460 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Yeah.

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:36.880 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:38.172 align:middle line:90%
A couple more of these, please.

00:23:38.172 --> 00:23:39.080 align:middle line:90%
We love these.

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:39.880 align:middle line:90%
I love these.

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.270 align:middle line:90%
We love these stories.

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:43.312 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Well, I'll
give you an animal story.

00:23:43.312 --> 00:23:45.320 align:middle line:84%
We had a golden retriever
who's getting old.

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.300 align:middle line:90%
His name is Kit Carson.

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:49.405 align:middle line:84%
And Kit had an infection and
went through the NuVision.

00:23:49.405 --> 00:23:51.280 align:middle line:84%
And they were able to
determine a whole bunch

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:54.970 align:middle line:84%
of different things that
were going on with him.

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:56.380 align:middle line:90%
He's doing great now.

00:23:56.380 --> 00:24:00.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So NuVision doesn't
have any prejudice between

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:01.530 align:middle line:90%
species.

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:03.220 align:middle line:84%
It can read a dog
like it can read--

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.260 align:middle line:84%
Did it say anything
about his past lives?

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:08.460 align:middle line:90%


00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:11.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are all the movies
out right now about dogs--

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:14.530 align:middle line:84%
a dog's purpose and a dog's
journey and dogs' past lives.

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And I personally believe
they do have past lives.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:19.820 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's not exactly
the same as it is with us.

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:22.060 align:middle line:84%
But I was kind of
joking and kind of not.

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:23.904 align:middle line:84%
It was reading
him also on a kind

00:24:23.904 --> 00:24:26.321 align:middle line:84%
of a multidimensional level
and emotionally and everything

00:24:26.321 --> 00:24:26.550 align:middle line:90%
as well?

00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:26.576 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Yeah.

00:24:26.576 --> 00:24:28.090 align:middle line:84%
But we were more
focused on the 3D

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:30.020 align:middle line:84%
for him because of
the serious infection.

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't really
recall the past life stuff.

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So have any
veterinary clinics,

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:38.290 align:middle line:84%
for example, adopted
this technology?

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:41.330 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Well, most of the
vets tend to be Western trained

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:43.040 align:middle line:90%
in that drug model.

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:45.280 align:middle line:84%
But there are some
progressive folks around here

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:48.208 align:middle line:84%
who are getting into
CBD and carbon 60.

00:24:48.208 --> 00:24:50.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we're going
to get all that in a minute.

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: And laser therapies
and PEMF and seeing incredible

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:54.260 align:middle line:90%
results with animals.

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.260 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What happens
when people come to you?

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:59.080 align:middle line:84%
Obviously a lot of them have
already been to medical doctors

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:02.380 align:middle line:84%
and have been either not
diagnosed or misdiagnosed.

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And they end up with
NuVision Technology.

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And it shows them a different
spectrum of causal effect

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:11.050 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:12.520 align:middle line:90%
What happens after that?

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Do they go back to their
doctors and say, hey,

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:17.590 align:middle line:84%
does anyone honor that
information outside

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:19.970 align:middle line:84%
of the alternative
healing community?

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:22.370 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: I'd say the
naturopaths and the osteopaths

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:23.830 align:middle line:84%
and chiros tend
to be open to it.

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:24.630 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:25.610 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:27.652 align:middle line:84%
So there's starting to be
a melding a little bit.

00:25:27.652 --> 00:25:30.068 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: But you know, too
many cooks spoil the broth.

00:25:30.068 --> 00:25:31.220 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:32.840 align:middle line:90%
So I tell people, look.

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:34.130 align:middle line:90%
You've been to 20 people.

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:35.510 align:middle line:90%
And it's failed.

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:38.310 align:middle line:84%
If you trust me, we
can make this happen.

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:40.550 align:middle line:84%
But if you're going to have
one foot in both camps,

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:42.000 align:middle line:90%
I really can't help you.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.370 align:middle line:90%
There's exceptions, of course.

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:45.870 align:middle line:84%
But like if you think you're
going to do chemo and radiation

00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:48.340 align:middle line:84%
and then do our Nanoxide
and do our PEMF, which

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:51.920 align:middle line:84%
are anti-cancer, and you're
going to beat the cancer,

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.980 align:middle line:84%
you're not stacking
the deck in your favor.

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:55.380 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm hm.

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:59.030 align:middle line:84%
But then that puts the
burden of the responsibility

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:02.960 align:middle line:84%
for correctly
assessing the situation

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.487 align:middle line:90%
and for treatment in your hands.

00:26:05.487 --> 00:26:07.320 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Well, we
don't diagnose, treat,

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:08.710 align:middle line:84%
or cure any disease
or condition, right?

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.670 align:middle line:84%
You just help balance
things after you

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:11.750 align:middle line:90%
see what a readout says.

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:12.050 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: We're eliminating
the things that need to be

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:16.940 align:middle line:84%
eliminated and we're introducing
the things that are lacking,

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:18.410 align:middle line:90%
typically voltage and light.

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:18.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:19.310 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:20.780 align:middle line:84%
So you're talking
about things that

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:22.580 align:middle line:90%
are more ubiquitous in nature.

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:24.530 align:middle line:84%
So you're flooding
the body with--

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:26.670 align:middle line:84%
the entire system--
with a frequency range,

00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:28.425 align:middle line:84%
for example, rather
than the targeted one

00:26:28.425 --> 00:26:29.300 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about.

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:29.810 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Right.

00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:31.893 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And then you're
eliminating the toxins.

00:26:31.893 --> 00:26:34.040 align:middle line:84%
And I assume detox is
part of the problem--

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.910 align:middle line:84%
part of the solution a
lot of times as well.

00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:36.710 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Well, one of the
new focuses now is 50% detox

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:42.490 align:middle line:90%
and 50% regeneration.

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:43.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:45.748 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: So what we remove
is just as important at this

00:26:45.748 --> 00:26:48.830 align:middle line:84%
point because of all these
vectors that we spoke about.

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:51.050 align:middle line:84%
For example, on
NuVision it's about 100%

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:53.810 align:middle line:90%
of folks have mercury toxicity.

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:56.448 align:middle line:84%
About 100% have Lyme, like
we talked about last time.

00:26:56.448 --> 00:26:57.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What about aluminum?

00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:58.010 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Aluminum.

00:26:58.010 --> 00:26:58.430 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:58.430 --> 00:26:59.240 align:middle line:90%
And barium.

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:00.260 align:middle line:90%
Strontium.

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Everything in the
chem trails/ contrails both.

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:04.773 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:04.773 --> 00:27:07.190 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: So the other thing
with NuVision is we can do

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:09.560 align:middle line:84%
demographic studies, which
could be really important for us

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:10.360 align:middle line:90%
moving forward.

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.830 align:middle line:84%
Imagine one in every country
and being able to test people

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:14.247 align:middle line:84%
and being able to
say, oh, there's

00:27:14.247 --> 00:27:16.130 align:middle line:84%
an Ebola outbreak in
the Sudan right now.

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And have it be verifiable
with the device, right,

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:21.750 align:middle line:84%
and then verifiable with
blood work and what have you.

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:22.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:23.600 align:middle line:90%
That's really important.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.710 align:middle line:90%
I was listening recently.

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:26.240 align:middle line:84%
I did a little
piece on my own site

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:29.880 align:middle line:84%
on essentially very
gentle and affordable ways

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:33.470 align:middle line:84%
starting to detox from
aluminum toxicity in the body.

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And Klinghardt-- Dr. Klinghardt,
Dietrich Klinghardt--

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:40.880 align:middle line:84%
was saying that in his American
patients in the studies

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:45.052 align:middle line:84%
they've done, that virtually
100% have aluminum toxicity.

00:27:45.052 --> 00:27:46.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's the same
thing you're finding.

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:48.560 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: I would
corroborate that.

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:51.020 align:middle line:84%
But the good news is we
have easy, inexpensive ways

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:52.070 align:middle line:90%
to remove that now.

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:52.520 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.560 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: It's not
a $3,000 IV procedure

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:55.900 align:middle line:90%
at the doctor's office anymore.

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:56.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, it's not.

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:58.670 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: We have
EDTA suppositories

00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:01.010 align:middle line:84%
and under-the-tongue
sublingual that are inexpensive

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:02.600 align:middle line:90%
and incredibly effective.

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:05.973 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we can start with
simple things like citric acid.

00:28:05.973 --> 00:28:06.890 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Cilantro.

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:07.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Cilantro.

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:08.010 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Algae.

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:08.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:09.320 align:middle line:90%
And algae.

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:11.390 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: And even
carbon 60 is a chelator.

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:11.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:14.282 align:middle line:84%
And they start to chelate
these things out of the body,

00:28:14.282 --> 00:28:16.310 align:middle line:90%
because we cannot escape them.

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And so when someone
comes to you and you

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.630 align:middle line:84%
start seeing the
array of imbalances

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:25.100 align:middle line:84%
through the detection device,
you start with these protocols

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:27.410 align:middle line:84%
first-- with the
detoxing protocols

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:31.217 align:middle line:84%
dependent on what is showing up
in dominance in their bodies.

00:28:31.217 --> 00:28:33.800 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Well, we typically
focus on the infectious agents

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:35.810 align:middle line:84%
first, because they're
more aggressive.

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:36.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:36.410 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Right.

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:37.700 align:middle line:90%
You remember pleomorphism.

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:38.090 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:40.257 align:middle line:10%
>> STREETER: From Gunther
Enderlein and all of those

00:28:40.257 --> 00:28:42.750 align:middle line:10%
fantastic guys that we didn't
get a chance to talk about.

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:43.640 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:44.170 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:44.970 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:46.760 align:middle line:84%
All those amazing
people who discovered

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:50.600 align:middle line:84%
that these pathogens are
changing their state in order

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:53.660 align:middle line:84%
to survive, just like any
smart entity would do.

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:54.600 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:55.400 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:57.000 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: That's
the priority.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.940 align:middle line:84%
Once we get the
pathogens under control

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:00.680 align:middle line:84%
and get the body
alkalized to a point

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.180 align:middle line:84%
where they can deal
with it, then we

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:05.480 align:middle line:84%
begin to look at metals,
plastics, xenoestrogens,

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:08.795 align:middle line:84%
pesticides, basically
the toxicity matrix

00:29:08.795 --> 00:29:09.920 align:middle line:90%
that we like to talk about.

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:13.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, colon therapy is
an integral part of that.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:13.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:14.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I would think so.

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:15.640 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:20.040 align:middle line:84%
So you'll go after the bacteria
or the viral infection first.

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:20.840 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Right.

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:22.730 align:middle line:84%
But pathogens is a
big umbrella now.

00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:22.940 align:middle line:90%


00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:23.150 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:23.950 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:26.620 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Mycoplasms,
prions, et cetera.

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:29.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you deal with
the infectious pathogens first,

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:30.350 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:33.225 align:middle line:90%
What about molds, for example?

00:29:33.225 --> 00:29:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Well,
they're a tough one.

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:37.610 align:middle line:84%
But they do respond
well to nanosilvers,

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:41.510 align:middle line:84%
especially oxygenated ones like
nanoxide, turpentine therapy,

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:45.140 align:middle line:84%
like we talked about last time,
which people should look up Dr.

00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:47.433 align:middle line:90%
Jennifer Daniels on YouTube.

00:29:47.433 --> 00:29:49.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What about
fungal infections?

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:49.790 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Same.

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:50.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Same.

00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:51.010 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Yeah.

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And are these fairly
common in our bodies right now?

00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:55.220 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Yeah.

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:57.620 align:middle line:84%
There seems to be
a Candida problem

00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:01.710 align:middle line:84%
with probably over 80%,
90% of people as well.

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:03.360 align:middle line:84%
But Candida is
necessary for life.

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:06.150 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: So it's
a very fine line.

00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's much more
important to think

00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:10.620 align:middle line:84%
about changing the terrain
rather than targeting

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:12.685 align:middle line:84%
a specific pathogen
for elimination.

00:30:12.685 --> 00:30:13.560 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:13.777 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:13.777 --> 00:30:13.850 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:14.680 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.138 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Cause if we're
alkaline, they'll just die off.

00:30:17.138 --> 00:30:21.070 align:middle line:84%
Or through pleomorphism they'll
change into something harmless.

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:22.900 align:middle line:84%
Like a harmful Candida
becoming the one

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:24.410 align:middle line:90%
that we need for digestion.

00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:25.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:27.160 align:middle line:84%
So how would you
guide people, then,

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:31.870 align:middle line:84%
to start detoxing the
harmful Candida while leaving

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:33.288 align:middle line:90%
intact the healthy Candida.

00:30:33.288 --> 00:30:34.330 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Well, most--

00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:34.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Since
we're on the topic.

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Most people
are way too acidic.

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:37.300 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm hm.

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:39.940 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: And most people are
on the classic American diet.

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:40.630 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:41.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:44.080 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Heavy in cheeses
and grains and meats and coffee

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:47.290 align:middle line:84%
and alcohol and all these
things that are just completely

00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:48.200 align:middle line:90%
acidifying, right?

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.500 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: And they wonder
why they have all these disease

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:54.230 align:middle line:84%
states, particularly joint pain
and arthritis and what have

00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:55.030 align:middle line:90%
you.

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:55.475 align:middle line:90%
Unmotivated.

00:30:55.475 --> 00:30:56.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And it's shocking.

00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:56.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:56.970 --> 00:31:00.065 align:middle line:84%
And it's shocking how fast
those symptoms can be reversed.

00:31:00.065 --> 00:31:00.440 align:middle line:90%


00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:01.690 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Oh, it's amazing.

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:04.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean, I've done
this protocol a couple times

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.440 align:middle line:90%
now where I'll get too acidic.

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.430 align:middle line:90%
I'll be too American, you know.

00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:10.300 align:middle line:90%
Cause I love to bake.

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:11.290 align:middle line:90%
It's a thing.

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:13.060 align:middle line:84%
I just enjoy the
comfort and loveliness

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:14.547 align:middle line:90%
of baking for people.

00:31:14.547 --> 00:31:15.880 align:middle line:90%
So I like to make little things.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm getting
better in terms

00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:21.820 align:middle line:84%
of learning how to make
it low carb, paleo,

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:24.580 align:middle line:90%
gluten-free, friendly for all.

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:26.480 align:middle line:90%
Monk fruit instead of sugars.

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:27.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm learning all this.

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:29.497 align:middle line:84%
But along the way, if
I'm playing too much

00:31:29.497 --> 00:31:30.580 align:middle line:90%
I'll start getting acidic.

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:31.810 align:middle line:90%
And I can tell.

00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:34.840 align:middle line:84%
And I'll go on basically just a
kind of vegetable and vegetable

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:36.580 align:middle line:84%
juice diet, just keep
it really simple.

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:39.970 align:middle line:84%
Vegetable soup, vegetable
salads, vegetable juices.

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:42.522 align:middle line:84%
And it is really
pretty shocking.

00:31:42.522 --> 00:31:44.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and just add
a few little things,

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:48.355 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a little bit of
charcoal or flax seed in there

00:31:48.355 --> 00:31:50.260 align:middle line:90%
to just kind of move things out.

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:54.190 align:middle line:84%
How fast the body adjusts,
how quickly all of the toxins

00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:57.520 align:middle line:84%
move out, how all the fluids
that the body's holding just

00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.540 align:middle line:90%
start releasing.

00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:02.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's like, how can that
work within six days' time,

00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:03.920 align:middle line:90%
for example?

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
where people don't

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:07.690 align:middle line:84%
have faith in
their own bodies is

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:10.840 align:middle line:84%
that our bodies are so
perfectly engineered,

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:14.470 align:middle line:84%
if we just treat it right for
a little while, to help us,

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:15.270 align:middle line:90%
to heal us.

00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:17.437 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Well, the body
loves to be homeostatic.

00:32:17.437 --> 00:32:18.820 align:middle line:90%
And it loves to be homeodynamic.

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:20.528 align:middle line:84%
And it's always moving
in that direction.

00:32:20.528 --> 00:32:21.328 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:32:21.328 --> 00:32:22.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:25.810 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: And so whatever we
can do to assist that is ideal.

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And simple things like fasting
for 12 hours, 24 hours,

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:32.630 align:middle line:84%
can actually raise the immune
system by 10%, 15%, 20%.

00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:33.430 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:33.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:36.590 align:middle line:84%
But the average American diet,
you're eating at 9:00 at night

00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:37.810 align:middle line:84%
and again at 7:00
in the morning.

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:39.510 align:middle line:84%
So you don't even
make a 12-hour window.

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:39.990 align:middle line:90%


00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:40.180 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Right.

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:41.888 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But on the
subject of fasting,

00:32:41.888 --> 00:32:44.040 align:middle line:84%
since we're there we'll
just touch on it for a sec.

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:47.710 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be
extreme, as was once thought.

00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:52.030 align:middle line:84%
You can do a 15-hour or 18-hour
fast and have it significantly,

00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:54.690 align:middle line:84%
as you say, improve the
function of the immune system.

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:55.490 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Sure.

00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And there's things
that you can add,

00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:59.260 align:middle line:84%
like bioage algae,
which can assist you

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:00.610 align:middle line:90%
so that you don't get--

00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:03.490 align:middle line:84%
you don't start wasting away
with your muscles and proteins

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:05.260 align:middle line:90%
and what have you.

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:07.850 align:middle line:84%
Fresh fruit and vegetable
juices can be a part of that.

00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:10.760 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't have to
be completely monk-like.

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:11.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:12.310 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Right.

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:14.727 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So I think the whole
world of fasting is coming

00:33:14.727 --> 00:33:16.570 align:middle line:84%
around to something
that's actually doable,

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:19.990 align:middle line:84%
rather than these original
go on the Master Cleanse diet

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:23.050 align:middle line:84%
for seven to 10 to 30 days,
which of course scares the poo

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:24.520 align:middle line:90%
out of everyone to begin with.

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:27.010 align:middle line:84%
So no one even wants
to give it a try.

00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And then a few brave
souls go through and say,

00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:30.340 align:middle line:90%
I've seen the light.

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:32.210 align:middle line:84%
I've never been so
clear in my life.

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And oh, I wish I had the
discipline to do that.

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:36.940 align:middle line:84%
We're kind of erasing
those kind of--

00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:38.150 align:middle line:90%
those dividing lines now.

00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:38.950 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Right.

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And what we're finding is if
we add colon therapy to that

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:43.420 align:middle line:84%
and PEMF and certain
other things,

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:46.360 align:middle line:84%
we can really speed up the
whole detox process probably

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:48.700 align:middle line:90%
in half, or by 2/3.

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:49.690 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What would
be your protocol, then,

00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:53.260 align:middle line:84%
for someone who comes in and
they've got all this stuff.

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:54.060 align:middle line:90%
100%.

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:54.970 align:middle line:90%
They've got mercury.

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:56.320 align:middle line:90%
They've got Candida.

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.090 align:middle line:90%
They have aluminum toxicity.

00:33:58.090 --> 00:33:59.550 align:middle line:90%
All these toxins in their body.

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:00.678 align:middle line:90%
What do you do with them?

00:34:00.678 --> 00:34:03.220 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Well, everyone in
the Western mindset is looking

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:04.150 align:middle line:90%
for the silver bullet.

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:05.290 align:middle line:90%
But they need to understand--

00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:06.370 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Everyone's different.

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:07.660 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: --life
is a tool box.

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:09.370 align:middle line:84%
You don't paint a
house with a hammer.

00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And you don't pound
nails with a paint brush.

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:14.320 align:middle line:10%
So we start with
typically with nanoxide,

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:16.620 align:middle line:10%
which is our silver
water, which is

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:19.989 align:middle line:10%
a very powerful anti-pathogen
with a long track

00:34:19.989 --> 00:34:22.250 align:middle line:10%
record of incredible efficacy.

00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:24.219 align:middle line:84%
And then we usually
put them on EDTA

00:34:24.219 --> 00:34:27.550 align:middle line:84%
if they have some type
of mercury problem.

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And the colon
cleansing, of course.

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:33.037 align:middle line:84%
And then either they come to
the office and get the PEMF,

00:34:33.037 --> 00:34:34.870 align:middle line:84%
or they purchase one,
because the prices are

00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:37.810 align:middle line:84%
coming down and becoming
more reasonable for people

00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:38.949 align:middle line:90%
to have those.

00:34:38.949 --> 00:34:42.304 align:middle line:84%
We can look into laser
therapies and light therapies.

00:34:42.304 --> 00:34:43.929 align:middle line:84%
And then some of the
newer technologies

00:34:43.929 --> 00:34:45.909 align:middle line:84%
that we have now that
we're pretty excited about.

00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:47.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: First of
all, explain again.

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:48.710 align:middle line:90%
We talked about it last time.

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:51.168 align:middle line:84%
So they can go to our first
interview in the Gaia archives.

00:34:51.168 --> 00:34:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And I did another show
on it as well on PEMF.

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:58.048 align:middle line:84%
But just refresh everyone
quickly as to what PEMF is.

00:34:58.048 --> 00:35:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And then let's go into some
of the other technologies--

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:01.960 align:middle line:90%
the cold laser ones.

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:04.177 align:middle line:10%
>> STREETER: The Schumann
resonance is 7.84 hertz,

00:35:04.177 --> 00:35:06.010 align:middle line:10%
or at least that's what
it's supposed to be.

00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:08.560 align:middle line:10%
It's Mama planet
Earth's heartbeat.

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:10.030 align:middle line:10%
Right?

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:11.770 align:middle line:10%
And our brains and
our hearts resonate

00:35:11.770 --> 00:35:13.930 align:middle line:10%
at the exact same frequency.

00:35:13.930 --> 00:35:16.330 align:middle line:10%
Studies have shown that
headaches, heart disease,

00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:18.460 align:middle line:10%
and all kinds of problems
are because we're

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:20.315 align:middle line:10%
disconnected from this pulse.

00:35:20.315 --> 00:35:21.940 align:middle line:84%
So folks who don't
get enough sunlight,

00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:25.220 align:middle line:84%
they don't spend time
outdoors, what have you.

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:31.120 align:middle line:84%
So we can actually recreate
that pulse with these devices.

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And if you can imagine being
outdoors as an acoustic guitar,

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:35.860 align:middle line:84%
we're turning it into
an electric guitar.

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:36.970 align:middle line:90%
We're plugging in.

00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:38.230 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:40.630 align:middle line:84%
So we're just shortening
that window of something

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:42.460 align:middle line:84%
that people are
deficient in that's

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:44.690 align:middle line:90%
just as important as food.

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:47.500 align:middle line:10%
So when the PEMF device is
interjected to the body,

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:51.040 align:middle line:10%
we have a 400% increase in
stem cell proliferation.

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:53.710 align:middle line:10%
We have the Krebs cycle
begin to speed up.

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:57.370 align:middle line:84%
ATP production, neuropeptides,
lymphatic drainage,

00:35:57.370 --> 00:36:00.280 align:middle line:84%
feelings of well-being,
pain relief, and almost

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:01.810 align:middle line:90%
instantaneously.

00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:03.410 align:middle line:90%
10, 15 minutes.

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:04.420 align:middle line:90%
So that's exciting.

00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:06.795 align:middle line:84%
And long-term we're
seeing incredible results.

00:36:06.795 --> 00:36:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Especially with
the animals where

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:09.253 align:middle line:90%
there's no placebo effect.

00:36:09.253 --> 00:36:10.053 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:36:10.053 --> 00:36:11.710 align:middle line:84%
It's always fun with
kids and animals,

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:13.230 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
have any expectations.

00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:13.840 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: There's no agenda.

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:14.780 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's pure.

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:14.980 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:15.963 align:middle line:90%
It's pure.

00:36:15.963 --> 00:36:18.130 align:middle line:84%
What is the other one-- the
name of the other method

00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:20.680 align:middle line:84%
that's out there right now
that a lot of people are using?

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:21.310 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: The Bemer.

00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:21.880 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Bemer.

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:22.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.950 align:middle line:84%
So Bemer is what kind
of technology as opposed

00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:25.750 align:middle line:90%
to the PEMF?

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:27.875 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Well, Bemer
is a brilliant technology.

00:36:27.875 --> 00:36:30.070 align:middle line:84%
But what it's trying
to do is be more

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:34.490 align:middle line:84%
of an opera or an orchestra
rather than a rock concert,

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:37.520 align:middle line:84%
which is what some of the other
higher powered PEMF machines

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:38.320 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:41.770 align:middle line:84%
The Bemer is 0.66 Gauss, which
is a measure of horsepower

00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:43.700 align:middle line:90%
for these devices.

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:48.080 align:middle line:84%
Some of the other clinical
devices are 1400 and above.

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:51.195 align:middle line:84%
Bemer is brilliant for adrenal
fatigue, thyroid fatigue,

00:36:51.195 --> 00:36:52.070 align:middle line:90%
some of these other--

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:53.785 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Kind of boosting
your basic energetic systems.

00:36:53.785 --> 00:36:55.327 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Infants
and the elderly.

00:36:55.327 --> 00:36:58.090 align:middle line:84%
But if you think you're going
to fix your knee cartilage

00:36:58.090 --> 00:36:59.980 align:middle line:84%
problem, it's probably
not going to happen

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:01.390 align:middle line:90%
with that level of power.

00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And you're better off
looking at something

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:05.630 align:middle line:90%
that's a little more versatile.

00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:06.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:07.677 align:middle line:84%
Actually what you
just said makes sense.

00:37:07.677 --> 00:37:10.040 align:middle line:84%
I know an elderly woman
who's had some issues.

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And she's been
using the Bemer mat.

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:14.380 align:middle line:90%
And for her it does help too.

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:17.333 align:middle line:84%
Cause she's very delicate and
has some cancer in her neck.

00:37:17.333 --> 00:37:19.750 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Some need a nudge,
and some need a hip check.

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:19.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:22.240 align:middle line:84%
She's really helping
with the pain modulation

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.910 align:middle line:84%
for her, is doing
very well for her.

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:27.823 align:middle line:84%
But she can't take
anything strong.

00:37:27.823 --> 00:37:29.240 align:middle line:84%
So what you're
saying essentially,

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:31.060 align:middle line:90%
if you to get in and--

00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:34.163 align:middle line:84%
as you say, turn up
the amps, then you go,

00:37:34.163 --> 00:37:35.730 align:middle line:90%
you would say, to a PEMF device.

00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:36.550 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Right.

00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:38.710 align:middle line:90%
Well, Bemer is technically PEMF.

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:40.270 align:middle line:84%
But it's on the--
it's on the more

00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:40.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Stronger scale

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:40.985 align:middle line:90%


00:37:40.985 --> 00:37:42.090 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: --more
resonant side.

00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:42.520 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:44.230 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: For example, I have
a patient right now who's got

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:47.080 align:middle line:84%
a Bemer who's doing really great
with it for his adrenal fatigue

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:48.043 align:middle line:90%
and his Lyme.

00:37:48.043 --> 00:37:49.960 align:middle line:84%
But his back is killing
him, and he can't ski.

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:51.168 align:middle line:90%
And it's not working for him.

00:37:51.168 --> 00:37:54.460 align:middle line:84%
So he comes and uses
our pulsed harmonics

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:56.268 align:middle line:90%
or higher powered device.

00:37:56.268 --> 00:37:57.310 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Another thing.

00:37:57.310 --> 00:38:01.270 align:middle line:84%
Because I've always resonated
with light and color,

00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:04.060 align:middle line:84%
I have a device that's
doing near and far infrared.

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:06.310 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the role
and near and far infrared

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:07.960 align:middle line:90%
and what that's doing right now.

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:09.560 align:middle line:84%
Because those devices
are ubiquitous.

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:10.360 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Sure.

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:12.850 align:middle line:10%
Well, PEMF is the
foundation of the pyramid.

00:38:12.850 --> 00:38:15.490 align:middle line:10%
It's low frequency, typically.

00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:20.500 align:middle line:84%
The light is a higher frequency
and represents more of an ATP

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:22.607 align:middle line:84%
and a nitric oxide
type of pathway.

00:38:22.607 --> 00:38:24.190 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And tell
us what that does.

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:27.550 align:middle line:10%
>> STREETER: Well the ATP is
the currency of all life, right,

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:28.990 align:middle line:10%
in the Krebs cycle.

00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:32.020 align:middle line:84%
And the nitric oxide is
what causes vasodilation.

00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:33.130 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:38:33.130 --> 00:38:35.860 align:middle line:10%
>> STREETER: So in people
like diabetics with diabetic

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:38.920 align:middle line:10%
neuropathy, the reason they're
having these problems is that

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:42.130 align:middle line:10%
the tissue from the elbow out
or the knee down has literally

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:43.930 align:middle line:10%
become like granite.

00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:46.210 align:middle line:10%
And it's difficult for
fluids to move through rock.

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:47.080 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:50.140 align:middle line:84%
So we're literally
decalcifying and making

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:51.140 align:middle line:90%
these more malleable.

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:54.520 align:middle line:84%
So imagine a piece of granite
becoming more like a brand

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:55.978 align:middle line:90%
new rubber band, if you will.

00:38:55.978 --> 00:38:58.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so these
frequencies of light can really

00:38:58.270 --> 00:39:01.340 align:middle line:84%
get in there and start allowing
that circulation to flow again.

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:02.140 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Sure.

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And what we found is
that the combination

00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:05.800 align:middle line:84%
of the light
therapies and the PEMF

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:08.000 align:middle line:84%
is actually ideal, if
people have the resources.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:08.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:09.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:10.260 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:11.830 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk beyond that.

00:39:11.830 --> 00:39:13.810 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to-- there's
some things in here

00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:15.690 align:middle line:90%
that I don't know about.

00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is the NanoVi
and also the holy hydrogen.

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:19.870 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Right.

00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:21.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So most people
haven't heard of these

00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:22.730 align:middle line:90%
technologies.

00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:25.180 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: So there's a new
thought process of instead

00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:28.630 align:middle line:84%
of having to expend huge amounts
of money and take a capsule

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:31.615 align:middle line:84%
every time that you
want a desired result,

00:39:31.615 --> 00:39:34.240 align:middle line:84%
what if you could make a machine
that for the rest of your life

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:37.450 align:middle line:84%
could create the same result
and not have to deal with

00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:39.980 align:middle line:84%
the supplements and the
bottles and what have you?

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:41.860 align:middle line:90%
Which is really quite brilliant.

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:44.938 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it's just
supplying the frequencies.

00:39:44.938 --> 00:39:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Well, like the
holy hydrogen, for example,

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:50.238 align:middle line:84%
is infusing the water with
hydrogen for up to 12 hours

00:39:50.238 --> 00:39:52.780 align:middle line:84%
so that you can put it in your
water bottle or your Camelbak.

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:53.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What form
does it come in?

00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:54.598 align:middle line:90%
How is it infused?

00:39:54.598 --> 00:39:56.890 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Well, it's a
machine that actually infuses

00:39:56.890 --> 00:40:00.130 align:middle line:84%
the hydrogen in the water and
makes it stick so that when we

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:02.380 align:middle line:84%
drink that, we get that
incredible antioxidant

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:04.990 align:middle line:84%
capability of the hydrogen,
which is hundreds of times more

00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:06.700 align:middle line:90%
than vitamin C.

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:09.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so how does
this dovetail, for example,

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:12.280 align:middle line:84%
with Patrick Flanagan's original
technology of mega h and all

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:15.820 align:middle line:84%
of that, where he's using a
supplemental powder in order

00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:17.123 align:middle line:90%
to do this super hydrogenated--

00:40:17.123 --> 00:40:18.790 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Well,
Patrick is brilliant,

00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:20.283 align:middle line:90%
and people have copied him--

00:40:20.283 --> 00:40:21.450 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Many, many times.

00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:23.230 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Quicksilver
has the Elite H2,

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:24.535 align:middle line:90%
which is a great product.

00:40:24.535 --> 00:40:27.160 align:middle line:10%
But what we're finding is that--
and this is really important--

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:29.260 align:middle line:10%
is that there are ROS out there.

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:30.940 align:middle line:10%
And your viewers
should study this.

00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:32.840 align:middle line:10%
It's called Reduced
Oxygen Species.

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:33.640 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:35.590 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
necessary for life,

00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:40.070 align:middle line:84%
and others are oxidative
and can lead to cancer.

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:42.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's talk
about where the ROS is.

00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:44.525 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: The beauty of
the holy hydrogen is it's only

00:40:44.525 --> 00:40:47.530 align:middle line:84%
producing positive ROS
that's helpful for the body,

00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:48.940 align:middle line:90%
which is a real breakthrough.

00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:51.607 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you're saying some
of these products on the market

00:40:51.607 --> 00:40:52.758 align:middle line:90%
can actually be damaging.

00:40:52.758 --> 00:40:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Well, they
can produce negative ROS.

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:57.050 align:middle line:84%
And if your body can deal
with that, then that's fine.

00:40:57.050 --> 00:41:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And if the ratio is maybe 75
to 25, then we're cooking.

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:03.790 align:middle line:84%
But some of the
older technologies,

00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:05.950 align:middle line:84%
like the violet
ray, we don't even

00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:07.810 align:middle line:84%
know what kind of
negative ROS they

00:41:07.810 --> 00:41:09.440 align:middle line:90%
may have produced, for example.

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:11.740 align:middle line:84%
So we're just getting
more specific with being

00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:13.540 align:middle line:90%
able to be efficacious.

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:15.627 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So holy
hydrogen is a device.

00:41:15.627 --> 00:41:16.310 align:middle line:90%


00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:17.110 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Mm hm.

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:18.010 align:middle line:90%
It's a desktop.

00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And you infuse your
water every day.

00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And people are overcoming
all kinds of problems

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:26.757 align:middle line:84%
just because we live in a
hugely oxidative environment.

00:41:26.757 --> 00:41:27.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, boy, do we.

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:32.020 align:middle line:84%
With a massively
reduced oxygen supply.

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:35.440 align:middle line:84%
The oxygen available to
us in the air in general

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.030 align:middle line:90%
is hugely reduced.

00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:39.910 align:middle line:84%
It's not really sufficient
to support life--

00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:41.540 align:middle line:90%
human life any longer.

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:43.370 align:middle line:90%
We're adapting to it.

00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:45.420 align:middle line:84%
But most of us barely
breathe anyway.

00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:45.670 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:46.090 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Right.

00:41:46.090 --> 00:41:48.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So somehow we're
still alive and we're adapting

00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:49.300 align:middle line:90%
to it.

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:50.950 align:middle line:90%
But that is a serious issue.

00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:52.617 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: And we
can get to it later.

00:41:52.617 --> 00:41:55.240 align:middle line:84%
But the 5G actually is
targeting the oxygen molecule

00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:56.330 align:middle line:90%
in the human body.

00:41:56.330 --> 00:41:57.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We don't
have to get to it later.

00:41:57.310 --> 00:41:58.903 align:middle line:84%
Let's just talk
about it right now.

00:41:58.903 --> 00:42:00.820 align:middle line:84%
Because we're on the
subject of holy hydrogen.

00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:02.030 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Well, let me just
talk about NanoVi real quick,

00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:02.430 align:middle line:90%
if we could.

00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:02.620 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:04.560 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about NanoVi,
and let's go to 5G.

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:05.360 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: OK.

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:07.612 align:middle line:84%
So NanoVi is an amazing
technology from Germany

00:42:07.612 --> 00:42:09.070 align:middle line:84%
that's been around
for a long time,

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:13.090 align:middle line:84%
but was not the ideal
ROS ratio until now.

00:42:13.090 --> 00:42:15.680 align:middle line:84%
So it's pretty much 100%
positive for reduced oxygen

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:16.480 align:middle line:90%
species.

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:18.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Is it similar
to the Holy Hydrogen?

00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:18.370 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Yes.

00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:20.770 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't-- it's not
dealing at the hydrogen level.

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:26.515 align:middle line:84%
It's putting a 1,260 nanometer
frequency into the water.

00:42:26.515 --> 00:42:27.640 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Which does what?

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:29.390 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: And then
you drink the water.

00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's a signaling
mechanism for protein folding

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:35.410 align:middle line:84%
in ATP production and
stem cell production.

00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:37.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's really
exciting technology

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:41.050 align:middle line:84%
to be able to deal on this very
subtle level in the chromosome

00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:44.200 align:middle line:84%
DNA level that actually
creates huge benefits,

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:48.100 align:middle line:84%
because remember, DNA
chromosomes become cells.

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:49.210 align:middle line:90%
Cells become tissues.

00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:50.260 align:middle line:90%
Tissues become organs.

00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:51.560 align:middle line:90%
And organs become people.

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:54.100 align:middle line:84%
So it really behooves
us to break the body

00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:57.980 align:middle line:84%
and bio-hack all the way down
to that level for great results.

00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:00.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So the NanoVi.

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:02.090 align:middle line:90%
How much does that cost?

00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:03.855 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's thinking--
ka-ching. $2,000,

00:43:03.855 --> 00:43:06.338 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: It's
$5,000 to about $14,000.

00:43:06.338 --> 00:43:07.255 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: To $14,000.

00:43:07.255 --> 00:43:08.055 align:middle line:90%
To PEMF.

00:43:08.055 --> 00:43:10.120 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: But think
about what people spend

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:10.660 align:middle line:90%
on their health now.

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:12.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Vacations
and everything else.

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:12.960 align:middle line:90%
PEMF.

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:14.350 align:middle line:90%
How many thousands on PEMF?

00:43:14.350 --> 00:43:16.710 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Well, they range
from about 1,000 to-- well

00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:19.465 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure, about 300 to 40,000.

00:43:19.465 --> 00:43:20.590 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: To about 40,000.

00:43:20.590 --> 00:43:22.720 align:middle line:84%
So there's a whole range
of PEF and PEMF devices.

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:23.520 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:25.090 align:middle line:90%
So I just thinking.

00:43:25.090 --> 00:43:26.710 align:middle line:84%
People have to work
this one through.

00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:29.280 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to carry a mortgage
or take care of your health?

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:30.080 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:31.520 align:middle line:90%
These are choices.

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:32.320 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:35.120 align:middle line:84%
So stem cell therapies that
are happening right now.

00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And then because this
is also affected,

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:39.100 align:middle line:84%
then I do want to
go to 5G briefly,

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:41.160 align:middle line:84%
as terrifying a thought
as that is, for a moment.

00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:41.800 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:43.550 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: So what's
really need to see,

00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:45.910 align:middle line:84%
like I mentioned earlier, is
the biotech industry coming

00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:47.620 align:middle line:90%
to a different tact.

00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And there's been some
great breakthroughs

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:52.520 align:middle line:84%
with Western medicine and
their stem cell injections

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:53.320 align:middle line:90%
and what have you.

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:53.830 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:43:53.830 --> 00:43:55.150 align:middle line:90%
Using our own stem cells.

00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:56.650 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: But
they are expensive.

00:43:56.650 --> 00:43:58.120 align:middle line:90%
And they usually require a trip.

00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And they're very specific
to a joint or an organ.

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And the success rate
is not 100% yet.

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:09.040 align:middle line:10%
What we find is that if you
can combine the injections

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:12.490 align:middle line:10%
with an oral stem cell, like
Origin-22 on our website, which

00:44:12.490 --> 00:44:14.980 align:middle line:10%
is a Chinese herb
called Scutellaria

00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:18.400 align:middle line:10%
that is in a proper
ratio with other things

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:21.850 align:middle line:10%
that actually increases
immunoglobulin A in the gut.

00:44:21.850 --> 00:44:24.490 align:middle line:10%
And IGA is the basis of
all mucous membranes.

00:44:24.490 --> 00:44:27.310 align:middle line:10%
So gut, joints, brain.

00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:28.790 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:29.830 align:middle line:90%
Amazing stories there.

00:44:29.830 --> 00:44:32.310 align:middle line:84%
Regrowing fingertips,
regrowing spleens,

00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:33.340 align:middle line:90%
regrowing your jawbone.

00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:34.798 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I cut
off three fingers.

00:44:34.798 --> 00:44:35.820 align:middle line:90%
I need some.

00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: They regrew a jaw
bone in a gentleman that they

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:41.250 align:middle line:84%
couldn't even put the implant in
because the jaw was like Jello.

00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And after three months
on this product,

00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:44.350 align:middle line:90%
he was able to get the implant.

00:44:44.350 --> 00:44:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This
is the Origin-22?

00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:45.820 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Right.

00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:47.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So what does it do?

00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:47.950 align:middle line:90%
It activates--

00:44:47.950 --> 00:44:49.200 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: It activates IGA.

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:49.850 align:middle line:90%


00:44:49.850 --> 00:44:50.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:50.650 --> 00:44:50.890 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Right.

00:44:50.890 --> 00:44:51.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: So immunoglobulin
A is the basis of these mucous

00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:57.740 align:middle line:84%
membranes at the
stem cell level.

00:44:57.740 --> 00:44:58.540 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:00.640 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about
5G before we get back

00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.243 align:middle line:84%
to Imuregen. Is
that how you say it?

00:45:02.243 --> 00:45:03.160 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Imuregen.

00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:04.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Imuregen.

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:05.040 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: So--

00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:06.415 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Before
we get to that.

00:45:06.415 --> 00:45:08.680 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: 1954 this was
created in Czechoslovakia.

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's been around
for this long.

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:12.310 align:middle line:84%
But it's finally
coming to America now.

00:45:12.310 --> 00:45:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And our group is
bringing this in.

00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:14.710 align:middle line:90%
We're really excited about it.

00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:15.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What is it?

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: It's
minerals, enzymes,

00:45:17.770 --> 00:45:20.890 align:middle line:84%
and other oligosaccharides
and things like that,

00:45:20.890 --> 00:45:24.430 align:middle line:84%
nucleotides that actually
create, theoretically,

00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:28.483 align:middle line:90%
the basis for cell creation.

00:45:28.483 --> 00:45:30.400 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, if
you were in a laboratory

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:31.817 align:middle line:84%
and you wanted to
make a cell, you

00:45:31.817 --> 00:45:34.120 align:middle line:90%
would need this as a foundation.

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:37.210 align:middle line:84%
This is curing avascular
necrosis, Down's syndrome,

00:45:37.210 --> 00:45:39.580 align:middle line:90%
cancer, all kinds of things.

00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:42.103 align:middle line:90%
And it has for well, 1954.

00:45:42.103 --> 00:45:43.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So how
come it's been hidden?

00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:44.595 align:middle line:90%
You said Czechoslovakia?

00:45:44.595 --> 00:45:45.370 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Mm hm.

00:45:45.370 --> 00:45:47.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: How come it's been
hidden away all this time?

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:48.670 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Welcome
to big pharma.

00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:49.090 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:45:49.090 --> 00:45:49.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: And it's
in the Philippines now.

00:45:51.250 --> 00:45:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And so they made the
jump from Czechoslovakia

00:45:53.110 --> 00:45:53.910 align:middle line:90%
to the Philippines.

00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:55.660 align:middle line:90%
And now it's coming to America.

00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And we think it's going to
be the hottest thing going

00:45:58.160 --> 00:45:58.960 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:45:58.960 --> 00:45:59.670 align:middle line:90%
It's really exciting.

00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:01.060 align:middle line:90%
I've been on it for a week now.

00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:02.630 align:middle line:90%
And it's already a game-changer.

00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:04.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So anybody
can have access to it?

00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:04.840 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Oh yeah.

00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:07.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: When the time
comes, anyone can purchase it.

00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:08.110 align:middle line:84%
What do you take
it as a supplement?

00:46:08.110 --> 00:46:08.800 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Mm hm.

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:09.620 align:middle line:90%
It's a liquid.

00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:10.420 align:middle line:90%
Under the tongue.

00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Does it have
any downsides to it?

00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:14.020 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: None
that we can see.

00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:14.200 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:15.250 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about you.

00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:17.410 align:middle line:84%
You've been on it for a
week, which is still new.

00:46:17.410 --> 00:46:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of time the
first things you notice

00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:20.900 align:middle line:84%
happen in that first
week-- or two weeks--

00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:22.730 align:middle line:84%
because it's kind of
shocking your system.

00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:23.530 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Right.

00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what
have you noticed?

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.042 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Well, even
though I'm part cave man,

00:46:27.042 --> 00:46:29.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm also really sensitive
to devices and supplements

00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:31.000 align:middle line:90%
for some reason.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.440 align:middle line:84%
I've noticed increased mood,
better digestion, better sleep.

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:39.650 align:middle line:84%
My gut is a lot happier in
terms of nervousness or anxiety

00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:40.450 align:middle line:90%
or what have you.

00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And sports performance
is off the charts.

00:46:42.610 --> 00:46:45.340 align:middle line:84%
I went and skied the other
day all day in powder.

00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:46.930 align:middle line:90%
And it was a marvelous day.

00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:47.770 align:middle line:90%
Didn't get tired.

00:46:47.770 --> 00:46:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And lactic acid buffering,
those types of things.

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:51.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:52.330 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: And recovery.

00:46:52.330 --> 00:46:54.340 align:middle line:84%
Usually the next day
after a big output for me

00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:56.800 align:middle line:84%
like that is not
really pleasant.

00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:57.850 align:middle line:90%
Not pain, necessarily.

00:46:57.850 --> 00:47:02.440 align:middle line:90%
But just overwhelming fatigue.

00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:03.470 align:middle line:90%
This was great.

00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:04.720 align:middle line:90%
A lot less.

00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:06.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So
Imuregen is its name.

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:08.410 align:middle line:90%
How much does that cost?

00:47:08.410 --> 00:47:11.290 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: It's $120 a
bottle, which is a month.

00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:16.490 align:middle line:84%
So not ridiculous, particularly
seeing what can come of it.

00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:17.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:47:17.290 --> 00:47:18.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think most people
will say that that's

00:47:18.970 --> 00:47:20.137 align:middle line:90%
kind of in their wheelhouse.

00:47:20.137 --> 00:47:22.008 align:middle line:84%
They can give it a
whirl for a month or two

00:47:22.008 --> 00:47:23.800 align:middle line:84%
and see if they're
noticing the difference.

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:24.330 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:47:24.330 --> 00:47:25.130 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:26.830 align:middle line:90%
So finally, let's get to 5G.

00:47:26.830 --> 00:47:28.030 align:middle line:90%
It's rolling out.

00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:29.440 align:middle line:90%
You've been following the story.

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And although, as you say,
you're no expert on it.

00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:33.042 align:middle line:90%
But you have been following it.

00:47:33.042 --> 00:47:34.270 align:middle line:90%
You have to for your work.

00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:38.150 align:middle line:84%
Many doctors are coming out
and saying this is devastating.

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:41.530 align:middle line:84%
Now if you assume that
there is no solution

00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:45.160 align:middle line:84%
and that the human body is
not capable of adapting,

00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:47.470 align:middle line:84%
it sounds like an
absolute nightmare

00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:49.690 align:middle line:90%
ready to unfold for humanity.

00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And I guess it's coming
to a theater near us

00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:54.150 align:middle line:90%
in the United States first.

00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:54.950 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:55.270 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Right.

00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's talk
about it for a moment.

00:47:56.590 --> 00:47:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And then also,
some of the ways we

00:47:58.510 --> 00:48:00.350 align:middle line:84%
can ameliorate some
of the effects,

00:48:00.350 --> 00:48:02.150 align:middle line:90%
or potentially or actually.

00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.950 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: OK.

00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:04.492 align:middle line:84%
Well, the sad part
is that they could

00:48:04.492 --> 00:48:07.480 align:middle line:84%
have chosen a whole host
of other frequencies

00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:10.900 align:middle line:84%
like the Russian work on
scalar waves and torsion fields

00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:12.950 align:middle line:84%
for communication
and what have you.

00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:16.540 align:middle line:84%
But they chose this
millimeter microwave scenario

00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:19.150 align:middle line:84%
partly as a eugenics
program, from my research,

00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:22.390 align:middle line:84%
and partly as a way to keep
people in the Western system

00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:24.550 align:middle line:84%
and keep people
sad and depressed

00:48:24.550 --> 00:48:26.630 align:middle line:84%
and not be able to rise
up against the tyrannical

00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:27.430 align:middle line:90%
government.

00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:28.610 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:48:28.610 --> 00:48:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's very
inefficient, because you

00:48:30.250 --> 00:48:33.590 align:middle line:84%
have to have a tower every
x amount of feet in order

00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:34.390 align:middle line:90%
to make it happen.

00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:34.825 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Lots of them.

00:48:34.825 --> 00:48:36.160 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Lots of them.

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:37.840 align:middle line:90%
So it is heating.

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:41.815 align:middle line:84%
But it's also the same frequency
that destroys human oxygen,

00:48:41.815 --> 00:48:44.330 align:middle line:90%
or binds to human oxygen.

00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:48.020 align:middle line:84%
So the original
studies are not pretty.

00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:49.930 align:middle line:84%
I kind of like to lean
towards George Carlin

00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:52.580 align:middle line:84%
when he says, oh, you think
you're going to ruin the earth?

00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:54.580 align:middle line:84%
She's going to keep going
for millions of years.

00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:55.730 align:middle line:90%
And so will humanity.

00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to
not be a doomsayer.

00:48:58.710 --> 00:48:59.510 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.740 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:01.141 align:middle line:90%
I'm with you on that.

00:49:01.141 --> 00:49:01.570 align:middle line:90%
But we need to be aware.

00:49:01.570 --> 00:49:02.778 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: This one is bad.

00:49:02.778 --> 00:49:04.803 align:middle line:90%
And it's unnecessary.

00:49:04.803 --> 00:49:06.220 align:middle line:84%
Some of the
protections against it

00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:09.790 align:middle line:84%
might be some of the EMF
bracelets and what have you.

00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:12.280 align:middle line:84%
Maybe Reich technology
with Orgone.

00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:14.440 align:middle line:84%
But we know that
carbon 60 and CBD

00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:17.710 align:middle line:84%
do have protective capabilities
to keep the inflammation down

00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:21.130 align:middle line:84%
and keep the microwave
oven effect to a minimum,

00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:22.450 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:49:22.450 --> 00:49:25.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: If it's having that
effect on the oxygen system

00:49:25.390 --> 00:49:27.500 align:middle line:84%
in the body, then how
does the hydrogen--

00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:30.065 align:middle line:84%
how do the hydrogen
technologies feed into that?

00:49:30.065 --> 00:49:31.690 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Well,
they may be helpful.

00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:32.610 align:middle line:90%
We don't know yet.

00:49:32.610 --> 00:49:33.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:34.480 align:middle line:90%
You just don't know.

00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:36.160 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Probably the
best thing is going to be live

00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:37.060 align:middle line:90%
rurally.

00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:37.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:38.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:38.110 --> 00:49:40.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we live out
where there isn't much.

00:49:40.330 --> 00:49:41.555 align:middle line:90%
We just got cable TV.

00:49:41.555 --> 00:49:41.973 align:middle line:90%


00:49:41.973 --> 00:49:44.140 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: The scenarios
of living in an apartment

00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:48.670 align:middle line:84%
or a condo with 30,
40, 50 other 5Gs is--

00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:50.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
how to contemplate

00:49:50.170 --> 00:49:51.790 align:middle line:84%
what that looks
like mathematically

00:49:51.790 --> 00:49:54.262 align:middle line:84%
and exponentially, as far
as damage to the body.

00:49:54.262 --> 00:49:56.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, there are
two points this brings up.

00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting is Jack
Cruz has stated that what's

00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:03.440 align:middle line:84%
going to happen is
he, as a neurosurgeon,

00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:05.380 align:middle line:84%
is stating that this
is going to interfere

00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:09.490 align:middle line:84%
with the delicate
instrumentation in the OR,

00:50:09.490 --> 00:50:12.310 align:middle line:90%
for example, in his profession.

00:50:12.310 --> 00:50:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And that this is going
to have to be addressed.

00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:17.120 align:middle line:84%
How do you block--
you have to start

00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:21.260 align:middle line:84%
blocking medical facilities, for
example, from these frequencies

00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:22.965 align:middle line:90%
so they can just do their job.

00:50:22.965 --> 00:50:25.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, somewhere this is
going to have to get attention.

00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:27.380 align:middle line:90%
But what I'm seeing now-- boom.

00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:29.275 align:middle line:90%
I mean Verizon, everywhere.

00:50:29.275 --> 00:50:30.650 align:middle line:84%
Now they're starting
to come out.

00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:32.030 align:middle line:90%
5G on its way.

00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:33.170 align:middle line:90%
5G.

00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:33.970 align:middle line:90%
Fast, fast, fast.

00:50:33.970 --> 00:50:36.178 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be connected
to the rest of the world

00:50:36.178 --> 00:50:37.280 align:middle line:90%
faster than ever.

00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:38.470 align:middle line:90%
And most people are, yippee!

00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:40.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be even--
it's already there

00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:43.560 align:middle line:84%
in a half a second or
a tenth of a second.

00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:45.570 align:middle line:84%
But maybe it's going to
be hundreds of a second.

00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:46.470 align:middle line:90%
This is us too.

00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:47.420 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Mm hm.

00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:51.920 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We as the consuming
public have also somewhat

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:55.250 align:middle line:84%
allowed for this, because we've
been narcotized into the notion

00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:58.065 align:middle line:90%
faster, bigger is always better.

00:50:58.065 --> 00:50:59.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, at what point
do we stand up and say,

00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:01.100 align:middle line:90%
we don't want faster.

00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:02.140 align:middle line:90%
We want healthier?

00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:02.640 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:04.598 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Well, a
certain point in the past,

00:51:04.598 --> 00:51:07.190 align:middle line:84%
materialism surpassed humanism
as the driving force on this

00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.610 align:middle line:90%
planet.

00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:08.090 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:09.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: 5G was chosen so
that the micro traders who do

00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:14.060 align:middle line:84%
all these micro trades
can make a fortune,

00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:16.923 align:middle line:84%
because if they're too
slow, they can't do it.

00:51:16.923 --> 00:51:17.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Which is why the
Twin Towers were abandoned

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:22.660 align:middle line:84%
mostly by financial people
because they had copper wiring,

00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:25.160 align:middle line:84%
and they needed fiber optics,
and they couldn't keep up with

00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:25.490 align:middle line:90%
all that.

00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:26.420 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:28.608 align:middle line:84%
So are we really going to
make micro trading more

00:51:28.608 --> 00:51:29.900 align:middle line:90%
important than people's health?

00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:31.872 align:middle line:90%
I think that's a lost society.

00:51:31.872 --> 00:51:33.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I think it is too.

00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:35.497 align:middle line:84%
And it's partly for us to speak
up and say, no, thank you.

00:51:35.497 --> 00:51:37.220 align:middle line:90%
I don't want your faster.

00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And we have to make
hard decisions.

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:41.720 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we do have to move
to a 200-square foot

00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:43.978 align:middle line:84%
cabin in the woods
instead of our apartment.

00:51:43.978 --> 00:51:45.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how this
is going to roll out.

00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:46.025 align:middle line:90%
Honestly.

00:51:46.025 --> 00:51:46.825 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Fiji.

00:51:46.825 --> 00:51:48.380 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Or Fiji or somewhere.

00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:49.040 align:middle line:90%
But not everybody can do that.

00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:51.165 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Even worse,
they're talking about with

00:51:51.165 --> 00:51:54.410 align:middle line:84%
the satellites that actually
have a blanket of 5G everywhere

00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:57.510 align:middle line:84%
you go on the planet,
this could be devastating.

00:51:57.510 --> 00:52:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what you're saying
is that potentially carbon 60,

00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:06.410 align:middle line:84%
CBD, and maybe even Imuregen,
might be helpful as antidotes

00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:08.630 align:middle line:84%
to protect us against
the effects of the 5G.

00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:10.970 align:middle line:84%
Which is-- it's good news
to know that anything might.

00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:12.920 align:middle line:84%
But one thing I've
learned for sure

00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:17.510 align:middle line:84%
is not all CBD products,
not all carbon 60 products,

00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:18.430 align:middle line:90%
are created the same.

00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:19.430 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Absolutely.

00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:21.722 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so now this
opens up a whole other world

00:52:21.722 --> 00:52:24.020 align:middle line:84%
for people to have to
navigate through and say,

00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:25.050 align:middle line:90%
I don't feel anything.

00:52:25.050 --> 00:52:25.850 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Right.

00:52:25.850 --> 00:52:27.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And someone
else to say, oh my god,

00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:29.240 align:middle line:84%
my whole life is
changed on this stuff.

00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:31.580 align:middle line:84%
This world is like
anything else.

00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:32.390 align:middle line:90%
It's new.

00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:33.500 align:middle line:90%
It's the Wild West.

00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And no one knows who
to trust anymore.

00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And people don't
necessarily have money

00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:39.840 align:middle line:90%
to just throw down the drain.

00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:40.640 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Right.

00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:42.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So how do you
even begin that process

00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:43.550 align:middle line:90%
of discernment?

00:52:43.550 --> 00:52:44.180 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Well--

00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:46.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean, I know you
guys are trying to do your due

00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:47.900 align:middle line:84%
diligence and get
clean products.

00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And there are other
people who are really--

00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:51.500 align:middle line:84%
and you have to find the
people you resonate with

00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:53.583 align:middle line:84%
and you think are leading
you down the right path.

00:52:53.583 --> 00:52:57.530 align:middle line:90%
But what do you not fall for?

00:52:57.530 --> 00:52:58.355 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Price.

00:52:58.355 --> 00:52:59.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What does that mean?

00:52:59.610 --> 00:53:01.443 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Well, you
get what you pay for.

00:53:01.443 --> 00:53:03.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's true
with cars and homes.

00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's true with
these products.

00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:06.410 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And plus, we've been
trained by NASA people

00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:11.630 align:middle line:84%
and the top physicists
behind all this.

00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:14.248 align:middle line:84%
We're some of the first
people to roll out the carbon.

00:53:14.248 --> 00:53:16.040 align:middle line:84%
We have some of the
best minds in the world

00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:18.200 align:middle line:84%
here in Boulder working
on our CBD product, which

00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:20.680 align:middle line:84%
is Spagyric, which is very
important if your viewers want

00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:21.480 align:middle line:90%
to look that up.

00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:23.630 align:middle line:10%
S--P-A-G-Y-R-I-C.

00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:26.120 align:middle line:10%
We're actually able to
capture the entire entourage

00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:28.310 align:middle line:10%
effect and all of the
essence of the plant.

00:53:28.310 --> 00:53:29.310 align:middle line:90%
This is old alchemy.

00:53:29.310 --> 00:53:30.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:53:30.110 --> 00:53:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: Much farther above
just a tincture or a gummy bear

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:34.800 align:middle line:90%
or what have you.

00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:36.200 align:middle line:90%
This is-- and you can taste it.

00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:39.190 align:middle line:84%
It's magnificent, like a
fine olive oil or something.

00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:42.870 align:middle line:84%
You can just taste the
richness and the depth of it.

00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And smaller doses
actually go farther

00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:46.460 align:middle line:90%
with animals and people.

00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:48.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which is nice, cause
that evens out the pricing

00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:50.450 align:middle line:84%
issue, because if it's more
expensive, if you need less,

00:53:50.450 --> 00:53:51.300 align:middle line:90%
that's a good thing.

00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: And if you
add the carbon to it,

00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:54.320 align:middle line:84%
now you're getting two
birds with one stone.

00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:57.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's 200 times more powerful
than vitamin C. Chelates

00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:00.270 align:middle line:90%
4,000 goodies out of the body.

00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And just for clarity,
the CBD does not have the same

00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:05.670 align:middle line:84%
effects on the brain for
example, that THC does.

00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:06.470 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: No.

00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:09.890 align:middle line:10%
We have military people and
cops and helicopter pilots,

00:54:09.890 --> 00:54:13.070 align:middle line:10%
people who cannot afford
to be stoned or taking--

00:54:13.070 --> 00:54:15.350 align:middle line:10%
losing a drug test to THC.

00:54:15.350 --> 00:54:16.200 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:20.217 align:middle line:84%
But to be clear, ours does
have 0.3% or less THC,

00:54:20.217 --> 00:54:21.300 align:middle line:90%
which is really important.

00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:22.325 align:middle line:90%
That's a booster.

00:54:22.325 --> 00:54:25.040 align:middle line:84%
A 100% CBD product
is not going to have

00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:27.410 align:middle line:84%
the same effect as
that little bit of THC

00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:29.370 align:middle line:84%
that acts like a high
test, if you will.

00:54:29.370 --> 00:54:30.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:54:30.170 --> 00:54:32.660 align:middle line:84%
Because one thing I came across
recently and I am concerned

00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:34.640 align:middle line:84%
about-- and we don't
have time to go there--

00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:39.380 align:middle line:84%
is that we now have pot
legal in certain states.

00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:41.570 align:middle line:84%
It's coming to most
states, I believe.

00:54:41.570 --> 00:54:42.750 align:middle line:90%
And I started--

00:54:42.750 --> 00:54:44.160 align:middle line:84%
I looked at this
a few years ago.

00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:45.120 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, hm.

00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:45.920 align:middle line:90%
Soma.

00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:46.640 align:middle line:90%
Brave new world.

00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:47.445 align:middle line:90%
Soma.

00:54:47.445 --> 00:54:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And I started thinking
about the effect

00:54:49.070 --> 00:54:52.010 align:middle line:84%
of that type of placid
society that's chilled,

00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:54.380 align:middle line:84%
and what the advantage
could be in that.

00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:55.190 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:59.340 align:middle line:84%
So hemp, THC is being credited
with a lot of wonderful things.

00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:01.430 align:middle line:84%
But one thing I've
learned as of late

00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:05.810 align:middle line:84%
is that it also reduces
the production of dopamine.

00:55:05.810 --> 00:55:06.770 align:middle line:90%
This is not good.

00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:08.450 align:middle line:84%
This is your frontal
lobe functioning.

00:55:08.450 --> 00:55:09.250 align:middle line:90%
>> STREETER: Right.

00:55:09.250 --> 00:55:12.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And this is your
ability to navigate your way

00:55:12.290 --> 00:55:14.990 align:middle line:84%
through life and to think and
discern and apply your will

00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:15.920 align:middle line:90%
and your thought.

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:18.123 align:middle line:84%
And when your dopamine
action is down,

00:55:18.123 --> 00:55:20.540 align:middle line:84%
you're also looking at things
like potentially Alzheimer's

00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:21.742 align:middle line:90%
in the end and so forth.

00:55:21.742 --> 00:55:23.450 align:middle line:84%
So this is a whole
other subject that I'd

00:55:23.450 --> 00:55:27.230 align:middle line:84%
like to go into one
day about the benefits

00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:30.850 align:middle line:84%
versus the detriment of having
a society that's smoking weed

00:55:30.850 --> 00:55:31.650 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:55:31.650 --> 00:55:33.590 align:middle line:10%
>> STREETER: Well, as
a 25-year pot user,

00:55:33.590 --> 00:55:35.570 align:middle line:10%
that's really changed
my life, honestly.

00:55:35.570 --> 00:55:38.010 align:middle line:84%
Gotten me off of pharmaceuticals
and what have you.

00:55:38.010 --> 00:55:40.580 align:middle line:84%
But then to transition
from smoking to edibles,

00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:43.652 align:middle line:84%
and then away from Rick Simpson
oil and what have you to CBDs.

00:55:43.652 --> 00:55:45.860 align:middle line:84%
If your viewers call me, we
can have this discussion.

00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:47.693 align:middle line:84%
It's very important,
especially for children

00:55:47.693 --> 00:55:48.825 align:middle line:90%
and elderly and sensitives.

00:55:48.825 --> 00:55:49.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you.

00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:50.742 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad I brought it up.

00:55:50.742 --> 00:55:52.230 align:middle line:90%
Because we're out of time now.

00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:53.030 align:middle line:90%
And I felt like--

00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:53.780 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know why--

00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:55.863 align:middle line:84%
I needed to bring it up
so that what you just said

00:55:55.863 --> 00:55:57.680 align:middle line:84%
is important,
because I'm getting--

00:55:57.680 --> 00:55:59.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm becoming very
concerned, especially

00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:01.610 align:middle line:84%
about a young generation
that's finding

00:56:01.610 --> 00:56:04.580 align:middle line:84%
there's not a lot of
resources left for them.

00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:06.830 align:middle line:84%
And they're struggling to
find their way in the world.

00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:08.407 align:middle line:84%
And weed's a really
easy way out.

00:56:08.407 --> 00:56:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And thinking what's going
to happen to their brain

00:56:10.490 --> 00:56:12.110 align:middle line:90%
down the road, I'm concerned.

00:56:12.110 --> 00:56:14.750 align:middle line:84%
>> STREETER: The CBD edibles
are a higher state of being than

00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:16.160 align:middle line:90%
smoking pot all the time.

00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:17.670 align:middle line:90%
Just honestly.

00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:18.470 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:19.928 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's our
little statement.

00:56:19.928 --> 00:56:21.770 align:middle line:84%
So Glenn, thank you so
much for coming back.

00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:25.350 align:middle line:84%
You've just loaded people up
with tons of new information

00:56:25.350 --> 00:56:26.510 align:middle line:90%
they can start researching.

00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:29.023 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it's always
fascinating to learn from you

00:56:29.023 --> 00:56:31.190 align:middle line:84%
kind of the latest and
greatest of what's out there.

00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, oh
my god, that's what?

00:56:32.930 --> 00:56:36.190 align:middle line:90%
6,000, 8,000, 500.

00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:39.110 align:middle line:90%
What can I afford here?

00:56:39.110 --> 00:56:41.780 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, people can get
in touch with you directly.

00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:42.863 align:middle line:90%
So again, thank you Glenn.

00:56:42.863 --> 00:56:44.030 align:middle line:90%

00:56:44.030 --> 00:56:45.140 align:middle line:90%
