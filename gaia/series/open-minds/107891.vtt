00:00:05.952 --> 00:00:07.936 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:07.936 --> 00:00:28.610 align:middle line:90%


00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.110 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: In my last
conversation with Matthew Fox,

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.210 align:middle line:10%
we spoke about the phenomenal
life of Hildegard von Bingen.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And today we will speak
of Meister Eckhart, whom

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.284 align:middle line:90%
she preceded by 150 years.

00:00:39.284 --> 00:00:40.700 align:middle line:84%
They were both
part of what became

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.830 align:middle line:90%
known as the Rhineland Mystics.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.300 align:middle line:84%
According to Dr. Fox,
their mystic visions

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.740 align:middle line:84%
and understandings are the
vital bridge between religion,

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.460 align:middle line:90%
science, and cosmology.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.330 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.070 align:middle line:84%
I so loved our last
conversation about Hildegard.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.561 align:middle line:90%
>>MATTHEW FOX: So do I, Regina.

00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:56.827 align:middle line:90%
Looking forward to this one.

00:00:56.827 --> 00:00:57.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And so, Meister Eckhart--
equally as little known

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.120 align:middle line:84%
in the world today, except
for some people that

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.970 align:middle line:84%
have these esoteric
understandings--

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.641 align:middle line:90%
was as brilliant a being as she.

00:01:10.641 --> 00:01:11.390 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Absolutely.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.680 align:middle line:10%
In his own right, yes.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.780 align:middle line:10%
He was not as broad
a personality.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.780 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, yeah, she
was quite the creator.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.260 align:middle line:10%
>>FOX: He didn't write music.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.220 align:middle line:10%
She was the creator.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.990 align:middle line:10%
He didn't paint and write
music and do healings.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.960 align:middle line:84%
But as a mystic and
philosopher, he was astounding.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.080 align:middle line:10%
And he lived 1260 to 1329.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.620 align:middle line:10%
Rumi died when Eckhart
was 13 years old.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And then Hafiz, the Sufi
mystic who followed Rumi,

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.920 align:middle line:90%
was a contemporary of Eckhart's.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And Thomas Aquinas died
when Eckhart was 17.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.200 align:middle line:84%
And then, Mechthild of Magdeburg
died when he was, like, 20

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.700 align:middle line:90%
or so.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.153 align:middle line:90%
So he's part of this ongoing.

00:01:49.153 --> 00:01:50.986 align:middle line:84%
There was something in
the air at that time,

00:01:50.986 --> 00:01:51.310 align:middle line:90%
like there is today.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, there was, like,
a mystical revolution going on

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.306 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:01:54.306 --> 00:01:54.930 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Exactly.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.460 align:middle line:90%
And he drank deeply of it.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, do you know
if he was aware of Rumi, Hafiz,

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.040 align:middle line:90%
the others?

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.870 align:middle line:90%
The Sufis?

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.490 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: He was definitely
aware of the Sufis.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.280 align:middle line:84%
Because he cites
Avicenna, who was

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.620 align:middle line:84%
a Muslim philosopher who lived
about 150 years before them.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.290 align:middle line:90%
And he cites him 13 times.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.710 align:middle line:84%
He gives credit to
Avicenna for the idea

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.050 align:middle line:90%
of the spark of the soul.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.704 align:middle line:84%
He says, this one
philosopher talks

00:02:23.704 --> 00:02:24.870 align:middle line:90%
about the spark of the soul.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.050 align:middle line:84%
So he goes on about
the spark of the soul.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.040 align:middle line:90%
We all have this spark.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.600 align:middle line:84%
Which is, he says,
the Holy Spirit in us.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.700 align:middle line:84%
Or in other places he
says, it's the manger

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.570 align:middle line:90%
where the Christ is born in us.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.800 align:middle line:90%
And he develops that.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And of course, he was very
familiar with the Kabbalah,

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.310 align:middle line:84%
with the Jewish
mystical happening

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.000 align:middle line:84%
that was also occurring
at the very same time.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's interesting,
I have a whole chapter

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.735 align:middle line:84%
in my recent book on Eckhart
on Sufism in Eckhart.

00:02:53.735 --> 00:02:57.250 align:middle line:84%
I also have a chapter
on Buddhism in Eckhart.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.110 align:middle line:84%
He did not know
Buddhists or Buddhism.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.280 align:middle line:84%
But he comes to
the same experience

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.530 align:middle line:90%
that the Buddhists talk about.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.940 align:middle line:90%
It's astounding.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again, these
essential truths in life.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.230 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Exactly.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And same as we had
talked about in Hildegard,

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.090 align:middle line:84%
she just innately understood
and was given downloaded visions

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.570 align:middle line:90%
of these essential truths.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And for just a moment, I
want to backtrack a bit.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.954 align:middle line:84%
Because you and
Meister Eckhart were

00:03:19.954 --> 00:03:21.120 align:middle line:90%
both of the Dominican order.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.870 align:middle line:84%
But also, you were
educated in Paris.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And you both had the
same kind of experience

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.300 align:middle line:84%
with the church itself,
politically speaking.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.420 align:middle line:84%
So did you have and did you
feel some kind of alignment

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.302 align:middle line:84%
with him, early on, when you
were first exposed to him?

00:03:35.302 --> 00:03:37.510 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Well, I'll tell you,
I was not exposed to them

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.220 align:middle line:90%
by the Dominicans.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.290 align:middle line:84%
Because he was condemned
a week after he died.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.331 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, of course.

00:03:42.331 --> 00:03:44.950 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: And so he was lost
to mainstream Christianity,

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:45.920 align:middle line:90%
unfortunately.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.190 align:middle line:84%
But I'll tell you, I was in a
serious car accident in 1976.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And two years later,
I had an operation.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And during that operation,
Eckhart came to me.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And we walked together
on the beach, silently.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.520 align:middle line:90%
And it was the most--

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How amazing.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.653 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:04:00.653 --> 00:04:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: One of my most
profound dreams of my life.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And I knew, from then on, that
he and I had a relationship.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And then I had to
pursue him more deeply.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you walked
on the beach with him,

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.060 align:middle line:84%
what was the nature
of the understanding?

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.130 align:middle line:90%
What passed between you?

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.779 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Well, again,
it was in silence.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:17.709 align:middle line:90%
We didn't speak.

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.540 align:middle line:90%
But what can I say?

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.390 align:middle line:84%
It was, simply, very
supportive and brotherly.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.600 align:middle line:90%
I was still a Dominican then.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.930 align:middle line:84%
But I was writing a book
on compassion at the time.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.031 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking for
Western theologians

00:04:35.031 --> 00:04:36.280 align:middle line:90%
who had written on compassion.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.540 align:middle line:84%
I was appalled at how
few had written about it.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.600 align:middle line:84%
They wrote all these
books on contemplation

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.290 align:middle line:90%
but very little on compassion.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:44.640 align:middle line:90%
But then I found Eckhart.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And he had a whole
sermon on Jesus

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.095 align:middle line:84%
saying be compassionate
as your creator in heaven

00:04:51.095 --> 00:04:53.740 align:middle line:90%
is compassionate, Luke 6.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And I knew I had
found a brother there.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.030 align:middle line:84%
And then I found,
in his writings,

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.896 align:middle line:84%
whole sentences that I
had published the year,

00:05:00.896 --> 00:05:01.770 align:middle line:90%
never having met him.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Never
having seen them.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.980 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: On an article I did on
sacred space and sacred time.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.230 align:middle line:90%
So this really freaked me out.

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.170 align:middle line:84%
But I realized I did
have a brother here.

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I really
went for him in a big way.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.120 align:middle line:90%
And I translated.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.030 align:middle line:84%
I was the first to
translate into English

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.070 align:middle line:84%
from the critical German
edition, 36 of his sermons

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.930 align:middle line:90%
with a commentary after each.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.235 align:middle line:84%
And then I did a little
book, "Meditations

00:05:25.235 --> 00:05:26.450 align:middle line:90%
with Meister Eckhart."

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.180 align:middle line:90%
But that was over 30 years ago.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.213 align:middle line:84%
This new book I've
done, "Meister Eckhart:

00:05:30.213 --> 00:05:32.009 align:middle line:84%
A Mystic-Warrior
for Our Times"--

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:34.300 align:middle line:84%
this is the first book I've
written on him in 30 years.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.390 align:middle line:84%
But I've been teaching
him all these years

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.690 align:middle line:84%
and realizing what an impact
he has on people's lives.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what's
interesting is in that era,

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.890 align:middle line:84%
as we just talked about--
where you have Rumi and Hafiz

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.800 align:middle line:84%
and Thomas Aquinas and
himself and others-- there

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.180 align:middle line:84%
was an opening, a
portal of sorts.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.020 align:middle line:84%
It was the time for this
kind of mystical information,

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.330 align:middle line:84%
these essential truths
to pour through.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.940 align:middle line:84%
Which, I think is
fair to say, even

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.466 align:middle line:84%
though there's a fair amount
of resistance to it even today.

00:06:03.466 --> 00:06:04.840 align:middle line:84%
The same thing
has been happening

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.540 align:middle line:84%
over the last 50 or 100 years
and through moment in time,

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.070 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.320 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: I think so, definitely.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's very
ecumenical today, of course.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:17.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm mean, we're reading
Buddhists and Hindus and Sufis

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:18.920 align:middle line:90%
today and experiencing them.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.774 align:middle line:84%
And of course, Jewish scholars
too, like Rabbi Heschel.

00:06:21.774 --> 00:06:23.440 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I try
to do in this book,

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.960 align:middle line:84%
is to put him in the room with
these 20th century thinkers.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.950 align:middle line:84%
Because, like you say,
there's a common truth

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.760 align:middle line:84%
that all religions
come to, especially

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.400 align:middle line:84%
around the experience
of the omnipresence

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.240 align:middle line:90%
of the divine in all things.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.764 align:middle line:90%
And call it the Buddha Nature.

00:06:42.764 --> 00:06:43.930 align:middle line:90%
Call it the cause of Christ.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Call it the image of God, as
the Jewish tradition does,

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.990 align:middle line:90%
or the Shekinah.

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:53.080 align:middle line:84%
But this is lost when religion
goes its own way and starts

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.030 align:middle line:84%
drawing attention to itself and
wants to build its buildings

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.800 align:middle line:90%
and create its hierarchies.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And you know, you're not
going to reform religion.

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.340 align:middle line:84%
Carl Jung said that, that
only the mystics bring what

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.330 align:middle line:90%
is creative to religion itself.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.840 align:middle line:84%
So if we're going to make
religion shape up and serve

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.680 align:middle line:84%
today, instead of
kind of, well, go

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.600 align:middle line:84%
to war against
each other-- which,

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.780 align:middle line:84%
of course, is happening-- we
have to go back to the mystics.

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.920 align:middle line:84%
Because they distill the real
essence of religion for us.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And Eckhart is the
greatest mystic,

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.370 align:middle line:90%
certainly of Christianity.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:28.890 align:middle line:90%
And probably of the west.

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:33.987 align:middle line:84%
And the proof of it is that he
was condemned, like Jesus was.

00:07:33.987 --> 00:07:35.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All good men like you.

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.722 align:middle line:90%
You were condemned as well.

00:07:36.722 --> 00:07:38.430 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go into
that a little bit.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:43.200 align:middle line:84%
But I wonder, too, what
is your perception,

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.150 align:middle line:84%
in new age parlance, the field
where everything is connected,

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:48.440 align:middle line:90%
where time continues?

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.820 align:middle line:84%
In that case, even
where incarnations

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.220 align:middle line:84%
continue with the soul
to express themselves

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:54.480 align:middle line:90%
throughout time.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.070 align:middle line:84%
How do you feel about
that innate connection

00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:00.810 align:middle line:84%
you have with Eckhart and
these ancient mystics?

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:04.240 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Well, in the
theological tradition,

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.120 align:middle line:84%
we talk about the
community of saints.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.304 align:middle line:84%
More ancient cultures
talk about the ancestors.

00:08:11.304 --> 00:08:12.220 align:middle line:90%
They're still with us.

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.030 align:middle line:90%


00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And I hear many
stories from people

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:18.290 align:middle line:90%
whose loved ones have died.

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:21.660 align:middle line:84%
And then they have Resurrection
experiences with these people.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.020 align:middle line:84%
I have a friend who's
not at all religious.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.070 align:middle line:90%
He's very blue collar.

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:27.770 align:middle line:84%
He builds things with
his hands all the time.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:29.159 align:middle line:90%
And his mother died.

00:08:29.159 --> 00:08:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And three months
later, she showed up

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:31.680 align:middle line:90%
at the end of his bed.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.409 align:middle line:90%
And they had a conversation.

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And every time he
tells me about it,

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.169 align:middle line:84%
you know, tears
come to his eyes.

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:38.429 align:middle line:90%
It's just a reality.

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:39.610 align:middle line:90%
This happened to him.

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:42.059 align:middle line:84%
And so that, to me--
and among other things--

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:44.860 align:middle line:84%
it puts the Jesus
experience-- the many people

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.480 align:middle line:84%
who experienced him after the
Resurrection-- into context.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.000 align:middle line:84%
This happens a lot when
people love each other.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.470 align:middle line:84%
So the idea that our
lives are limited

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:58.710 align:middle line:84%
to this one time
around, so to speak,

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:04.730 align:middle line:84%
and that consciousness
dies when we die,

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:07.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's a
lot of evidence for that.

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:10.650 align:middle line:84%
I think most of the evidence
is in the opposite corner,

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:11.960 align:middle line:84%
that all kinds of people have
experiences of ancestors.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.959 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're somehow
dancing in the field

00:09:13.959 --> 00:09:16.850 align:middle line:90%
with this other consciousness?

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:18.050 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: That's right.

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:19.480 align:middle line:90%
We belong to many fields.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.720 align:middle line:90%
Here's a wonderful story.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.330 align:middle line:10%
David Paladin,
you've heard of him.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.140 align:middle line:10%
But he's a Navajo painter.

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:30.092 align:middle line:10%
And quickly, he volunteered
for the army, second World War.

00:09:30.092 --> 00:09:30.883 align:middle line:90%
Lied about his age.

00:09:30.883 --> 00:09:32.270 align:middle line:90%
He was only 16.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:37.100 align:middle line:84%
He was captured
immediately in Europe,

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.630 align:middle line:84%
put in a concentration
camp, not in a GI

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:43.080 align:middle line:84%
camp, where he was tortured
mercilessly for four years.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.330 align:middle line:84%
When the Americans
liberated the camp,

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:46.765 align:middle line:84%
they found his
body at the bottom

00:09:46.765 --> 00:09:48.050 align:middle line:90%
of a pile of dead bodies.

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:49.180 align:middle line:90%
He weighed 65 pounds.

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:51.830 align:middle line:90%
He was comatose and paraplegic.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:55.540 align:middle line:84%
They brought him back
to his tribe in Arizona.

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And two years later, he
came out of his coma.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
you have a choice.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.635 align:middle line:84%
You will be a paraplegic
in a wheelchair the rest

00:10:03.635 --> 00:10:04.885 align:middle line:90%
of your life in a VA hospital.

00:10:04.885 --> 00:10:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Or we'll try to heal
you in the ancient ways.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And he said, let's
try the ancient ways.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.740 align:middle line:84%
So they took this
guy, a paraplegic,

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:16.514 align:middle line:84%
to an ice-cold river and
threw him in over his head.

00:10:16.514 --> 00:10:18.180 align:middle line:84%
He said, he was more
angry at his elders

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:21.420 align:middle line:84%
than he was at the Nazis
who did this to him.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.199 align:middle line:90%
But it worked.

00:10:22.199 --> 00:10:23.490 align:middle line:90%
He walked for the rest of life.

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:26.990 align:middle line:84%
He took two pilgrimages by
foot to Mexico and back.

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:29.390 align:middle line:90%
But he was a painter.

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And after he died,
I visited his wife.

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:36.937 align:middle line:84%
Because he was very
interested in my work,

00:10:36.937 --> 00:10:37.770 align:middle line:90%
"Original Blessing."

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:39.186 align:middle line:84%
Because it connected
his Christian

00:10:39.186 --> 00:10:41.280 align:middle line:90%
and his Native American roots.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.790 align:middle line:90%
And I saw his paintings.

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:44.380 align:middle line:90%
She told me this story.

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:49.130 align:middle line:84%
She said, often dead artists
would come to my husband

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:49.660 align:middle line:90%
at night.

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:51.659 align:middle line:90%
And he would paint for them.

00:10:51.659 --> 00:10:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And then she went
and got a painting.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.462 align:middle line:84%
And immediately, I said,
well, that's Paul Klee.

00:10:55.462 --> 00:10:57.170 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, it
was signed Paul Klee.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.980 align:middle line:84%
She said, I remember the night
when Paul Klee came to him

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:01.797 align:middle line:90%
and dictated this painting.

00:11:01.797 --> 00:11:02.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.340 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: So all I'm
saying, is life,

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:06.340 align:middle line:84%
there's so many more
dimensions to life

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:07.770 align:middle line:90%
than television would tell us.

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:08.350 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:10.420 align:middle line:84%
It's not two-dimensional,
this life.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:11.330 align:middle line:90%
So there you go.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:15.042 align:middle line:84%
So Paul Klee's busy
coming to artists

00:11:15.042 --> 00:11:16.625 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the
night, right now.

00:11:16.625 --> 00:11:18.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So why not Meister
Eckhart coming to you

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.844 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the night?

00:11:19.844 --> 00:11:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And you are, really, at the
epicenter of the resurgence

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:26.870 align:middle line:90%
of this kind of mysticism.

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:28.536 align:middle line:84%
You've sold over a
couple million books.

00:11:28.536 --> 00:11:30.379 align:middle line:90%
That's huge.

00:11:30.379 --> 00:11:31.170 align:middle line:90%
That's really huge.

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:32.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people are
paying attention.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:33.701 align:middle line:90%
They're thirsty for this.

00:11:33.701 --> 00:11:35.421 align:middle line:90%
And it's not just Catholics.

00:11:35.421 --> 00:11:36.670 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Well, that's very true.

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:39.887 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's in
spite of Catholics.

00:11:39.887 --> 00:11:41.720 align:middle line:84%
It's wounded Catholics,
those who have left.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.094 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
and you had, also,

00:11:43.094 --> 00:11:47.600 align:middle line:84%
an experience of-- as we talked
about in our last interview--

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.640 align:middle line:84%
being, essentially,
excommunicated

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.410 align:middle line:84%
from the Dominican
Order by Ratzinger.

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, that is the
opposite of what

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.920 align:middle line:90%
we were just talking about.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.150 align:middle line:84%
These fertile
dimensions and fields

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:03.680 align:middle line:84%
where information has
a cycle and a time.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And there's a resurgence
of it when the time is here

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.180 align:middle line:84%
and when the
information is needed.

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:11.850 align:middle line:84%
That's not exactly how the
Catholic Church, you know,

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:13.749 align:middle line:90%
embraces their philosophy.

00:12:13.749 --> 00:12:15.040 align:middle line:90%
And I want to get to something.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.460 align:middle line:84%
Ratzinger, he was the one
that was responsible--

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:21.920 align:middle line:84%
because you were so
broad in your thinking

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.360 align:middle line:84%
and what you told--
I just want to give

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:28.440 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of background,
what happened under him.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.810 align:middle line:90%
Something was going on.

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And then we have a totally
different kind of pope now.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.742 align:middle line:84%
Well, somewhat
different, anyway.

00:12:33.742 --> 00:12:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And I would like
you comment on it.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:39.854 align:middle line:84%
So under Ratzinger-- when we're
talking about the divine trying

00:12:39.854 --> 00:12:40.645 align:middle line:90%
to make its way in.

00:12:40.645 --> 00:12:42.820 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, we
have repressive forces--

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.800 align:middle line:84%
his influence over
three million Germans--

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.530 align:middle line:84%
I have here-- left the Catholic
Church during that time.

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And the attendance
dropped by almost 90%.

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:52.770 align:middle line:90%
And he was German.

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:55.130 align:middle line:90%
What was going on?

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:57.280 align:middle line:84%
You're trying to bring
in the light of what

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.270 align:middle line:90%
we call the Rhineland Mystics.

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:00.670 align:middle line:90%
And he's trying to suppress you.

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:02.590 align:middle line:90%
He's trying to suppress that.

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:04.059 align:middle line:90%
But people felt it.

00:13:04.059 --> 00:13:05.350 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Definitely they felt it.

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And remember, I'm only
one of 105 theologians

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:15.020 align:middle line:84%
that they booted and
hounded and destroyed.

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:16.680 align:middle line:90%
So it was a policy.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And it began under
Pope John Paul II.

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And Ratzinger was
his hatchet man.

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:24.960 align:middle line:84%
But it continued, then, when
Ratzinger became pope too.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:25.860 align:middle line:90%
But I see it.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.450 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a book about this
called "The Pope's War," where

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:30.442 align:middle line:84%
I go through the history
of the last 34 years

00:13:30.442 --> 00:13:31.400 align:middle line:90%
of the Catholic Church.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.770 align:middle line:90%
And it's not pretty.

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:36.230 align:middle line:84%
But I came to this conclusion
that the Holy Spirit

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:37.240 align:middle line:90%
is behind this.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.920 align:middle line:84%
The Holy Spirit gave
us two very bad popes

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.820 align:middle line:84%
in order to destroy the
Catholic Church as we know it.

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:45.450 align:middle line:84%
So we can start
Christianity over.

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And today Christianity has
to travel much lighter.

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:51.680 align:middle line:84%
I say, we don't need
basilicas on our back.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.430 align:middle line:90%
Backpacks are enough.

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:55.180 align:middle line:84%
With the mystics
and the prophets,

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:57.400 align:middle line:84%
the Jesus teachings,
and that's what

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:04.366 align:middle line:84%
we need, to stir things and
assist the many transformations

00:14:04.366 --> 00:14:06.240 align:middle line:84%
that human beings have
to go through if we're

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.210 align:middle line:90%
going to survive as a species.

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:10.960 align:middle line:84%
Because frankly,
no betting person

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.560 align:middle line:84%
would put money on our
species at this time.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.350 align:middle line:90%
Because we're not in good shape.

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:19.500 align:middle line:84%
So we have to lighten
up our spiritual lives

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.970 align:middle line:90%
and travel with less baggage.

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I think the
Catholic Church, as we know it,

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:26.680 align:middle line:90%
is definitely going under.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:30.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even this pope, who is
a very decent man, remember,

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:34.490 align:middle line:84%
when he was Cardinal
in Argentina, only 10%

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:36.880 align:middle line:84%
of Argentinian Catholics
were practicing.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:40.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's not as if he got a lot
of people to go to church then.

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.450 align:middle line:90%
He's not naive.

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:43.090 align:middle line:84%
The point is not
going to church.

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:46.360 align:middle line:84%
The point is taking the
basic teachings of Jesus

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.994 align:middle line:90%
and making them work.

00:14:47.994 --> 00:14:50.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and that's
what I found interesting,

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.210 align:middle line:84%
is here we have,
at the same time,

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Ratzinger was having this
really dreadful influence.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:15:00.130 align:middle line:84%
And people were dropping away
from the church every day.

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:03.090 align:middle line:84%
That was the resurgence, also,
of not just the Rhineland

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:06.280 align:middle line:84%
Mystics, of Hildegard, the
work you're doing, but also

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.340 align:middle line:90%
of Hafiz and Rumi.

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:09.160 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: That's true.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:09.659 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:15:09.659 --> 00:15:11.260 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
liberation theology,

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.022 align:middle line:84%
which they went after tooth and
nail, with the help of the CIA.

00:15:14.022 --> 00:15:15.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tell us about that.

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:16.030 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:18.529 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Well, you see, liberation
theology from Latin America

00:15:18.529 --> 00:15:20.500 align:middle line:90%
was all about bringing justice.

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:23.600 align:middle line:84%
Many of the countries
back then, 30 years ago,

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.030 align:middle line:90%
were dictated by dictators.

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And the dictators, many
of them were propped up

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.780 align:middle line:84%
by the CIA and the
American government.

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And so the Christians there
started reading the Gospels

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:37.800 align:middle line:84%
more carefully about what
it said about justice

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.100 align:middle line:90%
and fairness and all.

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And they started their
own base communities

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.260 align:middle line:84%
outside the organized
institutional church.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:46.860 align:middle line:90%
And it became very strong.

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And they had
excellent theologians

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.730 align:middle line:90%
like Leonardo Boff and others.

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And of course, Oscar
Romero comes out

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:55.540 align:middle line:84%
of that tradition,
the bishop who

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:59.470 align:middle line:84%
was shot down in El
Salvador, who the new pope is

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:01.660 align:middle line:90%
about to declare a Saint.

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very
powerful movement.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:07.150 align:middle line:84%
But I prove, in my
book, "The Pope's War,"

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:10.760 align:middle line:84%
that when Ronald Reagan was made
president, three months later,

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:15.180 align:middle line:84%
the National Security Council
met in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And their whole week seminar was
how can we destroy liberation

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.120 align:middle line:90%
theology in Latin America?

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.850 align:middle line:84%
They concluded they
couldn't directly.

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:24.870 align:middle line:90%
But they could split the church.

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:28.350 align:middle line:84%
So they went after the
Pope, John Paul II,

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:31.710 align:middle line:84%
with all kinds of
money for solidarity.

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:34.480 align:middle line:84%
The head of CIA at the time
was a very right-wing Catholic.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:38.420 align:middle line:84%
He made 29 trips to the Vatican
with satchels full of cash.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:41.540 align:middle line:84%
Gave it to the pope, who give
it to solidarity in Poland.

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:44.120 align:middle line:84%
But in return, the pope went
after liberation theology

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:46.840 align:middle line:84%
in Latin America and
split the church there.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And but this new pope,
now, it's interesting,

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.110 align:middle line:84%
that he's canonizing
Oscar Romero,

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:56.220 align:middle line:84%
whereas the previous popes
didn't like him at all.

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And he's supporting the
first liberation theologian--

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:04.410 align:middle line:84%
who's now in his 80s--
had to flee South America.

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:06.520 align:middle line:84%
Because his
right-wing Cardinal--

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:10.240 align:middle line:84%
appointed by the previous
popes-- was after him.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.579 align:middle line:84%
So he's living his
last days in France

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:14.650 align:middle line:90%
with the French Dominicans.

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:16.630 align:middle line:84%
But this new pope
invited him to dinner.

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:18.298 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, that's a
statement, you know?

00:17:18.298 --> 00:17:20.089 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, he's
behaving a little more

00:17:20.089 --> 00:17:23.040 align:middle line:84%
like a warrior, which is going
to be a segue into Meister

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:23.540 align:middle line:90%
Eckhart.

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:25.530 align:middle line:90%
He is behaving more like that.

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:27.680 align:middle line:84%
He's coming out
against a lot having

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.140 align:middle line:84%
to do with the world of
finance and the banking system

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:30.640 align:middle line:90%
as it is.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.390 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Absolutely.

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:32.890 align:middle line:84%
He talks about
savage capitalism.

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And of course, being
a third world person,

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:38.722 align:middle line:84%
he knows the price that
one pays down there for--

00:17:38.722 --> 00:17:40.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tough
times in Argentina.

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:40.805 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Exactly.

00:17:40.805 --> 00:17:43.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, here, in
the United States,

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:47.820 align:middle line:84%
Main Street took a hit from Wall
Street, with the last crash.

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:52.190 align:middle line:84%
But imagine if you're living
that circumstance all the time.

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:55.010 align:middle line:84%
Which is what a lot of
third world is undergoing.

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:57.980 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, this pope is very
strong in that domain.

00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:59.455 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
there's also, now,

00:17:59.455 --> 00:18:05.171 align:middle line:84%
a very big backlash from
right-wing forces against that.

00:18:05.171 --> 00:18:07.670 align:middle line:84%
But that's just proof that he's
saying something worthwhile.

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:07.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He is.

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And on the other hand, we
have to look at it honestly.

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:14.490 align:middle line:84%
He's still not for the allowance
of birth control still.

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:16.490 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, just to put
it in proper perspective,

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:17.400 align:middle line:90%
he's doing his best.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.191 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Right, he still
has things to learn.

00:18:19.191 --> 00:18:21.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But he still
has things to learn.

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: And a lot of them
have to do with women.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:23.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
was going to say,

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:25.580 align:middle line:84%
not in alignment with
Hildegard, maybe, just yet.

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:27.413 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's your job,
is to bring Hildegard

00:18:27.413 --> 00:18:28.405 align:middle line:90%
to his consciousness.

00:18:28.405 --> 00:18:29.790 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: That's true.

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:31.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, even Francis,
the name he took,

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.810 align:middle line:84%
you know, Francis, of
course, famous for ecology

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:34.970 align:middle line:90%
and for the poor.

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:36.600 align:middle line:84%
But there's a third
thing about Francis

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.220 align:middle line:90%
that he rarely mentions.

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:41.170 align:middle line:84%
Francis had this gender
justice in his psyche.

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:44.225 align:middle line:84%
It comes out in his brilliant
poem about Brother Sun

00:18:44.225 --> 00:18:45.520 align:middle line:90%
and Sister Moon.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.780 align:middle line:84%
Each stanza in the poem
goes from the feminine

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:50.060 align:middle line:84%
to the masculine, the
feminine to the masculine.

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:53.470 align:middle line:84%
Mother Earth and Sister
Water and all this.

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:57.960 align:middle line:84%
So Francis, his namesake,
had this inner sense

00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.580 align:middle line:90%
of gender justice.

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.024 align:middle line:90%
This pope has to learn that.

00:19:01.024 --> 00:19:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so he hasn't
embraced that third aspect yet.

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.981 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: He hasn't
understood that yet.

00:19:04.981 --> 00:19:06.780 align:middle line:84%
It's hard for Jesuits
to understand that.

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:08.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I would think so.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.175 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Ignatius, the founder
of the Jesuits, was a soldier.

00:19:10.175 --> 00:19:10.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:11.060 align:middle line:90%
Very militant.

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.362 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: And he was 16th century.

00:19:12.362 --> 00:19:12.945 align:middle line:90%
Very militant.

00:19:12.945 --> 00:19:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And the 16th century was the
most patriarchal century ever.

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:16.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:17.786 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: And so it's very hard.

00:19:17.786 --> 00:19:18.910 align:middle line:90%
There are no women Jesuits.

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:21.614 align:middle line:84%
There are women Benedictines
and women Dominicans

00:19:21.614 --> 00:19:22.280 align:middle line:90%
and Franciscans.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:23.800 align:middle line:90%
There are no women Jesuits.

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.780 align:middle line:84%
So there's some catch
up he has to do there.

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:26.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There's some catch up.

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.480 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now, we'll make
the Warrior segue.

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:32.100 align:middle line:84%
Because Meister Eckhart,
you refer to him

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:34.450 align:middle line:90%
as a mystic warrior.

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:36.440 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about why
you call him that.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about his
early life coming through.

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:42.990 align:middle line:90%
And set the stage for him.

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:49.690 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Well, I think he's a
Warrior because he's strong.

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:53.990 align:middle line:84%
He's like the Green Man is
here to defend Mother Earth.

00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:58.730 align:middle line:84%
So I think he's here to
defend good causes, the Divine

00:19:58.730 --> 00:19:59.690 align:middle line:90%
Feminine.

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:02.130 align:middle line:84%
He's explicit about the
feminine side of God.

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And for a man to be that
way, in the Middle Ages,

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.180 align:middle line:90%
was quite unique.

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:09.680 align:middle line:84%
He says, for example, what
does God do all day long?

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:13.010 align:middle line:84%
God lies on a maternity
bed giving birth, he says.

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:17.120 align:middle line:84%
So for him, creativity is at
the very core of the universe.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Which is, of course,
today's science.

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:23.710 align:middle line:84%
We now know that a star is
being born every 15 seconds.

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:26.450 align:middle line:84%
How different that is from
the mechanical universe we

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:28.300 align:middle line:84%
had in the modern
era, when we were

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:31.570 align:middle line:84%
told the sky was inert
and dead and all the rest.

00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:33.550 align:middle line:84%
But no, there's all
this birthing going on.

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:37.284 align:middle line:84%
Well, Eckhart intuited that as
a mystic seven centuries ago.

00:20:37.284 --> 00:20:39.575 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, how much was
he influenced by Hildegard?

00:20:39.575 --> 00:20:44.099 align:middle line:90%


00:20:44.099 --> 00:20:45.640 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: He wasn't
much more influenced

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.730 align:middle line:84%
by the Beguines, which was a
women's movement of his day.

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:50.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure that
he read Hildegard.

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:52.290 align:middle line:84%
If he did, I don't
think he read a lot.

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:55.820 align:middle line:84%
Again, she had been kind of
put on the shelf, if you will.

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:56.778 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:20:56.778 --> 00:20:57.690 align:middle line:84%
The church had
excommunicated her as well.

00:20:57.690 --> 00:20:59.130 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: After she died, yeah.

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:03.850 align:middle line:84%
But he was very involved
in the Beguine movement,

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:05.320 align:middle line:90%
which was the women's movement.

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.350 align:middle line:84%
In his day, women
had two choices.

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:10.970 align:middle line:84%
Be a nun in a convent,
locked up in a convent.

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:12.790 align:middle line:90%
Or be married.

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:15.280 align:middle line:84%
The Beguines carved
their own way,

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.450 align:middle line:84%
which they lived in
community with other women.

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:19.280 align:middle line:90%
They did not take formal vows.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:23.690 align:middle line:84%
But they developed a very
vernacular spirituality,

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:24.290 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:27.710 align:middle line:84%
They were reading the
scriptures and the vernacular.

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:29.050 align:middle line:90%
They were working.

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:30.130 align:middle line:90%
They were artisans.

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:31.060 align:middle line:90%
They were working.

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:32.450 align:middle line:90%
They were making stained glass.

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:36.521 align:middle line:84%
Or they were making pottery
and so forth, sewing.

00:21:36.521 --> 00:21:37.770 align:middle line:90%
And they worked with the poor.

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:39.470 align:middle line:90%
They worked with the young.

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And they were at the
edge, you might say.

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And they were considered very
dangerous by the patriarchy.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.650 align:middle line:84%
One pope, the same
pope that condemned

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Eckhart, John the XXII,
condemned the Beguines

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:57.040 align:middle line:90%
17 different times.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Which tells you, hey, this
wasn't exactly working, was it?

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:00.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.400 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Out, out,
damn spot, 17 times.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.639 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you too, out.

00:22:03.639 --> 00:22:04.680 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Yeah, and you too.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:06.440 align:middle line:84%
When that guy died,
that pope, there

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:08.150 align:middle line:84%
were hundreds of
thousands of Beguines

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:11.300 align:middle line:84%
flourishing all over Europe,
especially northern Europe.

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And these were some
very bold, intelligent women.

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:14.170 align:middle line:90%
Well positioned too.

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:14.670 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Yes.

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:16.970 align:middle line:84%
Although, most of them
came from lower classes.

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:19.430 align:middle line:84%
So they weren't as
well educated as,

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:21.430 align:middle line:90%
like, Hildegard's women were.

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:25.370 align:middle line:84%
But yes, they got
themselves educated.

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And they hung out with the
Dominicans and the Franciscans.

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:31.160 align:middle line:84%
Which, at that time,
were a new orders.

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And so this was kind
of an edgy thing to do.

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:36.180 align:middle line:84%
And there was one woman,
Marguerite Porete,

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:36.950 align:middle line:90%
who was a writer.

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:38.035 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I was
going to get into her.

00:22:38.035 --> 00:22:38.940 align:middle line:90%
Please.

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:40.810 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: A French
writer, theologian.

00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:45.660 align:middle line:84%
And she was burned at the
stake in Paris in 1210.

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:49.629 align:middle line:84%
And a year later,
Eckhart moved to Paris.

00:22:49.629 --> 00:22:50.920 align:middle line:90%
It was his third time in Paris.

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.430 align:middle line:90%


00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think he was really
upset by what happened to her.

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And he left the next
year and never came back.

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:04.940 align:middle line:84%
But curiously, a Dominican
in whose convent he lived

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:08.290 align:middle line:84%
was the inquisitor who got
Marguerite Porete burned

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:09.520 align:middle line:90%
at the stake.

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.560 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very
likely that he took

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.675 align:middle line:84%
Marguerite's book with him,
or at least copied it down.

00:23:14.675 --> 00:23:15.260 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:18.030 align:middle line:84%
Because we now know that in
one of his most famous sermons,

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:20.630 align:middle line:84%
he's actually quoting
Marguerite Porete.

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:22.010 align:middle line:90%
Now, think about that.

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:24.617 align:middle line:84%
That's warriorhood, how
courageous that was.

00:23:24.617 --> 00:23:26.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, most people
would slink away

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.400 align:middle line:84%
from someone who's just
been burned at the stake.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:31.570 align:middle line:90%
He went around quoting her.

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:36.160 align:middle line:84%
What can I say an accolade that
is, to this woman theologian,

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:41.030 align:middle line:84%
that this male
theologian was quoting

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:42.157 align:middle line:90%
her the rest of his life?

00:23:42.157 --> 00:23:42.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:43.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:46.340 align:middle line:84%
She was, like Hildegard, a
very brave outspoken woman.

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:47.980 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: She was very brave.

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And her whole book is
about a church of love

00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:55.220 align:middle line:90%
instead of a church of power.

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And she talks about
two different churches,

00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:59.700 align:middle line:84%
the Church of Love and
the Church of Hierarchy.

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:02.360 align:middle line:90%
And so she, too, was a Reformer.

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:05.120 align:middle line:84%
This was 200 years
before Luther.

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And she was trying to
rattle those cages.

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And interesting, too, when they
burned her, they asked her,

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:13.450 align:middle line:84%
do you want some
drugs or something?

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:14.180 align:middle line:90%
No, she said.

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:15.782 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She didn't
receive any help.

00:24:15.782 --> 00:24:17.240 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: She didn't
receive any help.

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.087 align:middle line:90%
And she didn't ask.

00:24:18.087 --> 00:24:18.920 align:middle line:90%
She didn't want any.

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:20.644 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:24:20.644 --> 00:24:21.560 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing story.

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:22.410 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: She showed
amazing courage.

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:23.440 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing story.

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's only recently that
we have the whole story.

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:28.690 align:middle line:84%
Only recently have we been able
to prove that that book was

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:29.680 align:middle line:90%
written by her.

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:32.190 align:middle line:84%
For centuries, they thought
it was written by a man.

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The name
of the book again?

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.792 align:middle line:90%
If you remember it, offhand?

00:24:36.792 --> 00:24:37.500 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: I'm sorry.

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:38.170 align:middle line:90%
I didn't look it up.

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:39.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because I didn't
write it down, here, either.

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:40.200 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: OK.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.116 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You have it?

00:24:41.116 --> 00:24:42.520 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: The book
is called "Mirror

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:46.320 align:middle line:84%
of the Simple Annihilated
Souls for Those That Tarry

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:49.520 align:middle line:84%
Solely in Desiring
and Demanding Love."

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:50.920 align:middle line:90%
Kind of a long title.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:55.440 align:middle line:84%
But notice, "Mirror the Simple,
Those Who Desire and Demand

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.250 align:middle line:90%
Love."

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:58.124 align:middle line:90%
That's the name of her book.

00:24:58.124 --> 00:25:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that would be
enough to get you burned,

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:03.330 align:middle line:84%
when you have a story
about love, right?

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And let's go back,
now, to Eckhart.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:08.030 align:middle line:84%
Because I have one
of those quotes

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:10.805 align:middle line:84%
you were talking
about, compassion.

00:25:10.805 --> 00:25:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And I have one of the quotes
I've written down here

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:14.290 align:middle line:90%
that I particularly liked.

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:18.530 align:middle line:90%
But he stated God is compassion.

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:21.650 align:middle line:84%
So with compassion, if
love was a central theme

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:24.350 align:middle line:84%
for her and for
Hildegard, compassion

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:26.139 align:middle line:84%
was a central theme
for Eckhart, right?

00:25:26.139 --> 00:25:26.930 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Yes, it was.

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:27.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:28.860 align:middle line:84%
So this particular
quote says, "We

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:31.090 align:middle line:84%
are compassionate
like the father when

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:32.120 align:middle line:90%
we are compassionate.

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.970 align:middle line:84%
Not from passion,
not from impulse,

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:37.450 align:middle line:84%
but from deliberate choice
and reasonable decision.

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:40.580 align:middle line:84%
The passion does not take
the lead but follows.

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:45.140 align:middle line:90%
Does not rule but serves."

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:45.880 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Yes.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:49.360 align:middle line:84%
He has another place where
he talks about passion.

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:58.260 align:middle line:84%
He says that we should put the
bridle of love on our passions.

00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:01.010 align:middle line:84%
He says, that will
carry you much further

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:04.715 align:middle line:84%
than repressing them
or putting them down.

00:26:04.715 --> 00:26:05.590 align:middle line:90%
And notice the image.

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:07.580 align:middle line:84%
A bridle, of course, is
a steering instrument

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:08.690 align:middle line:90%
for a stallion.

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:08.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, of our passions.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.293 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: He's saying, we all
have a stallion inside of us.

00:26:11.293 --> 00:26:12.390 align:middle line:90%
It's a wonderful thing.

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:14.040 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
lock it in the barn.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:16.484 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to do
asceticism and beat it up.

00:26:16.484 --> 00:26:18.400 align:middle line:84%
But you have to be smarter
than your passions.

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:18.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Guide it wisely.

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:20.010 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: You've got guide it.

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:21.872 align:middle line:84%
You have to guide it and not
let it run away with you.

00:26:21.872 --> 00:26:21.920 align:middle line:90%
Just like a horse.

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.461 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that
was a common theme,

00:26:23.461 --> 00:26:25.610 align:middle line:84%
it sounds like, with
these Rhineland Mystics.

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:26.450 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Yes.

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:27.080 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:29.790 align:middle line:90%
They were not afraid of passion.

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:32.410 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: They saw
its positive side.

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And again, I give the
Celts credit for that.

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:38.000 align:middle line:90%
That's Celtic spirituality.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.400 align:middle line:90%
There's a wildness to it.

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:41.775 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you've ever been
to the west coast of Ireland,

00:26:41.775 --> 00:26:45.350 align:middle line:84%
there's a wildness to the
wind and to the weather,

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:47.280 align:middle line:90%
just to survive over there.

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's part of the
gift of the Celtic Christianity

00:26:54.240 --> 00:27:00.010 align:middle line:84%
was lost when order became
more important than chaos.

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:01.930 align:middle line:84%
How do we balance
order and chaos?

00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:03.410 align:middle line:90%
That's really the question.

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And the danger is that
we want to control chaos.

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:08.760 align:middle line:84%
That's what all
Fundamentalism is trying

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.160 align:middle line:90%
to control the Goddess Chaos.

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and feminine
is the chaotic principle.

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:12.210 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Pardon me?

00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:13.668 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the
ancient teachings,

00:27:13.668 --> 00:27:15.260 align:middle line:84%
the feminine is the
chaotic principle.

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:15.980 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Exactly.

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's the goddess
in the goddess times.

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:21.860 align:middle line:90%
It was honored and necessary.

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:25.260 align:middle line:84%
But whenever patriarchy
takes over in Fundamentalism,

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:29.027 align:middle line:84%
it always thinks its job is
to control the goddess chaos.

00:27:29.027 --> 00:27:30.110 align:middle line:90%
And then what do you have?

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:31.510 align:middle line:90%
You have no creativity left.

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:33.761 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, then you get
that dry as toast doctrine.

00:27:33.761 --> 00:27:34.635 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Well, exactly.

00:27:34.635 --> 00:27:35.940 align:middle line:90%
You get law and order.

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:37.540 align:middle line:90%
And nothing else.

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:38.356 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:38.356 --> 00:27:39.480 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: And you get fascism.

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:41.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, fascism.

00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And another thing that's
interesting about him,

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:48.220 align:middle line:84%
is in a lot of the
religious doctrines,

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:50.110 align:middle line:90%
it's the light of God.

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:53.990 align:middle line:84%
And he was saying that
the essence of God

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:55.480 align:middle line:90%
comes from the dark.

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, take some time and
explain what this means.

00:27:57.930 --> 00:28:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And I definitely get
that, when you're

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:05.240 align:middle line:84%
looking at the notion of the
feminine principle, chaos,

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:07.470 align:middle line:84%
fertile ground for giving
birth and so forth.

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:09.370 align:middle line:90%
What does it actually mean?

00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Well, it's all
those things and more.

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:15.160 align:middle line:84%
It also applies to the
new science and cosmology

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.020 align:middle line:90%
that we're talking now about.

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:19.190 align:middle line:84%
Dark matter and dark
energy constitute

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:22.319 align:middle line:84%
98% of all the energy
in the universe.

00:28:22.319 --> 00:28:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And we don't even
know what they are.

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:25.370 align:middle line:84%
But that's what
science is saying.

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know,
yet, what it is.

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:30.110 align:middle line:90%
Because it is dark.

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:33.010 align:middle line:84%
So there's this return
of darkness, today,

00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:34.750 align:middle line:84%
to our psyches, and
it's coming through.

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:38.000 align:middle line:84%
For example, many people
are having experiences

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.130 align:middle line:90%
with the Black Madonna.

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And not just Christian
people but others.

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And what does a Black
Madonna represent

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:48.410 align:middle line:90%
archetypally and universally?

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:50.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, again, the
darkness of the soil,

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:53.080 align:middle line:90%
the darkness of the universe.

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Astronauts and cosmonauts
have gone up into the sky

00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:01.700 align:middle line:84%
and come back mystics-- and
I talked to some of them--

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:04.430 align:middle line:84%
because the experience of
silence and darkness up there,

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:06.230 align:middle line:90%
it makes them mystics.

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:09.360 align:middle line:84%
So this is what is called,
traditionally, the Apophatic

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:12.080 align:middle line:90%
Divinity, the god of darkness.

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:15.350 align:middle line:84%
Eckhart says "God is
super essential darkness

00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:16.420 align:middle line:90%
who has no name.

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:18.350 align:middle line:90%
It will never be given a name."

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:21.830 align:middle line:84%
So there's a sense of
mystery that we're not

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:24.720 align:middle line:90%
in control of the divine.

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:27.150 align:middle line:90%
And the divine is unnameable.

00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:28.640 align:middle line:90%
It's often dark.

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.810 align:middle line:10%
Of course, we also can go
through our own dark nights

00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:32.890 align:middle line:10%
of the soul.

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:35.890 align:middle line:10%
I think, today, our species
is in a collective dark night,

00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:37.030 align:middle line:10%
dark night of our species.

00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:39.800 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't know
what's coming next.

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.610 align:middle line:90%
We don't have the answers.

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And the mystics
that'll teach us,

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:46.870 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot to learn
in this dark night.

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:49.500 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot to learn
about this wisdom, not just

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:50.090 align:middle line:90%
knowledge.

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:51.950 align:middle line:90%
And that's about compassion.

00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And now, Thich Nhat Hanh,
the Buddhist theologian monk

00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:00.720 align:middle line:84%
says that he loves the
Apophatic Divinity,

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.020 align:middle line:90%
the divinity of darkness.

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:04.450 align:middle line:84%
He says, when
Christians recover it,

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:07.800 align:middle line:84%
then we'll learn anew the real
treasures in Christianity.

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:10.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It just made
so much sense to me.

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:12.110 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: And no one
knows it better,

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:15.250 align:middle line:84%
has spoken of it more
than Eckhart, in the west.

00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:17.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he's so at home with
this Apophatic Divinity.

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:18.420 align:middle line:90%
But he has both.

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:20.470 align:middle line:84%
He has a god of
light, the Cataphatic,

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:22.000 align:middle line:90%
and the god of darkness.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.780 align:middle line:84%
But he really--
what should I say--

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:27.959 align:middle line:84%
speaks out on the
god of darkness.

00:30:27.959 --> 00:30:29.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
it's interesting.

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:32.010 align:middle line:84%
Because when you get into
a lot of the new physics,

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:34.510 align:middle line:84%
for example, you're
talking black hole theory.

00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:36.990 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about
some of them saying,

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:40.180 align:middle line:84%
not only is it not a
void, it's a plenum.

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:43.560 align:middle line:84%
You look at the
energy, maybe even

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:46.690 align:middle line:84%
taking into the realm
of entity, super entity

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:50.690 align:middle line:84%
behind the sun, which is
what we see as a simple spark

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:55.400 align:middle line:84%
or expression, that has risen
from this dark well of all that

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.610 align:middle line:90%
creates.

00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing
when you look the soil.

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:00.680 align:middle line:90%
Every seed is planted in that.

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And on a personal
level, I used to feel

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:07.200 align:middle line:84%
something was, maybe, wrong
with me and my meditations.

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.640 align:middle line:84%
Because I didn't go into
a light-filled place.

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:12.400 align:middle line:84%
But where I did go,
and always have gone,

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:16.140 align:middle line:84%
was this beautiful,
quiet, dark field,

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:19.130 align:middle line:84%
where everything existed
and nothing all at once.

00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:21.780 align:middle line:84%
Completely quiet,
peaceful, and beautiful.

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, how come
we can't see the light?

00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:26.090 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: That's beautiful.

00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:26.756 align:middle line:90%
That's powerful.

00:31:26.756 --> 00:31:28.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yet, everything
was already there.

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:31.780 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Eckhart says the
ground of the soul is dark.

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:33.140 align:middle line:90%
And that's where you traveled.

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:33.780 align:middle line:90%
Good for you.

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:34.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
where I go, yeah.

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: But again, the
ground, the ocean is dark.

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:37.920 align:middle line:90%
The ground of the sky is dark.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:38.770 align:middle line:90%
The ground of the soil is dark.

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:39.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: So why are we
so afraid of darkness?

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's why I
wanted to bring this part

00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:43.530 align:middle line:90%
of the conversation up.

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:43.820 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Yes.

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:45.486 align:middle line:84%
Well, you see, the
modern era, remember,

00:31:45.486 --> 00:31:48.120 align:middle line:84%
it was launched with
the "Enlightenment."

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:49.940 align:middle line:90%
We call it the Enlightenment.

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:51.770 align:middle line:90%
And it's left brained.

00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:52.557 align:middle line:90%
It's knowledge.

00:31:52.557 --> 00:31:53.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:54.040 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: And that's a good thing.

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:56.000 align:middle line:84%
We want the lights on to
read books and write them

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:56.830 align:middle line:90%
and all the rest.

00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:58.420 align:middle line:90%
But there's this other thing.

00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:00.070 align:middle line:84%
It's what you meet
in a sweat lodge,

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:02.260 align:middle line:84%
for example, where
it's utterly dark.

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's back to
the womb, literally.

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:05.532 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was just going to
say, the darkness of the womb,

00:32:05.532 --> 00:32:06.032 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:32:06.032 --> 00:32:07.990 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: For nine months,
we lived in the dark.

00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:09.990 align:middle line:90%
And it was fine.

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And so a healthy
mysticism has ways

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:14.840 align:middle line:84%
to bring you back
to that darkness,

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.200 align:middle line:84%
just like you found
in your meditation.

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's in the darkness
that we feel oneness.

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And you don't see
difference in the darkness.

00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:25.630 align:middle line:90%
You see unity in the darkness.

00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:27.297 align:middle line:90%
And you feel it.

00:32:27.297 --> 00:32:28.380 align:middle line:90%
It's not really seeing it.

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:28.520 align:middle line:90%
You feel it.

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, everything
exists there already,

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:31.860 align:middle line:90%
in pure quietude.

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:32.800 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Exactly.

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:35.840 align:middle line:84%
So wonderful, you've
already made this journey.

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:37.400 align:middle line:84%
You and Eckhart are
on the same page.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:38.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I don't know
that we're on the same page.

00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:40.570 align:middle line:90%
But that's where I go.

00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:42.330 align:middle line:90%
That's where I have always gone.

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:42.500 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: That's a
good place to go.

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I've
always loved it.

00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:44.368 align:middle line:90%
I've loved the feeling.

00:32:44.368 --> 00:32:46.690 align:middle line:90%
But really, I thought, where?

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Other people see
this blinding light.

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:50.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm not seeing this
blinding light.

00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:51.560 align:middle line:90%
It might be uncomfortable even.

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:52.560 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:55.289 align:middle line:90%
OK, so now, let's go further.

00:32:55.289 --> 00:32:56.080 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: That's true.

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:57.038 align:middle line:90%
Just to make one point.

00:32:57.038 --> 00:32:57.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:01.020 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Hildegard's mysticism
was much more light oriented.

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:02.547 align:middle line:84%
She talked about
the living light.

00:33:02.547 --> 00:33:03.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:05.890 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: And her illuminations,
what she calls her paintings

00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:07.110 align:middle line:90%
and visions.

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:10.460 align:middle line:84%
So she was much more of
a light-oriented mystic.

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:12.570 align:middle line:84%
She does not talk a
whole lot about the dark.

00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:15.320 align:middle line:84%
Whereas Eckhart talks
a lot about the dark.

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:17.520 align:middle line:84%
So you have more in common,
really, with Eckhart

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:19.037 align:middle line:84%
than with Hildegard
in that regard.

00:33:19.037 --> 00:33:19.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:21.510 align:middle line:84%
But the whole thing
with vision, she

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:24.260 align:middle line:84%
had this encroachment
of light and such

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:25.880 align:middle line:90%
that was always present.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.420 align:middle line:84%
So when she started
having visions,

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:29.060 align:middle line:84%
now that's a little
different thing.

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:31.550 align:middle line:84%
Visions aren't the same as
going to this wonderful field,

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:32.330 align:middle line:90%
for me.

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:34.163 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Exactly, the
visions are about light.

00:33:34.163 --> 00:33:38.680 align:middle line:84%
She called the encounter
with the living light.

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:39.180 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:39.763 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:39.763 --> 00:33:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And even if one starts
to go unconscious,

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:43.760 align:middle line:84%
the first thing you
see is loads of light

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:45.914 align:middle line:90%
flooding the field of vision.

00:33:45.914 --> 00:33:47.580 align:middle line:84%
Which is an interesting--
because you're

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:50.410 align:middle line:84%
in an interface between a
conscious and unconscious

00:33:50.410 --> 00:33:51.400 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:54.350 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, all of it, the
play of the light and dark,

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:55.320 align:middle line:90%
is fascinating.

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:56.070 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Absolutely.

00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:57.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And beauty
comes from all of it.

00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:00.980 align:middle line:84%
But I agree with you, not
to be afraid of the notion

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:02.620 align:middle line:90%
of a beautiful dark field.

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:03.470 align:middle line:90%
It's the cosmos.

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:04.680 align:middle line:90%
It's everything.

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:05.860 align:middle line:90%
We all come from it.

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:06.360 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Yes.

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:07.230 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:10.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so this
statement, I absolutely love.

00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:12.710 align:middle line:84%
This is from Thomas Aquinas,
which is just beautiful.

00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:16.080 align:middle line:84%
"Humans are capable
of the universe."

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:18.179 align:middle line:84%
And this is a theme
that Eckhart played on.

00:34:18.179 --> 00:34:19.260 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Yes.

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:19.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What does that mean?

00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:22.186 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Remember, both Aquinas
and Eckhart were Dominicans.

00:34:22.186 --> 00:34:24.610 align:middle line:84%
So Eckhart knew
Aquinas very well.

00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:26.610 align:middle line:84%
Though Aquinas was under
a cloud his whole life.

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:30.080 align:middle line:90%
Because Aquinas was condemned.

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:32.900 align:middle line:84%
After he died, three
bishops condemned him.

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:34.976 align:middle line:84%
So the Dominicans, to
their credit, they fought.

00:34:34.976 --> 00:34:36.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The only way
you can trust a guy is

00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:37.634 align:middle line:90%
if he's been condemned.

00:34:37.634 --> 00:34:38.271 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Well, that's right.

00:34:38.271 --> 00:34:40.104 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think that's
what's rising here.

00:34:40.104 --> 00:34:42.940 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: And in fact, Eckhart's
trial, at the end of his life,

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:46.060 align:middle line:84%
many scholars relate to the
fact that Aquinas had just

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:47.880 align:middle line:90%
been canonized a saint.

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.699 align:middle line:84%
And the Franciscans
didn't like this.

00:34:49.699 --> 00:34:51.820 align:middle line:84%
Because their man wasn't
canonized a saint.

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:53.770 align:middle line:84%
So the Franciscans
were the first ones

00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:55.800 align:middle line:90%
to call a trial against Eckhart.

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:58.220 align:middle line:84%
So people put the
two together, that it

00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:02.320 align:middle line:84%
was Aquinas' canonization
that got Eckhart in trouble.

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:04.540 align:middle line:84%
So besides everything
he was saying.

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:05.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Besides
everything he was saying.

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:07.160 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: They were all other
Christs, for example.

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But let's
talk about this notion

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:12.960 align:middle line:84%
that humans are a unique
species in the cosmos

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.220 align:middle line:90%
and on this planet.

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And I've often wondered,
even in the passages

00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:18.700 align:middle line:84%
in the Bible,
biblical references,

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:23.760 align:middle line:84%
as the Son of God, meaning is
that maybe not a broader term

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:27.521 align:middle line:84%
having to do with this
incredible human expression?

00:35:27.521 --> 00:35:28.270 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Absolutely.

00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:31.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, biblical
scholars today all agree

00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:33.790 align:middle line:84%
that Jesus is not
only the Son of God.

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:39.590 align:middle line:84%
In Israel, before Jesus, Israel
itself was called Son of God,

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:41.380 align:middle line:84%
and individuals were
called Son of God.

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:43.860 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who's living
a life of wisdom,

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:45.660 align:middle line:84%
in the Jewish
tradition, is a "Son

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:47.570 align:middle line:90%
of God" or "Daughter of God".

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea that only
Jesus is the Son of God,

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:53.330 align:middle line:84%
this came, again, in
the fourth century

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:55.180 align:middle line:90%
with the Council of Nicaea.

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it
was very political.

00:35:57.130 --> 00:35:59.140 align:middle line:84%
That consulate was
called by the emperor.

00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted order in
the empire and all that.

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:05.690 align:middle line:84%
But Jesus didn't go around
calling himself a son of God.

00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:09.270 align:middle line:84%
But he was called the
Son of God because people

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:12.964 align:middle line:84%
recognized he was living
out a life of wisdom.

00:36:12.964 --> 00:36:14.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the
larger reference

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:15.505 align:middle line:90%
is, too, the human species.

00:36:15.505 --> 00:36:16.796 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: It's a larger reference.

00:36:16.796 --> 00:36:17.330 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:17.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And to our capacity, to
be carriers of the divine

00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:21.800 align:middle line:90%
compassion.

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.383 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, like
this says, humans

00:36:23.383 --> 00:36:25.175 align:middle line:90%
are capable of the universe.

00:36:25.175 --> 00:36:25.770 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Capable of the universe.

00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Spend a little time
explaining that and talking

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:29.149 align:middle line:90%
about that in principle.

00:36:29.149 --> 00:36:31.770 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Well, today, for
example, I mean, we're

00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:34.200 align:middle line:84%
picking up sounds from
the original fireball

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:35.597 align:middle line:90%
13.8 billion years ago.

00:36:35.597 --> 00:36:37.430 align:middle line:84%
That's the universe
talking to us, isn't it?

00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:38.138 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:36:38.138 --> 00:36:41.880 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: We're picking up pictures
of the edge of the universe.

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:45.930 align:middle line:84%
And you know, before long,
the universe is expanding.

00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
go over the horizon.

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:50.350 align:middle line:84%
We are living at
this remarkable time

00:36:50.350 --> 00:36:53.980 align:middle line:84%
in the history of the
universe and this planet,

00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:58.130 align:middle line:84%
where we humans can actually
see the edge of the universe.

00:36:58.130 --> 00:37:02.050 align:middle line:84%
Because in a while, it's
going to go over the edge.

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:03.760 align:middle line:84%
No one will be able
to see it again.

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:07.050 align:middle line:90%
So we're capable, obviously.

00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What does that mean,
we are capable of the universe?

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:12.320 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Well, that we're
made for something very big.

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:17.780 align:middle line:84%
We're not here just for
television and a good meal.

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And building pyramids
for our children.

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:21.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you
for the reminder, yes.

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:23.740 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: That we're capable
of the whole universe.

00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:27.530 align:middle line:84%
That we have this big
soul that will never

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:33.820 align:middle line:84%
be satisfied without some
cosmic food and nourishment.

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And, again, this is
Aquinas' teaching.

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:40.320 align:middle line:90%
Again, it's premodern teaching.

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:43.570 align:middle line:84%
In many ways, indigenous
people say the same thing.

00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:46.530 align:middle line:84%
That, for example, an
aboriginal in Australia

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:50.010 align:middle line:84%
said to me one night, he
said, the stars, he said,

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:53.590 align:middle line:84%
we don't teach our children
that those are stars up there.

00:37:53.590 --> 00:37:56.790 align:middle line:84%
We say, these are the
campfires of our ancestors

00:37:56.790 --> 00:38:00.310 align:middle line:84%
who are looking down at us to
see what's cooking on earth.

00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:03.060 align:middle line:84%
So notice, they
personalize the universe.

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:05.245 align:middle line:90%
A star is not just an object.

00:38:05.245 --> 00:38:06.860 align:middle line:90%
It's a campfire.

00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And notice, in that
effort to blend and make

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:17.160 align:middle line:84%
a family of ourselves and
the rest of the universe.

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:19.480 align:middle line:84%
This is an ancient quest in
the human heart and soul.

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:21.786 align:middle line:90%
We want to feel that we belong.

00:38:21.786 --> 00:38:23.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
Eckhart started.

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:26.470 align:middle line:84%
But we belong to the whole,
to something very vast.

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And today, of course,
we're learning

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:29.616 align:middle line:84%
about the universe,
how old it is,

00:38:29.616 --> 00:38:33.510 align:middle line:84%
and how busy it is birthing,
and how vast it is.

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:35.760 align:middle line:90%
This is all part of us.

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.270 align:middle line:90%
We drink this stuff in.

00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:38.580 align:middle line:90%
We're curious.

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:40.590 align:middle line:90%
We want to know our origins.

00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:42.150 align:middle line:90%
And it's all holy.

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And this is part of
the cosmic Christ, too,

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:47.330 align:middle line:90%
that the Christ is that big.

00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:49.220 align:middle line:84%
Or the Buddha
nature is that big.

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a way of kind
of talking about it as, well,

00:38:53.090 --> 00:38:54.590 align:middle line:84%
as Hildegard does,
that we're being

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:57.730 align:middle line:84%
our hugged by the arms of
the mystery of the universe.

00:38:57.730 --> 00:39:01.436 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How did
he describe soul?

00:39:01.436 --> 00:39:02.060 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Aquinas?

00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:02.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Eckhart.

00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:03.390 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Eckhart.

00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:05.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, for one thing, he
and Aquinas both said,

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:06.757 align:middle line:90%
the soul is not in the body.

00:39:06.757 --> 00:39:07.715 align:middle line:90%
The body's in the soul.

00:39:07.715 --> 00:39:09.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I like this part.

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:09.995 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: I like it too.

00:39:09.995 --> 00:39:11.610 align:middle line:84%
Because it's about
the expansion.

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And Eckhart, time
and again, he says,

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:18.310 align:middle line:84%
God is delighted to
watch your soul enlarge.

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:20.540 align:middle line:90%
So he's really for expansion.

00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And at one point,
I think it's one

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:24.240 align:middle line:90%
of his most important sermons.

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:28.290 align:middle line:84%
He says, it's very hard
to talk about the soul.

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:30.565 align:middle line:84%
What we can say,
is that the soul

00:39:30.565 --> 00:39:32.831 align:middle line:90%
is where God works compassion.

00:39:32.831 --> 00:39:34.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again,
back to compassion.

00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:35.413 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Back to compassion.

00:39:35.413 --> 00:39:37.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And Hildegard
would say love.

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:38.175 align:middle line:90%
But it's all one in the same.

00:39:38.175 --> 00:39:39.030 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: That's right.

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And so for Eckhart,
you don't really

00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:43.800 align:middle line:84%
have a soul until you're
on the path of compassion

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:46.380 align:middle line:90%
and the path of active love.

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:49.614 align:middle line:84%
So we shouldn't be
complacent, should we?

00:39:49.614 --> 00:39:50.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, we should not.

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:53.780 align:middle line:84%
OK, and the other thing
is he, like Hildegard,

00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:56.070 align:middle line:84%
he was a man of the
science of the day.

00:39:56.070 --> 00:40:00.580 align:middle line:84%
He believed in
blending the offerings

00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:06.250 align:middle line:84%
of the intellect with our
religious or spiritual fervor.

00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:10.780 align:middle line:84%
But he believed that the seat
of the intellect was the heart.

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:11.370 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Yes.

00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And Aquinas before
him taught that too.

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:16.219 align:middle line:90%
And that's the Jewish teaching.

00:40:16.219 --> 00:40:18.510 align:middle line:84%
In the Jewish tradition, the
intellect is in the heart,

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:20.170 align:middle line:90%
not in the head.

00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:23.790 align:middle line:84%
Which again, is very different
from today's modern science,

00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:28.120 align:middle line:84%
which is saying the
intellect's in the brain.

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:31.530 align:middle line:84%
Which really, has
never be proven.

00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:33.282 align:middle line:84%
It's a dogma, as
Rupert Sheldrake says.

00:40:33.282 --> 00:40:34.240 align:middle line:90%
It's never been proven.

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:35.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:37.441 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: No, but really,
what they're saying, then,

00:40:37.441 --> 00:40:40.590 align:middle line:84%
is that wherever our soul
travels-- our imaginations,

00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:44.170 align:middle line:84%
our dreams, our passions--
into the universe,

00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:46.380 align:middle line:90%
all that is your soul.

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And the intellect is meant
to operate with the heart.

00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:52.990 align:middle line:90%
And that's what wisdom is.

00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:55.290 align:middle line:84%
That's what distinguishes
wisdom from knowledge.

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:57.550 align:middle line:84%
The knowledge is just the
left side of the brain.

00:40:57.550 --> 00:41:00.130 align:middle line:84%
Wisdom incorporates the
heart and the right side

00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:01.900 align:middle line:84%
of the brain,
which is intuition.

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And you know who else talks
about that, is Einstein.

00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:08.750 align:middle line:84%
Einstein says that values do
not come from the intellect.

00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:10.910 align:middle line:84%
They come from
intuition, he says,

00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:13.780 align:middle line:90%
which is also deep feeling.

00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:15.890 align:middle line:90%
That is where values come from.

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And Einstein says, I
abhor American education.

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:20.220 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:22.090 align:middle line:84%
Because it's all
about the rational,

00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:24.360 align:middle line:90%
the one side of the brain.

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:25.595 align:middle line:90%
And not about the intuition.

00:41:25.595 --> 00:41:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And of course, for me,
another word for intuition

00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:28.840 align:middle line:90%
is mysticism.

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:30.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
Einstein was a mystic.

00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:30.770 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: That's right.

00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:31.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And all of
his great breakthroughs

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:33.980 align:middle line:84%
came from intuition,
not the intellect.

00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:34.930 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: There you go.

00:41:34.930 --> 00:41:39.687 align:middle line:84%
Also, by the way, angels Aquinas
says, learn only by intuition.

00:41:39.687 --> 00:41:41.520 align:middle line:84%
So what that means to
me is that when you're

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:43.627 align:middle line:84%
on the highway of
intuition, you're

00:41:43.627 --> 00:41:45.960 align:middle line:84%
going to be picking up angels
who are hitchhiking there.

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:46.810 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're
being creative,

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:51.310 align:middle line:84%
you see, we have the special
word for it, the Muses,

00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:51.857 align:middle line:90%
don't we?

00:41:51.857 --> 00:41:52.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:55.400 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: So angels inspire us.

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And it says they carry
thoughts from prophet

00:41:58.110 --> 00:42:04.300 align:middle line:84%
to prophet, like a bee carries
nectar from flower to flower.

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:08.320 align:middle line:84%
So that's part of
opening our minds up too,

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:10.490 align:middle line:90%
to the presence of the angels.

00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:12.605 align:middle line:84%
And as we talked about
earlier, the ancestors too.

00:42:12.605 --> 00:42:13.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And you know, bridging
science and consciousness,

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:20.730 align:middle line:84%
spirituality, I
had the privilege

00:42:20.730 --> 00:42:23.690 align:middle line:84%
of being party to watching
a little experiment that

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:24.730 align:middle line:90%
was being conducted.

00:42:24.730 --> 00:42:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And it was between two
different modalities

00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:31.500 align:middle line:84%
of measuring responses in the
being, in the intelligence.

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And one of them had
the EEG monitors on.

00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:39.680 align:middle line:84%
This was from a
brain state system.

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And the other one, he
was using the heart math.

00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And they had their
various sensors on.

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And they were giving
various stimuli

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.120 align:middle line:84%
to the person who
was in the chair,

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:51.350 align:middle line:84%
and watching which one
started responding first.

00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And by just that
millisecond, the heart

00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:57.980 align:middle line:84%
was always responding before
the brain to this stimuli.

00:42:57.980 --> 00:42:58.700 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Wow.

00:42:58.700 --> 00:42:59.480 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:00.742 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Uh-huh.

00:43:00.742 --> 00:43:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And then if you
read further, it'll

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:04.970 align:middle line:84%
say neuropeptides,
even in the stomach--

00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:07.690 align:middle line:84%
those gut feelings we
have, the deep feeling

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:11.040 align:middle line:84%
we have-- will respond
more quickly to a situation

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:13.600 align:middle line:84%
than the brain has the
capability to respond.

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:14.720 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: There you go.

00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:16.553 align:middle line:84%
That's why I talk about
all the chakras have

00:43:16.553 --> 00:43:20.600 align:middle line:84%
to be engaged in education
and in spirituality, not just

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:21.270 align:middle line:90%
the head chakra.

00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:22.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:26.070 align:middle line:84%
So OK, now, one
thing Eckhart was

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:31.290 align:middle line:84%
big on was the notion that we
each give birth to the Christ

00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:32.860 align:middle line:90%
inside ourselves.

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:35.630 align:middle line:84%
So first, his definition
of Christ, and what

00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:37.220 align:middle line:90%
does that mean?

00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:39.300 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Well again, he
had a deep understanding

00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:42.404 align:middle line:90%
of the cosmic Christ.

00:43:42.404 --> 00:43:44.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Creation
spirituality comes in here.

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:44.770 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:43:44.770 --> 00:43:45.728 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Yes, definitely.

00:43:45.728 --> 00:43:47.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you
talk about that?

00:43:47.170 --> 00:43:49.280 align:middle line:84%
We didn't really get
around to it in Hildegard.

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:52.780 align:middle line:84%
Just to give a definition
of creation spirituality?

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:55.110 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Well,
creation spirituality

00:43:55.110 --> 00:43:56.950 align:middle line:84%
is the oldest
tradition in the Bible,

00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:59.130 align:middle line:84%
actually, the J source
in the Hebrew Bible

00:43:59.130 --> 00:44:00.264 align:middle line:90%
is creation centered.

00:44:00.264 --> 00:44:02.430 align:middle line:84%
There's tradition of wisdom
literature in the Bible,

00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:03.790 align:middle line:90%
which is a tradition of Jesus.

00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:05.560 align:middle line:84%
He comes from the
Wisdom tradition.

00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's about finding God in
nature, not just God in a book.

00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:11.360 align:middle line:90%
Books are very recent.

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:14.370 align:middle line:84%
We've only been literate for
a few thousand years, really.

00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:19.730 align:middle line:84%
And so does that mean that
13.8 billion years, God wasn't

00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:21.280 align:middle line:90%
writing things?

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:24.560 align:middle line:84%
Aquinas says, revelation
comes in two volumes, nature

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:25.840 align:middle line:90%
and the Bible.

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:28.930 align:middle line:84%
So that emphasis on
nature as a revelation

00:44:28.930 --> 00:44:30.790 align:middle line:90%
is creation spirituality.

00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:32.570 align:middle line:84%
Creation spirituality
is feminist insofar

00:44:32.570 --> 00:44:35.810 align:middle line:84%
as wisdom is feminine in the
Bible and around the world.

00:44:35.810 --> 00:44:39.070 align:middle line:90%


00:44:39.070 --> 00:44:40.900 align:middle line:90%
It's not afraid of science.

00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:42.762 align:middle line:84%
It's eager to learn
what science has to say.

00:44:42.762 --> 00:44:43.720 align:middle line:90%
Because science's job--

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:44.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not
in conflict with it.

00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:46.086 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: It's not in conflict.

00:44:46.086 --> 00:44:48.680 align:middle line:84%
Science's job is to tell
us what nature's all about.

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:50.580 align:middle line:84%
Aquinas said, a mistake
about nature results

00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:52.350 align:middle line:90%
in a mistake about God.

00:44:52.350 --> 00:44:56.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's an affirmation
of the scientist's vocation.

00:44:56.130 --> 00:44:59.350 align:middle line:84%
Teach us about nature,
we'll know more about God.

00:44:59.350 --> 00:45:02.180 align:middle line:84%
And one concrete example,
today, would be homosexuality.

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:05.482 align:middle line:84%
For centuries, tribes have
felt, oh this is unnatural.

00:45:05.482 --> 00:45:06.815 align:middle line:90%
It's not unnatural, we now know.

00:45:06.815 --> 00:45:08.780 align:middle line:84%
8% to 10% of a
population is going

00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:10.560 align:middle line:84%
to be gay any place
on the planet.

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:11.610 align:middle line:90%
So get over it.

00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:13.150 align:middle line:90%
There's a reason for this.

00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:16.380 align:middle line:84%
So it's the Galileo
case of our time,

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:19.770 align:middle line:84%
I think, that religion is
fumbling the ball again

00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:21.410 align:middle line:84%
and looking in
their bibles instead

00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:26.290 align:middle line:84%
of asking science what they
have to say about that subject.

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:28.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the cosmic
Christ and giving birth

00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:29.550 align:middle line:90%
to that within us.

00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:32.390 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Eckhart, at a Christmas
mass, he gave a sermon.

00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And he said, what
good is it to me

00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:37.790 align:middle line:84%
if Mary gave birth to the
Son of God 1,400 years ago?

00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And I don't do it in my person,
in my time, and in my culture?

00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:45.170 align:middle line:84%
We are all meant to be
mothers of God, he said.

00:45:45.170 --> 00:45:45.990 align:middle line:90%
So there you go.

00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:50.370 align:middle line:84%
You see, the Christ is always
needing to be born, he said.

00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:53.200 align:middle line:84%
So again, religion can
freeze things and freeze it

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:53.750 align:middle line:90%
in the past.

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:55.020 align:middle line:90%
Oh, Mary did it all.

00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:57.292 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to
worship her son.

00:45:57.292 --> 00:45:58.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Our responsibility.

00:45:58.500 --> 00:45:59.000 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: No.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.140 align:middle line:90%
We have to get involved.

00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:02.630 align:middle line:90%
Exactly, our responsibility.

00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:05.090 align:middle line:84%
So what we give birth
to, our children, yes.

00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:10.000 align:middle line:84%
But our citizenship,
our work, our community,

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.310 align:middle line:84%
all our efforts at learning and
developing ourselves and giving

00:46:14.310 --> 00:46:14.810 align:middle line:90%
back.

00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:17.077 align:middle line:84%
This is all a birthing
of the Christ.

00:46:17.077 --> 00:46:18.910 align:middle line:84%
Or if you're more at
home with the language,

00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:20.750 align:middle line:90%
of the Buddha nature.

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:22.850 align:middle line:90%
I lectured in Korea this summer.

00:46:22.850 --> 00:46:24.639 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
Buddhist monk there

00:46:24.639 --> 00:46:25.930 align:middle line:90%
who came up to me the next day.

00:46:25.930 --> 00:46:27.760 align:middle line:84%
He said, obviously
in your previous life

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:29.090 align:middle line:90%
you were a Buddhist monk.

00:46:29.090 --> 00:46:30.430 align:middle line:90%
OK, I said, fine.

00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:32.460 align:middle line:84%
He said, that phrase,
cosmic Christ,

00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:33.630 align:middle line:90%
I've never heard it before.

00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:36.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start talking about
the cosmic Buddha, he said.

00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:40.780 align:middle line:90%
So we got going on that.

00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and again,
as I said earlier,

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:45.180 align:middle line:90%
this is the creation tradition.

00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:48.640 align:middle line:84%
It's the Celtic tradition
that every being is holy.

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:51.070 align:middle line:84%
Mary Oliver has this
great poem where

00:46:51.070 --> 00:46:56.490 align:middle line:84%
she talks about how she's
sitting in a river on a rock

00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:57.900 align:middle line:90%
and listening very carefully.

00:46:57.900 --> 00:46:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And after many hours,
she begins to hear

00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:01.540 align:middle line:90%
what the river is saying.

00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:03.960 align:middle line:90%
The river is saying, I am holy.

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And the moss in the river
is saying, I am holy.

00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And the rock is
saying, I am holy.

00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:11.220 align:middle line:84%
That's the cosmic Christ,
the holiness of all beings.

00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that part
of his thought was ecology

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:17.050 align:middle line:84%
is a kind of
spiritual observance.

00:47:17.050 --> 00:47:19.530 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Absolutely
because turn that around.

00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:23.300 align:middle line:84%
If we're destroying rainforests
and whales and polar bears

00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:27.190 align:middle line:84%
and elephants, we are crucifying
the Christ all over again.

00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:27.915 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:47:27.915 --> 00:47:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:31.141 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: That, again, we shouldn't
be looking just in the past.

00:47:31.141 --> 00:47:33.290 align:middle line:84%
The Roman Empire
crucified Jesus.

00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:37.060 align:middle line:84%
But our empire and
empires are crucifying

00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:39.100 align:middle line:84%
the polar bears
and the rainforest

00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:40.890 align:middle line:90%
and the earth itself.

00:47:40.890 --> 00:47:43.920 align:middle line:90%
So let's get real.

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he wanted
to, at the same time,

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:49.770 align:middle line:84%
embracing all that exists here,
as to move beyond the five

00:47:49.770 --> 00:47:54.690 align:middle line:84%
senses and really understand
the nature of divine creation.

00:47:54.690 --> 00:47:56.920 align:middle line:90%
And we're part of that.

00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:57.420 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Yes.

00:47:57.420 --> 00:47:58.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a top-down thing.

00:47:58.730 --> 00:47:59.646 align:middle line:90%
It's not hierarchical.

00:47:59.646 --> 00:48:00.170 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: No.

00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:00.900 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:06.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for example, he says, if
I was alone and feeling afraid,

00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:08.820 align:middle line:84%
I would like to have
an animal with me.

00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:10.500 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps a dog.

00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:13.162 align:middle line:84%
Because equality gives
strength in all things.

00:48:13.162 --> 00:48:14.370 align:middle line:90%
Now, notice what he's saying.

00:48:14.370 --> 00:48:16.850 align:middle line:84%
He's saying at the
level of being,

00:48:16.850 --> 00:48:18.280 align:middle line:84%
we're equal to
these other beings.

00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:19.910 align:middle line:90%
We're not superior.

00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you want an
animal in your life or a stone

00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:27.980 align:middle line:84%
or beings of various kinds,
to remind us that we all

00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:29.270 align:middle line:90%
have received being.

00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:30.520 align:middle line:90%
Being is a gift for everybody.

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:30.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:31.821 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: And being is holy.

00:48:31.821 --> 00:48:33.670 align:middle line:90%
He says, isness is God.

00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:35.040 align:middle line:90%
Being is God.

00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's omnipresent, therefore,
the presence of the divine.

00:48:39.010 --> 00:48:41.520 align:middle line:84%
But we have to have a certain
humility to appreciate that.

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:41.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, we do.

00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:43.430 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: We have to realize
we're equal to the animals.

00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:44.221 align:middle line:90%
We're not superior.

00:48:44.221 --> 00:48:46.191 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're not a
very humble species.

00:48:46.191 --> 00:48:47.190 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Have you noticed?

00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:49.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's the
most difficult thing,

00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:52.910 align:middle line:84%
is to watch the cruelty that's
displayed against the animal

00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:53.910 align:middle line:90%
kingdom.

00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:55.300 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Exactly.

00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:56.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And against trees.

00:48:56.610 --> 00:48:57.840 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: And against trees.

00:48:57.840 --> 00:48:58.780 align:middle line:90%
You see, yes.

00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:00.260 align:middle line:90%
Against the soil.

00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:03.250 align:middle line:84%
Which is also cruelty against
our great-great-grandchildren

00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:04.230 align:middle line:90%
to come.

00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:07.720 align:middle line:84%
Because their lives will be that
much less rich and beautiful

00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:10.590 align:middle line:84%
when all this other
beauty disappears.

00:49:10.590 --> 00:49:12.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Another
of his which was

00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:15.240 align:middle line:84%
similar-- we talked about in
the beginning of the interview.

00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:16.950 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't expressed
the same way--

00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:23.060 align:middle line:84%
the notion that to be
in sync with the divine

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:25.410 align:middle line:84%
is to be in a state
of creativity.

00:49:25.410 --> 00:49:29.300 align:middle line:84%
That creation and creativity
is key to our existence

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:31.160 align:middle line:84%
as spiritual beings,
and that we're

00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:34.550 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be creating
and recreating ourselves

00:49:34.550 --> 00:49:37.065 align:middle line:84%
and everything
around us every day.

00:49:37.065 --> 00:49:37.690 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Exactly.

00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:39.490 align:middle line:84%
He has a whole theology
of the Holy Spirit.

00:49:39.490 --> 00:49:42.450 align:middle line:84%
He gave a sermon on--
it's from the Psalmist.

00:49:42.450 --> 00:49:44.270 align:middle line:84%
It talks about
the rushing river.

00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And he says the Holy Spirit is
a rushing river of creativity.

00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's a marvelous sermon
because you feel the energy.

00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:59.220 align:middle line:84%
The image I have of
being in a creative state

00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:01.910 align:middle line:84%
is being on a raft
without oars, just

00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:03.100 align:middle line:90%
going down a rushing river.

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:04.169 align:middle line:90%
You're not in control.

00:50:04.169 --> 00:50:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And you're not looking
at the time, either.

00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:07.920 align:middle line:84%
You just know you're having a
good time, and it's important.

00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:09.919 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's one of
my favorite meditations.

00:50:09.919 --> 00:50:11.010 align:middle line:90%
Head first.

00:50:11.010 --> 00:50:12.551 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: There you
go, head first even.

00:50:12.551 --> 00:50:13.270 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wow.

00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:17.230 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but so Eckhart
develops, incredibly,

00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:20.854 align:middle line:84%
this whole theology, of the
Holy Spirit and creativity.

00:50:20.854 --> 00:50:22.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course
Aquanis before him

00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:24.910 align:middle line:84%
said that the same
spirit that hovered

00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:27.310 align:middle line:84%
over the waters of the
beginning of creation

00:50:27.310 --> 00:50:30.139 align:middle line:84%
hovers over the mind
of the artist at work.

00:50:30.139 --> 00:50:31.930 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, this
is the Holy Spirit.

00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:35.480 align:middle line:84%
It is the creative spirit
that is working on us that

00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:37.740 align:middle line:90%
worked on the big creation too.

00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And Eckhart says the Holy
Spirit that gave birth to Jesus

00:50:42.690 --> 00:50:44.920 align:middle line:84%
in Mary's rule,
that overshadowed

00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:49.040 align:middle line:84%
her-- as the scriptures say--
overshadows us too and gives

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:50.520 align:middle line:90%
birth to us.

00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:51.020 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And to us giving
birth to the Christ.

00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:57.490 align:middle line:84%
So he sees the Holy
Spirit working everywhere

00:50:57.490 --> 00:50:58.790 align:middle line:90%
as the creative spirit.

00:50:58.790 --> 00:51:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And co-creation, for him,
is a very important word

00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:05.250 align:middle line:84%
as it was for Hildegard
150 years sooner, earlier.

00:51:05.250 --> 00:51:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so now we
live in a merchant society,

00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:09.560 align:middle line:90%
essentially.

00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And people are under the
guidance of various churches

00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:15.440 align:middle line:90%
that have structure.

00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And they have a need
for financial support

00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:21.960 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, which has created
almost an automated species.

00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:24.610 align:middle line:84%
We appear to be
the exact opposite

00:51:24.610 --> 00:51:28.455 align:middle line:90%
of this basic tenant of life.

00:51:28.455 --> 00:51:29.080 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Exactly.

00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And he talks
explicitly about that.

00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:33.420 align:middle line:84%
He took on capitalism
in his day.

00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:35.810 align:middle line:84%
This is one reason
he was on trial.

00:51:35.810 --> 00:51:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And Cologne, where he
did his big preaching,

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:42.440 align:middle line:84%
was a center of capitalism
for Europe at that time.

00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And here they were building
a brand new cathedral.

00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:47.500 align:middle line:84%
It exists today, a
gingerbread Gothic.

00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:49.371 align:middle line:84%
It was half done
in Eckhart's day.

00:51:49.371 --> 00:51:50.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Where is this?

00:51:50.370 --> 00:51:50.950 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: In Cologne.

00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:51.991 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In Cologne, OK.

00:51:51.991 --> 00:51:54.250 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: He got up in
that half-done cathedral

00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:56.109 align:middle line:84%
with all the bankers
and bishops, all proud

00:51:56.109 --> 00:51:57.400 align:middle line:90%
of themselves in the front row.

00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And he said, the only
temple that counts is

00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:04.340 align:middle line:90%
the temple in the human heart.

00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And he took, as a text,
Jesus driving money lenders

00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:08.020 align:middle line:90%
from the temple.

00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we have
become merchants.

00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:11.700 align:middle line:90%
It's all buy and sell.

00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:14.650 align:middle line:84%
He said, most people treat
God like they do a cow.

00:52:14.650 --> 00:52:18.440 align:middle line:84%
For the amount of cheese and
milk you can get from God.

00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:18.940 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:19.440 align:middle line:90%


00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:21.070 align:middle line:84%
It's all about
something for something.

00:52:21.070 --> 00:52:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And he said, this is
not how God works.

00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:24.040 align:middle line:90%
And he goes on.

00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And he calls it the
merchant mentality

00:52:25.930 --> 00:52:27.970 align:middle line:90%
that is taking over our souls.

00:52:27.970 --> 00:52:29.570 align:middle line:90%
So he was fierce.

00:52:29.570 --> 00:52:30.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, he was--

00:52:30.570 --> 00:52:31.940 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: And capitalism was
just coming into its own

00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:32.801 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:52:32.801 --> 00:52:34.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can imagine
if he were here today.

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:35.260 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Oh my.

00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:36.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What would
his reflection be?

00:52:36.930 --> 00:52:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Well, I think he would
agree with Pope Francis,

00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:42.090 align:middle line:84%
that there is such a thing
as savage capitalism.

00:52:42.090 --> 00:52:44.490 align:middle line:90%
And that it can devour us.

00:52:44.490 --> 00:52:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Because as he says,
this merchant mentality

00:52:48.350 --> 00:52:52.340 align:middle line:84%
is a way of seeing the world,
in terms of give and take.

00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:55.360 align:middle line:84%
So he talks, as
Buddhists do, he talks

00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:59.370 align:middle line:84%
about living without a why--
W-H-Y-- loving without a why,

00:52:59.370 --> 00:53:01.400 align:middle line:90%
and working without a why.

00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:05.110 align:middle line:84%
And this takes the rug out
from this merchant mentality.

00:53:05.110 --> 00:53:07.470 align:middle line:84%
Because the merchant
mentality is always for a why.

00:53:07.470 --> 00:53:09.140 align:middle line:90%
How much am I going to get?

00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:12.263 align:middle line:90%
And so he has an answer to it.

00:53:12.263 --> 00:53:13.550 align:middle line:90%
He's not just complaining.

00:53:13.550 --> 00:53:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And let me say, too, in
that sermon, he says,

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:17.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking
about the merchants.

00:53:17.370 --> 00:53:19.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
religious people

00:53:19.210 --> 00:53:21.440 align:middle line:84%
who think they can get
things from God this way.

00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:24.106 align:middle line:84%
So that's what makes
him really radical.

00:53:24.106 --> 00:53:25.480 align:middle line:84%
He's not talking
about the other.

00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:29.322 align:middle line:84%
He's taking on his own
profession, religion itself.

00:53:29.322 --> 00:53:30.530 align:middle line:90%
That's what he's criticizing.

00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:32.446 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he was
talking about our working

00:53:32.446 --> 00:53:35.000 align:middle line:84%
for the sake of it, to
create for the sake of it.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.750 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: You work in
order to work, he says.

00:53:36.750 --> 00:53:39.280 align:middle line:84%
You do justice in
order to do justice.

00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And see, that's the
Warrior energy too.

00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:43.810 align:middle line:84%
That it's not just about
what are the results.

00:53:43.810 --> 00:53:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Although you do your
best to get good results.

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:49.540 align:middle line:84%
The point is that you
live a life integrity.

00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And that your path,
the way, is itself

00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:56.560 align:middle line:84%
a Christ path, if you
will, or a justice path.

00:53:56.560 --> 00:54:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And you let the chips
fall where they may.

00:54:01.060 --> 00:54:04.290 align:middle line:84%
You see, Eckhart's trial was
really about three things.

00:54:04.290 --> 00:54:07.190 align:middle line:84%
One was his relationship to
women and the Beguine movement.

00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:12.030 align:middle line:84%
Another was his taking on the
excessive capitalist powers

00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:13.750 align:middle line:90%
of his day explicitly.

00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:18.960 align:middle line:84%
But third was that he was the
first intellectual preacher

00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:20.880 align:middle line:90%
to preach in German.

00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:24.780 align:middle line:84%
German, in his day, was the
dialect of the peasants.

00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And we actually found trial
transcripts from his trial

00:54:27.730 --> 00:54:29.490 align:middle line:90%
in the 19th century.

00:54:29.490 --> 00:54:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And it was clear that this
was an issue at his trial.

00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:34.020 align:middle line:84%
They said to him,
why are you preaching

00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:36.640 align:middle line:84%
to the peasants, these
uneducated people,

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:40.680 align:middle line:84%
in their own language, telling
them that they are aristocrats

00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:42.400 align:middle line:90%
and they're nobles?

00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:44.270 align:middle line:90%
And that they are other Christ?

00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:46.654 align:middle line:84%
You're confusing the simple
people, they said to him.

00:54:46.654 --> 00:54:49.070 align:middle line:84%
If you would preach in Latin,
like everyone else is doing,

00:54:49.070 --> 00:54:49.760 align:middle line:90%
we'd let you go.

00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Because the peasants weren't
getting the sermons in Latin.

00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:54.000 align:middle line:90%
What did Eckhart say?

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:54.880 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:55.930 align:middle line:90%
I'll never do it again?

00:54:55.930 --> 00:54:56.910 align:middle line:90%
This was his answer.

00:54:56.910 --> 00:55:02.240 align:middle line:90%


00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:02.920 align:middle line:90%
How'd he put it?

00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:04.990 align:middle line:90%
The ignorant need to learn.

00:55:04.990 --> 00:55:11.150 align:middle line:84%
So if they do not, they will not
know how to live or why to die.

00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:13.520 align:middle line:84%
10 years after he spoke
that, the peasant wars

00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:16.110 align:middle line:84%
broke out in Germany, where
tens of thousands of peasants

00:55:16.110 --> 00:55:17.320 align:middle line:90%
were murdered.

00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:18.950 align:middle line:84%
So he was living in
a time like ours,

00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:20.210 align:middle line:84%
when the rich were
getting richer

00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:21.585 align:middle line:84%
and the poor were
getting poorer.

00:55:21.585 --> 00:55:22.520 align:middle line:90%
And he saw the gap.

00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And he tried to do
something about it.

00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's a main reason
why he was condemned also.

00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:31.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He was the most
popular preacher of the time.

00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:31.620 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:32.220 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: He was.

00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And preaching was kind of the
only art form in town too.

00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:36.634 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:55:36.634 --> 00:55:37.800 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: It was entertainment.

00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:39.721 align:middle line:90%
And it was education.

00:55:39.721 --> 00:55:40.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:43.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But this populist
message, elevating everyone

00:55:43.310 --> 00:55:45.300 align:middle line:90%
to that of royalty.

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:50.150 align:middle line:84%
Because under the heavens,
we are all the same creation,

00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:53.460 align:middle line:84%
this divine creation that
is capable of the universe.

00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And he kept pounding that
home with the peasants.

00:55:56.030 --> 00:55:57.780 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Pounding it
home with the peasants.

00:55:57.780 --> 00:55:59.930 align:middle line:90%
And he said, you're all nobles.

00:55:59.930 --> 00:56:01.030 align:middle line:90%
You soar like the eagle.

00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:02.790 align:middle line:84%
You have the beauty
of the eagle.

00:56:02.790 --> 00:56:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the eagle
is a biblical metaphor

00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:07.240 align:middle line:90%
for the prophet, too, you see?

00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:08.000 align:middle line:90%
And for wisdom.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Because the eagle sees
things with perspective

00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:11.836 align:middle line:90%
and soars above things.

00:56:11.836 --> 00:56:13.210 align:middle line:84%
He says, you all
have this power.

00:56:13.210 --> 00:56:14.070 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And this was
stepping on the toes

00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:21.150 align:middle line:84%
of those who thought themselves
uniquely aristocrats.

00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:24.370 align:middle line:90%
So he disturbed the pot there.

00:56:24.370 --> 00:56:26.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
tell us what happened

00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:28.620 align:middle line:84%
toward the end of his life,
with his times and career?

00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:32.340 align:middle line:84%
Because he went into
obscurity, just like Hildegard.

00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:35.340 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Well, there was a trial
called in Cologne against him.

00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:37.340 align:middle line:90%
And he actually won that trial.

00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:41.400 align:middle line:84%
Then, there was a trial called
in Avignon, where the pope was

00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:43.010 align:middle line:90%
living then, in France.

00:56:43.010 --> 00:56:44.880 align:middle line:90%
And he traveled to that trial.

00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:47.450 align:middle line:90%
And he went through it.

00:56:47.450 --> 00:56:50.410 align:middle line:90%
And then he died a week later.

00:56:50.410 --> 00:56:53.580 align:middle line:84%
After it was over, he died
just a week afterwards.

00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And then they put out this
papal bull condemning many

00:56:56.950 --> 00:57:00.040 align:middle line:90%
of his ideas-- supposed ideas.

00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And that was kind
of the end of him

00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:08.550 align:middle line:84%
as far as his work permeating
mainstream Christianity.

00:57:08.550 --> 00:57:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And remember, then,
within a century,

00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:12.440 align:middle line:84%
you had Luther and
the Reformation.

00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:15.860 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that if
Eckhart had been listened to

00:57:15.860 --> 00:57:20.121 align:middle line:84%
and understood, that probably
the violence of the Reformation

00:57:20.121 --> 00:57:21.370 align:middle line:90%
would not have been necessary.

00:57:21.370 --> 00:57:23.900 align:middle line:84%
Because he was trying
to reform the Church,

00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:26.210 align:middle line:84%
like Francis tried to do
before him and like Hildegard

00:57:26.210 --> 00:57:28.132 align:middle line:90%
before Francis.

00:57:28.132 --> 00:57:29.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So because
of his condemnation,

00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:31.171 align:middle line:90%
he went into obscurity?

00:57:31.171 --> 00:57:32.420 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: He went into obscurity.

00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And what's even
worse is the idea

00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:38.830 align:middle line:84%
that you can marry mysticism
and social action, mysticism

00:57:38.830 --> 00:57:42.080 align:middle line:84%
and prophetic warriorhood--
that went underground.

00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And it came up a
bit with Luther.

00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:47.630 align:middle line:84%
It came out more with the
radical Protestants, who

00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:51.130 align:middle line:84%
depended entirely on Eckhart's
theology of the word of God,

00:57:51.130 --> 00:57:54.100 align:middle line:84%
that every creature is a word
of God and a book about God,

00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:54.820 align:middle line:90%
he said.

00:57:54.820 --> 00:57:59.470 align:middle line:84%
Because the peasants remember,
in Luther's day, 2/3 of Germany

00:57:59.470 --> 00:58:00.820 align:middle line:90%
was illiterate.

00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:02.130 align:middle line:90%
And they were peasants.

00:58:02.130 --> 00:58:04.240 align:middle line:90%
And so they didn't read books.

00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:05.230 align:middle line:90%
They read nature.

00:58:05.230 --> 00:58:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And so they loved
what Eckhart taught,

00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:08.910 align:middle line:90%
every creature is a book of God.

00:58:08.910 --> 00:58:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And they kind of resented
Luther and these intelligentsia

00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:14.560 align:middle line:84%
there, learning
languages and everything

00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:17.180 align:middle line:84%
and getting their
theology from books.

00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:22.590 align:middle line:84%
So the radical process is
Hans Denck, Sebastian Franck,

00:58:22.590 --> 00:58:24.990 align:middle line:90%
and Hans Hutt.

00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:27.470 align:middle line:84%
They followed Eckhart's
theology of the word of God.

00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:30.960 align:middle line:84%
But it's really in the
Quakerism and George Fox

00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:32.870 align:middle line:90%
that you get Eckhart, again.

00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:36.650 align:middle line:84%
Because he marries social
protest-- he goes to jail a lot

00:58:36.650 --> 00:58:39.770 align:middle line:90%
under the King-- with mysticism.

00:58:39.770 --> 00:58:43.362 align:middle line:84%
So in many ways, the Quaker
movement is very Eckhartian.

00:58:43.362 --> 00:58:45.070 align:middle line:84%
The very first time
I lectured on Eckhart

00:58:45.070 --> 00:58:46.907 align:middle line:84%
was in a Quaker house
outside Chicago.

00:58:46.907 --> 00:58:47.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:50.160 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: And I'll never
forget, when I finished,

00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:52.877 align:middle line:84%
the head lady-- who was a
big, strong lady-- she boomed

00:58:52.877 --> 00:58:53.960 align:middle line:90%
from the back of the room.

00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:57.310 align:middle line:84%
My God, she said, it sounds
just like George Fox, she said.

00:58:57.310 --> 00:58:59.530 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's
very interesting too.

00:58:59.530 --> 00:59:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Because a profound
contemplation,

00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:05.351 align:middle line:84%
contemplative life,
and an active life,

00:59:05.351 --> 00:59:06.975 align:middle line:84%
for Eckhart, are
thoroughly compatible.

00:59:06.975 --> 00:59:09.656 align:middle line:90%


00:59:09.656 --> 00:59:13.167 align:middle line:84%
But what we have mostly
is dualism, either/or.

00:59:13.167 --> 00:59:13.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:14.470 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:16.780 align:middle line:84%
OK, but I have one question
I still need to ask you.

00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:18.890 align:middle line:84%
And that is you have
spent decades writing

00:59:18.890 --> 00:59:23.690 align:middle line:84%
about the mystical nature of
these people in the church

00:59:23.690 --> 00:59:25.320 align:middle line:84%
and the early
church, the Rhineland

00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:27.110 align:middle line:90%
mystics in particular.

00:59:27.110 --> 00:59:30.024 align:middle line:84%
But what does this tell us
about your own mystical nature?

00:59:30.024 --> 00:59:34.470 align:middle line:90%


00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Well, I grew
up in Wisconsin.

00:59:37.090 --> 00:59:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And Wisconsin is a place
where the spirits of the land

00:59:41.110 --> 00:59:42.645 align:middle line:90%
are still very alive.

00:59:42.645 --> 00:59:46.080 align:middle line:84%
The Native American
memories are alive there.

00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:48.956 align:middle line:84%
I had Native American
dreams when I was a boy.

00:59:48.956 --> 00:59:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
nature in Wisconsin,

00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:52.746 align:middle line:84%
you have all these lakes
where I grew up, in Madison

00:59:52.746 --> 00:59:54.280 align:middle line:90%
and the four seasons.

00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:56.602 align:middle line:84%
And I just got high on
nature all the time.

00:59:56.602 --> 00:59:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And then in high
school, I remember

00:59:58.060 --> 01:00:01.420 align:middle line:84%
getting high on hearing
Beethoven's seventh, on reading

01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:03.790 align:middle line:84%
Shakespeare, and then
reading "War and Peace" when

01:00:03.790 --> 01:00:05.040 align:middle line:90%
I was a junior in high school.

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:07.390 align:middle line:84%
I told my friend it
blew my soul wide open.

01:00:07.390 --> 01:00:08.820 align:middle line:90%
So I had a mystical life.

01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:11.810 align:middle line:90%
Also, at 12, I got polio.

01:00:11.810 --> 01:00:12.800 align:middle line:90%
And I lost my legs.

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't tell me
if I'd ever walk again.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.010 align:middle line:84%
My father been a football coach
at the University of Wisconsin.

01:00:18.010 --> 01:00:19.760 align:middle line:84%
My older brothers were
all state football.

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:21.801 align:middle line:84%
And I figured, this is
what it meant to be a man.

01:00:21.801 --> 01:00:23.630 align:middle line:90%
But here, I had to give that up.

01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:25.340 align:middle line:90%
And I had another experience.

01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And this Dominican brother used
to visit me in the hospital.

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And he was the
opposite of my father.

01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:32.790 align:middle line:90%
He was very contemplative.

01:00:32.790 --> 01:00:34.890 align:middle line:84%
He ended up being a
Trappist monk, in fact.

01:00:34.890 --> 01:00:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, well, this is
another way of being a man.

01:00:38.170 --> 01:00:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And so then, when I got
my legs back after a year,

01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:46.460 align:middle line:84%
I remember saying
to the universe

01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:48.990 align:middle line:84%
that I'll never take my
legs for granted again.

01:00:48.990 --> 01:00:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a
very mystical intuition,

01:00:51.010 --> 01:00:52.100 align:middle line:90%
not to take for granted.

01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:55.300 align:middle line:84%
That's why breathing is so
important in meditation.

01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:56.970 align:middle line:84%
It's so easy to take
breath for granted.

01:00:56.970 --> 01:00:59.250 align:middle line:84%
But when you think about
it, it's rather primal

01:00:59.250 --> 01:01:00.350 align:middle line:90%
that we've got breath.

01:01:00.350 --> 01:01:02.190 align:middle line:90%
And it's a heck of a gift.

01:01:02.190 --> 01:01:06.640 align:middle line:84%
So I think I've been
blessed with a rather

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:09.210 align:middle line:90%
rich mystical life.

01:01:09.210 --> 01:01:11.370 align:middle line:90%
Just from those sources alone.

01:01:11.370 --> 01:01:14.820 align:middle line:90%
But I came of age in the '60s.

01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:17.160 align:middle line:84%
So the whole prophetic thing,
the Civil Rights Movement,

01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:20.210 align:middle line:84%
the anti-war thing,
then the gay revolution,

01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:23.834 align:middle line:84%
and the women's movement, and
of course, ecology movement.

01:01:23.834 --> 01:01:25.750 align:middle line:84%
All these have been
extremely important to me.

01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:28.131 align:middle line:10%
So in my doctoral
studies in Paris,

01:01:28.131 --> 01:01:29.630 align:middle line:10%
studying the history
of spiritually,

01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:33.400 align:middle line:10%
my question was can we relate
mysticism and social justice?

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:35.160 align:middle line:10%
Or are they separate tracks?

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:38.840 align:middle line:10%
So all my books are
dealing with that topic.

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:41.630 align:middle line:10%
And I love Eckhart's
statement that compassion is

01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:44.589 align:middle line:10%
where peace and justice kiss.

01:01:44.589 --> 01:01:46.380 align:middle line:84%
Compassion is where
peace and justice kiss.

01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:49.660 align:middle line:84%
That's mysticism and
warriorhood coming together.

01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:51.180 align:middle line:90%
And that nails it for me.

01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:52.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you are
a warrior as well.

01:01:52.850 --> 01:01:54.930 align:middle line:84%
