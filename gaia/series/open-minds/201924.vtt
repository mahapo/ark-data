>>REGINA MEREDITH: In a time
of seeming disempowerment,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.480 align:middle line:10%
many people are turning
to spiritual practices

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.730 align:middle line:10%
to regain a sense
of equilibrium.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.890 align:middle line:84%
Information streams
like Gaia are a source

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.840 align:middle line:90%
of insight and inspiration.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And one of our favorite
authors, Mitch Horowitz,

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.850 align:middle line:84%
is back with us today
to have a conversation

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.610 align:middle line:84%
that I say the time
has arrived for,

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.610 align:middle line:84%
to simply understand the
true metaphysical nature

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.630 align:middle line:90%
of our beings.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.940 align:middle line:84%
This knowledge itself
can be the basis

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.550 align:middle line:84%
of the creation of
our experienced world,

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.450 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to all of
the rituals and beliefs

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.792 align:middle line:84%
and really kind
of solid practices

00:00:53.792 --> 00:00:54.750 align:middle line:90%
we've done in the past.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.880 align:middle line:84%
That's the other part
of that open sentence.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.020 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back, Mitch.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH HOROWITZ:
Thank you so much.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:59.540 align:middle line:90%
Great to be here.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.332 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know I
have been enjoying you

00:01:01.332 --> 00:01:02.499 align:middle line:90%
on a site called The Medium.

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:03.299 align:middle line:90%
Medium.com.

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:04.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.510 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah
that's a great site

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.100 align:middle line:10%
of kind of collated information
of all different subject

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.900 align:middle line:10%
matters.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.725 align:middle line:10%
But I love the
content you're doing.

00:01:11.725 --> 00:01:13.350 align:middle line:10%
That's where people
can kind of connect

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.970 align:middle line:10%
with all your newest articles.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And they're really wonderful
nice good sandwich sized piece.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.330 align:middle line:84%
It's not a little bite.
but it's not overwhelming.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.560 align:middle line:90%
It's not a giant hoagie.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.700 align:middle line:84%
They're really
beautifully written.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.080 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to
say, I'm loving it.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh I
appreciate that.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.110 align:middle line:10%
And I've been enjoying
writing for Medium

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.830 align:middle line:10%
because it's direct to reader.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.970 align:middle line:10%
It's a streaming experience
and I love the immediacy

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.350 align:middle line:10%
and I love connecting with
the many, many people who

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.600 align:middle line:10%
are flowing through that site.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's great.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.303 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I did
a lot of the research

00:01:39.303 --> 00:01:40.740 align:middle line:90%
for this particular interview.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.300 align:middle line:90%
Because I wanted to--

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.070 align:middle line:84%
we've talked about
your books and you

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.460 align:middle line:90%
have another one coming up.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.200 align:middle line:84%
But we're in this
unique period of time,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.153 align:middle line:84%
and you're writing
uniquely for this time.

00:01:49.153 --> 00:01:50.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Thank you.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.730 align:middle line:90%
That's my effort.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:51.530 align:middle line:10%
That's my wish.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.755 align:middle line:10%
I write about my search,
my search and my work

00:01:53.755 --> 00:01:54.900 align:middle line:10%
are one and the same.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And one other
thing is with you,

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.110 align:middle line:90%
you're always evolving yourself.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.970 align:middle line:84%
You don't claim to
be, I know everything.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.053 align:middle line:90%
I know all the principles.

00:02:01.053 --> 00:02:02.820 align:middle line:84%
I've studied them
all my whole life.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.490 align:middle line:84%
You're constantly evolving
your own knowledge base

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.110 align:middle line:84%
and your own
understanding of how this

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.900 align:middle line:90%
works to fit in a unique time.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: I certainly
try and you're

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.370 align:middle line:84%
one of the things I was
thinking about this morning is

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.010 align:middle line:84%
that in all honesty, I
want to make mistakes.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.160 align:middle line:90%
I want to fail.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And I don't say that in some
glib way, or as a sentiment.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.790 align:middle line:84%
I experiment, I try,
I make an effort.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.040 align:middle line:84%
I pass these things
onto my readers.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.510 align:middle line:84%
I want to hear
from my readers how

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.280 align:middle line:84%
they're doing with these
various exercises and methods

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.080 align:middle line:90%
and techniques.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.030 align:middle line:84%
There's an old
expression, every guru

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.830 align:middle line:84%
wishes that a student
will surpass him.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.260 align:middle line:90%
Well, I am not a guru.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm just a seeker.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.830 align:middle line:84%
But my wish is that if
a reader surpasses me

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.890 align:middle line:84%
in something that I've
experimented with,

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm on the right scent trail.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.800 align:middle line:84%
And if I stumble and if
I fail I want my reader

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.940 align:middle line:90%
to know that as well.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:48.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, OK.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.060 align:middle line:84%
So now we launch into some
of the new work, which

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.640 align:middle line:84%
is one of the articles you
wrote is, "Is Magic Necessary"?

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.433 align:middle line:84%
Now, like I said in the
open to this show people

00:02:57.433 --> 00:02:58.350 align:middle line:90%
are looking for magic.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.060 align:middle line:84%
They're looking for
kind of anything

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.420 align:middle line:84%
to make this crazy
scene make sense now.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And right at this time you're
saying, do we really need that?

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.590 align:middle line:90%
Launch into it.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.007 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: That's a question
that I've been asking myself

00:03:10.007 --> 00:03:11.700 align:middle line:90%
really since early this year.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.130 align:middle line:84%
My spiritual search
is very broad ranging.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.600 align:middle line:90%
It includes meditation.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.850 align:middle line:84%
It includes positive
mind metaphysics.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.200 align:middle line:84%
It includes spells,
ceremonies, sigils, prayer,

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.360 align:middle line:84%
every kind of practice
you can conceive of,

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.540 align:middle line:84%
because I like to try
different vehicles.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I
have asked myself recently

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.010 align:middle line:84%
is whether at this point
in the human situation,

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.920 align:middle line:84%
and given that all
of us are forced,

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.500 align:middle line:84%
whether we want to
or not to participate

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:47.100 align:middle line:84%
in this enormous reset, do we
need rote, ritual, liturgy,

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.000 align:middle line:90%
ceremony?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.020 align:middle line:84%
Do we need the formality
of magical practice

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.590 align:middle line:84%
or even some of our hallowed
religious traditions?

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.570 align:middle line:84%
If the individual has a
sense that he or she leads

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.390 align:middle line:84%
a metaphysical existence
along with the physical,

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.360 align:middle line:84%
an extra physical existence
along with the physical,

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.180 align:middle line:84%
and we know far too much to
doubt that each one of us

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.280 align:middle line:84%
participates in
both the physical

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.700 align:middle line:84%
and extra physical
existence, is that knowledge

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:22.950 align:middle line:84%
alone enough to see through
one's needs, wishes, desires,

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.840 align:middle line:84%
obligations, and
ethics in the world?

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.380 align:middle line:84%
Do we need the
formality of magic

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.670 align:middle line:84%
or is the realization of
your extra physical existence

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:37.350 align:middle line:84%
sufficient itself to bring
you into the larger life

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.750 align:middle line:84%
that we're searching for
through liturgy and magic.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:41.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: True.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.060 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go into some kind
of famous statements about this

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.280 align:middle line:90%
to put it in perspective.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.720 align:middle line:84%
But you and I were
talking off camera.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.340 align:middle line:84%
And there's one
thing, and that is

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.830 align:middle line:84%
going to the event
or the emotion that

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.420 align:middle line:84%
precedes the desire
to even participate

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.640 align:middle line:90%
in all these rituals.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.160 align:middle line:84%
If you really take it back
to source and our being,

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.580 align:middle line:84%
you and I were talking about the
word and the notion of desire.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes, and I
think desires are sacred.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.820 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely bow
my knee to desires.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.913 align:middle line:84%
If it wasn't for desire,
as we were talking about,

00:05:11.913 --> 00:05:14.580 align:middle line:84%
the Buddha never would have left
his palace to go on his search.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Nothing would
occur in this universe.

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.620 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Exactly.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And we talk about
or we're conditioned

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.580 align:middle line:84%
to talk about
transcending desire.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.830 align:middle line:84%
But I really want people to
take a fresh look at that.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.650 align:middle line:84%
And we can afford to take a
fresh look at that in a world

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.430 align:middle line:84%
that, whether we like it or not,
has been up ended right now.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.830 align:middle line:84%
Too often we as
seekers, and this

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.340 align:middle line:84%
is true of people in every
walk of life, repeat ideas that

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.000 align:middle line:84%
have been passed down to us,
very often in translations

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.960 align:middle line:84%
of translations of translations
of ancient religious

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.600 align:middle line:84%
and ethical
literature, very often

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.940 align:middle line:84%
translations written
by people who are not

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.485 align:middle line:84%
even able to converse
in the original language

00:05:50.485 --> 00:05:52.170 align:middle line:84%
that these things
were written in.

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.750 align:middle line:84%
Very often translations
of literature

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.510 align:middle line:84%
that, while it has
universal properties

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.420 align:middle line:84%
also belong to a certain
time and place and set

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.860 align:middle line:90%
of circumstances.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.070 align:middle line:84%
I think we can allow ourselves
the benefit right now

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.460 align:middle line:84%
to look at concepts
like transcending desire

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.540 align:middle line:84%
or non-attachment or
non-identification and ask,

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.890 align:middle line:84%
is that really serving you in
your search as a 21st century

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:17.760 align:middle line:90%
person?

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.430 align:middle line:84%
Every religious idea is
culturally conditioned.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.200 align:middle line:84%
It may be universal
in some part.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.140 align:middle line:84%
But in another part, it's
attached to the time, place,

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.890 align:middle line:84%
language, and social
situation from which it arose,

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:32.460 align:middle line:84%
Judaism, Christianity, the
Vedic traditions, and so on.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.570 align:middle line:90%
There's no exception to that.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And you as the individual,
you as the individual,

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:39.930 align:middle line:84%
have it as your
sacred birthright

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.560 align:middle line:84%
to ask the question, how do
I know transcending desire is

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.360 align:middle line:90%
a good idea?

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.810 align:middle line:84%
How do I know that in terms
of my own verified personal

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.730 align:middle line:90%
experience in the here and now?

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.410 align:middle line:84%
Not what I've read,
not what's been

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.680 align:middle line:84%
quoted to me, not what I can
cite chapter and verse of,

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.610 align:middle line:90%
but in terms of my experience.

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.390 align:middle line:84%
It may be that desire
is the precedent

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.823 align:middle line:84%
that you the individual
need to get someplace

00:07:02.823 --> 00:07:03.990 align:middle line:90%
that's profoundly important.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well I believe that.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's, I think always
been part of my operating

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:12.300 align:middle line:84%
system in life,
is without desire,

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:13.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to do anything.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
accomplish anything.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.870 align:middle line:84%
I have no motivation to do
anything, if there's no desire.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.710 align:middle line:84%
And so I mean, we
can either live life

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.760 align:middle line:84%
at being pulled forward
or in resistance

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.770 align:middle line:90%
or trying to repel life.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:29.100 align:middle line:84%
But I personally
believe that desire

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.630 align:middle line:84%
is the thing that pulls
us forward into our lives

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:35.070 align:middle line:84%
and into our dharma
and so forth.

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And so, I agree with
you 100% we should

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:40.650 align:middle line:84%
be asking that question
of ourselves, what

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:41.850 align:middle line:90%
is the role of desire?

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:43.470 align:middle line:84%
But then we have to, if
we're going to just go down

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:45.000 align:middle line:84%
this rabbit hole
a little further,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.130 align:middle line:84%
I think it's important
to look at desire

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:49.680 align:middle line:90%
with a big D versus a little d.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.350 align:middle line:84%
You know say, I think
I'm going to have

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:54.230 align:middle line:90%
another couple of cocktails.

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:56.640 align:middle line:84%
OK, that's a type
of desire, but I'm

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:01.080 align:middle line:84%
talking about the desire
that kind of moves

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.140 align:middle line:84%
between your cells, that you
can feel moving through you,

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:05.580 align:middle line:90%
calling you.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.610 align:middle line:84%
That desire, that's a
different kind of desire.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:08.610 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes I agree.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:10.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the desire
with a small d

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.830 align:middle line:90%
is escapism in a certain sense.

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:12.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:14.400 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: It's intoxication.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.240 align:middle line:90%
It's calories.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.410 align:middle line:90%
It's booze.

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:17.810 align:middle line:90%
It's I mean--

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:20.385 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Any kind of
addiction, binge watching.

00:08:20.385 --> 00:08:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Anything
that's compulsive.

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:23.520 align:middle line:90%
Anything that's compulsive.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.650 align:middle line:84%
And what we're trying
to get at is not

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:28.170 align:middle line:90%
escapism, but expression.

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:30.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly, and
you put it perfectly.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.130 align:middle line:90%
Little d is escapism.

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:35.400 align:middle line:84%
Big D is something that
draws you out and forward.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.789 align:middle line:90%
Big D, big desire.

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:39.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: And of course if
little d takes over my life.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.002 align:middle line:90%
I can't get anywhere.

00:08:41.002 --> 00:08:42.419 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK let's
talk about that

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:44.800 align:middle line:84%
with the whole situation of
everybody being quarantined

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:45.600 align:middle line:90%
all this time.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.225 align:middle line:84%
You're in the epicenter,
New York City.

00:08:47.225 --> 00:08:50.610 align:middle line:84%
Things got really quiet and
pretty still and for some

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:52.260 align:middle line:90%
people, very depressing.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:56.012 align:middle line:84%
How did people deal
with the little d?

00:08:56.012 --> 00:08:57.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: I'll tell
you this, you know,

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.760 align:middle line:90%
and I say this somberly.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.930 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of
drinking going on.

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:05.138 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of imbibing
of social media going on.

00:09:05.138 --> 00:09:06.930 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of
binge watching going on,

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.110 align:middle line:90%
not always a bad thing.

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:08.910 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we all--

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:10.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'll do binge
watching if it's fun.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:11.380 align:middle line:90%
I like it too.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:12.810 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: We need to
unplug from time to time

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:14.130 align:middle line:90%
and it's necessary.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:16.810 align:middle line:84%
I tend to binge watch
World War I documentaries,

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:20.740 align:middle line:84%
which is not an ideal way
to unplug, but that's me.

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:26.670 align:middle line:84%
But I think that people were
and are dealing with depression.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:28.990 align:middle line:84%
And New York is just
starting to come out of it.

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:30.910 align:middle line:84%
But we're dealing with
the aftermath of it.

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:32.370 align:middle line:90%
And it's very, very tough.

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And this is one
of the reasons why

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:36.570 align:middle line:84%
I want people to ask themselves
very serious questions

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:38.790 align:middle line:84%
as if for the first time,
as if for the first time.

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:39.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
the time to do it.

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:40.620 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: What do I want?

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:41.430 align:middle line:90%
What do I want?

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:43.847 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like you said at the
beginning, this is a reset.

00:09:43.847 --> 00:09:46.680 align:middle line:84%
This is a chance to reset
society, cultures, everything.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: , Everything and
none of us particularly asked

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.290 align:middle line:84%
for it, at least not
in a cognizant way.

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:53.680 align:middle line:90%
But we received it.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.940 align:middle line:90%
We received it.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.570 align:middle line:84%
We have to ask ourselves
about college expenses.

00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:00.080 align:middle line:84%
We have to ask ourselves about
the scale of our household.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well let's
have the courage

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:02.200 align:middle line:90%
to go there for a minute.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Please.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So many kids are
just dying on the vine.

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:10.650 align:middle line:84%
This whole virtual school,
doing everything online

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:14.310 align:middle line:84%
has just killed their
enthusiasm, interest, energy.

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:16.320 align:middle line:84%
You know, so kids are
gaming late at night.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.200 align:middle line:84%
They don't even want to get up
and do these stupid classes.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And so this is bringing a
whole larger discussion up as

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:25.560 align:middle line:84%
to the nature of
an education model

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.720 align:middle line:84%
that was based in
the Industrial Age

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.290 align:middle line:84%
to train people for specific
things, specific jobs,

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:33.240 align:middle line:84%
to walk through a
specific door, to apply

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.970 align:middle line:84%
for a specific thing,
most of which or much

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:37.200 align:middle line:90%
of which is going away.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.658 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: No
question about that.

00:10:38.658 --> 00:10:43.620 align:middle line:84%
It's extremely important and
I really ask parents and kids

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:46.620 align:middle line:84%
and caregivers to think
very, very carefully

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:50.640 align:middle line:84%
about the cost-benefit
ratio of college,

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.100 align:middle line:84%
about whether college
is going to steer you

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:58.290 align:middle line:84%
on a path that's financially
stable, and personally happy,

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.570 align:middle line:90%
personally rewarding.

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:02.940 align:middle line:84%
Because I think I mean
certainly my generation

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.900 align:middle line:84%
has operated for a long
time off of the model

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.690 align:middle line:84%
that, well, if you
have a college degree

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:12.330 align:middle line:84%
you can pull yourself up by
the bootstraps and so on and so

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:12.510 align:middle line:90%
forth.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:13.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not so much now.

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:14.577 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Not so much now.

00:11:14.577 --> 00:11:17.620 align:middle line:84%
That's a post-war
baby boomer trope.

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:18.420 align:middle line:90%
It's a trope.

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.533 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a trope
and we have to look at it.

00:11:20.533 --> 00:11:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And I was saying to
you before the show,

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:26.670 align:middle line:84%
I always tell my kids you can be
an electrician who loves opera.

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:28.590 align:middle line:84%
No one will ever be
able to export your job.

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:30.960 align:middle line:84%
You're doing work that's
extremely important

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.530 align:middle line:90%
and you're getting paid well.

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to immerse
yourself in all the things

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.770 align:middle line:84%
that are beautiful
and good in life,

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:39.420 align:middle line:90%
you can do that in the trades.

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.490 align:middle line:84%
The trades are a
wonderful career.

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think we
really have to start

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.250 align:middle line:90%
to wrap our arms around that.

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:46.600 align:middle line:90%
I so agree with you.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.850 align:middle line:90%
I was just-- it just made me--

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:51.070 align:middle line:84%
I was tickled to hear
you say it in that way.

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:53.050 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't agree with
you more on this.

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And this allows the
freedom of a young person

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:58.300 align:middle line:84%
to actually start
resonating with something

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.250 align:middle line:84%
rather than trying to fill
some industrialized slot

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:02.110 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:03.068 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Absolutely.

00:12:03.068 --> 00:12:05.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, like
you say with your son,

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:10.420 align:middle line:84%
there's a Matthew, Matthew
Crawford wrote a book called,

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:13.930 align:middle line:90%
"Shop Class as Soul Craft."

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:15.013 align:middle line:90%
Which I thought was--

00:12:15.013 --> 00:12:16.180 align:middle line:90%
I read that a few years ago.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:19.570 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was an
amazing book, looking at--

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:22.210 align:middle line:84%
here is a man who
was in a think tank,

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:26.200 align:middle line:84%
and really using his mind
strategically, very, very

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.310 align:middle line:90%
mental process.

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:30.278 align:middle line:84%
You never see an outcome of
anything at the end of the day.

00:12:30.278 --> 00:12:31.570 align:middle line:90%
You're just playing with ideas.

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:34.540 align:middle line:84%
You go home and it's like
nothing has really happened.

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.090 align:middle line:90%
His days seemed inconsequential.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:41.170 align:middle line:90%
So he decided the heck with it.

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:43.480 align:middle line:84%
And he decided to go back
into something he adored,

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.380 align:middle line:84%
which was motorcycle
maintenance.

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And he took over a garage
and start repairing

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:49.120 align:middle line:90%
the town's motorcycles.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And so people come in with their
stories, friendships are made.

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Complex little
problems are solved

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:59.410 align:middle line:84%
and you start feeling like
he had a life, a community.

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:00.590 align:middle line:90%
Riff on that for a minute.

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:02.257 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: It's
absolutely fascinating.

00:13:02.257 --> 00:13:04.300 align:middle line:84%
And I remember back when
I was in publishing,

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:07.990 align:middle line:84%
oh man, this must be
going back about 20 years.

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:11.890 align:middle line:84%
I was at Penguin which is
now Penguin Random House.

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And I was sitting in
an editorial meeting

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:16.420 align:middle line:84%
and I received a
proposal for a book.

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.820 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't "Shop
Craft as Soul Craft."

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:21.040 align:middle line:84%
But it even preceded
that book, in which

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.290 align:middle line:84%
the author was making the
case that it was really time

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:24.920 align:middle line:90%
to rethink college.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:26.980 align:middle line:90%
And I loved the book.

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.643 align:middle line:84%
And my colleagues
stared at me blankly.

00:13:28.643 --> 00:13:30.310 align:middle line:84%
They just didn't get
it because they all

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:32.170 align:middle line:84%
grew up with the
presumption that this

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:33.740 align:middle line:84%
is the pathway to
the middle class.

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And now what we're
seeing is, it's

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:41.510 align:middle line:84%
in many cases, not all but many
a pathway to crushing debt.

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:42.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Crushing the spirit.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:44.927 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Crushing the
spirit to great difficulty,

00:13:44.927 --> 00:13:48.490 align:middle line:84%
to getting to hemmed into
choices you might not want.

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And of course, none
of this stuff is easy.

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.640 align:middle line:90%
None of this stuff is easy.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.400 align:middle line:84%
If an individual unplugged
a white collar job

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.740 align:middle line:84%
and goes into a more
craft based job,

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.570 align:middle line:84%
he or she might have terrible
concerns about health care.

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:02.530 align:middle line:84%
How do you pay for That these
are deadly serious issues.

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:04.363 align:middle line:84%
And I'm with the
individual on these issues.

00:14:04.363 --> 00:14:05.822 align:middle line:84%
There's no hiding
from any of this.

00:14:05.822 --> 00:14:07.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's not easy.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.190 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: It's not easy
and it's very complex.

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:10.670 align:middle line:90%
But we have to look at it.

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:12.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean we're being
forced to look at it.

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:15.370 align:middle line:90%
And it has to be treated--

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:17.710 align:middle line:84%
we have to throw ourselves
into it with a certain degree

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:18.490 align:middle line:90%
of energy.

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:19.907 align:middle line:84%
Because whether
we like it or not,

00:14:19.907 --> 00:14:21.370 align:middle line:84%
these questions
are in front of us.

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:24.070 align:middle line:84%
I know somebody who got
laid off from a finance job

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:27.100 align:middle line:84%
back in the Great
Recession of 2008.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.630 align:middle line:90%
He had carpentry skills.

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:30.110 align:middle line:90%
He became a carpenter.

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:31.698 align:middle line:90%
He was enormously happy.

00:14:31.698 --> 00:14:33.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying it's
the path for everybody,

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:37.090 align:middle line:84%
but I've seen too many such
instances to just dismiss it

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:37.900 align:middle line:90%
as a chimera.

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.262 align:middle line:90%
I mean, these are real things.

00:14:39.262 --> 00:14:40.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They are,
and a lot of it

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.200 align:middle line:84%
has to do with us parents
to start actually just

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.410 align:middle line:84%
observing and watching where
our children's excitement is

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:48.562 align:middle line:90%
coming from.

00:14:48.562 --> 00:14:50.770 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of times we're
walking right past them.

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:53.110 align:middle line:84%
We've got them shipped off
into this class and a tutor

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:55.820 align:middle line:84%
here and music lessons
there and so forth.

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And we're not really
watching what's

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:01.390 align:middle line:84%
giving rise to increases
in their own excitement

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:02.890 align:middle line:90%
and energy.

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And I was interviewing
Michael Tellinger years

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.890 align:middle line:84%
ago in his Ubuntu
Movement and talking

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:11.410 align:middle line:84%
about mentorship
programs, where children

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:15.560 align:middle line:84%
start showing their passions
and skills early in life.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And even at the age
of seven and eight,

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.472 align:middle line:84%
pairing them with someone
who is skilled in that field.

00:15:20.472 --> 00:15:21.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Absolutely.

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:23.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know there's so
many creative ways to do this.

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And it just makes me so happy
even having this conversation.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.135 align:middle line:84%
Because it's like human beings
get to buy their souls back.

00:15:30.135 --> 00:15:31.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes,
that's the wish.

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:32.740 align:middle line:90%
That's the wish.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:34.330 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think
we're all going

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.210 align:middle line:84%
to need to come to
terms with not only what

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:39.790 align:middle line:90%
do we really want, but how--

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:41.380 align:middle line:84%
this economy is never
going to go back

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:42.910 align:middle line:84%
to the way it was
six months ago.

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And none of us
know precisely what

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:45.600 align:middle line:90%
that is going to look like.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It will be different.

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:47.410 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: It'll be different.

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:48.827 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
there's going to be

00:15:48.827 --> 00:15:51.490 align:middle line:84%
a need for medical
professionals and for engineers.

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:54.250 align:middle line:84%
But there's also going to be
need for all kinds of jobs that

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:55.660 align:middle line:84%
can't be outsourced,
whether it's

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:59.240 align:middle line:84%
auto mechanic or
hairstylist or you name it.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:05.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think certainly, in
this past generation or two,

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.980 align:middle line:84%
we have as a society,
made a terrible mistake

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:12.310 align:middle line:84%
of failing to attach appropriate
prestige to those jobs.

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:13.528 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, we have.

00:16:13.528 --> 00:16:15.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Those
are wonderful jobs.

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Calling
them blue collar.

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:17.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah, I
don't like any of that.

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.162 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
elevating white collar.

00:16:19.162 --> 00:16:19.962 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Amen.

00:16:19.962 --> 00:16:21.100 align:middle line:90%
I don't like any of that.

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:23.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right down to the
criminal justice system.

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:25.300 align:middle line:84%
You can get away
with horrific crimes

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.430 align:middle line:84%
if you have a white
collar, if you

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:29.432 align:middle line:90%
have a whiter, whitest collar.

00:16:29.432 --> 00:16:30.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Absolutely.

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:32.515 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's pretty
sickening when you look back.

00:16:32.515 --> 00:16:35.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: A jet plane crashes
with 180 people on board,

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.720 align:middle line:84%
there will never be any
criminal prosecutions.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.442 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's correct, yeah.

00:16:39.442 --> 00:16:41.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're on the same page
in virtually everything anyway

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:42.900 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:44.610 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back to
the notion of magic.

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:47.630 align:middle line:84%
So we hear people thinking,
OK, I know what I want now.

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:49.220 align:middle line:90%
How do I manifest this?

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And you kind of look to your
book of magic or miracles

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:54.870 align:middle line:90%
and you span all of them.

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:56.170 align:middle line:90%
You use everything.

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm just going to
read a couple of things

00:16:58.170 --> 00:16:59.820 align:middle line:84%
here, because this
is interesting.

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:02.871 align:middle line:84%
The word magic itself
has a connotation.

00:17:02.871 --> 00:17:04.079 align:middle line:90%
Some people are afraid of it.

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:05.470 align:middle line:90%
Some want to dive into it.

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:08.819 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and because of the notion
of black and white magic.

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:09.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:12.800 align:middle line:84%
So, and basically,
Aleister Crowley,

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.359 align:middle line:84%
whose work you've also studied,
whom many people shudder

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:16.470 align:middle line:90%
at the name of, right?

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:19.349 align:middle line:84%
He's saying, simply
put the science and art

00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:23.460 align:middle line:84%
of causing change to occur
in conformity with will, that

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.380 align:middle line:90%
is what he's calling magic.

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:28.950 align:middle line:84%
I pulled that out of one, I
believe one of your articles.

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:32.160 align:middle line:84%
The art and science of causing
change to occur in conformity

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.270 align:middle line:90%
with our will.

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:34.920 align:middle line:90%
Or I would say, desire.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.240 align:middle line:90%
OK, will or desire.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.790 align:middle line:84%
Singer wrote, and
you can tell us

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:41.250 align:middle line:84%
who Singer is, we're all
black magicians in our dreams

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:44.580 align:middle line:84%
and our fantasies,
perversions, and phobias.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:48.210 align:middle line:84%
So everyone has a little
bit of black magic.

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:51.240 align:middle line:84%
If you're thinking
clearly an unkind thought,

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.400 align:middle line:84%
and hermetics go
deeply into this,

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:57.150 align:middle line:84%
if you're thinking an unkind
thought about this person

00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:02.220 align:middle line:84%
over there that is putting
out a thread of energy,

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.080 align:middle line:90%
a thought form in the world.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.720 align:middle line:90%
That's black magic.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Well,
it's interesting.

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say, I felt a
sense of great liberation,

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.780 align:middle line:84%
personally speaking
in my search,

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:19.170 align:middle line:84%
when I began pushing
away the idea of being

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:21.030 align:middle line:84%
afraid of black
magic and turning

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:23.610 align:middle line:84%
from black magic,
of averting my eyes

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:25.080 align:middle line:90%
from so-called black magic.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And today, I think
we're in an era that's

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:29.940 align:middle line:90%
beyond white and black magic.

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that concept
serves us well anymore.

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:34.155 align:middle line:84%
But to use the
old terms, I would

00:18:34.155 --> 00:18:36.030 align:middle line:84%
say if somebody asked
me for a definition of,

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:38.520 align:middle line:84%
what do you mean when
you say black magic?

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean very simply it's
my will be done versus thy

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:42.330 align:middle line:90%
will be done.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:44.100 align:middle line:84%
We read in scripture,
thy will be done

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:47.250 align:middle line:84%
and we write to merger will with
a higher will of the creator

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:48.240 align:middle line:90%
or god.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:51.270 align:middle line:84%
I would have to say to be
plain, traditionally speaking,

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:53.530 align:middle line:90%
black magic is my will be done.

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:55.652 align:middle line:84%
However, I bring a
different wrinkle to it.

00:18:55.652 --> 00:18:58.110 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned the name Aleister
Crowley, and lots of people

00:18:58.110 --> 00:18:59.790 align:middle line:90%
cringe when they hear Crowley.

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:03.780 align:middle line:84%
Crowley was a brilliant
magician, a brilliant artist,

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.250 align:middle line:90%
a brilliant intellect.

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:09.090 align:middle line:84%
Crowley, in my estimation
had a terrible ethical lapse.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And if he was living, I
wouldn't be one of his students.

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:16.675 align:middle line:84%
Crowley, I think
was insufficiently--

00:19:16.675 --> 00:19:17.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Principled?

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:18.967 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: --versed
or principled

00:19:18.967 --> 00:19:20.950 align:middle line:90%
in the idea of reciprocity.

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:24.075 align:middle line:84%
Reciprocity, all of
life is one whole.

00:19:24.075 --> 00:19:25.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Will over others.

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes,
will over others.

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:31.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what I consider
black magic, will over others.

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: It's an
interesting question.

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:35.080 align:middle line:90%
I sit with that question.

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:37.810 align:middle line:84%
I do believe in
cosmic reciprocity.

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:39.850 align:middle line:84%
Another person
might call it karma.

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:42.070 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that
whatever I do to another,

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:43.603 align:middle line:90%
I'm ultimately doing to myself.

00:19:43.603 --> 00:19:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And there's no question
about that in my mind.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.687 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you have a
very high sense of ethics

00:19:47.687 --> 00:19:49.970 align:middle line:84%
and a very broad background
in the use of mind.

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:51.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: I appreciate that.

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:55.120 align:middle line:84%
So I really take very seriously
that whatever I'm doing

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm ultimately doing to self.

00:19:56.590 --> 00:20:01.440 align:middle line:84%
I can't function without
an ethical backdrop.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.090 align:middle line:84%
Crowley did not have an ethical
backdrop and people around him

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:05.200 align:middle line:90%
got hurt.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.720 align:middle line:84%
You could learn from
Crowley but you must,

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:11.620 align:middle line:84%
must see the terrible
lapses in his character.

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:13.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it's
not just Crowley.

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:16.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've interviewed
many, many, many people.

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.628 align:middle line:84%
And some of them I know
the personal side of.

00:20:18.628 --> 00:20:19.920 align:middle line:90%
They're not walking their talk.

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.160 align:middle line:90%
We can just say that.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.118 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Absolutely.

00:20:22.118 --> 00:20:26.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lot of people are
brilliant in terms of content.

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:28.010 align:middle line:90%
But they're not necessarily--

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:30.800 align:middle line:90%
and what is the saying?

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.770 align:middle line:84%
We teach best what
we need to learn.

00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of
people I interview,

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:37.168 align:middle line:84%
actually, well, a number of
them fall in that category.

00:20:37.168 --> 00:20:38.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: It's
the truth and we get

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:40.330 align:middle line:90%
to see the sausages being made.

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:43.510 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you know the
person behind the workshop,

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:45.270 align:middle line:84%
you get to see the
sausages being made.

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:46.450 align:middle line:90%
And it ain't always pretty.

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:47.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it's not.

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's surprising, some
of the people actually

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:51.580 align:middle line:84%
that pose as the
greatest light are often

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:53.320 align:middle line:90%
the ones that are doing harm.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
people that seem--

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:58.480 align:middle line:84%
I remember interviewing-- I'm
not going to name his name.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.530 align:middle line:84%
I think we have him
in our archives here.

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:02.170 align:middle line:84%
But when he came
into the studio,

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:03.640 align:middle line:90%
everyone was like, oh my god.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.950 align:middle line:84%
You know it was like
darkness is coming our way.

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:09.550 align:middle line:84%
This was one of the
sweetest hearts and kindest

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:13.790 align:middle line:84%
men, gentleman like
in the heart, even.

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And yet some of the
principles also aligned

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:19.930 align:middle line:84%
with the intellectual
principles of Crowley.

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:22.870 align:middle line:84%
So we ourselves need
to go out of fear

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:24.160 align:middle line:90%
and have our own discernment.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.230 align:middle line:84%
Like, no, you crossed
the line there.

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:27.380 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe that.

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:29.260 align:middle line:90%
That's black magic to me.

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:30.930 align:middle line:90%
May not be to someone else.

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:32.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: I know who
you mean and I also

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:33.370 align:middle line:90%
won't mention his name.

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:35.770 align:middle line:84%
But I personally like him
because I know in his heart

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:36.730 align:middle line:90%
he's an ethical person.

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:37.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: And I want people
to feel that their search has

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:40.980 align:middle line:90%
no boundaries.

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And I also want to
start to throw out

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.350 align:middle line:90%
some of our vocabulary.

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:47.000 align:middle line:84%
Because we hem people
into thinking like that's

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:47.800 align:middle line:90%
a good person.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.090 align:middle line:90%
That's a bad person.

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:51.970 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the actual
story of a person's life

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:55.030 align:middle line:84%
can be very complex and can
have to do with what barriers

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:57.430 align:middle line:84%
they're dealing with, what
they're pushing against,

00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:00.040 align:middle line:84%
who they are, their
sense of reciprocity.

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And those who
advertise themselves

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:08.180 align:middle line:84%
as being the whitest magic,
I mean, we've both seen it.

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:11.410 align:middle line:84%
You part the curtain and there's
anger, there's desperation,

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:14.110 align:middle line:84%
there's outburst, there's
humiliating other people.

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:15.843 align:middle line:90%
And it can make you cynical.

00:22:15.843 --> 00:22:17.260 align:middle line:84%
But I would say,
don't be cynical.

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:18.130 align:middle line:90%
Don't be cynical.

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:19.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with you.

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:20.530 align:middle line:90%
Don't be cynical.

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:22.600 align:middle line:90%
In fact, there are always tells.

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.030 align:middle line:84%
When you're listening
to a person and you're

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:26.500 align:middle line:90%
in a person's field.

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.240 align:middle line:90%
How is this making me feel?

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.250 align:middle line:84%
You know, they're speaking
sparkly, nice words,

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:32.200 align:middle line:90%
but wow, my heart hurts.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.160 align:middle line:90%
My guts hurt.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.225 align:middle line:90%
I want to run.

00:22:34.225 --> 00:22:37.210 align:middle line:84%
Pay attention because you're
getting conflicting information

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:38.950 align:middle line:90%
that's in a subtle field.

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, this is
really hard because we

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:45.400 align:middle line:84%
have to know started detaching
our intellect from everything

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:49.270 align:middle line:84%
we've been told is true into
a level of true discernment,

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:50.920 align:middle line:84%
which gets us back
to the original part

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:52.360 align:middle line:90%
of the conversation.

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.340 align:middle line:84%
When you keep reducing,
reducing, reducing,

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:55.900 align:middle line:90%
we go to desire.

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:57.960 align:middle line:90%
Crowley calls it will.

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And desire fueled by will
is a very, very powerful.

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:02.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes, yes.

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:05.830 align:middle line:84%
I would say desire
fueled by will is,

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:08.770 align:middle line:90%
it's the primeval form of magic.

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:10.960 align:middle line:84%
It's the deepest
part of ourselves.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:13.720 align:middle line:84%
You know I would suspect
that all of your viewers

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:16.330 align:middle line:84%
probably can identify
a period of time

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:19.060 align:middle line:84%
in life where they said
to themselves, maybe

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:21.370 align:middle line:84%
when they were very young,
maybe when they were older,

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:22.820 align:middle line:90%
I know exactly what I want.

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.790 align:middle line:84%
I know exactly what
I have to go for.

00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And I would always ask people
to hold onto that recollection.

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:31.270 align:middle line:84%
Think about what the
circumstances were

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:35.050 align:middle line:84%
when you experienced it and ask
yourself, can I cultivate this?

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:36.520 align:middle line:90%
Because there's magic in that.

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And I've experienced
it myself and recently.

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:40.630 align:middle line:90%
You can't always cultivate it.

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:42.250 align:middle line:84%
It can't always
be grasped again.

00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:43.630 align:middle line:90%
But sometimes it can.

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:46.840 align:middle line:10%
And I know I had an experience
myself about 20 years ago,

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:48.910 align:middle line:10%
where I walked to the
top of a stone tower that

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:52.430 align:middle line:10%
was on the banks of the Charles
River in Westin, Massachusetts.

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:54.430 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't supposed to be
inside this stone tower.

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:56.260 align:middle line:84%
It was covered with
grating and stuff.

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:57.513 align:middle line:90%
But I had to go inside.

00:23:57.513 --> 00:23:58.930 align:middle line:84%
And I got to the
top of this tower

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:01.760 align:middle line:84%
and I looked out over the
Charles, and I said to myself,

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:02.740 align:middle line:90%
I want to be a writer.

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:04.662 align:middle line:84%
I want to be an
established author.

00:24:04.662 --> 00:24:05.870 align:middle line:90%
And something went out of me.

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And it was the most
magical moment of my life.

00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:10.600 align:middle line:84%
I know people listening
have had those experiences.

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:11.730 align:middle line:90%
Watch for those.

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:12.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I do conferences,
sometimes, very rarely,

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:18.370 align:middle line:84%
where I'll take a
small group of people

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:21.520 align:middle line:84%
and I'll take them into my home
for two, three days together.

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And I do this one
particular meditation

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:26.560 align:middle line:84%
that brings back the
magic of what you

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.920 align:middle line:90%
desired at five, six years old.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Brilliant,

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:31.053 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Brilliant.

00:24:31.053 --> 00:24:34.990 align:middle line:84%
Because we're much closer
at that age to the desires

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:38.920 align:middle line:84%
we came in with, even if it's
not literally the feeling

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:41.230 align:middle line:84%
that fueled that
desire at that age

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:44.260 align:middle line:84%
and reconnecting with
that particular feeling

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:46.510 align:middle line:84%
may or may not be
associated with that thing

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:48.310 align:middle line:84%
that they love
doing at that time.

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:51.940 align:middle line:84%
But it's going back and tracing
when what moments in my life

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:53.820 align:middle line:90%
have I felt that feeling.

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:55.360 align:middle line:90%
That's the feeling of passion.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:56.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's wonderful.

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:59.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, this is something I
talk about in one of my books.

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:01.570 align:middle line:84%
The philosopher
Goethe had a principle

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:06.250 align:middle line:84%
that what you wish for when
you're very, very young

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:08.590 align:middle line:84%
will come upon you in
waves when you're old.

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:09.890 align:middle line:90%
So be careful.

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people hear that
and they want to argue with it

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:12.700 align:middle line:90%
and say, well, wait a minute.

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.770 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of things I
wish for I haven't got.

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And I would always say,
take some time with that.

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:18.520 align:middle line:90%
Peel back the onion.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.940 align:middle line:84%
Because you may find
an uncanny congruity

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:25.180 align:middle line:84%
between your fantasies when you
were even as young as age three

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:28.150 align:middle line:84%
or four and what you're
living out right now.

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:29.530 align:middle line:90%
We're very forgetful.

00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And with intervals of time we
fail to make connections, just

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:33.880 align:middle line:90%
human nature.

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.130 align:middle line:84%
But if you really allow the
onion to be peeled back,

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:40.030 align:middle line:84%
you might find an extraordinary
symmetry between the earliest

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:41.975 align:middle line:90%
fantasies and present life.

00:25:41.975 --> 00:25:42.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:45.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in my life has
been quite literal.

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:47.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my earliest
fantasies were all artistic,

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:49.860 align:middle line:90%
but especially dancing.

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:52.180 align:middle line:84%
You know going borrowing
someone's coffee table

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:54.910 align:middle line:84%
book at five to teach myself
ballet, because no one would

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:56.290 align:middle line:90%
give me lessons.

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:58.450 align:middle line:84%
But then again, picking
up ballet as an adult,

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:01.100 align:middle line:84%
I was taking ballet
again right before COVID.

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:03.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, tango
dancing, tap dancing,

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:06.160 align:middle line:84%
you know, something about
having communication

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:09.400 align:middle line:84%
moved through the body,
because I wasn't very I wasn't

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.560 align:middle line:90%
very open and communicative.

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:15.280 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't speak with my
mouth, but my body could speak.

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And so I find that that's
facilitated all kinds

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:18.700 align:middle line:90%
of communication sense.

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:21.755 align:middle line:84%
And even being a journalist
and a film producer, when

00:26:21.755 --> 00:26:23.130 align:middle line:84%
I was very young,
I thought, god,

00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:25.420 align:middle line:90%
could a woman direct a film?

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And 20, 30 years later I'm on
a mountaintop with my crew.

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:32.715 align:middle line:84%
It's like oh my god, I had
this fantasy as a girl.

00:26:32.715 --> 00:26:34.840 align:middle line:84%
Tell me some of those for
you and some other people

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:37.465 align:middle line:84%
because this is exciting when we
start, because people watching

00:26:37.465 --> 00:26:39.520 align:middle line:84%
right now are, oh
my god, I remember

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.985 align:middle line:90%
what I was excited about.

00:26:41.985 --> 00:26:43.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: I'll
share it very frankly.

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:46.720 align:middle line:84%
When I was a kid just
from the youngest age,

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:49.270 align:middle line:84%
like let's say age
four, I vividly

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:51.160 align:middle line:84%
remember that when
we were playing--

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.160 align:middle line:84%
I was playing some kind
of game with my friends,

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:57.010 align:middle line:84%
whether it was an army game
or cowboys or whatever it was,

00:26:57.010 --> 00:26:59.440 align:middle line:84%
I was internally
imagining that I

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:03.850 align:middle line:84%
was playing the part of a cowboy
or playing the part of an army

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:07.850 align:middle line:84%
guy in a movie, in a TV show and
that there was a camera on me.

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:10.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, I didn't disclose
this to my friends.

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And they were surely having
their own experiences.

00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:16.060 align:middle line:84%
But that was part of my
earliest stock of memories.

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And I look at my life
today, and very often I

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:20.770 align:middle line:84%
am in front of cameras and
I am in front of audiences.

00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:22.510 align:middle line:90%
I am in front of microphones.

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:24.640 align:middle line:84%
It didn't come about
in exactly the way

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.120 align:middle line:90%
that I could have imagined.

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:27.440 align:middle line:90%
But it came about.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.170 align:middle line:90%
And it did so decisively.

00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And I really want people
to turn their minds back

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.430 align:middle line:90%
to those earliest fantasies.

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:36.100 align:middle line:84%
There is so much information
there about who we are

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:37.900 align:middle line:90%
and who we must be.

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:38.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And so, I encourage
everybody right now just,

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:42.940 align:middle line:84%
even if you have to hit
pause, go back and think

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:45.830 align:middle line:84%
about it before we even go
on with this conversation.

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:46.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:48.430 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of
places we can go here.

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:50.680 align:middle line:84%
But one of them is, you've
been in Egypt recently.

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.555 align:middle line:84%
And I was going to
use a segue to that,

00:27:52.555 --> 00:27:55.600 align:middle line:84%
that the whole notion of
this black and white, light

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:58.060 align:middle line:84%
and dark, you know, white
magic, black magic, that

00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:00.820 align:middle line:84%
dates back thousands
and thousands of years,

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:02.390 align:middle line:90%
these principles.

00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
you were talking about

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:08.950 align:middle line:84%
was the notion that you
have set and Horus embracing

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:11.860 align:middle line:90%
one another in this statuary.

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:14.530 align:middle line:90%
Talk about that.

00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:17.710 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll get into Egypt,
the culture, and everything.

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:20.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Horus is seen as
sort of the Redeemer figure

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:22.030 align:middle line:90%
in ancient Egyptian culture.

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:25.570 align:middle line:84%
Set is seen sometimes as
the adversarial figure,

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:27.220 align:middle line:90%
the satanic figure.

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And one of the old
kingdom pharaohs

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:32.080 align:middle line:84%
was trying to unite
Upper and Lower Egypt,

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:36.970 align:middle line:84%
and he instructed his artists to
depict images of Set and Horus

00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:38.410 align:middle line:90%
embracing one another.

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:41.008 align:middle line:84%
And I was just overwhelmed
when I saw these base reliefs.

00:28:41.008 --> 00:28:42.550 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't
see that very often.

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:43.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I have not that.

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.620 align:middle line:90%
That's why it really caught me.

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:45.670 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: They're rare.

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, there's
the whole human situation.

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:48.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What dynasty
was that, which pharaoh?

00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:49.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: It was one of
the old kingdom dynasties

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:51.250 align:middle line:90%
but I don't recall the pharaoh.

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:53.332 align:middle line:84%
And it's in the Egyptian
National Museum.

00:28:53.332 --> 00:28:54.790 align:middle line:84%
It's somewhere off
in the basement.

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:56.220 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's not
very widely seen.

00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:56.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In Cairo?

00:28:56.890 --> 00:28:57.765 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: In Cairo.

00:28:57.765 --> 00:28:59.560 align:middle line:90%
But it's absolute magnificent.

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:01.570 align:middle line:84%
I have some images
which I can post online

00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:03.310 align:middle line:90%
for people, which I will do.

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's the whole
human situation.

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:07.870 align:middle line:84%
We have to embrace these
different sides of us,

00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:09.190 align:middle line:90%
because they're all us.

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:09.990 align:middle line:90%
They're all us.

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:12.885 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean throwing
reciprocity out the window.

00:29:12.885 --> 00:29:15.010 align:middle line:84%
But we can't be divorced
from these different sides

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:15.810 align:middle line:90%
to ourselves.

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:17.690 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere along the
line, the human story

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:22.160 align:middle line:84%
got broken down into a white
magic, black magic dichotomy.

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And we're afraid of the
fact that we're both.

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:25.730 align:middle line:90%
We're both.

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:27.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's what I like
so much about the story you're

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:28.580 align:middle line:90%
telling about yourself.

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:33.350 align:middle line:84%
You can appreciate what Aleister
Crowley brought to the front

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:36.635 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the way in which
humans can use their desire

00:29:36.635 --> 00:29:38.137 align:middle line:90%
and their will for outcome.

00:29:38.137 --> 00:29:40.470 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, you're not
going to follow his ethics.

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:43.220 align:middle line:84%
You're going to apply it with
a very highly developed sense

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:44.090 align:middle line:90%
of ethics.

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:47.810 align:middle line:84%
And yet, right
now in this world,

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:49.520 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen
more polarization.

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:50.478 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Absolutely.

00:29:50.478 --> 00:29:52.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you can
make a person wrong,

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:54.730 align:middle line:90%
you're going to make you wrong.

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And there's a deep need to have
I don't even understand fully,

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:02.940 align:middle line:84%
this need for such
re-entrenched identity,

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:06.220 align:middle line:84%
that everything outside
of that is simply wrong.

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:09.220 align:middle line:84%
What you're asking for, what
we're talking about here

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:11.155 align:middle line:90%
is literally to throw that away.

00:30:11.155 --> 00:30:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's my wish.

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How does
that happen in such

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:16.157 align:middle line:90%
an incredibly polarized world?

00:30:16.157 --> 00:30:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: It's
interesting you know,

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:19.532 align:middle line:84%
obviously some of the
problems we're facing

00:30:19.532 --> 00:30:20.950 align:middle line:90%
have to do with social media.

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:22.840 align:middle line:90%
Human nature hasn't changed.

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Media
and social media.

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:25.888 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Media
and social media.

00:30:25.888 --> 00:30:28.480 align:middle line:84%
There's something about the
anonymity of social media

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:29.913 align:middle line:90%
that I don't like.

00:30:29.913 --> 00:30:31.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It brings
up a meanness.

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:32.163 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: It does.

00:30:32.163 --> 00:30:33.820 align:middle line:84%
It brings up a
meanness and there's

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:37.450 align:middle line:84%
a disinhibition of the wrong
kind that encourages people,

00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:41.560 align:middle line:84%
sometimes anonymously,
sometimes not, to make

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:44.750 align:middle line:84%
a withering and nasty and
sarcastic comment at will,

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:48.160 align:middle line:90%
24/7, always and everywhere.

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's really problematic
because it's not

00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:52.280 align:middle line:90%
accompanied by bravery.

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:53.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:54.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: There isn't
a commensurate bravery.

00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:56.665 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to get
up in somebody's face,

00:30:56.665 --> 00:30:58.490 align:middle line:84%
that may or may
not be a good idea.

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:01.390 align:middle line:84%
But if you're going to do
it, at least bear witness.

00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:03.470 align:middle line:84%
At least be who
you actually are.

00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:06.130 align:middle line:84%
But when you're hiding
behind an anonymous handle

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:09.460 align:middle line:84%
or when you're functioning at a
social remove or the perception

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:11.710 align:middle line:84%
of social remove, it's
kind of like everybody's

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:14.890 align:middle line:84%
going all guns blazing
with no consequence.

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:16.330 align:middle line:84%
But there are
consequences, which

00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:18.200 align:middle line:90%
is we've degraded one another.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And we've made sarcasm, which
has its uses, into the language

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.140 align:middle line:90%
of everyday life.

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:25.000 align:middle line:84%
I always tell
people, if you want

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000 align:middle line:84%
to stand more tall, if you
feel like you're suffering

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.600 align:middle line:84%
from a poor self-image, give
yourself one hour in which you

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:34.810 align:middle line:84%
desist from gossip,
humiliating other people,

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:38.350 align:middle line:84%
or withering sarcasm, and see
if you don't stand more tall.

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:39.220 align:middle line:90%
You will.

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:40.630 align:middle line:90%
These things degrade us.

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:41.710 align:middle line:90%
These things degrade us.

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:42.710 align:middle line:90%
And people don't see it.

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:45.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They don't and we
don't know how subtle it is

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:47.570 align:middle line:84%
and how serious it
is in our own lives.

00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:48.370 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Right.

00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:49.210 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:51.030 align:middle line:90%
It all--

00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:53.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Making even a little
dig like, oh, god, them again?

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:54.880 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Exactly.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.070 align:middle line:84%
It does come back
to the individual.

00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:59.200 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a
faculty within us that's

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.540 align:middle line:84%
sometimes called auto
suggestion, that we

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:02.510 align:middle line:90%
are what we think.

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:03.310 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:06.850 align:middle line:84%
Auto suggestion, let's say, or
conditioning shape self-image.

00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:10.180 align:middle line:84%
We also are shaped by what
we're always saying and thinking

00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:11.230 align:middle line:90%
about other people.

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:12.640 align:middle line:90%
We don't get a pass.

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:16.260 align:middle line:84%
That auto suggest is a function
that reverberates back to us.

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And I would venture
that other people

00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:19.570 align:middle line:90%
have had this experience.

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:23.770 align:middle line:84%
If you go to lunch with somebody
who draws you into gossiping

00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:26.890 align:middle line:84%
and you spend 90 minutes
gossiping, just talking down

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:28.780 align:middle line:84%
other people for
cheap thrills, you

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.130 align:middle line:84%
will feel almost physically
sick after that lunch.

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:31.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:33.778 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: I've had that
experience, Listen to that.

00:32:33.778 --> 00:32:35.680 align:middle line:90%
That's valuable information.

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.110 align:middle line:90%
Imagine what's going on 24/7.

00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:39.400 align:middle line:90%
But it can be unplugged from.

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:40.270 align:middle line:90%
It is possible.

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:41.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there's
also a fine line

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:44.440 align:middle line:84%
between sharing kind of
critical, uncomfortable

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:46.270 align:middle line:90%
information and gossip.

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:48.160 align:middle line:84%
So how do you even
make that discernment

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:50.810 align:middle line:84%
because people need to know in
their bodies, how to discern.

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:54.010 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Sure, listen, people
have to call out injustice

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:54.850 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:32:54.850 --> 00:32:57.032 align:middle line:84%
People have to air
problems sometimes.

00:32:57.032 --> 00:32:58.240 align:middle line:90%
We're going to have friction.

00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.897 align:middle line:84%
That's part of the
human situation.

00:32:59.897 --> 00:33:01.480 align:middle line:84%
And if you talk it
over with a friend,

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:03.020 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be
representing your side

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:04.690 align:middle line:84%
and they'll be representing
the other side.

00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:07.065 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that there's
not a place for that in life.

00:33:07.065 --> 00:33:08.080 align:middle line:90%
Of course there is.

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.390 align:middle line:84%
But it's talking
down people in kind

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:13.202 align:middle line:90%
of a wise ass kind of way--

00:33:13.202 --> 00:33:15.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That makes you
feel somehow superior.

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:17.290 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Superior, exactly.

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:19.750 align:middle line:84%
Taking pleasure at
other people's pain

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:23.620 align:middle line:84%
or suffering, taking
an attitude that--

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:24.920 align:middle line:90%
almost it's entertainment.

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:27.102 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's smear
as entertainment.

00:33:27.102 --> 00:33:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And we know when we
cross over into that.

00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:31.030 align:middle line:84%
We know when we cross over
to smear as entertainment.

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We do and
another area that

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:39.490 align:middle line:84%
dovetails in with that is
assigning motives to a person

00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:41.260 align:middle line:90%
and what they're doing and why.

00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:45.160 align:middle line:84%
We can say, I really don't
like what you're doing.

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:47.050 align:middle line:84%
I think what you're
doing is wrong.

00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:50.340 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying, you're
just doing this because.

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Now this is a whole other
layer that we tend to do.

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:55.420 align:middle line:84%
We want to assign
motive because it's

00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:58.780 align:middle line:84%
where our mind would assign
the motive, where we might jump

00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:01.900 align:middle line:84%
into that exact behavior
or we're familiar with

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:03.010 align:middle line:90%
or we've experienced.

00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:04.480 align:middle line:90%
Talk a little bit about that.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:05.930 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: It's a trust issue.

00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:08.389 align:middle line:84%
You know, we see people taking
a position on, let's say,

00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:11.380 align:middle line:90%
a certain political issue.

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And we immediately
think, aha, you're

00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:15.100 align:middle line:84%
taking that position
because you're this

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:16.360 align:middle line:90%
or because you're that.

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:17.860 align:middle line:90%
And it's not always true.

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:18.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:19.780 align:middle line:84%
You don't always know
someone's motive.

00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:20.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: You don't
know their motive.

00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:21.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sometimes
you're totally wrong.

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:23.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: And it's also
important, I believe,

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:26.380 align:middle line:84%
on the other end, to be
very, very plain with people,

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:28.360 align:middle line:90%
to say what you believe.

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:31.659 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that I think
we have gotten into overusing

00:34:31.659 --> 00:34:35.469 align:middle line:84%
on social media are
rhetorical questions,

00:34:35.469 --> 00:34:38.230 align:middle line:84%
rhetorical questions,
where we're not really

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:39.040 align:middle line:90%
asking a question.

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:41.120 align:middle line:90%
A question is a sacred thing.

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:44.050 align:middle line:84%
The question is at the
heart of the human exchange.

00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And if we turn questions
into just a device--

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:48.945 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To prove
yourself right.

00:34:48.945 --> 00:34:50.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: We
reduce our ability

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:52.360 align:middle line:84%
to even have an exchange
with one another.

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:54.699 align:middle line:84%
Don't ask a question
frivolously.

00:34:54.699 --> 00:34:57.280 align:middle line:84%
Don't ask a question
in a rhetorical way.

00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:02.080 align:middle line:84%
It really is a profound misuse
of the language, of the psyche,

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:04.060 align:middle line:84%
it makes it impossible
for us to communicate.

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:05.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:08.670 align:middle line:84%
We have gone far afield
and I'm so glad we have.

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:11.560 align:middle line:84%
But now we're going to go
back to the notion of now

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:13.180 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
deconstructing

00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:14.680 align:middle line:90%
some of these bad habits.

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:16.330 align:middle line:84%
We're actually
talking about the fact

00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:18.580 align:middle line:84%
that maybe we can leave
the Ouija board behind.

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:20.705 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah, that's
very interesting actually,

00:35:20.705 --> 00:35:22.240 align:middle line:90%
the old Ouija board.

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:25.180 align:middle line:84%
I believe there's a lot
that we can leave behind.

00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:29.320 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think that
if we accept that we have

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:30.700 align:middle line:90%
an extra physical existence.

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think in addition to the
testimony of seekers, which

00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:36.730 align:middle line:84%
extends back centuries,
we are seeing so much

00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:38.540 align:middle line:84%
in the sciences
today, whether it's

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:42.760 align:middle line:84%
psychical research, or quantum
theorizing, or neuroplasticity,

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:46.600 align:middle line:84%
or advances in placebo studies,
we've seen so much to conclude

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:48.130 align:middle line:84%
at this point in
the 21st century

00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:50.590 align:middle line:84%
that materialism
simply no longer covers

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:51.750 align:middle line:90%
the bases of life.

00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:54.550 align:middle line:84%
Philosophical materialism,
the belief that matter just

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:57.280 align:middle line:84%
creates itself, it
simply doesn't work.

00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.800 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't work it may
continue to hold sway

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:02.170 align:middle line:84%
in academia and other
places, but it no longer

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:03.400 align:middle line:90%
covers the bases.

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:06.610 align:middle line:84%
So if we can all
come to the agreement

00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:10.090 align:middle line:84%
that we do have some kind of
an extra physical existence,

00:36:10.090 --> 00:36:14.870 align:middle line:84%
it stands to reason that emotive
thoughts, mental pictures,

00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:19.090 align:middle line:84%
a focused will, a sense of
reciprocity, these things

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:22.960 align:middle line:84%
are in themselves
sufficient to enact what

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:25.030 align:middle line:84%
Aleister Crowley, for
example, was seeking

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:26.500 align:middle line:90%
through magic and ritual.

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:27.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Here, here.

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:29.842 align:middle line:84%
OK so now we're going
to talk about a couple

00:36:29.842 --> 00:36:31.300 align:middle line:84%
of really interesting
things I read

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:33.250 align:middle line:84%
about through one
of your articles

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:35.190 align:middle line:84%
having to do with
the placebo effect.

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And this one was
really wonderful.

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:40.000 align:middle line:84%
It was talking about
a placebo where

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.850 align:middle line:84%
the people in the
study actually we're

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:45.878 align:middle line:84%
told they're being
given the sugar pill.

00:36:45.878 --> 00:36:47.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean that's normally
not the way it goes.

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:49.090 align:middle line:84%
You get the drug,
the sugar pill.

00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:51.310 align:middle line:84%
They were told they were
being given a sugar pill.

00:36:51.310 --> 00:36:51.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's right.

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:52.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Take it from here.

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:54.378 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: There this is
the so-called honest placebo

00:36:54.378 --> 00:36:56.920 align:middle line:84%
study that was conducted several
years ago at Harvard Medical

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.185 align:middle line:90%
School.

00:36:58.185 --> 00:37:00.310 align:middle line:84%
Harvard took a group of
subjects who were suffering

00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:02.680 align:middle line:90%
from irritable bowel syndrome.

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:04.838 align:middle line:84%
One group of subjects
was given nothing.

00:37:04.838 --> 00:37:06.130 align:middle line:90%
They were just a control group.

00:37:06.130 --> 00:37:10.030 align:middle line:84%
Another group of subjects was
given effectively a sugar pill.

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And this group of subjects was
told transparently and upfront,

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:15.670 align:middle line:90%
this is a sugar pill.

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:18.320 align:middle line:84%
You are receiving an
inert, inactive substance.

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:24.570 align:middle line:84%
59% of those subjects reported
significant and lasting relief.

00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:26.920 align:middle line:90%
It was absolutely extraordinary.

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:29.320 align:middle line:84%
And my hat is really off
to these researchers,

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:32.200 align:middle line:84%
because not only did they
structure a very innovative

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:36.910 align:middle line:84%
experiment, but they held
back from judging the results.

00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:39.430 align:middle line:84%
They said, look, we found
something extraordinary.

00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:42.490 align:middle line:84%
The placebo effect
works transparently.

00:37:42.490 --> 00:37:43.720 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:45.400 align:middle line:90%
Now what do we do with it?

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.240 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:49.030 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that a wonderful Question
everybody wants to jump to why,

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:49.930 align:middle line:90%
why?

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:53.933 align:middle line:84%
You know, I-- let me say
of course I'm not sure.

00:37:53.933 --> 00:37:55.350 align:middle line:84%
I've thought about
it quite a bit.

00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:56.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've
thought about it too.

00:37:56.910 --> 00:38:00.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean we can understand how
a positive image, feeling,

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:02.470 align:middle line:90%
and desire works.

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:04.600 align:middle line:84%
But to know this thing
doesn't necessarily

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:08.118 align:middle line:84%
represent that, and to still get
the good will of that desire.

00:38:08.118 --> 00:38:09.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: It's amazing.

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:13.510 align:middle line:84%
It's like the individual him
or herself, I would venture,

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:16.990 align:middle line:84%
I would venture, that most
people in our culture today,

00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:18.940 align:middle line:84%
most people if you
say to them, you

00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:21.670 align:middle line:84%
know what the placebo effect
is, would say, well, of course.

00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:23.200 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe in
the effectiveness

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.290 align:middle line:90%
of the placebo effect?

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:25.660 align:middle line:90%
They would say, of course, sure.

00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:28.090 align:middle line:84%
I have read this
and that article.

00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:32.320 align:middle line:84%
The very knowledge that the mind
can materially affect the body

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:34.210 align:middle line:90%
is in itself sufficient.

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:37.360 align:middle line:84%
And if people can be reasonably
encouraged in that direction

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:41.060 align:middle line:84%
and told the truth as this study
tells them, here's the truth.

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:42.532 align:middle line:90%
You can actually do this.

00:38:42.532 --> 00:38:44.490 align:middle line:84%
Think of the possibilities
that presents to us.

00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:45.832 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: It's amazing.

00:38:45.832 --> 00:38:48.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Back to pure mind,
pure desire, pure will.

00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And now there was
another study, it

00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:51.733 align:middle line:84%
had to do with
maids, hotel maids.

00:38:51.733 --> 00:38:52.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: The hotel maids.

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:54.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about it.

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:56.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Absolutely
mind blowing.

00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:58.570 align:middle line:84%
People are going to
think I'm making this up

00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:00.370 align:middle line:84%
and I encourage
them to go online,

00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:03.130 align:middle line:84%
put in the search terms,
find the scientific journals

00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:04.510 align:middle line:90%
that this was written about in.

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And call me out if I'm
exaggerating any of it.

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:08.452 align:middle line:90%
Call me out.

00:39:08.452 --> 00:39:09.910 align:middle line:10%
There was a
psychologist at Harvard

00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:12.910 align:middle line:10%
named Ellen Langer who did
a study several years ago

00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:14.680 align:middle line:10%
with a group of hotel maids.

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:17.320 align:middle line:84%
She divided the subjects,
as in most of these studies,

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:21.430 align:middle line:84%
into a control group, who
just went about their business

00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:24.100 align:middle line:84%
as normal, and
then a study group.

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:26.620 align:middle line:84%
Langer and her colleagues
told the study group

00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:29.410 align:middle line:84%
the truth, which is
that the work they're

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:31.700 align:middle line:84%
doing every day
as hotel maids has

00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:35.020 align:middle line:84%
aerobic and anaerobic benefit,
and did they know that?

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Most of the maids said,
well no, I didn't know that.

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And Langer and her
colleagues said, well, yeah.

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:41.020 align:middle line:90%
Check this out.

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:43.420 align:middle line:84%
You're pushing around
vacuums all day long.

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:44.470 align:middle line:90%
You're changing linen.

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:45.370 align:middle line:90%
You're moving around.

00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:46.730 align:middle line:90%
You're on your hands and knees.

00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:48.070 align:middle line:90%
You're pushing a cart.

00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:51.550 align:middle line:84%
These things have aerobic
and anaerobic benefit.

00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:56.570 align:middle line:84%
Six weeks in, the control
group showed no change.

00:39:56.570 --> 00:40:00.740 align:middle line:84%
The study group
showed weight loss,

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:05.570 align:middle line:84%
lowered blood pressure, greater
flexibility, and greater muscle

00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:06.800 align:middle line:90%
to fat ratio.

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:08.780 align:middle line:90%
They had done nothing different.

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:11.297 align:middle line:84%
Langer and her team was
monitoring their activities.

00:40:11.297 --> 00:40:13.130 align:middle line:84%
There was no difference
in their activities.

00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:16.930 align:middle line:84%
Just knowing the truth,
which is that their jobs had

00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:20.060 align:middle line:84%
aerobic and anaerobic benefit,
made a concrete difference

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:22.340 align:middle line:84%
in their health,
measurable, measurable,

00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:24.620 align:middle line:84%
even to the extent
of weight loss,

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:27.590 align:middle line:84%
muscle tone, lowered
hypertension.

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:29.130 align:middle line:90%
It's just incredible.

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:30.505 align:middle line:84%
These people were
told the truth.

00:40:30.505 --> 00:40:31.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it
wasn't that they

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:33.500 align:middle line:84%
had to go into a
deep belief system.

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:35.150 align:middle line:90%
It was just an understanding.

00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:36.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, OK, sure.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:36.800 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Just an acceptance.

00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:39.320 align:middle line:84%
They monitored their
activities carefully.

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:41.000 align:middle line:84%
There was no change
in their activities.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.820 align:middle line:84%
But knowledge itself,
accurate knowledge

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:45.030 align:middle line:90%
of what they were doing.

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:48.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, listen the phrase has
to be used, mind over matter.

00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:49.370 align:middle line:90%
Mind over matter.

00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:51.050 align:middle line:90%
That's not an exaggeration.

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:53.240 align:middle line:90%
No one challenges this data.

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:56.190 align:middle line:84%
They might challenge the
implications of the data.

00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:57.773 align:middle line:90%
But those are the implications.

00:40:57.773 --> 00:41:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And there's many other things in
neuroplasticity, where thoughts

00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:02.810 align:middle line:84%
change the neural
pathways through which

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:04.670 align:middle line:90%
electrical impulses travel.

00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:08.090 align:middle line:84%
The designer of neuroplasticity,
a psychologist at UCLA,

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:10.130 align:middle line:84%
Jeffrey Schwartz,
he's brave enough

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:12.530 align:middle line:84%
to say, yes, this is
actually mind over matter.

00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:14.240 align:middle line:90%
This is mind over matter.

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:16.413 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing this
in our generation.

00:41:16.413 --> 00:41:18.830 align:middle line:84%
So to say that we lead an extra
physical existence, that's

00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:20.067 align:middle line:90%
not a far out statement.

00:41:20.067 --> 00:41:20.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is not.

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:22.820 align:middle line:90%
And that to me was--

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:24.890 align:middle line:84%
the statement, the one
statement you made alone,

00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:26.510 align:middle line:90%
i to simply under--

00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:31.070 align:middle line:84%
if humanity simply understood
that they are extra

00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:32.210 align:middle line:90%
dimensional.

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:35.210 align:middle line:84%
They have an extra dimensional,
metaphysical component.

00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:36.560 align:middle line:90%
This is just part of it.

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Just to even know that and
accept it, as you said,

00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:41.420 align:middle line:84%
actually created the outcome
from the first experiment.

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:43.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: And it's amazing,
what we're talking about

00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:46.100 align:middle line:84%
is very elementary,
mainstream stuff.

00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:48.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm not even going into
psychical research.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.672 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going into
quantum theorizing.

00:41:49.672 --> 00:41:51.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going into
any of that stuff that

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:52.850 align:middle line:90%
gets more controversial.

00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:55.260 align:middle line:84%
No one questions this
data and there it is.

00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:56.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:57.980 align:middle line:84%
We have another little area
I'd like to dabble into

00:41:57.980 --> 00:41:59.960 align:middle line:84%
and then I want to find out
what you were doing in Egypt

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:01.805 align:middle line:84%
and then I want to talk
about your new book.

00:42:01.805 --> 00:42:03.930 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to have to
hop through these things.

00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:05.560 align:middle line:90%
Anarchic magic.

00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:07.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:10.820 align:middle line:84%
That's basically ripping it
all up, ripping it all up,

00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:12.530 align:middle line:84%
throwing out the
various rule books,

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:14.390 align:middle line:84%
throwing out the
various liturgies,

00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:16.700 align:middle line:84%
throwing out the symbols,
rites, and ceremonies,

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:18.080 align:middle line:90%
and designing it for yourself.

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:18.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This was big
for you because you

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:20.120 align:middle line:90%
have symbols on your body.

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:22.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes, I do. , Well
I love the symbols that I have

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:23.540 align:middle line:90%
on my body.

00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:26.720 align:middle line:84%
They remind me of things in life
that I care very deeply about

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:28.680 align:middle line:84%
or memories or periods
of time or people

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:29.930 align:middle line:90%
that I care very deeply about.

00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I think
you said in one article,

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:32.200 align:middle line:90%
you have a sigil.

00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:33.325 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH HOROWITZ: Yes I do.

00:42:33.325 --> 00:42:34.980 align:middle line:84%
I have a sigil on
the back of my neck.

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:36.800 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what it
means because I really

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:39.532 align:middle line:84%
trust the sorceress
who made it for me.

00:42:39.532 --> 00:42:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm going
to let you do this.

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:42.740 align:middle line:90%
It's someone in Mexico City.

00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:44.090 align:middle line:90%
She sent it to me.

00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:45.716 align:middle line:90%
Talk about trust.

00:42:45.716 --> 00:42:47.580 align:middle line:84%
So I got it tattooed
on the back of my neck.

00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:50.110 align:middle line:84%
I really believe in going
all the way, you know.

00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:51.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're all in.

00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:51.800 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: So, yeah.

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:52.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm all in.

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:53.750 align:middle line:90%
That's my choice.

00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So anarchic
magic means throw it away.

00:42:55.850 --> 00:42:57.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Throw
it away, including

00:42:57.350 --> 00:42:58.630 align:middle line:90%
the term anarchic magic.

00:42:58.630 --> 00:42:59.930 align:middle line:90%
You know, that's my term.

00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:01.790 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't have to
be my neighbor's.

00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:02.730 align:middle line:90%
Do whatever you like.

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:04.355 align:middle line:84%
But I want people to
feel that liberty.

00:43:04.355 --> 00:43:06.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that was the
idea of this conversation.

00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:07.800 align:middle line:90%
We're in a post magic world.

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:08.600 align:middle line:90%
Go to the source.

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:09.710 align:middle line:90%
Go to your desire.

00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:12.470 align:middle line:84%
Go to the understanding you
are a supernatural being,

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:13.525 align:middle line:90%
just by being here.

00:43:13.525 --> 00:43:14.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: I
believed every word

00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:16.067 align:middle line:90%
of that, every word of that.

00:43:16.067 --> 00:43:18.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now let's go to Egypt,
and the documentary you're

00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:19.500 align:middle line:90%
doing.

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:20.410 align:middle line:90%
It looks beautiful.

00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh.

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:20.810 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've just seen
that little trailer.

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:22.670 align:middle line:90%
So talk about that.

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:24.140 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing there?

00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:26.990 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Last year,
filmmaker Ronnie Thomas and I

00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:30.710 align:middle line:10%
traveled to Egypt, where we
are shooting a documentary

00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:32.600 align:middle line:10%
on the book, "The
Kybalion" which

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:36.920 align:middle line:10%
a very wonderful, magical
book it was published in 1908.

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:41.052 align:middle line:84%
Which is basically a modern
adaptation of Hermetica.

00:43:41.052 --> 00:43:42.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of Hermetica, yeah.

00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: So it's the
psychology of the Hermetica.

00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:47.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
which would of course,

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:49.410 align:middle line:84%
have to take you to the
mother country, Egypt.

00:43:49.410 --> 00:43:50.660 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That was our wish.

00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:51.460 align:middle line:90%
That was our wish.

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:53.390 align:middle line:84%
We said, look, we
don't just want

00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:55.100 align:middle line:84%
to sit in front
of a green screen.

00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:58.350 align:middle line:84%
We really, really want
to go to the source.

00:43:58.350 --> 00:44:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And so we went to Egypt and we
shot there for about two weeks.

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:05.300 align:middle line:84%
It was an amazing
experience because we

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:08.060 align:middle line:84%
got to go places that I never
thought I would get to go.

00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:09.980 align:middle line:10%
It was also a very
chaotic experience.

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And I love the nation of Egypt
and I love the Egyptian people.

00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:15.800 align:middle line:84%
It is a tough country
to navigate around in.

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And we had to do a lot to get
places and to get cooperation,

00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:21.380 align:middle line:90%
but we did get cooperation.

00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:24.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you go to the
main places, like Luxor--

00:44:24.110 --> 00:44:24.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, yeah,
we went to the--

00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:25.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --and Ramana.

00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:25.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:28.280 align:middle line:84%
We went to the main places,
including the Great Pyramids

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:29.190 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:31.370 align:middle line:84%
But we got to go to
some places deep, deep

00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:33.620 align:middle line:90%
underneath The Valley of Kings.

00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:35.600 align:middle line:84%
We got to go to some
very out of the way

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:39.500 align:middle line:84%
places in the Temple of
Karnak, the Karnak complex.

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And I had some
opportunities to lay hands

00:44:42.350 --> 00:44:43.820 align:middle line:84%
on antiquities,
which is something

00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:45.590 align:middle line:90%
that I approach very carefully.

00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:48.890 align:middle line:84%
Because if everybody that comes
along lays hands on something,

00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:50.150 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be ruinous.

00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And I thought this
through very carefully.

00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:54.940 align:middle line:84%
But I was given the permission
to do it and I did do it.

00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And it was just a physically
tactile, real experience.

00:44:57.670 --> 00:45:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And we talk about, one
of the experiences I had

00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:03.910 align:middle line:84%
was laying hands on a beautiful
magnificent ceremonial bowl.

00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And I just felt absolute
lightning course

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:06.920 align:middle line:90%
through my body.

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:08.230 align:middle line:84%
There's no other
way I can put it.

00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:09.647 align:middle line:84%
There's no other
way I can put it.

00:45:09.647 --> 00:45:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to
get a sense of some

00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:14.470 align:middle line:84%
of what the ancient ancestors
might have experienced.

00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so much
of their iconography

00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:20.380 align:middle line:84%
had to do really with
the movement of the stars

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:21.280 align:middle line:90%
and the solar system.

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:22.463 align:middle line:90%
As above, so below.

00:45:22.463 --> 00:45:24.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: As above, so below,
the great Hermetic dictum.

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And if a person can live
with that statement,

00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:28.420 align:middle line:90%
it sounds so simple.

00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:29.980 align:middle line:90%
As above, so below.

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And yet live with it and
begin to apply it to life,

00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:35.810 align:middle line:84%
and you'll see it begins
to unmask so much to you.

00:45:35.810 --> 00:45:37.060 align:middle line:90%
There's a great power in that.

00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:37.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It really does.

00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:39.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean as soon as you said you
laid your hands on the bowl,

00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:41.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm thinking the Age of Taurus.

00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:43.750 align:middle line:84%
What was happening at that
time and inbued in that.

00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:45.110 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: There's so much--

00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:49.110 align:middle line:84%
you know the ancients had such
a profoundly deep understanding

00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:49.910 align:middle line:90%
of nature.

00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:53.350 align:middle line:84%
They were so connected to
nature in ways that I am not,

00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:55.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we've
even begun to grapple

00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:57.250 align:middle line:90%
with what their experience was.

00:45:57.250 --> 00:45:58.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when
do we see this?

00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:00.215 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh,
well, you know we

00:46:00.215 --> 00:46:03.070 align:middle line:84%
got held up because of the
COVID epidemic and other things.

00:46:03.070 --> 00:46:06.910 align:middle line:84%
We are supposed to be doing
the final filming this summer.

00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:11.140 align:middle line:84%
So knock wood, you're going to
see it probably-- thank you,

00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:14.463 align:middle line:84%
I'm guessing in
late fall of 2020.

00:46:14.463 --> 00:46:15.880 align:middle line:84%
We thought it would
be out sooner,

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:17.710 align:middle line:84%
but the world
turned upside down.

00:46:17.710 --> 00:46:19.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 2021.

00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:20.467 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: No, no, 2020.

00:46:20.467 --> 00:46:21.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This year?

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:22.660 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: 2020 is possible.

00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:23.560 align:middle line:90%
We might see it.

00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:25.307 align:middle line:84%
We might see it in
November, December.

00:46:25.307 --> 00:46:26.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful.

00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:28.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: You know
that's optimistic,

00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:31.847 align:middle line:84%
but we're doing our
final shoots this summer.

00:46:31.847 --> 00:46:32.680 align:middle line:90%
That much I can say.

00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm so excited
because just having a peek,

00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:36.422 align:middle line:84%
it looks like you're
doing a beautiful job.

00:46:36.422 --> 00:46:38.740 align:middle line:84%
The fact that you
ferreted out Set and Horus

00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:41.570 align:middle line:84%
embracing each other,
I've not seen that before.

00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:43.630 align:middle line:84%
When I go to the
Egyptian exhibit sites,

00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:47.440 align:middle line:84%
certainly in Paris, obviously
and New York, Paris,

00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:49.488 align:middle line:90%
and London, any opportunity.

00:46:49.488 --> 00:46:51.280 align:middle line:84%
But then of course,
the Egyptian government

00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:54.370 align:middle line:84%
called back a lot of the
antiquities and I miss them.

00:46:54.370 --> 00:46:56.822 align:middle line:84%
Because I haven't gone
to the exhibit in Cairo.

00:46:56.822 --> 00:46:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Well here's
one thing that's funny.

00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:02.320 align:middle line:84%
In Egypt, when the
tour guides or whomever

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:05.260 align:middle line:84%
wants to sort of put a
label on you, at some point

00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:09.070 align:middle line:84%
the conversation they'll
say, oh, you're a meditator.

00:47:09.070 --> 00:47:11.410 align:middle line:84%
That's how they'll label
an occultist or a New Ager

00:47:11.410 --> 00:47:12.320 align:middle line:90%
or what have you.

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:13.538 align:middle line:90%
And yes, I'm a meditator.

00:47:13.538 --> 00:47:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And then they understand
what you're about.

00:47:15.330 --> 00:47:16.675 align:middle line:90%
So that's their lingo.

00:47:16.675 --> 00:47:17.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, I can't wait
to go there one day.

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:22.390 align:middle line:84%
OK, now let's get
to your newest book.

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:25.360 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, my newest book
is called "The Miracle Habits."

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:29.170 align:middle line:10%
And that is out July 14,
and in "The Miracle Habits,"

00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:34.300 align:middle line:10%
I very simply identify 13
habits, 13 daily actions,

00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:35.980 align:middle line:10%
that you can go
through life with.

00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think they can
help you really and truly

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:42.300 align:middle line:84%
demonstrate and exercise your
own ethical power in the world.

00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:43.550 align:middle line:90%
That's what the book is about.

00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:44.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's
about ethical power.

00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:46.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Ethical power,
and when I say ethical--

00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:48.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Ethics are
really needed right now.

00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:49.617 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Very much.

00:47:49.617 --> 00:47:50.877 align:middle line:90%
I simply mean reciprocity.

00:47:50.877 --> 00:47:51.960 align:middle line:90%
I simply mean reciprocity.

00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:53.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And explain
that for people

00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:55.120 align:middle line:84%
so they understand
your definition.

00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:56.495 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: What
I do to another,

00:47:56.495 --> 00:47:57.880 align:middle line:90%
I do to myself ultimately.

00:47:57.880 --> 00:47:59.830 align:middle line:84%
You know, there are people
who look at me and think, wow,

00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:01.788 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about
everything this guy is into,

00:48:01.788 --> 00:48:03.620 align:middle line:84%
because my search
gets really far out.

00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:05.440 align:middle line:84%
But it's always
done with the ethic

00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:07.823 align:middle line:84%
that what I do
returns to me, always.

00:48:07.823 --> 00:48:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And meanwhile, you
keep pumping out the articles

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:11.170 align:middle line:90%
for The Medium, right?

00:48:11.170 --> 00:48:11.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Working on it.

00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:12.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:14.440 align:middle line:84%
Anything else you want to
say before we say goodbye?

00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:16.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: I just want to
say, I know the difficulties

00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:17.730 align:middle line:90%
that people are going through.

00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:20.007 align:middle line:10%
I understand
economically and socially

00:48:20.007 --> 00:48:21.340 align:middle line:10%
what people are passing through.

00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:22.600 align:middle line:10%
And I know it's hard.

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:25.030 align:middle line:10%
But you have tools in your
belt that you might not always

00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:26.530 align:middle line:10%
be aware of, that
you might not have

00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:28.090 align:middle line:10%
been raised to be aware of.

00:48:28.090 --> 00:48:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And mind and will
and desire can help

00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:34.390 align:middle line:84%
you navigate this life in
