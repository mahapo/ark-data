00:00:27.984 --> 00:00:30.400 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Many of you
have read articles and seen

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.946 align:middle line:10%
programs on how to improve
your brain function,

00:00:32.946 --> 00:00:35.070 align:middle line:10%
particularly now that the
Baby Boomers are starting

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.470 align:middle line:10%
to reach that senior status.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.900 align:middle line:84%
But what if I were to tell you
that the best path to improving

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.430 align:middle line:84%
this function is through love,
forgiveness, and acceptance?

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.170 align:middle line:84%
What if I were to tell you
that that has been quantifiably

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.120 align:middle line:90%
proven in hard science?

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm here with Doctor
James Hardt who

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.160 align:middle line:84%
I went through-- about
a month or two ago went

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.650 align:middle line:84%
through a very intensive
brain training,

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.100 align:middle line:84%
your Biocybernaut
brain training program.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say,
it's one of the most--

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.870 align:middle line:84%
if I'd known how intense it
was, I might have chickened out.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.130 align:middle line:84%
However, it's one of the best
experiences I've ever had.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.759 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't mind,
let's just-- first of all,

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:11.300 align:middle line:84%
I want to know about
you, because you

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.400 align:middle line:90%
didn't talk about you.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.170 align:middle line:84%
We were all there for
a week, 12 hours a day

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.660 align:middle line:84%
with you, doing this
brain training program

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.910 align:middle line:84%
to boost alpha that really
was astounding in terms

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.860 align:middle line:84%
of having to address
everything that

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.670 align:middle line:84%
had been hidden
from our own view.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And there's no
cheating the system

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.210 align:middle line:84%
in this which is
what's so amazing.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.330 align:middle line:90%
So welcome, first of all.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.310 align:middle line:84%
>>JAMES HARDT: Thank
you for inviting me.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
also, let's begin with,

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.910 align:middle line:84%
how did this end
up your passion?

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And how did you
go down this road

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.170 align:middle line:84%
to making these
discoveries to begin with?

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.900 align:middle line:10%
>>HARDT: Well, I started
my academic career

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.920 align:middle line:10%
determined to be a physicist.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.220 align:middle line:10%
I was going to be a
particle physicist.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.110 align:middle line:10%
And one day, I came out of
the student union on campus

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.920 align:middle line:10%
and there was a beautifully
hand painted sign

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.380 align:middle line:10%
where every letter was a
different color announcing

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.420 align:middle line:10%
that Doctor Joe
Camia would speak

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.350 align:middle line:10%
on brain waves
and consciousness,

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.940 align:middle line:10%
at a time that was just 10
minutes, at a building that

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.560 align:middle line:10%
was right over here, and
I didn't have a class.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.039 align:middle line:90%
So I went, and I was enthralled.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out
he was working out

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.320 align:middle line:84%
of a lab in San Francisco--
University of California, San

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.980 align:middle line:90%
Francisco.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And he had discovered
a few years earlier

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.970 align:middle line:84%
that brain waves could
be voluntarily controlled

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.060 align:middle line:90%
if people had feedback.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And he was at the beginning
edges of this research.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.490 align:middle line:84%
Physics was a
400-year-old science.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:29.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, so how
many years ago was this?

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.700 align:middle line:84%
This was like four
decades ago or so, right?

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: Well, that summer
after his visit with him,

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.500 align:middle line:84%
I spent every spare hour in
the library reading everything

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.750 align:middle line:84%
I could find about brain waves
three times before I went,

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.440 align:middle line:84%
rode my motorcycle
to San Francisco

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.720 align:middle line:84%
that summer, the
Summer of Love, '68.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, yeah.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: And I volunteered as
a research subject in his lab,

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.380 align:middle line:84%
and had three sessions
of about an hour each,

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.840 align:middle line:84%
one electrode at the middle
of the back of my head,

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.020 align:middle line:84%
one speaker giving a sound
from that, and one score.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.937 align:middle line:84%
And it was fascinating,
and I loved it.

00:03:02.937 --> 00:03:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And so on the fourth day, I
wanted more and I went back,

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.210 align:middle line:84%
but they weren't
doing any studies.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.460 align:middle line:84%
However, I had learned a
little how the lab worked.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.850 align:middle line:84%
And I found his
girlfriend and persuaded

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.590 align:middle line:84%
her to put me in the chamber,
put on a few electrodes

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.490 align:middle line:90%
just so I could play.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.820 align:middle line:84%
Then she went upstairs,
got involved in work.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.010 align:middle line:84%
Lunchtime came, she
went out to lunch.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And in course 11 of a
12 course Chinese lunch,

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.010 align:middle line:84%
she went, oh my
gosh, and remembered

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.930 align:middle line:84%
there was somebody
in the chamber.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.638 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How long
had you been in there?

00:03:33.638 --> 00:03:34.890 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's see, course 11.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: Well and it
was early morning, too.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.350 align:middle line:84%
So it went all through the
morning and then lunch.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.080 align:middle line:84%
And so probably maybe
close to four hours.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.767 align:middle line:84%
And so they jumped
in the vehicle,

00:03:44.767 --> 00:03:47.100 align:middle line:84%
went hurdling back across
town, raced into the building,

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.130 align:middle line:84%
ripped open the
door, and interrupted

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.760 align:middle line:84%
the latter stages of a
most incredible adventure.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.930 align:middle line:84%
I had been a Protestant
fundamentalist and a physics

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.480 align:middle line:90%
major when I went in there.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.708 align:middle line:84%
And what I learned about
the nature of consciousness,

00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:04.120 align:middle line:90%
I was very, very expanded.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And that fall, at the
end of the summer,

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.740 align:middle line:84%
I rode my motorcycle
back to Pittsburgh

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.790 align:middle line:84%
and registered to be a
grad student in psychology,

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.079 align:middle line:84%
because I realized that this
was going to be my life's work.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And I needed my rational
mind to be certified,

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.830 align:middle line:84%
stamp of approval PhD
psychology, so people would

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.870 align:middle line:84%
take with some seriousness
the amazing things I

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.337 align:middle line:90%
knew I would be doing.

00:04:27.337 --> 00:04:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK now, let's
back up just a little bit.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.919 align:middle line:84%
First of all, explain
the difference

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.410 align:middle line:84%
to people between biofeedback
and neurofeedback.

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And you had how many
electrodes on your head?

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: Well in
that original study,

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.050 align:middle line:84%
there was one active
electrode in the middle

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.912 align:middle line:84%
of the occipital lobe, one
reference electrode on the ear,

00:04:43.912 --> 00:04:45.120 align:middle line:90%
and a ground on the forehead.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because this
was a very beginning.

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: Primitive,
very primitive.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A very
primitive neurofeedback.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.872 align:middle line:84%
And so just quickly, difference
between bio and neurofeedback.

00:04:52.872 --> 00:04:54.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: Well, it's kind
of like the difference

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.060 align:middle line:84%
between a vehicle
and an automobile.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.590 align:middle line:84%
An automobile is a vehicle,
but not all vehicles

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:01.690 align:middle line:90%
are automobiles.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.650 align:middle line:84%
So biofeedback-- I actually
tend to think of biofeedback as

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.110 align:middle line:90%
from here down.

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.910 align:middle line:84%
Training to warm your hands,
or reduce the muscle tension,

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.160 align:middle line:84%
or change the electrical
conductivity of the skin,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.200 align:middle line:84%
accelerate or slow
down your heart rate.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.980 align:middle line:84%
Whereas neurofeedback
is almost exclusively

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.380 align:middle line:84%
from here up, where you're
working with the brain.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet you have to
be able to access and utilize

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.555 align:middle line:84%
the mind and the
emotions in both

00:05:26.555 --> 00:05:28.180 align:middle line:84%
to be able to get
the desired effect.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDT: Oh yes, yes.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.480 align:middle line:84%
However, let me
give you an example.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.490 align:middle line:84%
At one point after this,
I had gone to India

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.710 align:middle line:84%
with a whole range of
technology to study gurus.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.830 align:middle line:84%
Now one of them was--
one of the devices

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.070 align:middle line:84%
I used-- was a galvanic
skin response meter, kind

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.740 align:middle line:84%
of like the E-meter
they use in Scientology.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And so I would put these on
yogis, and within five minutes,

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.760 align:middle line:84%
sometimes two
minutes, the E-meter

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.660 align:middle line:84%
would go flat, no
additional information.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.646 align:middle line:84%
Whereas for an
hour or more, there

00:06:01.646 --> 00:06:03.440 align:middle line:84%
would be continual
deepening, deepening,

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.740 align:middle line:90%
deepening of the brain waves.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.090 align:middle line:84%
So some of the physiological
parameters are, shall we say,

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.580 align:middle line:84%
relatively superficial
in relationship

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.030 align:middle line:90%
to deep consciousness.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
what was it that

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.600 align:middle line:84%
happened in the chamber that
day when you said they walked in

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.770 align:middle line:84%
on a deeply
life-altering experience?

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And explain the process
of how being hooked up

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.340 align:middle line:84%
to this, with the
three basic electrodes,

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.960 align:middle line:84%
interfaces with the shift
in that consciousness?

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.460 align:middle line:84%
So people get kind
of a framework

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.876 align:middle line:84%
that we're going
to be using here.

00:06:33.876 --> 00:06:36.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDT: Oh, excellent question.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.940 align:middle line:84%
The simplest way to
understand biofeedback

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:41.800 align:middle line:84%
for brain wave feedback--
neurofeedback--

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.420 align:middle line:90%
is to think of it as a mirror.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.400 align:middle line:84%
If you stand in
front of a mirror,

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.560 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't make you smile,
it doesn't make you frown.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.790 align:middle line:84%
But if you are going to
be an actress in a play,

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:54.700 align:middle line:84%
you can stand in
front of the mirror,

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.810 align:middle line:84%
and pull different
muscles in your face,

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.540 align:middle line:90%
and get the feedback.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.230 align:middle line:84%
So with a little feedback,
you can pretty soon

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.580 align:middle line:84%
make exactly the expression
you need to make for this role.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.110 align:middle line:84%
In the same way, with brain
wave feedback we pick up

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.910 align:middle line:90%
the brain waves, detect them.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:12.080 align:middle line:90%
They're very tiny signals.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.560 align:middle line:84%
They have to be amplified
about 100,000 times.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And then we filter
out selected bands,

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.840 align:middle line:84%
in this case alpha from the
theta, the delta, the beta,

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.220 align:middle line:90%
the gamma, and the alpha.

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.380 align:middle line:84%
We just pull out
the alpha and use

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.300 align:middle line:84%
that to run sounds,
musical sounds.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.310 align:middle line:84%
So if alpha gets bigger
at this point of the head,

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:32.079 align:middle line:90%
there's a tone that gets louder.

00:07:32.079 --> 00:07:34.370 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, if it gets bigger
at this point of the head,

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:37.020 align:middle line:84%
there's a different pitched
tone from a different speaker

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.950 align:middle line:90%
that gets louder.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:40.730 align:middle line:84%
So you literally have
a mirror for your mind,

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.869 align:middle line:84%
but it's a mirror that
works primarily with sound.

00:07:42.869 --> 00:07:44.535 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
working mostly though

00:07:44.535 --> 00:07:46.920 align:middle line:84%
with the subconscious
mind, right?

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.320 align:middle line:90%
Is that fair to say?

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: Well, the
whole point of this

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:52.730 align:middle line:84%
is to take that which
is in the unconscious

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:54.316 align:middle line:84%
and bring it into
the consciousness.

00:07:54.316 --> 00:07:56.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, for part of that we
have the computerized mood

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.657 align:middle line:90%
scales that you know about.

00:07:57.657 --> 00:07:58.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: Where the
computer can actually

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:04.430 align:middle line:84%
read emotions-- the
existence of emotions,

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:07.880 align:middle line:84%
positive and negative, that
the person's unconscious of.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to
get into the exact what

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.670 align:middle line:84%
happens in that training
in a little bit.

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:16.060 align:middle line:84%
I want to warm everybody up
to the notion of why we're

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.700 align:middle line:84%
working with certain brain
frequencies and the basics

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.220 align:middle line:84%
as you just explained
of neurofeedback itself,

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.650 align:middle line:84%
because you're able
to hear in this case--

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:27.540 align:middle line:84%
in some systems you'll
actually use little earbuds.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.860 align:middle line:84%
In this case, with
Biocybernaut, you're

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:33.189 align:middle line:84%
in a chamber where the sound is
being projected all around you.

00:08:33.189 --> 00:08:35.730 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: So you actually feel
it through your body as well as

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:36.510 align:middle line:90%
just your ears.

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:38.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and it
is very interesting.

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: Well and to go back
to your question about what

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.170 align:middle line:84%
was going on for me in
Joe Camia's chamber,

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:49.810 align:middle line:84%
the first four days-- which were
incredibly intriguing for me--

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:51.720 align:middle line:84%
I'd be sitting there in
the dark with my eyes

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.130 align:middle line:84%
closed, and the
tones would surge.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:56.890 align:middle line:84%
The tone would surge,
it would get louder.

00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:00.460 align:middle line:84%
Well immediately, my rational
mind would what did you do?

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:01.340 align:middle line:90%
How did you do that?

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that
would make it go away.

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And so with some
practice, what I learned

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:07.430 align:middle line:84%
to do when the
tone would surge is

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:10.839 align:middle line:84%
to restrain my rational
analytical mind

00:09:10.839 --> 00:09:12.380 align:middle line:84%
from coming in and
messing things up.

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:14.560 align:middle line:84%
But maybe I could only
restrain it for a half

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.950 align:middle line:84%
a second, with a little
practice, three quarters

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:19.280 align:middle line:84%
of a second, with
practice, two seconds.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.640 align:middle line:84%
But that additional time
allowed the alpha to emerge.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And that began to
produce a feeling

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:27.180 align:middle line:84%
such as might be
described by somebody

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:29.390 align:middle line:90%
in very advanced meditation.

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:31.770 align:middle line:84%
In meditation you're
also trying to tune

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:35.140 align:middle line:84%
into the subtle internal
signals of your alpha waves.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.860 align:middle line:84%
But there's no
feedback, and so you

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.530 align:middle line:90%
don't know if you're doing it.

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:43.340 align:middle line:84%
Which is why, in seven days
of the Biocybernaut training,

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.160 align:middle line:84%
people can learn to produce
the same brain wave patterns

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.430 align:middle line:84%
as if they did at
least 21 years of very

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:50.124 align:middle line:90%
disciplined zen meditation.

00:09:50.124 --> 00:09:51.290 align:middle line:90%
Technology speeds things up.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:52.664 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It is
very interesting.

00:09:52.664 --> 00:09:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And every person comes
with a different set

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.700 align:middle line:90%
of trauma and baggage.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.400 align:middle line:84%
So the effects for each
individual at the end of it

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.610 align:middle line:90%
are really quite different.

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:03.080 align:middle line:84%
But you just mentioned
something a moment ago.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.820 align:middle line:84%
So you allowed the beta
function of your brain,

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:08.960 align:middle line:84%
or the analytical function
of your brain, to interfere,

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.210 align:middle line:90%
which it's doing with us all--

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDT: Well, it's hard not to.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:12.420 align:middle line:90%
Because it's so automatic.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:13.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's so automatic.

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
want to get into.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.870 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about how the
average human being is living,

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:20.770 align:middle line:84%
day in and day out, in
the Western culture.

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:22.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDT: Reactive modes.

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:23.609 align:middle line:90%
They react.

00:10:23.609 --> 00:10:24.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it's mostly beta?

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:28.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's being
charged by beta?

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: Well, there's
tremendous stress and anxiety

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.450 align:middle line:84%
in modern culture, whether
it's financial stress,

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:37.180 align:middle line:84%
or relationship stress, or
related to the children,

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:40.130 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, there's a
tremendous amount of stress.

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And this suppresses
alpha and promotes

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:45.390 align:middle line:84%
beta mind, busy mind,
the inner dialogues.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:49.110 align:middle line:84%
Especially the negative
dialogues sabotage your alpha.

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And so you have a natural
predisposition to making alpha

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:56.320 align:middle line:84%
because the generator
of alpha is a pacemaker

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.816 align:middle line:84%
cells in the thalamus,
which is located about here,

00:10:59.816 --> 00:11:01.190 align:middle line:84%
middle of the
brain-- some people

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:02.650 align:middle line:84%
call it a brain
within the brain.

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And the pacemaker cells run
24 hours a day, 7 days a week,

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.970 align:middle line:84%
always urging your brain,
be in alpha, be in alpha.

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:12.440 align:middle line:84%
But what Shakespeare might
call the slings and arrows

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.220 align:middle line:84%
of outrageous fortune,
or just daily stress,

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:17.990 align:middle line:84%
sabotage the communication
of the thalamus

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:19.670 align:middle line:90%
with the surface of your brain.

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And so people have way less
alpha than is their endowment.

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:25.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.570 align:middle line:90%
It's so sad.

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:29.710 align:middle line:84%
But that's the hallmark
of modern times.

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And when I say modern
times, I mean really

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:34.320 align:middle line:84%
since the industrialization
of the world that's

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.990 align:middle line:90%
what became modern times.

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:38.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: Well Thoreau
spoke of a state of nature.

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:42.690 align:middle line:84%
The idea of maybe even
Garden of Eden, where things

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:45.900 align:middle line:84%
are peaceful, and tranquil,
and everything is provided for.

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.943 align:middle line:84%
This is a state which
will promote higher alpha.

00:11:48.943 --> 00:11:52.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But oddly,
because of the fear

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.870 align:middle line:84%
and, as you say, this
reactive state of mind

00:11:55.870 --> 00:12:00.460 align:middle line:84%
you're in that is forcing
us into an overuse of beta,

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:04.500 align:middle line:84%
it's even damaging the
way our beta functions.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.420 align:middle line:84%
Our beta's not even
functioning clearly.

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:08.600 align:middle line:84%
And explain-- let's talk
about the brain states,

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.450 align:middle line:90%
the aspects of brain function.

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:13.340 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about beta, and
what it's charged with doing,

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:18.522 align:middle line:84%
and then go to alpha theta, and
then down into awake, delta.

00:12:18.522 --> 00:12:20.230 align:middle line:84%
Let's explain that a
little bit so people

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:21.760 align:middle line:90%
know what the context is.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: Well, in
my research I've

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:26.990 align:middle line:84%
developed a thing called
brain energy maps.

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:28.780 align:middle line:84%
They're like
topological surfaces.

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:31.620 align:middle line:84%
I call it the cartography
of consciousness.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And in this, I can see--
we've got 21 different moods

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:37.960 align:middle line:84%
in the mood scales: anxiety,
depression, hostility,

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.270 align:middle line:84%
friendly, clear thinking,
sleepy, unhappy, vigor,

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:45.460 align:middle line:84%
things like that-- and I've
made four dimensional maps which

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:48.345 align:middle line:84%
show literally the
landscape of the mind

00:12:48.345 --> 00:12:50.470 align:middle line:84%
and the brain in different
states of consciousness.

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:54.220 align:middle line:84%
All the negative brain wave
states have elevated beta,

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:58.020 align:middle line:84%
whether it's anxiety,
unhappiness, depression,

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:01.900 align:middle line:84%
hostility, anger-- they
all have elevated beta

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:06.084 align:middle line:84%
and reduced or profoundly
suppressed alpha.

00:13:06.084 --> 00:13:08.000 align:middle line:84%
So this is how most
people are walking around.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.620 align:middle line:84%
They don't have the
endowment of alpha,

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:13.330 align:middle line:84%
and they have way more
beta than is healthy.

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:14.870 align:middle line:84%
Beta's associated
with a whole range

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:16.365 align:middle line:90%
of stress-related diseases.

00:13:16.365 --> 00:13:17.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's
talk about those.

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:21.470 align:middle line:84%
But also the point
I was getting to is,

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:25.770 align:middle line:84%
because of the driving
forces for the boosted beta,

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:27.980 align:middle line:84%
beta is also tasked
with that really

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.240 align:middle line:90%
clear mental functioning.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.640 align:middle line:84%
Say, if you're an attorney
presenting a case in court,

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:35.250 align:middle line:84%
you have to have really
clearly functioning beta.

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:36.890 align:middle line:90%
Most of us aren't that clear.

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:38.600 align:middle line:90%
Our memories are kind of off.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.959 align:middle line:90%
We're reactive.

00:13:40.959 --> 00:13:42.250 align:middle line:90%
You understand what I'm saying?

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:43.960 align:middle line:84%
We're in high beta but
it's not functional beta.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:44.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: The reason
I'm pausing is

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.970 align:middle line:84%
because there's two
very different ways

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:48.179 align:middle line:90%
to have that clarity of mind.

00:13:48.179 --> 00:13:49.803 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Good, so
let's talk about it.

00:13:49.803 --> 00:13:52.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: One is beta, stress,
anxiety, hostility, and so on.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:57.430 align:middle line:84%
Or if you let go of that and
you go into a high alpha state,

00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:00.260 align:middle line:84%
then you have a clarity of mind
which is really transcendent.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And it allows you access to your
creativity in ways that beta

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:04.580 align:middle line:90%
doesn't.

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:05.455 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:14:05.455 --> 00:14:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And the frequency
rise, you're looking

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.180 align:middle line:90%
at a range of frequency.

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.520 align:middle line:90%
And high alpha is right here.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Beta's here, high
alpha's right there.

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:14.276 align:middle line:84%
So it's sitting on that zone
between the two, really.

00:14:14.276 --> 00:14:16.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: The frequency
of alpha in the adults

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:19.240 align:middle line:84%
is between 8 and 13
cycles per second.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.120 align:middle line:90%
Above 13, you go into beta.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.780 align:middle line:84%
Unless you go far above that,
and then you come into gamma.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And so what we want
to do is we want

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.580 align:middle line:84%
to help people slow
down their brains.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And in the course of
that, they learned

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:35.270 align:middle line:84%
how to stop the mind chatter,
especially the negative voices.

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And one of the results
of the seven day

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:43.780 align:middle line:84%
alpha one training are a 50%
percent increase in creativity.

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:46.300 align:middle line:84%
That was a study we did with
Stanford Research Institute

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:47.260 align:middle line:90%
scientists.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:51.590 align:middle line:84%
There's also an IQ boost
that averages 11.7 points.

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And statistically, the
strongest effect of all

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:57.230 align:middle line:90%
is improvement in relationships.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes absolutely.

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:00.440 align:middle line:90%
I can attest to that.

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.950 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't mean the ride
isn't bumpy, necessarily.

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:03.624 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDT: No.

00:15:03.624 --> 00:15:05.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But there's
an improvement over all.

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: But you
can enjoy the bumps.

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:07.553 align:middle line:90%
I mean, look at roller coasters.

00:15:07.553 --> 00:15:10.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly, exactly.

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:12.250 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
one of the things

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:13.750 align:middle line:84%
when you're going
into this-- I just

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.260 align:middle line:84%
wanted to get clear on
neurofeedback and the brain

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:16.940 align:middle line:90%
states.

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Because we're going to
work our way into first

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.840 align:middle line:84%
some of the impediments to
really clear brain functioning.

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:25.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, before you go into the
Biocybernaut alpha training

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.060 align:middle line:84%
level one, you're very
clear with people,

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.680 align:middle line:90%
do not eat certain foods.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:34.710 align:middle line:84%
For example, onions,
garlic, caffeine.

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:37.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, these are mainstays
in most people's diets.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.640 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what those
things do to the brain,

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.370 align:middle line:84%
and then also why you
won't allow anybody

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:45.130 align:middle line:84%
to eat that before coming
into brain training.

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:47.180 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: Well, people
can eat what they want.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.006 align:middle line:90%
We recommend.

00:15:49.006 --> 00:15:50.505 align:middle line:84%
We don't have
policemen at the door.

00:15:50.505 --> 00:15:51.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is true.

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: But the
caffeine, nicotine,

00:15:57.750 --> 00:15:59.740 align:middle line:90%
alcohol all suppress alpha.

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:01.740 align:middle line:90%
They do it in different ways.

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:04.771 align:middle line:84%
Caffeine is a
vasoconstrictor, reduces

00:16:04.771 --> 00:16:05.770 align:middle line:90%
blood flow to the brain.

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:08.140 align:middle line:90%
Same with nicotine.

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:11.080 align:middle line:84%
If somebody-- one
time we had a lady

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.187 align:middle line:84%
who interrupted her
alpha training session,

00:16:13.187 --> 00:16:14.645 align:middle line:84%
said she had to go
to the bathroom,

00:16:14.645 --> 00:16:16.779 align:middle line:84%
but curiously she
took her purse along.

00:16:16.779 --> 00:16:18.320 align:middle line:84%
When she came back
from the bathroom,

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.820 align:middle line:90%
she smelled like tobacco smoke.

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.590 align:middle line:84%
When she sat down
in the chamber,

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:25.410 align:middle line:84%
the alpha that she had
just before leaving

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:29.640 align:middle line:84%
was reduced by a
factor of about five.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: And it
was just amazing.

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:35.440 align:middle line:84%
Nicotine, because it
goes through the lungs

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.792 align:middle line:84%
when you smoke, goes
right to the bloodstream.

00:16:37.792 --> 00:16:39.500 align:middle line:84%
Caffeine, which goes
through the stomach,

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.864 align:middle line:90%
takes a little bit longer.

00:16:41.864 --> 00:16:43.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So these
are vasoconstrictors.

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And so yet in the
morning, people

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:46.991 align:middle line:84%
feel like, I just
can't get going

00:16:46.991 --> 00:16:49.490 align:middle line:84%
until I have my cup of coffee
and in some cases a cigarette.

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:50.530 align:middle line:90%
But what's going on there?

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:52.863 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: Well, most people
have chronically under-slept.

00:16:52.863 --> 00:16:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And so when they wake
up, they're still groggy.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.830 align:middle line:84%
Instead of waking
up naturally, they

00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:01.550 align:middle line:84%
were probably dragged from
delta by their alarm clock,

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:02.624 align:middle line:90%
straight into beta.

00:17:02.624 --> 00:17:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And so they feel stressed,
and they're groggy,

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:05.915 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't
get enough sleep.

00:17:05.915 --> 00:17:09.163 align:middle line:84%
And so they put in way too
much caffeine or nicotine

00:17:09.163 --> 00:17:10.079 align:middle line:90%
to wake themselves up.

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:12.204 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's like--
it's having a dual effect.

00:17:12.204 --> 00:17:15.329 align:middle line:84%
On one level, it's boosting
dopamine in the body.

00:17:15.329 --> 00:17:17.520 align:middle line:84%
But on another, it's
restricting the-- as

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.175 align:middle line:90%
you say-- the vassal function.

00:17:20.175 --> 00:17:21.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
and alcohol works

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:23.780 align:middle line:84%
in a little bit of
a different way.

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:25.790 align:middle line:84%
Most people know
about happy hour.

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:27.930 align:middle line:84%
So they have high stress
work, they get off work,

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:29.980 align:middle line:84%
they go to a bar, and
they start drinking.

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And so alcohol relaxes
them physically.

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.870 align:middle line:84%
And so there may actually be
a period of about 45 minutes

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:38.370 align:middle line:84%
where their alpha
actually goes up,

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:40.440 align:middle line:84%
because they're letting
go of the stress

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:43.070 align:middle line:84%
and the tension in their
muscles is relaxing.

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:48.030 align:middle line:84%
However, alcohol is a central
nervous system depressant.

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And so if somebody
had even one beer,

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.199 align:middle line:84%
I can measure 24
hours later they're

00:17:53.199 --> 00:17:54.990 align:middle line:84%
going to have less
alpha in their baselines

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:58.110 align:middle line:84%
than if they hadn't
had that one beer.

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And so all of these
things suppress alpha.

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:04.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you're talking
about onions and garlic,

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:06.759 align:middle line:90%
I was raised in a German family.

00:18:06.759 --> 00:18:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And although we used
a lot of onions,

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.229 align:middle line:90%
garlic wasn't a part of it.

00:18:10.229 --> 00:18:12.520 align:middle line:84%
Garlic wasn't really part of
American culture very much

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.280 align:middle line:90%
until maybe 30 years ago.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.280 align:middle line:90%
And then it spread more broadly.

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:18.900 align:middle line:84%
But when I began doing
the Yogananda meditation

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:23.060 align:middle line:84%
lessons, correspondence lessons,
very early on Yogananda wrote,

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.260 align:middle line:84%
you have to start
eliminating onions and garlic

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.950 align:middle line:84%
from your diet because they
promote a rajasic temperament.

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:31.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, a rajasic temperament is
high stress beta, basically.

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And so what we see is that if
people even accidentally get

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:38.194 align:middle line:84%
some garlic, they're going
to come in the next day

00:18:38.194 --> 00:18:39.776 align:middle line:84%
and they're going
to be more agitated,

00:18:39.776 --> 00:18:41.700 align:middle line:84%
and their alpha levels
are going to be lower.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.380 align:middle line:84%
There's even an Arab
proverb that said,

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:45.230 align:middle line:84%
after the devil had
done his dirty work

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:47.150 align:middle line:84%
in the Garden of Eden,
when he walked out,

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:50.570 align:middle line:84%
where his first foot went,
that was where garlic grew.

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And where his second foot fell,
that was where onions grew.

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:57.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's known in many cultures
that onions and garlic are

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.650 align:middle line:84%
inimical to, shall we
say, spiritual growth.

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:02.450 align:middle line:90%
Even calmness of mind.

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:06.350 align:middle line:84%
I've had many people who eat
cloves of garlic a day say,

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:10.360 align:middle line:84%
no you can't tell me that garlic
makes me excited and hyper.

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:11.347 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:19:11.347 --> 00:19:13.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm glad I can't
deal with either one of them.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.910 align:middle line:90%
Those make me sick, really.

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:17.870 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's talk
about, conversely,

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:19.720 align:middle line:84%
what are some the
foods and beverages

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:23.090 align:middle line:84%
that will boost
a state of alpha?

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:24.080 align:middle line:90%
Are there any?

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:28.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: Well, the smell
of lavender enhances alpha.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.390 align:middle line:90%
Musk suppresses it.

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:35.860 align:middle line:84%
We ask people in the training
to eliminate spicy foods,

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:38.640 align:middle line:84%
because spicy foods tend
to agitate the mind.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.070 align:middle line:84%
This is like something
that's well known in yoga.

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:45.390 align:middle line:84%
That the diet should be
simple and more bland.

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And ideally, most or
all of the protein

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:50.580 align:middle line:90%
should be had at breakfast.

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.870 align:middle line:84%
Benjamin Franklin
was hip to this.

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:55.850 align:middle line:84%
He said, breakfast like a
king, lunch like a prince,

00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:57.340 align:middle line:90%
supper like a pauper.

00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:59.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, we could be a
little less sexist

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.036 align:middle line:84%
and say, breakfast like
a king or queen, lunch

00:20:01.036 --> 00:20:02.440 align:middle line:90%
like a prince or princess.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We get the point.

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:06.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So he also
said, eat few suppers

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:07.940 align:middle line:90%
and you'll need few medicines.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:10.940 align:middle line:84%
The idea of putting a-- protein
takes a long time to digest,

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:12.320 align:middle line:90%
as do oils.

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.800 align:middle line:84%
So they should be
consumed early in the day.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And so the evening
meal should be lighter.

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:21.857 align:middle line:84%
And so simple adjustments of
when you eat, what you eat

00:20:21.857 --> 00:20:22.940 align:middle line:90%
can make a big difference.

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:24.773 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that'll
make a big differences

00:20:24.773 --> 00:20:27.730 align:middle line:84%
as you wake up in the morning
to the alpha state you're

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:28.460 align:middle line:90%
in at that point.

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:28.890 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDT: Right on.

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:30.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, OK good.

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:32.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: Because if
you have a big meal,

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:33.920 align:middle line:90%
several things happen.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.010 align:middle line:84%
When you eat a big meal,
or really any meal,

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:40.140 align:middle line:84%
your body temperature has to go
up in order to digest the meal.

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:42.740 align:middle line:84%
That's why you eat a meal,
and even if it's a cold meal

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:44.831 align:middle line:90%
you suddenly feel warm.

00:20:44.831 --> 00:20:46.830 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is that
in order to fall asleep,

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:48.647 align:middle line:84%
your body temperature
needs to drop.

00:20:48.647 --> 00:20:50.480 align:middle line:84%
So if you eat a big
meal and then go to bed,

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.944 align:middle line:84%
you set up a war in your
body, where one part

00:20:52.944 --> 00:20:54.610 align:middle line:84%
is trying to make the
temperature go up,

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:56.568 align:middle line:84%
another trying to make
the temperature go down.

00:20:56.568 --> 00:20:58.980 align:middle line:84%
You get maldigestion,
putrifaction in the gut,

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:01.980 align:middle line:84%
and shallow, dream-filled,
restless sleep.

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:03.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is very
useful information.

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.480 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.210 align:middle line:84%
No, it's really--
it's important.

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:09.710 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to set it
up, because these

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:11.220 align:middle line:84%
are things people
can do at home.

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody's going to be able
to make it to alpha training.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.470 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody can
afford alpha training,

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:17.240 align:middle line:84%
but there are things
you can do for yourself.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:17.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDT: To shift.

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:19.386 align:middle line:84%
And you'd be healthier
as well as happier.

00:21:19.386 --> 00:21:20.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:23.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's bust into
the training itself.

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:30.940 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just speaking from--
I had no idea what to expect.

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:33.957 align:middle line:84%
I just knew that I'd heard
about the brain training

00:21:33.957 --> 00:21:35.790 align:middle line:84%
and the results people
were getting from it.

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And I was intrigued with
what you were doing.

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:42.662 align:middle line:84%
And just upfront, you had said,
well, we have one slot left.

00:21:42.662 --> 00:21:44.370 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you go ahead
and take that slot

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:45.540 align:middle line:84%
so you'll know
what you're talking

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:46.706 align:middle line:90%
about when you interview me?

00:21:46.706 --> 00:21:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh sure,
I have a couple days.

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.502 align:middle line:84%
I figured I'd come in for
a couple hours on a Monday,

00:21:52.502 --> 00:21:53.960 align:middle line:84%
and then maybe a
couple on Tuesday,

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.700 align:middle line:90%
wrap it up on Wednesday.

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:58.000 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea that it
was a 12-hour-a-day,

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.090 align:middle line:90%
7-day-a-week thing.

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:03.240 align:middle line:84%
So once I found that out,
I rearranged my schedule,

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.230 align:middle line:90%
obviously.

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:09.220 align:middle line:84%
But as you come into this, it
is so rigorous in the sense

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:12.750 align:middle line:90%
that everything is recorded.

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:15.770 align:middle line:84%
You can't run and hide from
the results of anything

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:18.720 align:middle line:84%
that you're dealing with,
because-- how long has it

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:21.920 align:middle line:84%
taken to develop the
protocols in such a way

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.280 align:middle line:84%
that everything is check
and rechecked so that you're

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.040 align:middle line:84%
getting this
coherent, so to speak,

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.674 align:middle line:90%
on the information coming out?

00:22:27.674 --> 00:22:29.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: Well, I've been
doing the work for decades.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:31.790 align:middle line:84%
When I first began--
and this is now

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:34.210 align:middle line:84%
going to jump back one of
your earlier questions--

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:37.160 align:middle line:84%
what happened to me when I
was forgotten in the chamber?

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:40.880 align:middle line:90%
I had out-of-body experience.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.740 align:middle line:90%
I had eco-disintegration.

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:46.980 align:middle line:84%
I had contact with angelic
realm beings, beings

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:48.930 align:middle line:84%
that didn't have
physical substance.

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:52.762 align:middle line:84%
And nothing in my life had led
me to know that such things--

00:22:52.762 --> 00:22:54.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As a
fundamentalist Protestant?

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:55.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDT: Yeah, yeah.

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:58.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I believed in angels,
but I'd never seen any.

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And so the
out-of-body experience

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:05.310 align:middle line:84%
and the eco-disintegration
when later, as I read,

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:08.460 align:middle line:84%
I found these are goals
and advanced meditation.

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And Krishna said, of one million
one hears of me, of one million

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.580 align:middle line:84%
that hears of me,
one reaches me.

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:18.617 align:middle line:84%
The odds of getting there in
meditation are very, very low.

00:23:18.617 --> 00:23:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons
for the rigorous days

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:22.270 align:middle line:84%
is, if you're going
to make 21 to 40 years

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:24.550 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual progress
in a week, there

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:27.265 align:middle line:84%
isn't a lot of time to
lollygag or go dancing a night.

00:23:27.265 --> 00:23:28.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: And so this experience
of being incredibly euphoric,

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:38.030 align:middle line:84%
and happy, and joyful, literally
lifting out of my body,

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.030 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to share
this with people.

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And so all I wanted to do
was share this with people.

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:44.705 align:middle line:84%
And when I rode
my motorcycle back

00:23:44.705 --> 00:23:46.080 align:middle line:84%
across the country
to Pittsburgh,

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.907 align:middle line:84%
one of the first things
I did after registering

00:23:48.907 --> 00:23:51.240 align:middle line:84%
for grad school, I went to
see Rolf Von Eckartsberg, who

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:54.070 align:middle line:84%
was a professor at
another university.

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:56.200 align:middle line:84%
He'd been a grad student
under Timothy Leary,

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.010 align:middle line:84%
and he understood
altered states.

00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And so I walked into the
room, and he said sit down.

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:04.255 align:middle line:84%
And he took his arm, and he
swept everything off the desk

00:24:04.255 --> 00:24:04.880 align:middle line:90%
onto the floor.

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And he said, tell me,
what's happened to you.

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And so I talked for
about three hours,

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:12.700 align:middle line:84%
telling him what had happened
in the Joe Camia's lab.

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And when I finished,
he went like this.

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:16.800 align:middle line:84%
He said, well we
can do this here.

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, like
that, I had a vocation.

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:22.440 align:middle line:90%
I had a vocation.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And so I wanted to help
other people into the state.

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:28.690 align:middle line:84%
But I discovered very
quickly that very few people

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:34.321 align:middle line:84%
could go into this state easily,
because of emotional traumas.

00:24:34.321 --> 00:24:35.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was
my next question.

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:37.330 align:middle line:90%
This is good.

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:38.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDT: Wonderful.

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:41.150 align:middle line:84%
In May of 2007,
Drunvalo and his wife

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:42.360 align:middle line:90%
did the alpha one training.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:46.080 align:middle line:84%
Afterwards he said,
95% of all the people

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:48.130 align:middle line:84%
that do his teachings--
work around the world

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:49.970 align:middle line:84%
do not get the fullness
of his teaching.

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And he said, it's always
because of one thing,

00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:53.200 align:middle line:90%
emotional traumas.

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And he added, I've never
found anything as powerful

00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:58.400 align:middle line:84%
as the Biocybernaut
training in getting rid

00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.800 align:middle line:90%
of emotional traumas.

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:02.490 align:middle line:84%
So your question about
timing, once I realized

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:05.580 align:middle line:84%
that people were not
responding to the technology

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:09.760 align:middle line:84%
as fully as I did, I figured
out it was emotional traumas,

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:14.030 align:middle line:84%
so I did about a 20-year detour
to develop a psychotechnology

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:18.130 align:middle line:84%
to tap into, detect the
unconscious emotional traumas.

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And then I developed this now
14 step forgiveness process,

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.990 align:middle line:84%
so people could go through and
clear all of their traumas.

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:28.601 align:middle line:84%
I jokingly say, if you had
parents, you have traumas.

00:25:28.601 --> 00:25:30.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's true
And I can validate

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:32.230 align:middle line:84%
what you said about Drunvalo,
because I saw him a little bit

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:32.480 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.855 align:middle line:84%
And I was telling him I was
going to be interviewing you.

00:25:34.855 --> 00:25:36.190 align:middle line:90%
And he said, it's amazing.

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:40.530 align:middle line:84%
Just what it does for clearing
emotional trauma is amazing.

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:42.244 align:middle line:90%
And so yes.

00:25:42.244 --> 00:25:43.410 align:middle line:90%
And I would agree with that.

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:45.539 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the training itself.

00:25:45.539 --> 00:25:47.330 align:middle line:84%
You have your group of
people that come in.

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:49.871 align:middle line:84%
And you're only dealing with a
handful of people at the time,

00:25:49.871 --> 00:25:52.337 align:middle line:84%
because this is extraordinarily
labor intensive.

00:25:52.337 --> 00:25:53.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Maximum of five.

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:56.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: And so first
of all, the people

00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:58.540 align:middle line:90%
get acquainted with you.

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And they lay it
on the table what

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:01.820 align:middle line:90%
they think they're there for.

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:03.710 align:middle line:84%
Now that's the operative
word, because what

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:06.930 align:middle line:84%
people think they're there for
by the end of the seventh day

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:09.940 align:middle line:84%
turns out to seldom be the
real reason they're there.

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:12.240 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's pretty miraculous.

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:15.770 align:middle line:84%
So explain from your prospective
what you're seeing in all of us

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:18.344 align:middle line:84%
on the other side and how
we progress through this.

00:26:18.344 --> 00:26:19.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: Well, one
of the things I

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.750 align:middle line:84%
say to people on
the first day: who

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:25.516 align:middle line:84%
you think yourself
to be, you will

00:26:25.516 --> 00:26:30.310 align:middle line:84%
know at the end of this week,
you never were that person.

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:33.330 align:middle line:84%
You're far more conscious,
you're far more loving,

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:34.750 align:middle line:90%
you're far more open.

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:38.280 align:middle line:84%
Your far more powerful in your
awareness, but your access

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.700 align:middle line:84%
to this power, to
these gifts, is

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:44.250 align:middle line:84%
limited by principally
the emotional traumas.

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:47.220 align:middle line:84%
So to get people
into the spirit,

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:49.880 align:middle line:84%
we first of all tell
them, today's play day.

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:51.450 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
do any hard work.

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:55.400 align:middle line:84%
You just go in an interface
with-- the mind machine

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.590 align:middle line:90%
interface is complex.

00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And it usually takes a
couple of days for people

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:00.850 align:middle line:90%
to fully understand it.

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:03.550 align:middle line:84%
So pretty quickly, we
take them to a chamber

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:06.130 align:middle line:84%
and we demonstrate
how the chamber works.

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:09.310 align:middle line:84%
How the mood scales work
with a small sample of words.

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:11.070 align:middle line:84%
We play the feedback
tones for them,

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:14.030 align:middle line:84%
put the scores up on the screen,
because every two minutes

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:16.730 align:middle line:84%
the audio feedback stops
and for eight seconds

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:19.657 align:middle line:84%
they get to look at scores that
quantify the power that they

00:27:19.657 --> 00:27:21.490 align:middle line:84%
put out at different
regions of their brain.

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:23.330 align:middle line:84%
As well as the degree
to which their left

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:25.121 align:middle line:84%
and their right brain
are working together.

00:27:25.121 --> 00:27:27.090 align:middle line:90%
We call that hemicoherence.

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And so after that
initial demonstration,

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:32.300 align:middle line:84%
then we go, we
measure their heads.

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:34.190 align:middle line:84%
A technician puts
the electrodes on,

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:36.070 align:middle line:84%
and we give them a
PowerPoint presentation

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:39.745 align:middle line:84%
to give them a little idea
about how this is going to work.

00:27:39.745 --> 00:27:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And then they go off to
the chambers and they play.

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:45.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, at the end of the chamber
time, we gather in a room

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:48.410 align:middle line:84%
where we have canopy beds
where people can sit or lie.

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And each person in
turn is carefully

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:53.310 align:middle line:84%
interviewed to talk
about their experiences.

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:56.320 align:middle line:84%
When an astronaut comes
back from a space mission,

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:59.070 align:middle line:90%
they're debriefed, interviewed.

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And so when the Biocybernauts
come back from an inner space

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:03.930 align:middle line:90%
mission, we debrief them.

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:06.150 align:middle line:90%
And so that does several things.

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:08.620 align:middle line:84%
One, it helps the other
people in the group

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:11.100 align:middle line:90%
to get ideas of things to try.

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:13.574 align:middle line:84%
And it also helps
their experience

00:28:13.574 --> 00:28:15.240 align:middle line:84%
to be transferred
from short term memory

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:17.570 align:middle line:84%
to long term memory, so
they'll have a chance

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:19.006 align:middle line:90%
to maybe do better.

00:28:19.006 --> 00:28:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Or if there were
things that they

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:21.945 align:middle line:84%
were doing that
are non-productive,

00:28:21.945 --> 00:28:23.820 align:middle line:84%
they could be labeled
as that by the trainer.

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:25.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or they're
just doing something

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:27.594 align:middle line:84%
that would be called a
shortcut or cheating, like I

00:28:27.594 --> 00:28:28.830 align:middle line:90%
did the first day.

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:31.160 align:middle line:90%
I thought, wow, look at that.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.315 align:middle line:90%
Look at those numbers.

00:28:32.315 --> 00:28:33.015 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDT: Opening your eyes?

00:28:33.015 --> 00:28:33.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
opened my eyes, but no.

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:36.320 align:middle line:84%
I was rolling them up
in the top of my head.

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.920 align:middle line:84%
I was rolling my eyes up
and the numbers were going.

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:41.980 align:middle line:84%
But also when I meditate
and go to certain levels,

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:43.490 align:middle line:90%
that is what I do.

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:45.690 align:middle line:84%
But you're not to do that
in the brain training,

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:49.530 align:middle line:84%
because it's really much more--
the protocols are much more

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:52.401 align:middle line:84%
systematic than just going off
on your own like I was doing.

00:28:52.401 --> 00:28:54.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: You want to learn
how to do it directly

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.840 align:middle line:84%
from the brain without
influence of muscles.

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:57.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:59.830 align:middle line:90%
And so, go ahead, sorry.

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:00.990 align:middle line:90%
So from there.

00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:04.197 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: Well, so this
is now bringing people

00:29:04.197 --> 00:29:06.030 align:middle line:84%
to the point where
they've had their chamber

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:07.340 align:middle line:90%
experience for the day.

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:09.980 align:middle line:10%
They've been to the
canopy room to debrief.

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:11.830 align:middle line:10%
And then they go off
to the dining room,

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:13.890 align:middle line:10%
where they have the
meal that they selected

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:16.990 align:middle line:10%
from a menu earlier in the
day, soup and salad primarily.

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And after that, we go back
to the conference room.

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And we then come out of
the participant role.

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And we bring them
in as like sort

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.590 align:middle line:84%
of collaborative
scientists, where

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:30.360 align:middle line:84%
they get to study their
brain waves with us

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.290 align:middle line:90%
and we go over the results.

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:34.830 align:middle line:84%
So you have time to be
the participant as well

00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:36.550 align:middle line:90%
as the observer.

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:39.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when you're
in the chamber itself,

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:41.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's really--
it's quite a process,

00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:45.890 align:middle line:84%
because you have to go
through various exercises.

00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:46.870 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDT: Baselines.

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:48.453 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have
baselines while you

00:29:48.453 --> 00:29:49.590 align:middle line:90%
have the electrodes on.

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:50.774 align:middle line:90%
And these mood scales.

00:29:50.774 --> 00:29:52.440 align:middle line:84%
So now this is
interesting, because this

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:55.510 align:middle line:84%
is where we start accessing
subconscious emotions.

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And it seems like some of
the words that are put up,

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:02.676 align:middle line:84%
you just react to the words
on a scale of one to four,

00:30:02.676 --> 00:30:07.290 align:middle line:84%
or A to D, and then A or
B, and then yes or no.

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to
keep refining it,

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.770 align:middle line:84%
right, as we go through
these mood scales,

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:13.080 align:middle line:90%
passing through these words.

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:15.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: How do you feel
right now, in the morning

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:18.640 align:middle line:84%
or after the alpha
training while you're still

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:19.440 align:middle line:90%
in the chamber?

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:21.070 align:middle line:84%
You do a second
set of mood scales

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:23.330 align:middle line:84%
where you answer
the question, how

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:25.470 align:middle line:84%
did I feel in the
moments of highest alpha.

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:26.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And that is interesting,
because that's

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:31.890 align:middle line:84%
where the subconscious
information starts emerging.

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And where people start having a
real disconnect with what they

00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:40.355 align:middle line:84%
think they're feeling versus
what's actually going on.

00:30:40.355 --> 00:30:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
that a little bit,

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:44.390 align:middle line:84%
because somewhere in
there is the message

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:46.686 align:middle line:90%
of the hidden trauma.

00:30:46.686 --> 00:30:48.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: Well, and
before we get there,

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:50.760 align:middle line:84%
there's a more
shall we say direct,

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:53.830 align:middle line:84%
or easy to access use
of the mood scales.

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:56.130 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
scored by computer,

00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:58.050 align:middle line:90%
and so people can see.

00:30:58.050 --> 00:30:59.850 align:middle line:90%
We give them printouts.

00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:02.210 align:middle line:84%
They can see what their
anxiety, hostility, depression

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:04.830 align:middle line:90%
level was before and then after.

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And people who have lived for
years in a state of paralyzing

00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:12.520 align:middle line:84%
anxiety or deep
depression all of a sudden

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:13.720 align:middle line:90%
can see their numbers.

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:16.410 align:middle line:84%
Oh my God, my depression
dropped by half.

00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:21.070 align:middle line:84%
Or my anxiety went down to a
third in just the first day.

00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
then hope comes in.

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:27.430 align:middle line:84%
So giving them just
the actual scoring.

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:30.320 align:middle line:84%
But then the mood scale
analysis goes deeper.

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:33.540 align:middle line:84%
Because when they respond,
let's say the word "angry"

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:35.950 align:middle line:84%
comes up on the screen,
and they push zero,

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:37.950 align:middle line:84%
meaning they're saying
they're not at all angry.

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:38.215 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm not angry.

00:31:38.215 --> 00:31:38.480 align:middle line:90%
I don't have any anger issues.

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:39.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDT: Right, exactly.

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And so later after the chamber
time, and the canopy room,

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:45.830 align:middle line:84%
and dinner, when we gather
back at the conference table

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:48.630 align:middle line:84%
to go over the mood scales,
at one point, for example,

00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:51.580 align:middle line:84%
I had the CEO of a billion
dollar company in training.

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:53.370 align:middle line:90%
And who wants to go first?

00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:54.080 align:middle line:90%
His hand goes up.

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And so I opened his
mood scales and anger

00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:59.500 align:middle line:90%
was at the top of the list.

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:02.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, the computer
rates the degree

00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:04.476 align:middle line:84%
to which it doubts
a person's answer.

00:32:04.476 --> 00:32:06.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The incoherence
between your answer

00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:08.530 align:middle line:84%
and what your brain waves
are putting out, right?

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:10.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: Well I would
call it a discrepancy.

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:13.170 align:middle line:84%
Because I save the
word "coherent"

00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:15.630 align:middle line:84%
for a more mathematical
relationship between the brain

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:15.900 align:middle line:90%
waves.

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:16.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, so discrepancy.

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:17.754 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDT: Yeah, discrepancy.

00:32:17.754 --> 00:32:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And so, as far as
he was concerned,

00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:21.640 align:middle line:84%
consciously, he was
not feeling any anger,

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:25.000 align:middle line:84%
but the computer
gave him five sigmas.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, one sigma is a 68%
chance his answer is wrong.

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:30.770 align:middle line:90%
Two sigmas a 95% chance.

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:31.290 align:middle line:90%
Three--

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:31.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Five is a lot.

00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:32.630 align:middle line:90%
You're way off.

00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:33.338 align:middle line:90%
You're in denial.

00:32:33.338 --> 00:32:36.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: Yeah, three
sigmas is a 99.7% chance.

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:38.820 align:middle line:90%
So I know he's an angry man.

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And so I didn't want
him to be-- he's

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:43.880 align:middle line:90%
the first one and it's day one.

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.510 align:middle line:84%
So I say, well, you
know, sometimes we

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:47.560 align:middle line:84%
can have emotions
in our unconscious

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:48.910 align:middle line:90%
that we're not aware of.

00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:52.654 align:middle line:84%
And so the computer detected
anger to quite a strong degree.

00:32:52.654 --> 00:32:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything
you're aware of?

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:57.010 align:middle line:90%
And he yelled, no.

00:32:57.010 --> 00:32:59.830 align:middle line:90%
And so it's obvious he's angry.

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:03.510 align:middle line:84%
So I was trying to
make it easy for him

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:05.127 align:middle line:84%
to accept the fact
that he was angry.

00:33:05.127 --> 00:33:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And I go, let's see,
how do I do this?

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:10.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, he's married, so I started
praising women's intuition.

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:13.050 align:middle line:84%
Saying sometimes women
know things that men don't.

00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:14.915 align:middle line:84%
The stiffening brush
of logical positivism

00:33:14.915 --> 00:33:17.660 align:middle line:90%
pass more lightly over women.

00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And I was getting ready
to ask the question,

00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:22.480 align:middle line:84%
well, what would your wife say
if we asked her, are you angry?

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And I hadn't even gotten
to the question yet,

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:25.360 align:middle line:90%
but he's a bright guy.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:26.950 align:middle line:84%
He runs a billion
dollar company.

00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And so he loudly and
angrily yells no,

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:31.665 align:middle line:84%
even before I
asked the question.

00:33:31.665 --> 00:33:33.790 align:middle line:84%
At that point, the other
people in the room kind of

00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:36.170 align:middle line:84%
moved away from
him a little bit.

00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And so in that
kind of denial, we

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:40.537 align:middle line:84%
went quickly through
all of his words.

00:33:40.537 --> 00:33:41.870 align:middle line:90%
Then we'd go to the next person.

00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't own
up to anything.

00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:45.264 align:middle line:84%
So then we go to
the next person.

00:33:45.264 --> 00:33:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And they go through
a word or two.

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:48.263 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
we come to a word,

00:33:48.263 --> 00:33:50.280 align:middle line:84%
and they stop, and the
lip trembles a little.

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.130 align:middle line:90%
A tear comes out.

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:53.960 align:middle line:90%
I go, OK, what's here?

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:56.290 align:middle line:84%
And then they tell
the story of a trauma

00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:58.710 align:middle line:90%
which is related to this word.

00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And so afterwards,
there's like how

00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:02.740 align:middle line:90%
you feel after a spring rain.

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, that happened with
everyone in the group.

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:07.260 align:middle line:90%
So he didn't say anything.

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:10.090 align:middle line:84%
But the next day he showed up,
still in his three piece suit,

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:11.000 align:middle line:90%
white shirt a little too tight.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.409 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very uncomfortable
for the training.

00:34:12.409 --> 00:34:14.283 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: Very uncomfortable
for the training.

00:34:14.283 --> 00:34:16.969 align:middle line:84%
But he opened his suit
coat and he pulled out

00:34:16.969 --> 00:34:18.630 align:middle line:90%
and unfolded a long list.

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:21.984 align:middle line:84%
And on it he had written all
the people he was angry at.

00:34:21.984 --> 00:34:22.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:25.989 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: So he had done the
work, at least the beginning.

00:34:25.989 --> 00:34:27.389 align:middle line:90%
Now he knows what, you know.

00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:29.150 align:middle line:84%
So then we say, OK,
now go in the chamber

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:32.540 align:middle line:84%
and then the forgiveness
process follows.

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:34.525 align:middle line:84%
And he was able to forgive
all of the people he

00:34:34.525 --> 00:34:35.199 align:middle line:90%
was angry with.

00:34:35.199 --> 00:34:36.650 align:middle line:90%
He was transformed.

00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:37.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I bet.

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:40.340 align:middle line:84%
What is-- I mean you've
mentioned one of them I'm

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:43.510 align:middle line:84%
sure is anger-- but of all the
people you've seen through all

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:48.110 align:middle line:84%
of these years, what are the
top three most denied emotions?

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:52.170 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: Well emotions are--
we have three main categories,

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:58.139 align:middle line:84%
which are sadness and
depression, anger, and fear.

00:34:58.139 --> 00:35:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And pretty much everything
falls into those categories.

00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:02.960 align:middle line:84%
The emotional hierarchy
we use has five elements:

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:07.610 align:middle line:84%
apathy, sadness, depression,
anger, fear, and joy.

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And so people work
up through these.

00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And so people differ in
terms of whether they

00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:15.330 align:middle line:90%
have more problems with sadness.

00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:16.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: More
depressed than angry.

00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:18.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: Although
sometimes words

00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:19.790 align:middle line:84%
that aren't even
in those categories

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:21.220 align:middle line:84%
will lead to the
big breakthrough.

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:24.970 align:middle line:84%
Like there was a guy where
the word "shaky" came up.

00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And for several days, pre and
post training mood scales,

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:32.880 align:middle line:90%
I'd ask him about it.

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.620 align:middle line:90%
And he'd go, well this is shaky.

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And as you can
see, I'm not shaky.

00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And so after the second-- at
the end of the second day,

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:44.300 align:middle line:84%
it had come up four
times, denied every time,

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:45.620 align:middle line:90%
got big signals.

00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:49.325 align:middle line:84%
And I say, you know, shaky
has come up four times.

00:35:49.325 --> 00:35:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And each time you've denied, and
each time you've gotten sigma.

00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:54.965 align:middle line:84%
So I gave you a pass on it,
because you did such good work

00:35:54.965 --> 00:35:55.840 align:middle line:90%
with the other words.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:57.310 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's
something here.

00:35:57.310 --> 00:36:01.190 align:middle line:84%
So please, my intuition is it's
somehow locked in your body.

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:04.810 align:middle line:84%
So go soak in the hot tub
before you come in tomorrow.

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:06.320 align:middle line:84%
Day three he comes
in, hadn't done

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:07.742 align:middle line:90%
the soak, shaky's there again.

00:36:07.742 --> 00:36:10.200 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the day when I'm
reading him his mood scales,

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:11.580 align:middle line:90%
he gets angry.

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:14.643 align:middle line:84%
And he yells at me, don't
ask me about shaky anymore.

00:36:14.643 --> 00:36:17.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, now I know
there's something there.

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:18.980 align:middle line:84%
So I wait, we go
through everything.

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:20.773 align:middle line:84%
And as he's going
out the door, I

00:36:20.773 --> 00:36:23.480 align:middle line:84%
call out Jim-- that was
his name-- how many more

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.990 align:middle line:84%
times would shaky have to
show up in your mood scales

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:30.150 align:middle line:84%
before I'd have your
permission to ask me about it?

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And he realized that he'd
been a bit of a jerk,

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:33.340 align:middle line:90%
he didn't have to yell at me.

00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:35.359 align:middle line:90%
And so he goes like that.

00:36:35.359 --> 00:36:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, well,
what do you think?

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well I think
that it's somehow related,

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:40.600 align:middle line:90%
locked in your body.

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:42.525 align:middle line:84%
So please take that
soak in the hot tub.

00:36:42.525 --> 00:36:43.460 align:middle line:90%
He does that.

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:45.080 align:middle line:90%
Comes in the next day.

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:49.330 align:middle line:84%
And then-- oh, actually the
next morning, it was day four.

00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:52.720 align:middle line:84%
He'd gotten into the hot tub
after breakfast and shooting

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:53.570 align:middle line:90%
baskets.

00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And he's all mellow,
like a wet noodle, limp.

00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And 45 minutes in,
he opens his eyes.

00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:03.010 align:middle line:84%
He's lying perfectly
still, as far as he knows,

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:05.790 align:middle line:84%
and the surface of
the water is rippling.

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:07.590 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is a puzzle to him.

00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:11.280 align:middle line:84%
So he kind of half sits up, and
his right hand under the water

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:12.064 align:middle line:90%
was doing that.

00:37:12.064 --> 00:37:12.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:14.390 align:middle line:90%
It was bringing it out.

00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:15.210 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDT: Yes.

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And that released a
long suppressed trauma.

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:19.241 align:middle line:90%
He was cared for.

00:37:19.241 --> 00:37:20.740 align:middle line:84%
His parents worked
outside the home.

00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:22.330 align:middle line:90%
He had six siblings.

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:24.380 align:middle line:84%
He was cared for by
a beloved granny.

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:27.990 align:middle line:84%
I'd heard so much about this--
best granny in the world.

00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:31.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, when he was six,
granny had a stroke.

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And she became,
guess what, shaky.

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:35.575 align:middle line:90%
She also had personality change.

00:37:35.575 --> 00:37:38.730 align:middle line:84%
She was now cursing,
swearing, biting the children.

00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And the last time
he saw his granny,

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:43.580 align:middle line:84%
she was being literally dragged
out the kitchen door cursing

00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:45.800 align:middle line:90%
and shrieking and shaking.

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And he never saw
his granny again.

00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:50.819 align:middle line:84%
And when he asked his
parents, they would slap him

00:37:50.819 --> 00:37:52.610 align:middle line:84%
and say, shut up and
don't talk about that.

00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:54.550 align:middle line:84%
So he was completely
traumatized.

00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:58.380 align:middle line:84%
And what he did was, he
basically shut down love.

00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And so in his forgiveness,
he forgave granny

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:02.550 align:middle line:84%
for becoming this
mean old hag, he

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:05.730 align:middle line:84%
forgave his parents for
not counseling him or even

00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:06.930 align:middle line:90%
loving him through it.

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:10.090 align:middle line:84%
And the big one, he forgive
himself for shutting off love.

00:38:10.090 --> 00:38:13.222 align:middle line:84%
And this totally
transformed him.

00:38:13.222 --> 00:38:14.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's interesting.

00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:17.400 align:middle line:84%
Because as you go through
these, as you say these mood

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:21.610 align:middle line:84%
evaluations, you'll have your
release around the third day.

00:38:21.610 --> 00:38:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, oh
good, I got that one.

00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:24.020 align:middle line:90%
That's up.

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And then you find as
you go further into it,

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:27.620 align:middle line:84%
as they days go on, you
get more of these sigmas

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:31.160 align:middle line:84%
as more stuff starts
bubbling up from the well

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:32.920 align:middle line:84%
of the subconscious
mind and trauma.

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:35.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: And you find people
out in your world responding

00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:36.290 align:middle line:90%
to this.

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Recently here in
Sedona we had a couple

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:43.630 align:middle line:84%
come where the woman had
been born in Singapore.

00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:47.695 align:middle line:84%
Her mother was a twin, and
she had a cousin almost

00:38:47.695 --> 00:38:49.430 align:middle line:90%
her same age, a girl.

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:51.310 align:middle line:90%
And her mother died.

00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:55.250 align:middle line:84%
And so she was raised with
her cousin by her aunt.

00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And the aunt favored
her own daughter.

00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And things got worse and
worse, until finally she

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:03.790 align:middle line:84%
left Singapore and she said,
don't you ever contact me.

00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:06.030 align:middle line:84%
So now she's in the
chamber, and she's

00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:08.900 align:middle line:84%
doing forgiveness on her
aunt-- might be like day four.

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And she hadn't heard from
her aunt in five years.

00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:14.914 align:middle line:84%
And the next day,
although she decided

00:39:14.914 --> 00:39:16.830 align:middle line:84%
she wasn't checking email
during her training,

00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:20.790 align:middle line:84%
she checked email and her aunt
had sent her a letter of love

00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:21.680 align:middle line:90%
and reaching out.

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:24.527 align:middle line:84%
And they looked at the time
difference between Singapore

00:39:24.527 --> 00:39:26.610 align:middle line:84%
and when she was in the
chamber doing forgiveness,

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:28.390 align:middle line:84%
there was a three
hour difference.

00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:30.159 align:middle line:84%
Three hours after
she forgave her aunt,

00:39:30.159 --> 00:39:31.200 align:middle line:90%
the aunt wrote the email.

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely,
because we all

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:35.410 align:middle line:84%
are intertwined in
the field after all.

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And when you have something
that profound happen, of course

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:39.510 align:middle line:84%
the people that are
intertwined with us

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:41.482 align:middle line:90%
will feel the effects of that.

00:39:41.482 --> 00:39:42.440 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDT: And be healed.

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:43.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the thing
that's interesting

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:45.530 align:middle line:84%
about that forgiveness
process, it's

00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:49.690 align:middle line:84%
not like you just go and
say, OK I forgive you.

00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:53.320 align:middle line:84%
No, it's very strident
what has to be done,

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:55.850 align:middle line:84%
because you're looking
at brain wave numbers.

00:39:55.850 --> 00:39:58.074 align:middle line:84%
The person that's
in the chamber is

00:39:58.074 --> 00:39:59.490 align:middle line:84%
able to look at
their own numbers.

00:39:59.490 --> 00:40:02.010 align:middle line:84%
You go for a couple minutes
of intense concentration,

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:02.885 align:middle line:90%
emotional engagement.

00:40:02.885 --> 00:40:05.051 align:middle line:84%
And then you open your eyes
and you see how you did.

00:40:05.051 --> 00:40:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And then you go
back down, and you

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:08.260 align:middle line:84%
do this over a long
period of time.

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:09.500 align:middle line:90%
You keep doing this.

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:11.320 align:middle line:90%
And so you can see and chart it.

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And the protocol
requires that you

00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:17.550 align:middle line:84%
reach certain numbers, which
have colors associated.

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And you have to maintain that,
meaning your subconscious'

00:40:22.650 --> 00:40:25.930 align:middle line:84%
release and impact on the brain
is showing itself very clearly

00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:29.270 align:middle line:84%
numerically in terms
of your coherence.

00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:32.080 align:middle line:84%
You can't cheat and say,
oh yeah, I forgave them.

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:32.650 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And so what I
found-- which is why

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:38.570 align:middle line:84%
I said that in the open of
this show-- is that really,

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:41.210 align:middle line:84%
forgiveness we all have a
different definition of it.

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:42.710 align:middle line:84%
But since it's core
to the training,

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:45.010 align:middle line:84%
I had to get really clear
on my own definition of it.

00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:47.310 align:middle line:84%
It more has to do with
understanding love

00:40:47.310 --> 00:40:48.050 align:middle line:90%
and acceptance.

00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:49.420 align:middle line:90%
That is what forgiveness is.

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:51.180 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: To be
effective, forgiveness

00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:52.670 align:middle line:90%
needs to go all the way to love.

00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:54.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it does have to.

00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:54.790 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:56.310 align:middle line:90%
And then you can see.

00:40:56.310 --> 00:40:57.530 align:middle line:90%
And you don't push people.

00:40:57.530 --> 00:41:00.310 align:middle line:84%
If you can't reach
that goal, then you

00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:03.630 align:middle line:84%
wait, pick it up in the
next session, and try again,

00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:06.810 align:middle line:84%
but don't exhaust yourself
to a point of depression.

00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And so, can you talk
a little bit more

00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:09.900 align:middle line:90%
about the forgiveness process?

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:12.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDT: Sure.

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:14.720 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you a
little background.

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:18.440 align:middle line:84%
Everybody in America has
heard of the Gallup Poll.

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:22.110 align:middle line:84%
For a long time before the death
of Sir John Templeton-- a very

00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:25.785 align:middle line:84%
spiritual man and a good friend
of George Gallup-- every couple

00:41:25.785 --> 00:41:28.650 align:middle line:84%
of years Sir John
would get George

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:30.660 align:middle line:90%
to do a poll on forgiveness.

00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:34.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, one time I had a chance
to read one of the details.

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And in rating the importance
of forgiveness from zero,

00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:41.320 align:middle line:84%
not at all, up to four,
extremely, 80% of Americans

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:46.200 align:middle line:84%
said they considered forgiveness
extremely important, 80%.

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:48.960 align:middle line:84%
Then of those who considered
it extremely important,

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:51.420 align:middle line:84%
George Gallup asked,
well can you do it?

00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:54.050 align:middle line:90%
85% said no.

00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:58.610 align:middle line:84%
Even God's help was not
effective in producing

00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:01.030 align:middle line:84%
what we call effective
forgiveness for most people.

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:03.460 align:middle line:90%
85% said they could not do it.

00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:05.470 align:middle line:84%
Of the things that
Gallup asked about,

00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:07.540 align:middle line:84%
there was only one thing
that was correlated

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:08.740 align:middle line:90%
with effective forgiveness.

00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:11.180 align:middle line:90%
And that was meditative prayer.

00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:13.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you take
meditative as an adverb

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:16.720 align:middle line:84%
and put it in front of a
verb, like meditative fishing,

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:19.850 align:middle line:84%
meditative gardening, meditative
sewing, meditative reading,

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:22.180 align:middle line:90%
what I see are more alpha waves.

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And so in a sense,
George Gallup has

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:27.800 align:middle line:84%
revealed that effective
forgiveness requires

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:28.680 align:middle line:90%
more alpha waves.

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:31.140 align:middle line:84%
So the way I've incorporated
that into the training

00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:33.797 align:middle line:84%
is, the first thing, you
have to pick a charge.

00:42:33.797 --> 00:42:35.505 align:middle line:84%
You have to pick
somebody, a perpetrator,

00:42:35.505 --> 00:42:38.340 align:middle line:84%
and you want to forgive them,
and then there's a charge.

00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:41.660 align:middle line:84%
You bring in some high beings
as your observers or judges.

00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:43.494 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: They can be
your guides, or angels.

00:42:43.494 --> 00:42:45.201 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: Your guides,
angels, absolutely.

00:42:45.201 --> 00:42:47.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Whoever you wish
A team, a supportive team.

00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:49.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: But it can't
be your favorite uncle.

00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:52.070 align:middle line:90%
They need to be flawless beings.

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And so then the first thing,
when you make the charge,

00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:56.740 align:middle line:90%
you have to feel the pain.

00:42:56.740 --> 00:43:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you can't feel the
pain because it's blocked--

00:43:00.070 --> 00:43:02.820 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes people are so
armored, the pain is so great,

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:05.620 align:middle line:84%
they can't feel it--
their alpha won't drop.

00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:07.320 align:middle line:84%
If you can feel the
pain, your alpha

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:10.690 align:middle line:84%
will drop, which then causes the
color of the numerical scores

00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:11.860 align:middle line:90%
to turn white.

00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:14.160 align:middle line:84%
You need a majority
of scores to be white.

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:16.960 align:middle line:84%
If you get that,
only then can you

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:19.860 align:middle line:84%
advance to the next step,
which is doing the forgiveness.

00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:22.210 align:middle line:84%
Walk in the person's
shoes, realize

00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:25.070 align:middle line:84%
that they weren't
playing with a full deck.

00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:27.400 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, telling
them you love them.

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:30.150 align:middle line:84%
Understanding the difficulties
they had in their life.

00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:31.077 align:middle line:90%
And hugging them.

00:43:31.077 --> 00:43:32.160 align:middle line:90%
And saying, I forgive you.

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:33.490 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it is that works.

00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And if your alpha's
going up, your scores

00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:38.590 align:middle line:84%
are going to be in
blues or greens.

00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And so as long as that's
working, you keep doing it.

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:43.760 align:middle line:90%
You don't stop part way through.

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:46.530 align:middle line:84%
Only when you run out of
steam, and the alpha drops,

00:43:46.530 --> 00:43:48.990 align:middle line:84%
and the scores turn white again
do you turn to your judges

00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:52.460 align:middle line:84%
and say, have I done
all I can do for now?

00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And if the judges are unanimous,
then you rest, celebrate,

00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:57.670 align:middle line:84%
or you go onto the
next forgiveness.

00:43:57.670 --> 00:44:00.880 align:middle line:84%
If the judges, even one of
them, say no, you go back,

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:02.930 align:middle line:84%
feel the pain again,
and you start over.

00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:05.080 align:middle line:84%
That way you're
always maximizing

00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:06.840 align:middle line:84%
the amount of
forgiveness you can do.

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:09.860 align:middle line:84%
One time in Canada, where we
have a First Nation scholarship

00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:12.050 align:middle line:84%
program for Canadian
aboriginals,

00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:13.930 align:middle line:84%
there was a First
Nations man who

00:44:13.930 --> 00:44:17.290 align:middle line:84%
was sent back five
times by his judges

00:44:17.290 --> 00:44:19.120 align:middle line:90%
on forgiving a certain person.

00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:22.250 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of sexual abuse,
and alcoholism, and drugs,

00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:26.460 align:middle line:84%
and physical abuse in the
aboriginal community in Canada.

00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And on the fifth time
when he was sent back,

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:33.320 align:middle line:84%
the judges accepted
and said, OK,

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:34.870 align:middle line:90%
that's all you can do for today.

00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well what
did you do different?

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And he went, well, I
went all the way to love.

00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:42.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:44:42.850 --> 00:44:45.650 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about how
that displays itself.

00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:49.590 align:middle line:84%
Once you're able-- because these
traumas-- most of these traumas

00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:51.060 align:middle line:84%
have to do with
other human beings

00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:52.020 align:middle line:90%
and events that have happened.

00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:54.610 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are random, like
a car accident or something

00:44:54.610 --> 00:44:55.819 align:middle line:90%
where it doesn't necessarily.

00:44:55.819 --> 00:44:56.734 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDT: Or a disease.

00:44:56.734 --> 00:44:59.320 align:middle line:84%
You can forgive the this
virus, or the that virus, polio

00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:00.420 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:01.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:04.140 align:middle line:84%
And so once you go through
that, and once this trauma

00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:07.410 align:middle line:84%
has been felt, you've
taken it back up as high

00:45:07.410 --> 00:45:10.150 align:middle line:84%
as you can toward a
state of love, then

00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:12.750 align:middle line:84%
what happens in
the brain itself?

00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:16.257 align:middle line:84%
What's going on there that
puts us into this high state?

00:45:16.257 --> 00:45:17.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: Well, there's
a number things

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:20.580 align:middle line:84%
going on cortically as
well as subcortically.

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:22.720 align:middle line:84%
For example, we've
worked with soldiers

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:25.140 align:middle line:84%
who had post-traumatic
stress disorder.

00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And we know from other
studies that in these states--

00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:33.670 align:middle line:84%
for example, there's excessive
activity in the amygdala which

00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:36.190 align:middle line:90%
is part of the limbic system.

00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:38.660 align:middle line:90%
And so excess firing.

00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:41.720 align:middle line:84%
People are then angry,
explosively and so on.

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And so working with
the alpha actually

00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:48.200 align:middle line:84%
helps to calm down and
reduce excess activity

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:49.670 align:middle line:90%
in the limbic system.

00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:52.400 align:middle line:84%
So things are happening not just
at the surface of the brain,

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:55.010 align:middle line:90%
but also in the depths.

00:45:55.010 --> 00:46:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a statement that
says "insults are never given,

00:46:00.110 --> 00:46:01.710 align:middle line:90%
they're only received."

00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And so if somebody says,
la la la, and you go,

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:07.740 align:middle line:84%
what a lovely tone of
voice you have used.

00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:09.940 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know you
could be a singer.

00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:11.790 align:middle line:84%
So whatever was
the content-- which

00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:14.460 align:middle line:84%
they might have intended
to be an insult-- it just

00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:17.290 align:middle line:84%
completely didn't land on you
because you didn't receive it

00:46:17.290 --> 00:46:18.620 align:middle line:90%
in that way.

00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:20.410 align:middle line:84%
Marshall Thurber
says, "Communication

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:21.610 align:middle line:90%
is what's received."

00:46:21.610 --> 00:46:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And with alpha, when
you're in this state,

00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:28.860 align:middle line:84%
you are almost
invulnerable to negativity.

00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:32.850 align:middle line:84%
You can handle a much wider
range of aberrant behavior.

00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:36.850 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the reasons why
the statistically strongest

00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:39.090 align:middle line:84%
effect of the alpha
one training is

00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:40.930 align:middle line:90%
improvement in relationships.

00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:42.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, it doesn't
mean that you choose

00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:43.865 align:middle line:90%
to have negative relations.

00:46:43.865 --> 00:46:47.660 align:middle line:84%
You may in fact choose to have
only more positive relations.

00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:49.780 align:middle line:84%
But if you find
yourself in a situation

00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:52.195 align:middle line:84%
where people are dumping
negativity on you

00:46:52.195 --> 00:46:56.170 align:middle line:84%
or making stressful demands,
you can be equanimous about it.

00:46:56.170 --> 00:46:57.090 align:middle line:90%
You can be peaceful.

00:46:57.090 --> 00:46:57.673 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:57.673 --> 00:46:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And what I found
on a personal level

00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:03.420 align:middle line:84%
with this is, after the training
and the next couple months--

00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:05.730 align:middle line:84%
it had been a couple
months-- that followed,

00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:12.700 align:middle line:84%
was that I was acknowledging
the kind of relationship

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:15.920 align:middle line:90%
that I actually chose to be in.

00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:20.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my choices changed very
radically and very rapidly.

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:21.950 align:middle line:90%
The choices changed.

00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And not only did
the choices change,

00:47:24.210 --> 00:47:26.220 align:middle line:90%
but the resonance changed.

00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:29.400 align:middle line:84%
People on a different
field-- that

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:32.800 align:middle line:84%
are more in resonance
with me on that level

00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:34.904 align:middle line:90%
started coming into my life.

00:47:34.904 --> 00:47:36.570 align:middle line:84%
Or I started being
in contact with them,

00:47:36.570 --> 00:47:38.860 align:middle line:84%
whether it's work,
friendship, or whatnot.

00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And so the resonance
changed when

00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:46.050 align:middle line:84%
it comes to relationship
completely, actually.

00:47:46.050 --> 00:47:47.620 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it really was amazing.

00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:51.590 align:middle line:84%
I found the whole process--
as I said, it's work.

00:47:51.590 --> 00:47:52.630 align:middle line:90%
You have to work at it.

00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:53.630 align:middle line:90%
You have to be diligent.

00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:55.520 align:middle line:84%
You can't be lazy, or you
don't get the results.

00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:57.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: The machine
won't do it to you.

00:47:57.060 --> 00:47:58.393 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It won't do it to you.

00:47:58.393 --> 00:48:01.010 align:middle line:90%
And you can't fool the system.

00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:03.310 align:middle line:84%
You can't kind of BS
your way out of it.

00:48:03.310 --> 00:48:04.930 align:middle line:90%
Oh no, I didn't feel like that.

00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:09.516 align:middle line:84%
And so I really like that
degree of scientific scrutiny

00:48:09.516 --> 00:48:11.890 align:middle line:84%
that was taking place, because
you had to get down in it,

00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:13.550 align:middle line:90%
and then you had to release it.

00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And so yes, relationships
definitely very beautifully

00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:18.850 align:middle line:90%
impacted by it.

00:48:18.850 --> 00:48:22.310 align:middle line:84%
I found, on a personal level,
as did the people in our group,

00:48:22.310 --> 00:48:24.060 align:middle line:84%
because I know we had
one man in our group

00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:28.060 align:middle line:84%
who was a young man who's
very successful in his chosen

00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:28.990 align:middle line:90%
profession.

00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And he just kept saying,
no, I don't feel like that.

00:48:31.830 --> 00:48:33.871 align:middle line:84%
Must be something wrong
with your technology.

00:48:33.871 --> 00:48:34.620 align:middle line:90%
I don't feel like.

00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:37.070 align:middle line:84%
He kept every day
saying something was

00:48:37.070 --> 00:48:39.080 align:middle line:84%
wrong with your
technology, and then

00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:41.340 align:middle line:84%
had a massive
emotional breakthrough

00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:44.980 align:middle line:84%
in the end of something so
deeply hidden from himself

00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:47.540 align:middle line:84%
that he ended up at
the end of it saying--

00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:49.770 align:middle line:84%
because he's a
conscious young man.

00:48:49.770 --> 00:48:53.100 align:middle line:84%
He goes to every kind of
workshop, every seminar.

00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:55.740 align:middle line:84%
He knew practically half
the people I've interviewed,

00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:58.330 align:middle line:84%
he's either read their
book or attended.

00:48:58.330 --> 00:49:00.950 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't getting to
that point, that little place

00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:03.690 align:middle line:90%
deep inside that was very hurt.

00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:06.450 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I'm just
validating that what you do

00:49:06.450 --> 00:49:11.110 align:middle line:84%
has such depth, and such
beauty, and such effectiveness.

00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:13.554 align:middle line:90%
So I just had to share that.

00:49:13.554 --> 00:49:14.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDT: Thank you for that.

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:15.969 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're most welcome.

00:49:15.969 --> 00:49:19.400 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what people
can do if they can't make it

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:22.480 align:middle line:84%
to-- if they can't
do this training,

00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:25.670 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about what we can do
for ourselves, because anybody

00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:28.300 align:middle line:84%
watching this, besides not
eating onions, and garlic,

00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:30.550 align:middle line:84%
and a big meal at
night, what can we

00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:34.200 align:middle line:84%
do for ourselves to
facilitate our own forgiveness

00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:37.585 align:middle line:84%
process on somewhat
of an objective scale?

00:49:37.585 --> 00:49:39.960 align:middle line:84%
Because granted, we're not
going to have machines saying,

00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:41.530 align:middle line:90%
you're lying to yourself here.

00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:42.439 align:middle line:90%
How can we do this?

00:49:42.439 --> 00:49:43.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: Well, one
simple thing would

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:47.620 align:middle line:84%
be to buy a copy of my book,
"The Art of Smart Thinking,"

00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:50.650 align:middle line:84%
which you can get through
Amazon, "The Art of Smart

00:49:50.650 --> 00:49:51.490 align:middle line:90%
Thinking."

00:49:51.490 --> 00:49:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And in there,
among other things,

00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:56.870 align:middle line:84%
the forgiveness
process is detailed.

00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And so people can
read through that.

00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:02.010 align:middle line:84%
Now of course, the
process is more effective

00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:05.650 align:middle line:84%
and more powerful when you
interact with the technology.

00:50:05.650 --> 00:50:06.490 align:middle line:90%
But for example--

00:50:06.490 --> 00:50:07.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's much
faster, of course.

00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:08.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDT: Much faster.

00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:12.523 align:middle line:84%
But for example, in Canada one
of the aboriginals who trained

00:50:12.523 --> 00:50:17.480 align:middle line:90%
was a-- he's a priest.

00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:21.980 align:middle line:84%
As a small boy, he was
picked up every Saturday

00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:25.260 align:middle line:84%
by the Indian Agent,
taken off the reserve,

00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:26.470 align:middle line:90%
and sexually abused.

00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:29.010 align:middle line:90%
So he had a lot of trauma.

00:50:29.010 --> 00:50:32.290 align:middle line:84%
However now as a priest, he
has a very, very deep interest

00:50:32.290 --> 00:50:33.790 align:middle line:90%
in teaching forgiveness.

00:50:33.790 --> 00:50:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And so he has used the
Biocybernaut forgiveness

00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:37.620 align:middle line:90%
method.

00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And what started was he asked
me if he could use it just

00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:43.840 align:middle line:84%
to talk about it,
and then do whatever

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:46.610 align:middle line:84%
he could to help people
to go through the steps

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:48.400 align:middle line:90%
without the feedback.

00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And so his parish
agreed to let him

00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:59.390 align:middle line:84%
have a class in the church
on a weekday evening.

00:50:59.390 --> 00:51:02.365 align:middle line:84%
Well pretty quickly,
the church was full.

00:51:02.365 --> 00:51:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And so they had to let him
have another night in the week

00:51:05.550 --> 00:51:06.210 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:11.020 align:middle line:84%
So it's possible to read this,
and to incorporate it, and use

00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:13.920 align:middle line:84%
it to advance your
own forgiveness.

00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:16.470 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's not as powerful as
doing it with the technology,

00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:19.270 align:middle line:84%
but it is something
that you can do.

00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:21.880 align:middle line:84%
Also in the book are
a number of stories

00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:24.770 align:middle line:84%
about people's work,
the transformations,

00:51:24.770 --> 00:51:26.400 align:middle line:84%
the kind of traumas
they've dealt with.

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times
that can speak

00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:29.770 align:middle line:90%
to people in a very deep way.

00:51:29.770 --> 00:51:31.770 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things it
does is gives them hope,

00:51:31.770 --> 00:51:33.490 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes
people say, well,

00:51:33.490 --> 00:51:36.300 align:middle line:84%
the thing that happened to
me is just unforgivable.

00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And then they read a
story about somebody

00:51:38.850 --> 00:51:41.649 align:middle line:84%
who had something far
worse happen to them,

00:51:41.649 --> 00:51:43.190 align:middle line:84%
and how they were
able to forgive it.

00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:46.664 align:middle line:84%
And then it motivates people
to begin to open their hearts.

00:51:46.664 --> 00:51:48.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it
would seem to me,

00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:52.520 align:middle line:84%
as long as you have
the ability to focus,

00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:54.120 align:middle line:90%
to hold a clear thought.

00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And you have the
dedicated time where

00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:58.820 align:middle line:84%
you're choosing to
set aside the time,

00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:01.700 align:middle line:84%
because it's not easy
to go through this.

00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:03.306 align:middle line:90%
Say, I am ready to take this on.

00:52:03.306 --> 00:52:04.180 align:middle line:90%
You have to be ready.

00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:07.230 align:middle line:84%
If you're not ready, it's
not going to happen, right?

00:52:07.230 --> 00:52:08.410 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDT: Mm-hmm.

00:52:08.410 --> 00:52:11.500 align:middle line:84%
And methods differ in
their effectiveness.

00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:15.850 align:middle line:84%
Like Zen, which is a very
powerful meditation technique,

00:52:15.850 --> 00:52:18.680 align:middle line:84%
minimum 21 years
to get to the point

00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:21.635 align:middle line:84%
where the Zen masters rate
the students as advanced.

00:52:21.635 --> 00:52:25.000 align:middle line:84%
And in some cases it
takes up to 40 years,

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.970 align:middle line:90%
21 to 40 years of Zen practice.

00:52:26.970 --> 00:52:29.920 align:middle line:84%
Now besides meditation,
which I endorse,

00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:32.930 align:middle line:84%
meditation and
prayer can be very

00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:36.230 align:middle line:84%
powerful, it's helpful
to combine them

00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:39.580 align:middle line:84%
with breathing exercises,
where you do slow,

00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:42.810 align:middle line:84%
deep breathing for
a while before you

00:52:42.810 --> 00:52:45.600 align:middle line:84%
start your meditation
or your prayer.

00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And so you sit down, and
you take a few deep breaths.

00:52:48.370 --> 00:52:51.499 align:middle line:84%
And then you breathe in,
as slowly as you can, hold.

00:52:51.499 --> 00:52:53.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like for 8 counts,
or 10 counts, or whatever.

00:52:53.790 --> 00:52:55.380 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDT: Yeah, 8, 10, whatever.

00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:57.650 align:middle line:90%
Inhale, hold, exhale.

00:52:57.650 --> 00:53:00.710 align:middle line:84%
And you do like
a dozen of those.

00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And then you go into the
meditation and the prayer.

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And in my work,
I've demonstrated

00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:10.430 align:middle line:84%
that doing a slow breathing
before the meditation

00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:14.444 align:middle line:84%
will make there be more alpha
than if you just sit down

00:53:14.444 --> 00:53:15.360 align:middle line:90%
and start to meditate.

00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:16.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
it seems like that

00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:18.310 align:middle line:84%
would have a very direct
impact on the nervous system,

00:53:18.310 --> 00:53:19.820 align:middle line:84%
calming both the
mind and the body.

00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:24.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's a little easier
starting place for a person.

00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:25.350 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:53:25.350 --> 00:53:28.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: And I can give you
a little of the biochemistry.

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.390 align:middle line:84%
When you do slow,
deep breathing--

00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:33.740 align:middle line:84%
and I'm talking about
really, and then hold--

00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:36.647 align:middle line:84%
and when you exhale, most
people exchange about 20%

00:53:36.647 --> 00:53:38.480 align:middle line:84%
and the air in their
lungs with each breath.

00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:41.200 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
stale air in the lungs.

00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:44.600 align:middle line:84%
So in this breathing
exercise, when the exhale, you

00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:46.980 align:middle line:84%
pull in your tummy, and
you collapse your chest,

00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:50.540 align:middle line:84%
and you really-- you squeeze
out as much of the stale air

00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:51.380 align:middle line:90%
as possible.

00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:55.470 align:middle line:84%
So your body is getting a
richer supply of oxygen.

00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:58.060 align:middle line:84%
Now one of the things, that
by blowing off more carbon

00:53:58.060 --> 00:54:00.840 align:middle line:84%
dioxide, that shifts
the pH of the blood.

00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:05.130 align:middle line:84%
Dissolved carbon dioxide
contributes to pH through PCo2.

00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:07.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, when the pH of
the blood shifts away

00:54:07.990 --> 00:54:12.160 align:middle line:84%
from acid toward alkaline,
that triggers the blood vessels

00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:13.270 align:middle line:90%
to dilate.

00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:15.480 align:middle line:84%
So more blood that gets
to flow to the brain.

00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:18.400 align:middle line:84%
And oh, by the way, it has less
carbon dioxide and more oxygen.

00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:20.490 align:middle line:90%
So it's very beneficial.

00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And then the brain loves it
and responds by more alpha.

00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:27.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you for
that biochemistry lesson.

00:54:27.110 --> 00:54:28.510 align:middle line:90%
What else can we do?

00:54:28.510 --> 00:54:30.960 align:middle line:84%
Once we've made the time,
we've said we're committed.

00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:34.050 align:middle line:84%
We're ready to face the things
that are bothering us deeply.

00:54:34.050 --> 00:54:36.781 align:middle line:84%
And we've set the time aside,
we've done our deep breathing.

00:54:36.781 --> 00:54:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And we've gone
through the protocols

00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:40.570 align:middle line:84%
that you suggest in your
book, what else can we do?

00:54:40.570 --> 00:54:42.528 align:middle line:84%
Well you know, there's
a whole range of things.

00:54:42.528 --> 00:54:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Like exercise, good
diet, avoiding drugs,

00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:50.480 align:middle line:90%
caffeine, nicotine, alcohol.

00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And you combine all
those with an attitude,

00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:57.860 align:middle line:90%
an intention of practice.

00:54:57.860 --> 00:54:59.820 align:middle line:84%
The intention is
really important.

00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:02.070 align:middle line:90%
Having an intention to be calm.

00:55:02.070 --> 00:55:04.700 align:middle line:84%
Even if you only can sit
quietly, pray, and meditate

00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:08.670 align:middle line:84%
for five minutes a day, if you
have an intention to be calm,

00:55:08.670 --> 00:55:10.760 align:middle line:84%
that is going to be more
powerful than if you

00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:13.130 align:middle line:84%
did a lot of meditation
or a lot of prayer

00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:14.700 align:middle line:90%
without the intention.

00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:16.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Excellent.

00:55:16.290 --> 00:55:18.100 align:middle line:84%
I know we're running
close to being out

00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:20.500 align:middle line:84%
of time, so any final
thoughts that you would like

00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:22.740 align:middle line:84%
to share with us for
people at home that

00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:23.750 align:middle line:90%
know they have trauma.

00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:25.500 align:middle line:84%
They can feel the
effects of it every day.

00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:27.480 align:middle line:84%
They can feel it
dragging on them.

00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:30.890 align:middle line:84%
They can feel it on not just
their emotional function

00:55:30.890 --> 00:55:34.260 align:middle line:84%
and mental function, but in
all the aspects of how they're

00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:37.960 align:middle line:84%
interfacing with people in life,
any other final suggestions

00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:39.580 align:middle line:90%
for all of us?

00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: Well, the
Biocybernaut alpha training

00:55:43.410 --> 00:55:48.140 align:middle line:84%
does essentially one thing: it
improves central nervous system

00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:49.820 align:middle line:90%
function.

00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:51.520 align:middle line:84%
Improves central
nervous system function

00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:56.190 align:middle line:84%
by giving us more of
the inheritance, more

00:55:56.190 --> 00:55:59.660 align:middle line:84%
of our birthright to be
in a state of nature.

00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:03.110 align:middle line:84%
Be in a state of peace,
and love, and joy.

00:56:03.110 --> 00:56:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And so it's unsurprising
to me that doing alpha

00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:10.230 align:middle line:84%
produces-- doing alpha
training, learning

00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:11.660 align:middle line:84%
how to make more
alpha-- produces

00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:13.620 align:middle line:90%
such a wide range of benefits.

00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:16.280 align:middle line:84%
Reduced anxiety,
more creativity,

00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:20.200 align:middle line:84%
improvement in relationships,
reduction of depression.

00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:23.260 align:middle line:90%
There are so many things.

00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:26.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, just ask yourself
this, of all the things

00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:29.470 align:middle line:84%
where people strive
for excellence,

00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:31.780 align:middle line:84%
can you think of one that
doesn't require good brain

00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:32.360 align:middle line:90%
function?

00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:32.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:34.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDT: I can't either.

00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And so when you improve
central nervous function,

00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:38.600 align:middle line:84%
it's unsurprising that
the benefits show up

00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:41.380 align:middle line:84%
in people's lives
in amazing ways.

00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:42.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And now this is just a little
aside, but it's so fascinating.

00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:50.420 align:middle line:84%
For those rare individuals that
have very high waking delta,

00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:52.250 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed a
few people like that.

00:56:52.250 --> 00:56:54.940 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes there will
be a genius factor.

00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:58.370 align:middle line:84%
There's a kind of dreamy
look like oftentimes they're

00:56:58.370 --> 00:57:00.210 align:middle line:84%
not engaged or not
paying attention.

00:57:00.210 --> 00:57:03.290 align:middle line:84%
Yet, they're absorbing
knowledge by osmosis

00:57:03.290 --> 00:57:05.290 align:middle line:90%
universally and otherwise.

00:57:05.290 --> 00:57:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Massive amounts of data and
understanding coming in.

00:57:11.110 --> 00:57:15.461 align:middle line:84%
So you can recognize some
of those people as well.

00:57:15.461 --> 00:57:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And one of them was
in our group who

00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:18.660 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
continue working with.

00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And you say that
high waking delta,

00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:25.030 align:middle line:84%
this is the stuff that sci-fi
books are written about.

00:57:25.030 --> 00:57:27.820 align:middle line:84%
High waking delta
has the ability

00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:30.030 align:middle line:90%
to change physical reality.

00:57:30.030 --> 00:57:32.740 align:middle line:84%
Even though we all have
that birthright to an extent

00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:36.870 align:middle line:84%
to develop if we choose, high
waking delta alters reality.

00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:38.910 align:middle line:84%
Just explain that,
because it will show us

00:57:38.910 --> 00:57:42.080 align:middle line:84%
kind of the ultimate of
what we can aspire to.

00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:45.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: Well, a simple
example that most people would

00:57:45.610 --> 00:57:50.950 align:middle line:84%
be familiar with is in the first
Star Wars movie, "A New Hope."

00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:53.390 align:middle line:84%
Obi Wan, Luke, and the two
droids are in this speeder.

00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:57.685 align:middle line:84%
And they're going
into this town to try

00:57:57.685 --> 00:57:59.190 align:middle line:90%
and book passage off planet.

00:57:59.190 --> 00:58:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And they're met at
the gates of the city

00:58:01.330 --> 00:58:03.290 align:middle line:84%
by several imperial
storm troopers.

00:58:03.290 --> 00:58:05.290 align:middle line:90%
This is looking like trouble.

00:58:05.290 --> 00:58:09.180 align:middle line:84%
So Obi Wan goes, "These aren't
the droids you're looking for."

00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And the storm
trooper goes, "These

00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:12.789 align:middle line:84%
aren't the droids
we're looking for."

00:58:12.789 --> 00:58:13.830 align:middle line:90%
"Move along, move along."

00:58:13.830 --> 00:58:15.080 align:middle line:90%
"Move along, move along."

00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:16.850 align:middle line:84%
Now that's an
example of somebody

00:58:16.850 --> 00:58:19.850 align:middle line:84%
with delta using it
to influence others.

00:58:19.850 --> 00:58:21.520 align:middle line:90%
Now, there are ethical issues.

00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:26.500 align:middle line:84%
It's appropriate to use delta
to alter objects and events.

00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's questionable about
using it to influence people.

00:58:29.770 --> 00:58:32.160 align:middle line:84%
But it's an example
of what can be done.

00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:35.930 align:middle line:84%
Now so people can understand
this in a simple way,

00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:39.110 align:middle line:84%
most people have heard of
noise cancelling earphones.

00:58:39.110 --> 00:58:42.230 align:middle line:84%
Where noise is coming in,
so these are sound waves.

00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:45.160 align:middle line:84%
What the system does,
it detects those waves

00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:48.180 align:middle line:84%
and broadcasts back out
the exact same waves

00:58:48.180 --> 00:58:50.040 align:middle line:90%
but 180 degrees out of phase.

00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:51.990 align:middle line:90%
So it cancels them out.

00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:53.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you're
a physicist you

00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:57.520 align:middle line:84%
understand that everything,
the table, the cup, ourselves,

00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:59.620 align:middle line:84%
all of our atoms,
have wavelengths

00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:00.970 align:middle line:90%
associated with them.

00:59:00.970 --> 00:59:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And so when you can create
waves that are out of phase

00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:09.290 align:middle line:84%
with phenomenal reality, you
can change phenomenal reality.

00:59:09.290 --> 00:59:12.100 align:middle line:84%
Now the question of how you do
that in the noise cancelling

00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:14.390 align:middle line:84%
earphones involves
electronics that most people

00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:15.640 align:middle line:90%
don't understand.

00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:18.650 align:middle line:84%
When you do it with your
brain, it involves brain waves

00:59:18.650 --> 00:59:20.390 align:middle line:84%
that most people
don't understand.

00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:23.580 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you went to
a neurologist and you said,

00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:25.830 align:middle line:84%
this person has
high waking delta,

00:59:25.830 --> 00:59:27.910 align:middle line:84%
they would think
that you were daft,

00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:31.310 align:middle line:84%
because neurologists
typically only know delta

00:59:31.310 --> 00:59:34.040 align:middle line:84%
in the deepest stages
of sleep or coma.

00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:37.080 align:middle line:84%
But I've worked with
a number of people

00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:38.500 align:middle line:90%
who have high waking delta.

00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And all of them have
experiences where,

00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:44.470 align:middle line:84%
with an intent and
delta, they have altered

00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:47.910 align:middle line:84%
what would seem to be
phenomenal reality.

00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:48.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:59:48.990 --> 00:59:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And then also in
your brain training,

00:59:50.610 --> 00:59:52.547 align:middle line:84%
you do ultimately--
you can go to that

00:59:52.547 --> 00:59:54.130 align:middle line:84%
for the rare people
that can go there.

00:59:54.130 --> 00:59:55.930 align:middle line:84%
But people can also
do theta training.

00:59:55.930 --> 00:59:58.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: Yes, which
gives them the ability

00:59:58.130 --> 01:00:00.564 align:middle line:84%
to access the akashic
records, and to bring

01:00:00.564 --> 01:00:01.980 align:middle line:84%
in knowledge that
they don't know,

01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:04.310 align:middle line:84%
maybe no humans in
their time know.

01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:09.030 align:middle line:84%
Thomas Edison used this to make
his more than 1,000 patents.

01:00:09.030 --> 01:00:11.670 align:middle line:84%
He developed a way of lying
back in a recliner chair,

01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:14.472 align:middle line:84%
holding steel ball bearings with
metal pie plates underneath,

01:00:14.472 --> 01:00:16.930 align:middle line:84%
and he would try to fall asleep
while thinking of something

01:00:16.930 --> 01:00:19.300 align:middle line:90%
he wanted to invent.

01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And when he would hit theta,
he would lose postural tonus.

01:00:22.370 --> 01:00:25.040 align:middle line:84%
The balls would fall with a
cluttering din, wake him up.

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And he would then
write down a piece.

01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we did
over 1,000 patents.

01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And so it's amazing to be able
to give people access to this.

01:00:33.430 --> 01:00:35.040 align:middle line:84%
Insights come in
like zingers that

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:37.709 align:middle line:90%
are, where did you get that?

01:00:37.709 --> 01:00:39.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well and also
to remove the trauma even

01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:41.180 align:middle line:90%
in higher states of alpha.

01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And more so in coherent
states of alpha

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:46.900 align:middle line:84%
allows you to have access, and
communication, and dialogue

01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:48.014 align:middle line:90%
with other realms as well.

01:00:48.014 --> 01:00:48.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDT: Indeed.

01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:50.471 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so that's
another part of it.

01:00:50.471 --> 01:00:52.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: Well, there's
a brain wave pattern

01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:56.860 align:middle line:84%
which I recognize,
which whenever I see it,

01:00:56.860 --> 01:00:58.720 align:middle line:84%
I asked people,
do you see angels.

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:00.990 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe more generically,
astral plane beings?

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:03.830 align:middle line:90%
And they always say yes.

01:01:03.830 --> 01:01:05.692 align:middle line:84%
So we can just read
that in the brain waves.

01:01:05.692 --> 01:01:07.900 align:middle line:84%
Even one of the Army Green
Berets that I worked with.

01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:11.370 align:middle line:10%
When I called him on it,
he freaked out and almost

01:01:11.370 --> 01:01:14.650 align:middle line:10%
fell over it his chair, because
he'd only told his best buddy

01:01:14.650 --> 01:01:16.850 align:middle line:10%
that when he was doing
his martial arts practice,

01:01:16.850 --> 01:01:19.210 align:middle line:10%
this old martial arts master
would come in, appear,

01:01:19.210 --> 01:01:20.140 align:middle line:10%
and coach him.

01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:21.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:25.270 align:middle line:84%
Well anyway, I just
have to say, thank you

01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:27.080 align:middle line:84%
for allowing me to
have that experience

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:29.340 align:middle line:84%
and for us to share
this with other people,

01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:32.870 align:middle line:84%
because it's such a-- as
you say, Biocybernaut.

01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:36.470 align:middle line:84%
What a wonderful adventure that
is to be our own cybernaut.

01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: A Biocybernaut is to
inner space what an astronaut

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:40.215 align:middle line:90%
is to outer space.

01:01:40.215 --> 01:01:41.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

01:01:41.090 --> 01:01:43.535 align:middle line:84%
Doctor Hardt, thank you so
much for taking the time.

01:01:43.535 --> 01:01:44.660 align:middle line:90%
>>HARDT: Thank you, Regina.

01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Anything else you'd
like to add at this point?

01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:48.170 align:middle line:84%
You have trainings going
on around the world

01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:49.003 align:middle line:90%
all the time, right?

01:01:49.003 --> 01:01:52.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HARDT: We have a training
center in Germany, in Bavaria,

01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:55.530 align:middle line:84%
in Sedona, Arizona,
and in Victoria,

01:01:55.530 --> 01:01:57.140 align:middle line:90%
British Columbia, Canada.

01:01:57.140 --> 01:01:58.740 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Again,
the book is "The Art

01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:01.792 align:middle line:10%
of Smart Thinking," which
you can find on amazon.com.

01:02:01.792 --> 01:02:04.330 align:middle line:10%
Also, be aware you can
go to biocybernaut.com

01:02:04.330 --> 01:02:07.290 align:middle line:10%
and find out when the next
trainings are happening

01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:09.280 align:middle line:10%
in one of the three
centers around the world.

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:13.124 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
