>>COMPTON ROM: We had a
serious pandemic in 1918,

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.170 align:middle line:84%
and it killed a sizable
portion of our population.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.080 align:middle line:84%
But believe it or not, that
virus is still with us.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.810 align:middle line:84%
Viruses want to live, just
like people want to live.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.270 align:middle line:84%
You can tamper it with
anti-inflammatories.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.536 align:middle line:10%
And the best herbs
to do that is--

infectious disease

it's the need for
good systemic health.

Compton Rom is back
with us to elucidate

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.090 align:middle line:84%
what we can do to keep
our immune system as

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.560 align:middle line:90%
high as possible.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And as a matter of course now
for the rest of our lives,

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.990 align:middle line:90%
not just for now.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.460 align:middle line:90%
So Compton, welcome back.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.755 align:middle line:90%

>>REGINA: You're always one
of our viewers' favorites,

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.550 align:middle line:84%
and it's because you have a
lot of really good knowledge

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:52.450 align:middle line:90%
on this subject.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go into some
really interesting facts that

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.210 align:middle line:84%
have popped up recently
about the healthier zones

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.010 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And we'll go into
that in a minute.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.209 align:middle line:84%
First, what I wanted
us to talk about

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:08.800 align:middle line:84%
is the recent phenomenon
that has swept the world.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.062 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people think
that, oh, this is just

00:01:11.062 --> 00:01:13.270 align:middle line:84%
something that's a blip in
history, going to go away.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.210 align:middle line:84%
But you're talking about
a lot of other things

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.550 align:middle line:84%
piling on top of it, including
the notion of global warming

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.440 align:middle line:84%
and how global warming
is going to affect

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.340 align:middle line:90%
disease patterns in the future.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.670 align:middle line:84%
So I say let's start
there and launch into it

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.130 align:middle line:84%
before we start going
into some of the really

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.020 align:middle line:84%
interesting useful information
we can help ourselves with.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.820 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Right.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.830 align:middle line:10%
So as everyone has
experienced, we

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.200 align:middle line:10%
are in the new health normal.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.630 align:middle line:10%
And the new health
normal is we're

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.250 align:middle line:10%
taking actions that
we never thought

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.620 align:middle line:10%
we were having to take before.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.760 align:middle line:10%
Social isolation, quarantining,
social distancing,

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.840 align:middle line:10%
things like that.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.740 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, we have to
take additional actions.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.590 align:middle line:90%
This is not enough.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And one of the best and easiest
ways to do this, and experience

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.010 align:middle line:84%
and elevate your game to
the new health normal,

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.200 align:middle line:90%
is to increase your immunity.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And we'll be able to do
that by simple diet tricks,

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.830 align:middle line:90%
simple exercises, breath work.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.320 align:middle line:84%
And this is the things
that I wanted to go into.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.202 align:middle line:84%
And the main focus that
I want to talk about,

00:02:18.202 --> 00:02:19.660 align:middle line:84%
which is near and
dear to my heart,

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.540 align:middle line:84%
is how to diversify your
microbiome, because they're

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.790 align:middle line:84%
finding out that the
countries with the most

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.640 align:middle line:84%
diversified microbiomes
with certain

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.320 align:middle line:84%
herbs that decrease inflammation
have the lowest death

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.795 align:middle line:90%
rates from infectious disease.

00:02:33.795 --> 00:02:34.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Viral infections.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Yeah.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.530 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, also historically, we
go back a little bit to 1918.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.330 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Yes.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: H1N1.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about that so we
can understand how viruses work

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.540 align:middle line:90%
across the span of history.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.620 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Nice.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, as many people know, we
had a very serious pandemic

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.030 align:middle line:90%
in 1918 called the Spanish flu.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And it killed a sizable
portion of our population.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.530 align:middle line:84%
But believe it or not, that
virus is still with us.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And what people don't understand
is that viruses want to live,

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.500 align:middle line:90%
just like people want to live.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And they create a sort
of symbiotic relationship

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.640 align:middle line:84%
with their animals
that they inhabit,

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.840 align:middle line:84%
whether it be cows, chickens,
bats, humans, whatever.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And in 1918, they were
brand new to humans.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And it killed humans
to a great degree.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.430 align:middle line:84%
But they've symbiotically
linked each other to saying,

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.060 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm going to
inhabit your body,

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.950 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not going to
give you mortality.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.500 align:middle line:90%
So they can live as well.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.330 align:middle line:90%
We're still experiencing that.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.090 align:middle line:84%
So they've mutated in
such a way that we're

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.540 align:middle line:90%
living with them every day.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.310 align:middle line:84%
So when we take seasonal
flu outbreaks normally,

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.910 align:middle line:84%
the H1N1 viruses that
inhabit us with the flus

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.178 align:middle line:84%
are still linked
to the 1918 virus.

00:03:54.178 --> 00:03:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing
is going to happen

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.525 align:middle line:84%
with every single infectious
disease that we experience.

00:03:59.525 --> 00:04:01.150 align:middle line:84%
If it's a brand new
infectious disease,

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.820 align:middle line:90%
it causes complete mayhem.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.045 align:middle line:84%
And they just learn
to dance with us.

00:04:06.045 --> 00:04:07.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we
have to look at them.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
is a long process

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.450 align:middle line:84%
that happens and mutates
over many, many years.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.325 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Unfortunately.

00:04:12.325 --> 00:04:13.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not
something quick.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:14.500 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: It is.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.089 align:middle line:84%
But from the virus's
point of view,

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.010 align:middle line:84%
a long process is in
millions of years.

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, right, exactly.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: From our
individual point of view--

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We want something
to happen in months.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.902 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Exactly.

00:04:23.902 --> 00:04:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So here I've
written down some basic facts.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.480 align:middle line:84%
Viruses have 28
trillion microbes.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And it says over
400 trillion viruses

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.540 align:middle line:90%
living within the human body.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.060 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them are
comprised of bacteria.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is what
we're made up of.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.880 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Yeah.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.960 align:middle line:84%
It's actually the
other way around.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.400 align:middle line:90%
So in a human--

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I wrote
it down backwards?

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: You did a little bit.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.203 align:middle line:90%
So let me explain to this.

00:04:47.203 --> 00:04:51.588 align:middle line:84%
Our human microbiome comprises
of things that we can't see.

00:04:51.588 --> 00:04:52.630 align:middle line:90%
That's what microbes are.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:53.430 align:middle line:90%
We can't see them.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.760 align:middle line:90%
We can't see parasites.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.200 align:middle line:90%
We can't see funguses.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.310 align:middle line:90%
We can't see bacteria.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And we definitely can't
see viruses, right?

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.160 align:middle line:84%
So those four things
comprise of our microbiome.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.960 align:middle line:90%
They live inside of us.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.250 align:middle line:84%
These microbes, which are
again the parasites, the fungi,

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.640 align:middle line:84%
the yeasts, the bacteria,
and the viruses,

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.110 align:middle line:90%
they call this body their home.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.690 align:middle line:84%
So we focused on just one
of those things called

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:20.500 align:middle line:90%
the bacteria.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And we said that
that's the microbiome.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.520 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's not.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:31.250 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of cells, we have
10 times more cells of bacteria

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.110 align:middle line:90%
than the human body.

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:33.600 align:middle line:90%
But in terms of viruses--

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Than human cells.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Right.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.730 align:middle line:84%
So we have about 10
trillion human cells.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.180 align:middle line:84%
When we look at all our eye
cells, and our skin cells,

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.980 align:middle line:90%
our blood cells, 10 trillion.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.900 align:middle line:84%
But when we look at all
the bacterial cells,

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.120 align:middle line:90%
those are about 100 trillion.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Anywhere from 65
to 100 trillion.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.080 align:middle line:84%
But believe it or
not, the bacteria

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.370 align:middle line:84%
themselves have invaders inside
the bacteria called viruses.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And the viruses of
bacteria are called phages.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.643 align:middle line:84%
so there are prokaryotic
viruses, and there are--

00:06:03.643 --> 00:06:05.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's that
mean, prokaryotic?

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:10.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Prokaryotic means one
nucleus, like the pre-nucleus.

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.630 align:middle line:90%
And these are the bacteria.

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:17.400 align:middle line:84%
Eukaryotic, which is the human
cells, are the true nuclei.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.290 align:middle line:90%
They have viruses, too.

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:24.660 align:middle line:84%
But the bacteria constantly are
invaded with their own viruses.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And they've come up with
their own defense system

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.490 align:middle line:84%
to actually eliminate
those viruses.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And now, genetic engineering has
taken advantage of that system

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:38.100 align:middle line:84%
where the bacteria are
actually surgically excising

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.690 align:middle line:84%
those viruses out
of their system.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.110 align:middle line:90%
It's called the CRISPR system.

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.970 align:middle line:84%
We're using that in genetic
engineering right now.

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.990 align:middle line:84%
But every time they encounter
a virus inside their system,

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:50.420 align:middle line:90%
they just snip it out.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.220 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.060 align:middle line:90%
It goes out.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.400 align:middle line:84%
So there's a constant interplay
between the viruses that

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.300 align:middle line:84%
inhabit the bacteria in our
gut and the viruses themselves.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.230 align:middle line:84%
And believe it or not, while
there's 100 trillion bacteria

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.920 align:middle line:84%
in our gut, there could be
up to 500 trillion viruses

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.850 align:middle line:90%
in our gut.

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:10.910 align:middle line:90%
And it's called our virome.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:11.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Virome, yes.

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And we started on that a little
bit in our last conversation.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Yeah, we don't have no
idea right now how powerful

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:24.150 align:middle line:84%
this virome is and the interplay
that the bacteria have it.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.430 align:middle line:84%
But what is known is
that every time we

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.730 align:middle line:84%
get a virus into our
system, the bacteria

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:32.700 align:middle line:84%
are going to react
to that virus.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:37.980 align:middle line:84%
So if we have a healthy
microbiome, that microbiome,

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.830 align:middle line:84%
their number one
enemy is the virus.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And they don't care whether
it's a prokaryotic virus

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:45.810 align:middle line:90%
or a eukaryotic virus.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Their number one thing is
to get rid of that virus

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.550 align:middle line:84%
and to figure out how to
live symbiotically with it.

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:56.100 align:middle line:90%
So if we do things to--

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.590 align:middle line:84%
that's our number one
helper in our body

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:01.950 align:middle line:84%
to help us alleviate
the symptoms of viruses

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:03.540 align:middle line:90%
or the bacteria.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.670 align:middle line:84%
So every time we
take antibiotics,

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:10.590 align:middle line:84%
every time we take in foods that
hamper the bacteria in our gut

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:14.310 align:middle line:84%
to live, the more
we're suppressing

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:17.160 align:middle line:84%
this innate immune
system to deal

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.200 align:middle line:84%
with the viruses
and the diseases

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.753 align:middle line:90%
that we're going to get.

00:08:21.753 --> 00:08:23.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's interesting
the way you put it.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And what comes to
me is if you're just

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:28.860 align:middle line:84%
looking at it, that each one
of these has their own light.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.660 align:middle line:84%
They have their own
life force, right?

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Yeah.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So here you have
trillions and trillions of tiny

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.210 align:middle line:84%
little beings with
their own life force,

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:39.450 align:middle line:84%
with their own intelligence,
with their own survival skills

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:40.650 align:middle line:90%
that are the--

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:42.990 align:middle line:84%
we are the collective
of it with skin over it.

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:44.490 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: That's right.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:45.330 align:middle line:90%
We're the ecosystem.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're the
ecosystem for these beings,

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:48.880 align:middle line:90%
these little beings.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And so where the
problem first starts

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:56.910 align:middle line:84%
is we've been made to believe
that these little beings

00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:02.010 align:middle line:84%
in our own ecosystem
is working against us,

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:06.780 align:middle line:84%
and to have fear that these
outside invaders can overcome

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.430 align:middle line:90%
us so easily and quickly.

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And really, that the
community, the ecosystem,

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:15.540 align:middle line:84%
starts being made whole at
the top with our own feelings

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:20.010 align:middle line:84%
and emotions and our own faith
in how this all works together

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:21.210 align:middle line:90%
with its own intelligence.

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:22.800 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Exactly.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.500 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the problem
arises where we

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.080 align:middle line:84%
believe that us,
as a human being,

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:32.370 align:middle line:84%
is the only sole, proprietary
organism, conscious organism,

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:36.750 align:middle line:84%
in this ecosystem called the
human body when it's not.

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.760 align:middle line:84%
We're a collection
of consciousness,

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.590 align:middle line:90%
of bacteria, viruses.

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:41.730 align:middle line:90%
They are us.

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:44.370 align:middle line:90%
And to have it be not us and--

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:45.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Have
them all perceived

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:48.792 align:middle line:84%
as enemies when that's what
we're constituted from.

00:09:48.792 --> 00:09:51.000 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Well, that's the
basic problem of our society,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.470 align:middle line:84%
is this disunity and the fact
that we live in a duality.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.476 align:middle line:90%
Like, you better than me.

00:09:58.476 --> 00:10:01.080 align:middle line:84%
In all parts of our society,
we live in a duality.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.540 align:middle line:84%
There can only be one
winner, or there can only

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:08.310 align:middle line:84%
be one this or one that,
when we're all a collective.

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way
it works in our body.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:13.920 align:middle line:84%
Even the viruses want to have
this body, because they can't

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.810 align:middle line:90%
live without this human body.

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:20.820 align:middle line:84%
So when they encounter a virus
that doesn't want this body

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.240 align:middle line:84%
to live, even 99.9% of
the viruses are saying,

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.110 align:middle line:90%
like, what are you doing?

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:28.060 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:28.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:32.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and to me, that's
actually a very hopeful way

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:33.060 align:middle line:90%
to look at all of it.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.980 align:middle line:84%
If we can back
up, you don't even

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.770 align:middle line:84%
have to look at it
on a spiritual level.

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.500 align:middle line:84%
Just look at it on
a biological level.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.000 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: And an
epidemiological level.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:42.875 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:10:42.875 --> 00:10:45.510 align:middle line:84%
Every one of these little
beings has its own intelligence

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:47.017 align:middle line:84%

do to stay alive.

00:10:47.017 --> 00:10:47.850 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: That's right.

>>REGINA: And wishes
for us to stay alive.

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And why can't we trust in
the process of our own bodies

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.548 align:middle line:90%
more, but also enhance?

00:10:54.548 --> 00:10:56.340 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk
about the enhancements.

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:59.640 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Well, for example,
antibiotics actually come

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.990 align:middle line:90%
from microbes.

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:04.950 align:middle line:84%
You know, molds led to
this whole development

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:09.270 align:middle line:84%
of antibiotics, because these
molds and these fungus that

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:14.220 align:middle line:84%
naturally live within us
don't want the body to die.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:19.230 align:middle line:84%
So when a bacteria came in and
started killing off the body,

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:21.615 align:middle line:90%
like cholera, diphtheria, or--

00:11:21.615 --> 00:11:23.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Some of the
really aggressive ones.

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:24.543 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Exactly.

00:11:24.543 --> 00:11:26.460 align:middle line:84%
These funguses are saying,
what are you doing?

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.460 align:middle line:84%
So they came up with
their own antibiotics,

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:33.840 align:middle line:84%
which are antibacterial
compounds in the body.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.020 align:middle line:84%
The same thing
that they're doing,

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:38.340 align:middle line:84%
the funguses and the
bacteria, they're

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:42.030 align:middle line:84%
coming out with
antivirals, you know?

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And then the human cells, they
come out with these antivirals.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And we need to use the
biological intelligence that's

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.710 align:middle line:84%
within us, the
intelligence that's

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:55.480 align:middle line:84%
with everything in
our surroundings,

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.160 align:middle line:84%
including our human cells,
the bacterial cells,

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.350 align:middle line:84%
the fungal cells,
and the viral cells.

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:03.420 align:middle line:90%
And even the plants that we eat.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:05.940 align:middle line:84%
They have their
own intelligence.

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they have their
own bacteria and microbes

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:10.495 align:middle line:84%

or not, they do.

they're bringing

know how to handle

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:23.610 align:middle line:84%
these viruses that they
encountered in the ecosystem.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's a study
that was done recently

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:28.920 align:middle line:90%
that I found fascinating.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.530 align:middle line:84%
And it had to do with what
our bodies are living with all

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:33.150 align:middle line:84%
the time, we're
just not aware of it

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:34.780 align:middle line:90%
because we're asymptomatic.

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And they did a study
of 8,000 people.

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And I can't remember where
the study originated from,

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.930 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't write
it in my notes.

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.560 align:middle line:84%
I've just kind of picked
it up along the way.

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.670 align:middle line:84%
I think it was Dr.
Zach Bush who was going

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:45.390 align:middle line:90%
into great detail about it.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:46.223 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: He's amazing.

00:12:46.223 --> 00:12:47.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, he's good.

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And he was talking
about this study.

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:51.060 align:middle line:90%
So I was taking notes.

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And 8,000 people,
healthy people,

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:58.950 align:middle line:84%
asymptomatic of everything,
just healthy people, had their--

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:01.740 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was the
virome, but anyway, they

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.150 align:middle line:90%
had their blood analyzed.

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:07.424 align:middle line:84%
And what they found
was 42% of them had,

00:13:07.424 --> 00:13:12.540 align:middle line:84%
he said, significant levels of
HIV, herpes, papillomavirus,

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:15.090 align:middle line:90%
hep B, hep C, and so forth.

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:17.130 align:middle line:90%
And totally unaware of it.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:19.063 align:middle line:90%
It just lives within us.

00:13:19.063 --> 00:13:20.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's almost
half of the people

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.220 align:middle line:84%
had high levels
of these things--

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.500 align:middle line:84%
significant levels
of these within them.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.090 align:middle line:90%
Not symptomatic at all.

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:30.780 align:middle line:84%
Just living within them,
doing their own thing.

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:34.360 align:middle line:84%
So many of us have already
been exposed to so much.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:38.010 align:middle line:84%
But then the fear comes when
you see that certain people fall

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:38.920 align:middle line:90%
down with it.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.400 align:middle line:90%
Certain people don't survive it.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we want to
look at, is the factors of who

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:47.550 align:middle line:84%
survives these things
and who doesn't?

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:48.480 align:middle line:90%
And why?

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Right.

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:52.680 align:middle line:84%

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.800 align:middle line:84%
simplistic levels, we have
what's called an innate

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.735 align:middle line:84%
immunity and an
adaptive immunity.

00:14:01.735 --> 00:14:03.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where do
the T cells fall in?

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: The T cells are part
of the adaptive immunity.

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:06.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Adaptive immunity.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:09.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: So innate immunity,
when you look at it,

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:12.510 align:middle line:84%
let's say we're a big castle
and we have to defend ourself.

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:16.260 align:middle line:84%
So the defensive systems
that we have that

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:20.790 align:middle line:84%
protect anything that comes
at us at any time, that's

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:22.060 align:middle line:90%
called our innate immunity.

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.390 align:middle line:84%
So the innate
immunity is designed

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:28.230 align:middle line:84%
to handle anything that is
unknown to come with us.

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:30.660 align:middle line:84%
Then once it's known,
they figure out,

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:34.050 align:middle line:84%
hmm, you know, this is
a particular invader

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:35.200 align:middle line:90%
that's coming to invade us.

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.450 align:middle line:90%
Let's find out more about him.

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And let's find out how to
actually take him down,

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:42.420 align:middle line:90%
specifically for that invader.

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.980 align:middle line:84%
That's called the
adaptive immunity.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And the best things
that come out

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:51.130 align:middle line:84%
are the T cells, the B cells,
and they produce antibodies.

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:54.630 align:middle line:84%
So the antibodies are
specific magic bullets

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:56.070 align:middle line:90%
that take these things down.

00:14:56.070 --> 00:15:00.420 align:middle line:84%
But there's a time lag in
between the innate immunity

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:04.590 align:middle line:84%
and the reinforcements that come
called the adaptive immunity.

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:07.680 align:middle line:84%
It's that lag in
time that causes

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:12.160 align:middle line:84%
people to actually go down with
a particular disease or not.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
there must be factors

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:18.120 align:middle line:84%
that cause a longer period of
lag time in some versus others.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.110 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: That's right.

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And in this lag time, you
get a lot of inflammation,

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:25.320 align:middle line:84%
because the innate
immunity, what they do

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.480 align:middle line:84%
is they do a lot
of secretions, you

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.530 align:middle line:84%
know, just to slow down
that thing to come up.

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:32.440 align:middle line:84%
So they'll just-- you'll get
a lot of inflammation that

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.240 align:middle line:90%
comes up.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:37.240 align:middle line:84%
So you get a lot of secretions
to slow that stuff down,

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.910 align:middle line:84%
and you've got macrophages,
like, releasing enzymes

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:44.170 align:middle line:84%
to actually tear up
and completely destroy

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:46.210 align:middle line:90%
the cell that's been invaded.

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:48.670 align:middle line:84%
So you have a lot
of dead debris.

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And if your reinforcements
from adaptive immunity

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:54.880 align:middle line:84%
don't come fast enough,
you get inflamed.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And you get what's
called a cytokine storm.

00:15:57.890 --> 00:15:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And then you get a lot
of bacterial infection,

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:03.010 align:middle line:84%
because the endemic bacteria
that live inside you,

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:04.007 align:middle line:90%
they eat this stuff.

00:16:04.007 --> 00:16:04.840 align:middle line:90%
They eat the debris.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.670 align:middle line:90%
So you get bacterial infection.

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:07.660 align:middle line:90%
And it's all because--

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:08.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your whole
immune system crashes.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.467 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Your whole
immune system crashes.

00:16:10.467 --> 00:16:12.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's what
we saw in recent history,

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:17.020 align:middle line:84%
is a lot of people that had
underlying conditions and older

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:20.090 align:middle line:84%
people whose natural defenses
have worn down succumbed.

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:20.890 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:22.100 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: That's right.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:22.900 align:middle line:90%
So one of the--

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:24.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because of that lag
time you're talking about,

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:26.590 align:middle line:84%
just wasn't creating what
needed to be created.

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:27.670 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: That's right.

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And so now, they're finding
out that there are two factors

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.820 align:middle line:90%
in decreasing this lag time.

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:38.410 align:middle line:84%
Number one is are you
healthy enough for your body

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:40.720 align:middle line:84%
to respond and
decrease this lag time

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.230 align:middle line:84%
between the innate immunity
and the adaptive reinforcement

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:46.450 align:middle line:90%
immunity that's coming in?

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And to be healthy enough, the
biggest determinant factor

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.570 align:middle line:84%
in being healthy enough is
your gut and your microbiome.

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Because these bacteria are
putting out these compounds,

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:59.230 align:middle line:84%
these antivirals and
these antibacterials,

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:01.480 align:middle line:84%
and they're coming
to the rescue.

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:05.079 align:middle line:84%
And they're basically--
they have their own system

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:06.490 align:middle line:90%
and their own bullets.

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:09.790 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to come with
our own magic bullets,

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:12.542 align:middle line:84%
because if we keep
them healthy, they come

00:17:12.542 --> 00:17:13.750 align:middle line:90%
with their own magic bullets.

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And the way to keep
our microbiome healthy

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:20.410 align:middle line:84%
is to eat the most
diverse diet of fiber

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:22.540 align:middle line:84%
and to be as
plant-based as possible.

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:28.480 align:middle line:84%
When your innate immunity
gets an infectious disease,

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.500 align:middle line:90%
it starts defending itself.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:33.430 align:middle line:84%
But then the microbiome
and the bacteria come up

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:37.420 align:middle line:84%
and they start pinging it
with their own little bullets

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:41.050 align:middle line:84%
and stopping it until your
adaptive response comes in.

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And we can do that
through plants and herbs.

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:44.678 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about that.

00:17:44.678 --> 00:17:47.200 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about-- let's
take the Indian diet.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.950 align:middle line:84%
Very, very rich in spices
and herbs, and very rich

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:52.510 align:middle line:90%
in turmeric.

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:53.720 align:middle line:90%
Curry powders and so forth.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.030 align:middle line:90%
But just turmeric alone.

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:56.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Turmeric
alone has been proven

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.770 align:middle line:84%
to be extremely
antiviral, especially

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:03.010 align:middle line:84%
to a class of
infectious organisms

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:05.630 align:middle line:84%
that we all know
and love these days.

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:06.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:09.165 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk about
inflammatory processes,

00:18:09.165 --> 00:18:10.540 align:middle line:84%
because you were
speaking earlier

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:12.610 align:middle line:84%
that the cytokine
storm is what really

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:14.260 align:middle line:90%
crashes the immune system.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
things like using garlic,

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:19.300 align:middle line:84%
onions, some people are
allergic to those kind

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:22.840 align:middle line:84%
of sulfur-based things, but once
you ferment-- when you ferment

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.700 align:middle line:90%
them, it's a different deal.

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:26.920 align:middle line:84%
You can do fermented
garlic, even if you can't--

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.570 align:middle line:84%
I can't do raw garlic, but
I can do fermented garlic.

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:30.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Right.

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:32.960 align:middle line:84%
So fermenting turmeric
is really important.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And fermenting a lot of these
anti-inflammatory compounds

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:38.740 align:middle line:90%
is very important.

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:42.040 align:middle line:84%
But the main thing is to
prevent the cytokine storm.

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:47.980 align:middle line:84%
So when you encounter
a period in your life,

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:50.480 align:middle line:84%
it's the flu season, or
it's the viral season,

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:54.342 align:middle line:84%
and it's not a matter of whether
you're going to get it or not.

00:18:54.342 --> 00:18:56.050 align:middle line:84%
It's when you're going
to get it and what

00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:56.650 align:middle line:90%
you're going to do about it.

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:58.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you're
probably going to be exposed.

00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:59.560 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's going to be exposed.

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Everyone's going to
be exposed to viruses, right?

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.760 align:middle line:84%
So when you know
you're exposed, you

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:07.780 align:middle line:84%
need to focus on preventing
a cytokine storm.

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And a cytokine storm is when the
T cells just kind of freak out,

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:13.600 align:middle line:84%
and they go, whoa,
let's start doing this.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:17.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can tamper it
with anti-inflammatories.

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And the best herbs to do that
is turmeric that is fermented.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What if it's
not fermented, just

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:24.270 align:middle line:90%
off the shelves?

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:25.210 align:middle line:90%
Ground up turmeric.

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:27.670 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Well, the thing is
it's not very bioavailable.

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:29.600 align:middle line:90%
You have to eat a lot of it.

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:32.350 align:middle line:90%
But the Indians eat lots of it.

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:33.790 align:middle line:90%
They eat curries all the time.

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:37.030 align:middle line:84%
So eating lots of it as
opposed to worrying about

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:38.620 align:middle line:84%
whether it's
bioavailable or not--

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:40.662 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you're
eating it in most meals.

00:19:40.662 --> 00:19:41.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: That's right.

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:44.740 align:middle line:84%
So if you can get a source
of fermented turmeric,

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:45.700 align:middle line:90%
that would be great.

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:48.550 align:middle line:90%
But you know, another study is--

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:53.110 align:middle line:84%
they say that turmeric
actually prevents not

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:55.570 align:middle line:84%
only the attachment
of viruses to cells,

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:57.250 align:middle line:84%
but it also prevents
the replication.

00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:57.800 align:middle line:90%
It's like--

00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:58.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:59.520 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Yeah.

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.780 align:middle line:90%
It has two properties in one.

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:06.310 align:middle line:84%
So the compounds in turmeric
are called curcumin.

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:09.370 align:middle line:84%
That's the compound in turmeric
that is responsible for that.

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:12.050 align:middle line:84%
But turmeric has about
four different curcuminoids

00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:12.850 align:middle line:90%
in there.

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:16.427 align:middle line:84%
And if you ferment it, it
makes it into like eight or 16.

00:20:16.427 --> 00:20:17.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh really?

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:18.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Yeah.

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:19.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
mean, most people

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, where do you
find fermented turmeric?

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:24.910 align:middle line:90%
Is it readily available?

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:36.530 align:middle line:84%
But we're also
fermenting hemp with it,

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:41.630 align:middle line:84%
because they're finding
out that turmeric with CBD

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:43.993 align:middle line:84%
really helps against
the cytokines storm.

00:20:43.993 --> 00:20:45.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
CBD has come up

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:47.180 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of different
studies and a lot

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:51.440 align:middle line:84%
of different formulations as
being super helpful in terms

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:52.580 align:middle line:90%
of stopping that storm.

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Yeah, CBD
is very helpful.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And when combined with
turmeric, so there's a--

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.780 align:middle line:84%
here in Boulder, I
just saw these drinks

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:01.280 align:middle line:90%
with turmeric and CBD.

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And I bought,
like, four of them.

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.280 align:middle line:90%
They're awesome.

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And also astragalus,
another herb, and cordyceps,

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.160 align:middle line:90%
a mushroom.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was just
going to bring that up.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.680 align:middle line:90%
Cordyceps.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:14.243 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is a
little off-topic,

00:21:14.243 --> 00:21:16.160 align:middle line:84%
but I want to bring it
up, because everybody's

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.440 align:middle line:84%
starting to hear about it,
a lot of our audience will.

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.270 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing
with that mud water

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:23.720 align:middle line:84%
where you're taking chai
herbs, all the chai spices,

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:28.000 align:middle line:84%
and you're taking raw
cacao, turmeric, cinnamon,

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.878 align:middle line:84%
and four different
cordyceps ground up together

00:21:30.878 --> 00:21:32.420 align:middle line:84%
as your morning
drink and replacement

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:33.520 align:middle line:90%
for coffee or black tea.

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:34.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Yeah.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:34.950 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:35.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:37.020 align:middle line:90%
That gets a thumbs up from me.

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:37.280 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Have you tried it?

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:38.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I
drink it every day.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.440 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.523 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I love it.

00:21:40.523 --> 00:21:42.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: You're not going
to believe what that's

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.800 align:middle line:90%
doing for your microbiome.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.467 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, I'm glad I brought
it up, because it just started.

00:21:46.467 --> 00:21:47.660 align:middle line:90%
I actually made my own.

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:50.600 align:middle line:84%
You can make your own, you
know, if you can't find it

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:51.810 align:middle line:90%
or-- it's a little pricey.

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:55.100 align:middle line:84%
But I made my own there for
a while, because I ran out.

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about if
you want to make something

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:00.350 align:middle line:84%
like this for yourself,
what you would be looking to

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:01.550 align:middle line:90%
in terms of cordyceps.

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:03.675 align:middle line:84%
Because they have to be
powdered and ground to work

00:22:03.675 --> 00:22:05.960 align:middle line:84%
with this formula for a
drink in the morning, anyway.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:06.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Yeah.

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:10.460 align:middle line:84%
First of all, the strain of
cordyceps is very important.

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:12.530 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
cordyceps out there

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:14.420 align:middle line:90%
that are easy to grow.

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:17.150 align:middle line:84%
But the strain that you
want is cordyceps sinensis.

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And you want a
particular extract.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: S-I-N-E-N-S-I-S?

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:21.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Yes.

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:24.110 align:middle line:10%
And there are
particular extracts

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:26.810 align:middle line:10%
of that are good for energy.

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:29.090 align:middle line:10%
But there are other
extracts in that that

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:31.260 align:middle line:10%
are good for anti-inflammation.

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:32.330 align:middle line:90%
So, you know--

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:33.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sinensis.

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.270 align:middle line:84%
Which other ones might
be good for this?

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:36.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Cordyceps militaris.

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:37.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Militaris.

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:38.790 align:middle line:90%
Like military?

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:40.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Yeah.

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:43.340 align:middle line:84%
So the cordyceps militaris
is really good for energy,

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:46.995 align:middle line:84%
but cordyceps sinensis are very
good for anti-inflammation.

00:22:46.995 --> 00:22:49.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if you could find
them powdered in capsules,

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:51.020 align:middle line:84%
you could take
them apart and you

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:53.790 align:middle line:84%
could make your own
kind of compound, right?

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:54.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Yeah.

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:56.660 align:middle line:84%
So if you could find
a supplement that

00:22:56.660 --> 00:23:01.190 align:middle line:84%
has a combination of fermented
turmeric, astragalus.

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And there's a form
of astragalus that

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:07.920 align:middle line:84%
actually increases your
telomere with astragalosides.

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, with CBD, it
works great for inflammation

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:18.410 align:middle line:84%
and being able to prevent
your body from getting

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:19.845 align:middle line:90%
into that cytokine storm.

00:23:19.845 --> 00:23:21.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
like, in this drink

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:22.928 align:middle line:84%
that I drink in
the morning, if you

00:23:22.928 --> 00:23:25.550 align:middle line:84%
add in all the
cloves, and nutmeg,

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:28.280 align:middle line:84%
and allspice and cinnamon,
you get these great flavors,

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.010 align:middle line:84%
the chai flavors going, you
get something kind of tasty

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:34.010 align:middle line:84%
while you're really enhancing
the health of your microbiome

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:34.858 align:middle line:90%
it sounds like.

00:23:34.858 --> 00:23:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: But you know
what would really help?

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:37.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What?

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:39.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: If you actually
eat the dregs.

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:40.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Eat the?

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:41.300 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: The dregs.

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:41.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The dregs.

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Yeah, because those
are the insoluble fibers.

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:45.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh,
yeah, well, you do.

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.980 align:middle line:84%
What I do is I just swirl
a little more hot water in

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:48.770 align:middle line:90%
and then just gulp it down.

00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:49.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Nice.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a little
scratchy on the throat.

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:52.280 align:middle line:90%
But no, drink the whole thing.

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: That's actually
the most important part.

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:55.133 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I figured.

00:23:55.133 --> 00:23:57.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Because the
microbiome is made

00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:59.960 align:middle line:84%
of these particular
species of bacteria

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.260 align:middle line:90%
that feed off of fiber.

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:02.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:04.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: So when you're
talking about eating

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:08.090 align:middle line:84%
probiotic-like
foods, you're mainly

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:11.150 align:middle line:84%
talking about the fiber and
not necessarily the strains

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:12.890 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:15.260 align:middle line:84%
So you want to eat the fiber
from all different kinds,

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.270 align:middle line:84%
because it feeds
as many-- you want

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:21.270 align:middle line:84%
to get as many diverse microbes
in your gut as possible.

00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:25.060 align:middle line:84%
So when you go to the store,
focus on the insoluble fibers

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:25.860 align:middle line:90%
that you're eating.

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:30.910 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about the
root vegetables like cassava,

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:35.300 align:middle line:84%
and chicory, and Jerusalem
artichoke are really

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:37.010 align:middle line:90%
good probiotic fibers.

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:39.830 align:middle line:84%
But the fruits, like, the
really fibrous fruits.

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:42.050 align:middle line:90%
My favorite is the mango.

00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:43.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Super fibrous.

00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:44.930 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Super fibrous.

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:47.300 align:middle line:90%
And eating all that stuff.

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:48.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Apples.

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:48.680 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Apples.

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:49.513 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Obviously.

00:24:49.513 --> 00:24:51.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: That's right,
but eat the skin.

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And then other
microbiome builders

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:57.920 align:middle line:90%
are roots that are very bitter.

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:00.230 align:middle line:90%
And leaves that are very bitter.

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:01.820 align:middle line:90%
Like, if you can--

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:06.080 align:middle line:84%
like radishes, and
turmeric is bitter,

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.522 align:middle line:90%
and ginger is very bitter.

00:25:07.522 --> 00:25:09.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going
to say and ginseng.

00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:10.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: And ginseng.

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:11.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:15.560 align:middle line:84%
So those things really
increase these microbes.

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:17.840 align:middle line:84%
But the microbes we need
to be paying attention to

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:19.580 align:middle line:84%
are called the
keystone microbes.

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's talk
about keystone microbes.

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:21.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: OK.

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:24.980 align:middle line:84%
So there are bacteria,
and then there's bacteria.

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:25.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:26.810 align:middle line:90%
With a big B.

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:29.880 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: With a big B. So
they're finding out that

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:34.810 align:middle line:84%
in the macro ecosystem, if you
take out certain animals called

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:37.750 align:middle line:84%
the keystone species
out of our ecosystem,

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:40.040 align:middle line:90%
the ecosystem goes crazy.

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.100 align:middle line:84%
So you take out the wolves
out of North America--

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:44.080 align:middle line:84%
the wolves are considered
keystone species--

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:47.560 align:middle line:84%
and what happens is they
don't eat the deer that

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.390 align:middle line:90%
are too young or too old.

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And the deer
population goes crazy.

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.770 align:middle line:84%
The rabbit population
goes crazy.

00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:55.740 align:middle line:90%
And all the fauna are eaten.

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:58.510 align:middle line:84%
You want to reintroduce
wolves into the population,

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:02.720 align:middle line:84%
and then the ecosystem goes back
down into a manageable system.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:07.600 align:middle line:84%
So you do that to the elephants
in Africa, the lions in Africa,

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:10.330 align:middle line:90%
the orcas in the sea.

00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:12.190 align:middle line:84%
These are all called
keystone species.

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:14.080 align:middle line:90%
They keep everything in check.

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:17.320 align:middle line:84%
The great white sharks
are keystone species.

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:19.570 align:middle line:84%
We can't kill them
off, or else we're

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:23.080 align:middle line:84%
going to get an overgrowth
of all these organisms

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.450 align:middle line:84%
that are not very good
for the ecosystem.

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:29.480 align:middle line:84%
They may be cute, but they're
not good for the ecosystem.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And this is what's
happening in our gut.

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Every time we're
taking antibiotics,

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:36.280 align:middle line:84%
every time we're
eating GMO foods,

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.290 align:middle line:84%
every time we're
eating processed foods

00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:44.320 align:middle line:84%
that our guts don't recognize,
you're not really feeding

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:47.980 align:middle line:84%
the keystone species,
because they're fed on fiber.

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:51.250 align:middle line:84%
They're planted on diverse
plant fiber that's more

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:53.950 align:middle line:90%
bitter than anything, you know?

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:59.110 align:middle line:84%
So we were just talking earlier
about how you love to put lime,

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:00.460 align:middle line:90%
and you like to eat lime.

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:03.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, every time I eat
a grapefruit or a lime,

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:06.820 align:middle line:84%
I make sure I eat the white
part of the grapefruit skin.

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:08.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
like the white part.

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.460 align:middle line:90%
Talk about the value of that.

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:13.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Well, it turns
on your bile salts.

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:15.640 align:middle line:84%
Every time you're
eating bitterness,

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.040 align:middle line:90%
it turns on the bile salts.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.180 align:middle line:84%
So if you eat the white
part of the orange

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:25.120 align:middle line:84%
and the white part
of the grapefruit,

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:26.860 align:middle line:84%
it turns on these
bile salts that

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:30.220 align:middle line:84%
seem to increase these
keystone species in our gut,

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:35.453 align:middle line:84%
namely the Clostridium
group IV cluster in our gut.

00:27:35.453 --> 00:27:37.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is
responsible for what?

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:39.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: It's responsible
for regulating anything.

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:43.750 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of like the
police and the one world

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:46.180 align:middle line:90%
government of our gut.

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:48.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Great.

00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:49.370 align:middle line:90%
Militarius.

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:50.170 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Yeah, yeah.

00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:53.470 align:middle line:90%


00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:55.690 align:middle line:84%
So the study that
I want to present,

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:58.840 align:middle line:84%
no one's talking
about the microbiome.

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:02.410 align:middle line:84%
But when these
researchers looked

00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:07.120 align:middle line:84%
into how diet is affecting the
morbidity and the mortality

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:10.960 align:middle line:84%
rate of certain viruses
that are coming in now,

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.930 align:middle line:84%
they're finding out
that the countries that

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:16.270 align:middle line:84%
ate the highest in
fermented vegetables,

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:18.717 align:middle line:84%
not pickled vegetables,
but fermented vegetables--

00:28:18.717 --> 00:28:20.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because a lot
of people confuse the two.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:22.630 align:middle line:84%
Like in Germany,
for example, you

00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:24.910 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of pickled
foods with your meals.

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:27.820 align:middle line:84%
But you also have fermented
foods with the meals.

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:29.600 align:middle line:84%
So explain the difference
between the two

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:31.840 align:middle line:84%
so people understand you can't
just have a bread and butter

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.220 align:middle line:90%
pickle and have it do the job.

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:34.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Right.

00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:37.310 align:middle line:84%
So pickled foods is using a
lot of vinegar and salt. And it

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:38.110 align:middle line:90%
actually--

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:39.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And sometimes sugar.

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:40.298 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Sometimes sugar.

00:28:40.298 --> 00:28:42.640 align:middle line:84%
But it actually
prevents anything other

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:45.550 align:middle line:84%
than salt-loving
acid-loving bacteria

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:47.830 align:middle line:90%
from growing into the food.

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually a
preservative, high salt

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:53.080 align:middle line:90%
and high acids from vinegar.

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.000 align:middle line:84%
It prevents a lot of
bacteria from growing.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.520 align:middle line:84%
So you want foods
with a plethora

00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:59.110 align:middle line:90%
of bacteria growing in it.

00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:02.560 align:middle line:84%
So you just want fermented
foods where you don't add salt

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:04.060 align:middle line:90%
and you just add a little sugar.

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And you just let it sit there
and you ferment vegetables.

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's go
with the classic standard.

00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Everybody knows
about it pretty much.

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:13.720 align:middle line:84%
I remember encountering
it ages ago

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:17.200 align:middle line:84%
when I was in South Korea,
the kimchi barrels in people's

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.250 align:middle line:90%
backyards.

00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:20.980 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I didn't have any
real understanding of it.

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:24.760 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of just
overwhelmed with the scent.

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:26.870 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
what's going on there

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:30.040 align:middle line:84%
so we can learn about how we
create this ourselves, even,

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:33.520 align:middle line:84%
how we can create our
own fermented vegetables.

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Well, you can take
pre-fermented vegetables

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:40.300 align:middle line:84%
like kimchi and like sauerkraut
and actually mix them together.

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And you'll get a lot
of bacteria in there.

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:43.960 align:middle line:90%
And then you just--

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:47.710 align:middle line:84%
you take root vegetables
in from anywhere.

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:48.730 align:middle line:90%
You just chop them up.

00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:50.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like carrots,
or turnips, or parsnips?

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:51.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Yeah.

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:53.720 align:middle line:84%
Carrots have a lot
of sugar in them.

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:56.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually good
food for everything.

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.810 align:middle line:90%
So carrots, turnips, radishes.

00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:00.260 align:middle line:90%
But you want a diversity.

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:03.800 align:middle line:84%
So for the first time, if you've
never visited an Asian market,

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:06.200 align:middle line:84%
if you've never visited
a Middle Eastern market,

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.830 align:middle line:84%
if you've never visited
a South American market,

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:10.360 align:middle line:90%
go to those markets.

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:13.570 align:middle line:84%
Even the difference
between a regular broccoli

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:16.780 align:middle line:84%
and a Chinese broccoli can
bring up a different species

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:18.580 align:middle line:90%
of microbe in your gut.

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:21.040 align:middle line:84%
So if you've been eating
broccoli all the time,

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:21.970 align:middle line:90%
change it up.

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:24.190 align:middle line:90%
Go to a Chinese broccoli.

00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And they've got
these hybrid species

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:33.230 align:middle line:90%
of cauliflower and broccoli.

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:34.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:35.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they do.

00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:37.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Try the veggies that
you've never tried before;

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:39.162 align:middle line:90%
rutabagas, cassavas.

00:30:39.162 --> 00:30:41.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So start maybe with
a little kimchi, a little bit

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:43.240 align:middle line:84%
of sauerkraut,
mix them together,

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:46.100 align:middle line:84%
slice up some of these root
vegetables, and let it all sit?

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:46.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Right.

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:47.920 align:middle line:90%
Just let it all sit.

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:50.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the refrigerator,
or natural room temperature?

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:50.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: That's right.

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:51.920 align:middle line:90%
And add a little bit of honey.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:52.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A little
bit of honey to it

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:53.900 align:middle line:90%
to get the fermentation going.

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:55.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: To get the
fermentation going.

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:57.068 align:middle line:84%
And you don't want
too much kimchi,

00:30:57.068 --> 00:30:59.560 align:middle line:84%
because just one kimchi
contains millions and millions

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:00.610 align:middle line:90%
of bacteria.

00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:01.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:03.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: So if you don't
like the taste of kimchi,

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:08.140 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be diluted out by
the sauerkraut and the kimchi.

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And then, go and get
your favorite probiotic

00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:13.720 align:middle line:90%
that you feel really good about.

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:15.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And put it in there?

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:16.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: That's right.

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:17.830 align:middle line:90%
These live probiotics.

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, at
Ascended Health,

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.600 align:middle line:84%
we make a probiotic,
ProAlive, that's

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:25.090 align:middle line:84%
got about 300 different
species of bacteria

00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:27.470 align:middle line:84%
that we collect
from the blue zones.

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:28.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:29.150 align:middle line:90%
All over the world.

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:29.950 align:middle line:90%
And we did--

00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:31.610 align:middle line:84%
I think we did our
last show on that.

00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:32.410 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Yeah.

00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:35.440 align:middle line:84%
But there's so many good
spore-based probiotics.

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:38.620 align:middle line:90%
You want spore-based probiotics.

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:42.547 align:middle line:84%
Garden of Life makes
a really good one.

00:31:42.547 --> 00:31:45.130 align:middle line:84%
You just get it from the store,
and you just take one capsule,

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:48.370 align:middle line:84%
and you put it in with
these root vegetables

00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:51.307 align:middle line:90%
and bitter vegetables.

00:31:51.307 --> 00:31:53.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You don't
need to eat a lot of it.

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:55.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can have a
tablespoon or two with a meal.

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:57.490 align:middle line:84%
So what's the big
picture we're looking

00:31:57.490 --> 00:31:58.670 align:middle line:90%
at with this information?

00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:01.780 align:middle line:84%
Which is exciting, because
anyone can make a concoction.

00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:03.430 align:middle line:90%
It's cheap to do.

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:05.350 align:middle line:84%
And we have this
incredible protection

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:07.300 align:middle line:90%
coming from our microbiome.

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:10.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: So we want to
diversify the microbiome

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:13.070 align:middle line:84%
to increase not
just the bacteria,

00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:17.710 align:middle line:84%
but the main bacteria, which
is called the keystone species.

00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And also, eat things
that lowers the time

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:23.770 align:middle line:84%
lag between our innate
immunity and the reinforcement

00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:24.830 align:middle line:90%
of our adaptive immunity.

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:27.500 align:middle line:84%
So we want to keep
our inflammation down.

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:31.150 align:middle line:84%
So the main things is
we want a diverse amount

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:32.620 align:middle line:90%
of plant-based fiber.

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:33.980 align:middle line:90%
That's number one.

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:37.015 align:middle line:84%
And we want to add
turmeric, number two.

00:32:37.015 --> 00:32:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And the third thing that
was really important

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:42.503 align:middle line:84%
is eating a lot of
seaweed and phytoplankton.

00:32:42.503 --> 00:32:44.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can
get-- are you talking,

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:45.280 align:middle line:90%
like, blue-green algae?

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:47.170 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Blue-green algae, yeah.

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:48.610 align:middle line:84%
Some of the best
blue-green algae

00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:51.870 align:middle line:84%
comes from Klamath Lake
in the United States.

00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And spirulina and chlorella,
because the combination

00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:00.550 align:middle line:84%
of that with
fermented vegetables,

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:02.890 align:middle line:84%
it turns out that
the keystone microbes

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:06.670 align:middle line:84%
happened to be in our guts
when human beings came

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:08.440 align:middle line:90%
from sea animals.

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:12.280 align:middle line:84%
All the way back to
eukaryotic organisms

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:14.660 align:middle line:90%
that came in through the sea.

00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And it just makes sense, because
they were the original microbes

00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:19.460 align:middle line:90%
in our gut.

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:22.090 align:middle line:84%
So they love to
eat sea vegetables.

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:24.610 align:middle line:84%
So if you can eat seaweed,
eat a lot of nori.

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Just chomp on these
delicious nori.

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:29.860 align:middle line:84%
Use that as your potato
chip when you're eating

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:31.450 align:middle line:90%
your fermented vegetables.

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:37.360 align:middle line:84%
So a combination of
turmeric, and you put CBD,

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:42.760 align:middle line:84%
you put astragalus, and
you can put cordyceps

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:44.200 align:middle line:84%
in with these
fermented vegetables

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:45.440 align:middle line:90%
and eat that every day.

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And you will really
diversify the microbiome.

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And when you add seaweed, and
you add phytoplankton in there,

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:54.327 align:middle line:84%
it diversifies the
keystone species.

00:33:54.327 --> 00:33:56.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What happens
when, in your refrigerator,

00:33:56.410 --> 00:33:59.462 align:middle line:84%
your food turns into an
experiment where you just let

00:33:59.462 --> 00:34:00.920 align:middle line:90%
a soup sit there too long, but--

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:01.720 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: It's great.

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:02.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I was going to say.

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:04.955 align:middle line:84%
We tend to, like,
throw it out, say, mm.

00:34:04.955 --> 00:34:06.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Do you know
why we throw it out?

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:09.670 align:middle line:84%
It's because when you put it
in there in the first place,

00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:14.020 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't inoculated previously
with intentional microbes.

00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:17.920 align:middle line:84%
So one thing you
want to do before--

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.170 align:middle line:84%
OK, so before you
add your vegetables,

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:23.080 align:middle line:84%
you've got to steam
the vegetables.

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:24.219 align:middle line:90%
Because you want to--

00:34:24.219 --> 00:34:27.680 align:middle line:84%
you basically want to clean
off of the microbes that

00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:28.480 align:middle line:90%
were in there.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:28.719 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:28.719 --> 00:34:30.469 align:middle line:84%
No, we talked about
this in our last show.

00:34:30.469 --> 00:34:33.159 align:middle line:84%
You can also use ozonated water,
clean them all off beforehand.

00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:35.440 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying actually
steaming your vegetables

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:38.360 align:middle line:84%
before you put them in a soup
is a better way to go about it?

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:40.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Well, a lot of people
don't have ozone machines.

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:41.620 align:middle line:90%
You know, ozone would be better.

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a cheap,
easy way to do it.

00:34:43.370 --> 00:34:45.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: The easy way
is called blanching.

00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:47.650 align:middle line:84%
So blanching is when
you boil some water,

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:49.179 align:middle line:84%
and you put it to
a boil, and then

00:34:49.179 --> 00:34:53.949 align:middle line:84%
you just pour it on top of
all your fresh cut vegetables.

00:34:53.949 --> 00:34:56.260 align:middle line:90%
And then you count to 10.

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:57.580 align:middle line:90%
Just filter it back out.

00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:58.690 align:middle line:90%
Now it's blanched.

00:34:58.690 --> 00:35:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And all the microbes
that were there are gone.

00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And they could be
the good microbes,

00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:04.390 align:middle line:90%
they could be the bad microbes.

00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:07.030 align:middle line:84%
But then, when you add your
little piece of kimchi, which

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:09.340 align:middle line:84%
is all good microbes, and
your piece of sauerkraut,

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.320 align:middle line:84%
which is all good
microbes, and your honey--

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:12.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Into your soup.

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:13.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Into your soup.

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:17.302 align:middle line:84%
And you just throw it
around like a salad.

00:35:17.302 --> 00:35:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to make-- and then

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.740 align:middle line:84%
you add water to
it, like halfway up.

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to start fermenting

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:23.302 align:middle line:90%
these things over time.

00:35:23.302 --> 00:35:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And you just put
it in a mason jar.

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:27.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're doing an
intentional inoculation instead

00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:28.690 align:middle line:90%
of just letting it go bad.

00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:29.523 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: That's right.

00:35:29.523 --> 00:35:34.040 align:middle line:84%
I will have directions
on ascendedhealth.com.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:34.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, cool.

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:36.423 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know,
we throw these out,

00:35:36.423 --> 00:35:38.350 align:middle line:84%
and I've often thought,
hmm, I'm wondering

00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:40.900 align:middle line:84%
if it actually might have some
beneficial microbes in there.

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:44.170 align:middle line:84%
But like you say, it
could be anything.

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:45.880 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you could
get sick over them.

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:46.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Right.

00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:48.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so now one
thing I've learned here

00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:54.790 align:middle line:84%
is that dairy-based fermentation
products don't seem to overall,

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:56.320 align:middle line:84%
in the studies that
have been done,

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.720 align:middle line:84%
have as strong an
effect as plant-based.

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:03.670 align:middle line:84%
But what if people are, say,
making a coconut milk yogurt?

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:05.455 align:middle line:90%
So it's a plant-based yogurt?

00:36:05.455 --> 00:36:06.850 align:middle line:90%
Is that OK?

00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:10.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: They didn't find any
nut milks, or nut-based milks,

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:13.157 align:middle line:84%
or dairy-based milks or even
sour milks that were important.

00:36:13.157 --> 00:36:14.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not much effect.

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:14.770 align:middle line:90%
So it really is plants.

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:15.430 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: You know why?

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why?

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Because of the fiber.

00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:18.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, there's no fiber.

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:19.450 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: There's no fiber in it.

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:19.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:22.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: So if you added the--
if you make coconut milk,

00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:26.290 align:middle line:84%
and you add the nuts, and you
actually put the coconut fiber

00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:27.915 align:middle line:90%
in there, big effect.

00:36:27.915 --> 00:36:29.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh,
that's fascinating.

00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:30.665 align:middle line:84%
I'm learning so
many things here.

00:36:30.665 --> 00:36:32.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Because nuts
are full of fiber.

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:35.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they don't eat the liquid.

00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:38.440 align:middle line:84%
They chomp on the
insoluble stuff.

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:42.790 align:middle line:84%
That's why-- you know, in the
'50s, we had food that was,

00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:43.850 align:middle line:90%
like, "digestible".

00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:45.160 align:middle line:90%
Remember that stuff?

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:46.717 align:middle line:84%
Like, not that you
lived in the '50s.

00:36:46.717 --> 00:36:47.800 align:middle line:90%
I didn't live in the '50s.

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.342 align:middle line:84%
But I just remember
these commercials

00:36:49.342 --> 00:36:51.400 align:middle line:84%
that are like, hey,
eat this cereal that's

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:52.930 align:middle line:90%
completely digestible.

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:55.840 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why it was
digestible was it had no fiber.

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:58.570 align:middle line:84%
It just went boom, straight
through your system.

00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:02.440 align:middle line:84%
But you were actually
lowering your microbiome.

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:06.490 align:middle line:84%
As human beings, we are still
hunter-gatherers at heart.

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:10.510 align:middle line:84%
Like, If you had
an 800-chapter book

00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:13.870 align:middle line:84%
of the history of
humanity, only, like,

00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:16.630 align:middle line:84%
the very last chapter
encompasses, like,

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:20.740 align:middle line:84%
these last 200 years
of agricultural, GMO,

00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:23.410 align:middle line:84%
or highly processed
food society.

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Like, 799-- actually,
like 790 chapters

00:37:27.610 --> 00:37:30.080 align:middle line:90%
we were foraging for foods.

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:30.880 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:32.890 align:middle line:90%
So in this study that--

00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:35.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we didn't have
great hygiene necessarily.

00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:36.730 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: No.

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:38.170 align:middle line:90%
No, but that was a good thing.

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:39.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, so I'm saying.

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:42.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Because we incorporated
these microbes in our guts

00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:45.370 align:middle line:84%
that when we diversified
the microbiome in our guts,

00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:47.523 align:middle line:84%
they were able to
handle everything.

00:37:47.523 --> 00:37:48.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about that

00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:51.550 align:middle line:84%
where children are concerned,
because in the Western world,

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:56.620 align:middle line:84%
we've gone into these just
hyper sanitary practices

00:37:56.620 --> 00:38:00.250 align:middle line:84%
that I see as really
detrimental to kids.

00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Well, you know, I don't
see it as detrimental for kids.

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
is because I like to

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:09.580 align:middle line:84%
sanitize before I
inoculate my fermentation.

00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:11.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what about in
times past, where you just

00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:15.490 align:middle line:84%
could allow nature, what's in
the dirt, to be incorporated--

00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:18.190 align:middle line:84%
microbes in the dirt to be
incorporated into the diet?

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:20.800 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that just sort of a
natural kind of introduction?

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:23.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: That's a
natural introduction.

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:25.930 align:middle line:84%
But now we've got toxins
in the natural world.

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:28.690 align:middle line:90%
We've got plastics.

00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:31.507 align:middle line:84%
They just did this study
that 100% of the rain

00:38:31.507 --> 00:38:33.340 align:middle line:84%
have little bits of
nanoplastic in the rain.

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:33.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, jeez.

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:34.420 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:35.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Right?

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:37.480 align:middle line:84%
So we've got a lot of
toxins in the environment

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:40.820 align:middle line:84%
that we never had
even 100 years ago.

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:42.610 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, I'm for sterilization.

00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:45.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I mean, just
constantly washing and putting

00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:47.387 align:middle line:90%
sanitizers on and everything.

00:38:47.387 --> 00:38:48.595 align:middle line:90%

00:38:48.595 --> 00:38:52.450 align:middle line:84%
You know, I have another

00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And we're actually creating
probiotic sanitizers

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:58.353 align:middle line:84%
and water-based
sanitizers that--

00:38:58.353 --> 00:38:59.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Instead
of alcohol-based

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:00.400 align:middle line:90%
that strip everything.

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:01.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Instead of
alcohol-based that strip

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:02.950 align:middle line:90%
the microbiome from the skin.

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:07.150 align:middle line:84%
We need sanitizers that
inoculate after sanitization.

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:09.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, well,
there's a solution.

00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:12.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: So when we're blanching,
that's like sanitizing.

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:14.020 align:middle line:90%
But re-inoculate.

00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:17.350 align:middle line:84%
Once you clear the
parking lot of everything,

00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:20.440 align:middle line:84%
you want to introduce the
good things, you know?

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:23.530 align:middle line:84%
So our body is like
an open bar, you know?

00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:25.840 align:middle line:84%
You clear everyone
out of the bar.

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:28.840 align:middle line:84%
And then when you--
like, just imagine

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:33.160 align:middle line:84%
going into a bar with your
least favorite people.

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:34.300 align:middle line:90%
You can't go in.

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:37.300 align:middle line:84%
But if the bar is filled
with your friends and family,

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:39.730 align:middle line:84%
they're not going to
allow the people that you

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:41.440 align:middle line:90%
don't like in that bar.

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:44.350 align:middle line:84%
OK, so a lot of people
are taking probiotics,

00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:46.360 align:middle line:84%
but they don't feel
better afterwards,

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:47.980 align:middle line:84%
because those
probiotics actually

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:52.840 align:middle line:84%
don't live past a certain
amount of days in your gut.

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:59.080 align:middle line:84%
But there's one little hack to
feel better, because you can

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:00.880 align:middle line:90%
get those probiotics to live.

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:02.020 align:middle line:90%
And you know what it is?

00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:07.430 align:middle line:84%
It is oxygen. And you can get
oxygen in many different ways.

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:10.930 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's actually
oxygenated waters right now.

00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And some of the best
water is called Ophora.

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:17.980 align:middle line:90%
O-P-H-O-R-A, ophorawater.com.

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:20.620 align:middle line:84%
They have stabilized
oxygen in the water.

00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:24.460 align:middle line:84%
But the best way to get
oxygen inside your gut

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:27.340 align:middle line:84%
aside from oxygenated
water is breathing.

00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:28.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:29.710 align:middle line:90%
And exercise, movement.

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:31.010 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Movement, like walking.

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:31.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Walking.

00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:33.227 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: But not
just any breathing.

00:40:33.227 --> 00:40:35.440 align:middle line:84%
Like, Wim Hof
breathing is great,

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:36.790 align:middle line:90%
but I have a breathing coach.

00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:41.210 align:middle line:84%
His name is Bryan Mirabella,
like Bryan B-R-Y-A-N.

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And he's got this class
called Breathing with Bryan.

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And he's taught me how to use
a particular organ that's kind

00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:50.290 align:middle line:90%
of like the forgotten organ.

00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:53.020 align:middle line:84%
Any mammal cannot exist
without this organ.

00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:55.150 align:middle line:84%
Like, we can exist
without our spleen.

00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:57.820 align:middle line:90%
We can exist without one kidney.

00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:02.410 align:middle line:84%
But we cannot exist
without our diaphragm.

00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:05.532 align:middle line:84%
And he teaches you how to
breathe diaphragmatically.

00:41:05.532 --> 00:41:06.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Into the diaphragm.

00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:07.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:08.170 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: And if you do that--

00:41:08.170 --> 00:41:08.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And yogic breaths.

00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: --diet,
and yogic breaths,

00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:13.450 align:middle line:84%
and diaphragmatic breathing
actually gets oxygen out

00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:17.770 align:middle line:84%
of your blood and
into the cells.

00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:20.410 align:middle line:84%
So when we're measuring our
blood with the pulse oximeter

00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:24.520 align:middle line:84%
and we say, oh, we got
98%, 99% saturation,

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:28.090 align:middle line:84%
that means all the oxygen
is not where it needs to go.

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:31.750 align:middle line:84%
It's on the blood cells
and not into the cells.

00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:33.640 align:middle line:90%
You want your oxygen to be--

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:36.190 align:middle line:84%
you want your actual
oxygen saturation

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:39.400 align:middle line:84%
to be, like, down
to 96%, not 98%.

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Because the oxygen is
actually getting into cells.

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And through his low, slow,
and deep LSD breathing,

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:52.600 align:middle line:84%
where you breathe
out with your ribs,

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:54.340 align:middle line:84%
and you breathe out
with your diaphragm.

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And he's got this great class
that I do on a daily basis.

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And he's got 300
people in this class.

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And you just do
it for once a day.

00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:09.130 align:middle line:84%
It'll start growing
the probiotics

00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:10.275 align:middle line:90%
that you take in your gut.

00:42:10.275 --> 00:42:11.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is
so fascinating.

00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:11.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Yeah.

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And you'll feel the
difference within a week.

00:42:14.110 --> 00:42:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And the difference is
people go, oh, wow.

00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:17.050 align:middle line:90%
I feel good.

00:42:17.050 --> 00:42:20.600 align:middle line:84%
But it's not feeling good just
because the cells in your body

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:21.400 align:middle line:90%
is getting air.

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:23.528 align:middle line:84%
It is because the
bacteria, the facultative--

00:42:23.528 --> 00:42:24.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They need oxygen too.

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:26.950 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: They need oxygen too.

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:31.450 align:middle line:84%
The first half of
your small intestine

00:42:31.450 --> 00:42:36.310 align:middle line:84%
has oxygen-needing probiotics,
like the lactobacilli,

00:42:36.310 --> 00:42:37.360 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:40.060 align:middle line:84%
They'll live in the
presence of no oxygen,

00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:43.210 align:middle line:84%
because they're facultative,
but when you give them oxygen,

00:42:43.210 --> 00:42:44.660 align:middle line:90%
they love it.

00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:45.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And there are keystone
species in there

00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:48.800 align:middle line:84%
that we need to
pay attention to.

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:51.760 align:middle line:90%
So breathing exercises are key.

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:54.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, lots of
info to take in here,

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:55.780 align:middle line:90%
and all very useful.

00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:58.900 align:middle line:84%
All very doable,
accessible to everyone

00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:01.630 align:middle line:84%
watching the show, which is
what I love about your work.

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:04.420 align:middle line:84%
So we need to start feeding
the guts in the ways

00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:07.030 align:middle line:84%
that we just mentioned, giving
them the right probiotics,

00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:10.690 align:middle line:84%
giving them plenty of
diverse types of fiber.

00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:14.170 align:middle line:84%
We need to breathe
so that that same--

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:16.030 align:middle line:84%
that organisms that
are feeding off of that

00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:18.350 align:middle line:84%
have oxygen enough so
that they're healthy.

00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:19.150 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:19.990 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Yes.

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:22.840 align:middle line:84%
I will have-- on
ascendedhealth.com,

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:26.650 align:middle line:84%
I will have recipes,
simple recipes for people

and how to ferment turmeric.

And also a little synopsis--

00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:37.482 align:middle line:84%
I'll do a little synopsis on
these breathing exercises.

00:43:37.482 --> 00:43:38.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's great.

00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Just to give us kind

00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:44.200 align:middle line:90%
We need to do that--

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:46.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We need to
create our own healthy gut,

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:47.535 align:middle line:90%

I mean, during this
time now, you know,

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:55.780 align:middle line:84%
we need to take a
step back and start

00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:57.980 align:middle line:84%
focusing on our
nutritional health,

00:43:57.980 --> 00:43:59.110 align:middle line:90%
especially in our schools.

00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:00.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my gosh.

00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:02.470 align:middle line:84%

would implore people

00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:04.180 align:middle line:84%
to do, all the
teachers out there,

00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:09.370 align:middle line:84%
learn about teaching children
how to increase and diversify

00:44:09.370 --> 00:44:10.930 align:middle line:90%
their gut microbiome.

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Any final
thoughts before we go?

00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:13.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: No.

00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:15.700 align:middle line:84%
But I just wanted to
thank the audience.

00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:21.610 align:middle line:10%
And, you know, the biggest
fear is fear itself.

00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:23.440 align:middle line:10%
We're learning as we go along.

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:25.220 align:middle line:90%
No one has all the answers.

00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:27.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling you,

00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Our government is doing
the best that they can do.

We're all working
in this together.

00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:37.720 align:middle line:84%
