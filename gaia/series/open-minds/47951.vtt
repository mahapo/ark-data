00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.900 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: I
think that most of us

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.810 align:middle line:10%
experience a sense of
renewal, even magic,

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.680 align:middle line:10%
during the time we spend in
nature or in our gardens.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.425 align:middle line:84%
In ancient times, it
was well understood

00:00:37.425 --> 00:00:40.370 align:middle line:84%
that the outdoors belong
to a kingdom of beings

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.970 align:middle line:84%
who were responsible for its
life force, the Devic Kingdom.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.870 align:middle line:84%
Elves, fairies, brownies,
gnomes, undines,

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.790 align:middle line:84%
and many other
invisible creatures

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.030 align:middle line:84%
are tasked with keeping
nature alive with wonder.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.140 align:middle line:84%
Linda Cooper began
tapping into this kingdom

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.390 align:middle line:84%
many years ago as a
landscape designer,

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.810 align:middle line:84%
and has been asking them about
their world for as many years.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.590 align:middle line:84%
She's with us today to take
us on a magical mystery

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.750 align:middle line:84%
tour of the unseen
world surrounding us.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm so happy to have you here.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.310 align:middle line:84%
And what a sweet, just
a sweet and magical book

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.470 align:middle line:90%
you've written.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDA SHAYLOR COOPER:
Thank you, Regina.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I just, I love it.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And when I was-- I've talked
to you quite a bit off camera

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.930 align:middle line:90%
about all of this.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And we need to go
back a little bit.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.720 align:middle line:84%
Go back to the beginning
of where you first

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.600 align:middle line:84%
started connecting
with this world,

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.860 align:middle line:84%
and then the deal you had to
broker to make this book come

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.830 align:middle line:90%
about, which is fascinating.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.240 align:middle line:10%
>>COOPER:Yes, well, I've been
interested in the fairy realm

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.850 align:middle line:10%
ever since I was a little girl.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.280 align:middle line:10%
I was born in
South Africa, and I

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.740 align:middle line:10%
used to go hide under
the bushes and feel

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.030 align:middle line:10%
like I was in fairyland.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.360 align:middle line:10%
Then when I grew up, I
kind of forgot about it.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking for
my passion in life,

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.870 align:middle line:84%
and I ended up being passionate
about being in my own garden.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.370 align:middle line:84%
I became so enamored
with the plants

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.190 align:middle line:84%
and how they combined
and all of that,

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.700 align:middle line:84%
that I ended up waking up
to the fairy realm again.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.825 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, as an adult.

00:02:07.825 --> 00:02:08.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.949 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Exactly.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:10.344 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:02:10.344 --> 00:02:12.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA:And you had a
unique experience, too,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.720 align:middle line:90%
when you were a young woman.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Where most of us are like, just
pounding away on our careers

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.960 align:middle line:84%
or child-bearing
and rearing, you

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.310 align:middle line:90%
took a break with your husband.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.480 align:middle line:84%
I thought that was so
fascinating what you ended up

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.990 align:middle line:90%
doing.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.906 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:02:25.906 --> 00:02:27.600 align:middle line:84%
Because it gave you
the space most of us

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.917 align:middle line:90%
don't have the courage to take.

00:02:28.917 --> 00:02:29.500 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Yes.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To get in
touch with all of this.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And tell us about
your grand adventure.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.100 align:middle line:90%
I love this.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.220 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Oh, it was amazing.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.370 align:middle line:84%
At around 25 years old,
I married this lovely man

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.410 align:middle line:84%
who happened to be a
lawyer, attorney type.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And after seven
years of marriage,

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.830 align:middle line:90%
he was so stressed out.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most the time,
I was in la la land,

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.650 align:middle line:90%
but he was in the courtroom.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.970 align:middle line:84%
And I just was like,
this is not fun.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Because it was like living
on the razor's edge for him.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.300 align:middle line:84%
So I got to a place where I
said, Cooper I'm out here.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, no,
don't leave me.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.570 align:middle line:84%
So I said well,
let's go traveling.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.270 align:middle line:84%
Because I had done a lot
of traveling in my life.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.990 align:middle line:84%
So he, being the first Eagle
Scout in Orange County,

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.910 align:middle line:84%
knew how to do
everything camping-wise.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.670 align:middle line:90%
I have never been a camper.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.570 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, it took us about a year.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.020 align:middle line:84%
We decided to get
in a Volkswagen bus

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.420 align:middle line:84%
that we both outfitted, and
go to the tip of South America

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.669 align:middle line:90%
and come back in one year.

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:32.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's so cool.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:33.500 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: It was amazing.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's a dream.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.595 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: And we were
in our early 30s.

00:03:35.595 --> 00:03:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And friends of ours who
were around the same age

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.220 align:middle line:90%
thought we were just nuts.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Especially him
leaving his legal practice.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:43.175 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Exactly.

00:03:43.175 --> 00:03:43.675 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:03:43.675 --> 00:03:48.660 align:middle line:84%
But it gave us the
opportunity of being retired

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.676 align:middle line:84%
at the age in our early
30s, which was amazing.

00:03:51.676 --> 00:03:53.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To have
all that energy

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.965 align:middle line:90%
and curiosity and adventure.

00:03:53.965 --> 00:03:54.250 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Yeah.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.560 align:middle line:84%
At first, we didn't
know what to do with it,

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.030 align:middle line:84%
except just figure out where
we were going every day

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.670 align:middle line:90%
and where to get food.

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.530 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I almost had
a nervous breakdown

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.670 align:middle line:90%
crossing the border in Tijuana.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.100 align:middle line:84%
I was going into a
third-world country.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.850 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, we survived it.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.370 align:middle line:84%
It took him four
months to relax.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.990 align:middle line:90%
And that was amazing.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:20.149 align:middle line:84%
But where it supported
me in this work

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:25.120 align:middle line:84%
that I have eventually come to
honor and be passionate about,

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.180 align:middle line:84%
was because we were
in so much nature.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.410 align:middle line:90%
We'd stay out in the wilderness.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.340 align:middle line:90%
We'd stay in national parks.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:37.350 align:middle line:84%
I was imprinted with the
way Mother Earth designs

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.080 align:middle line:90%
her gardens.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.040 align:middle line:84%
So when I became a garden
fairy, when we got back,

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.050 align:middle line:84%
we actually went
traveling for a year.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.132 align:middle line:84%
And then we got a bigger
vehicle because he wanted to go.

00:04:49.132 --> 00:04:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A school
bus as I recall.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: A school
bus that he outfitted.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.820 align:middle line:84%
I said, I am not living
with you in a Volkswagen

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:56.990 align:middle line:90%
bus for another year.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.570 align:middle line:90%
So we end up with a school bus.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.610 align:middle line:90%
And we outfitted it into an RV.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:04.770 align:middle line:90%
And he did all the work.

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:05.950 align:middle line:90%
We both did, actually.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.910 align:middle line:90%
But he figured it out.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.160 align:middle line:84%
And we had a 2 and
1/2 year difference,

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.860 align:middle line:84%
where we lived in our
home in Laguna Beach.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.520 align:middle line:90%
We had a grandmother's unit.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.830 align:middle line:84%
So we lived in the back
and kept our house rented.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.169 align:middle line:84%
And he got a job as
an RV mechanic at--

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:23.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What a
switch, career wise.

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:24.150 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: I know.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
wonderful, though.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.140 align:middle line:84%
He had to let go,
maybe, of some ego that

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.990 align:middle line:84%
had been attached to
the previous career.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.811 align:middle line:84%
Or he was done once he had hit
South America in the VW van

00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:32.310 align:middle line:90%
for a while.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.Yeah.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:33.280 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Exactly.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.930 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.590 align:middle line:84%
Once you're a
lawyer, you never let

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.540 align:middle line:90%
go of that part, the ego part.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.260 align:middle line:84%
Because they've had
a lot of education.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.620 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so 2 and
1/2 years later,

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.850 align:middle line:84%
I started-- in the
in between time

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.890 align:middle line:84%
is when I started--
people would ask

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.230 align:middle line:84%
me to do their gardens because
they'd walk by the garden

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.720 align:middle line:84%
that I was enthralled with,
because everything was growing

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.340 align:middle line:90%
to gigantic proportions.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.120 align:middle line:90%
And they were shimmering.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.670 align:middle line:90%
And it had beautiful scent.

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:01.920 align:middle line:90%
It was, it was fairyland.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:02.878 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very magical.

00:06:02.878 --> 00:06:04.740 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: And so
I started-- people

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.740 align:middle line:90%
asked me to do their gardens.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
wow, this is great.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:13.800 align:middle line:84%
So that's when my landscaping
business actually started.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.960 align:middle line:84%
But then 2 and 1/2
years later, we

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.150 align:middle line:90%
ended up taking our second trip.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.760 align:middle line:84%
In the second trip, we ended
up spending a major amount

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.150 align:middle line:84%
of time in the national
parks and the state

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.950 align:middle line:84%
parks of the United
States and Canada.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, I
knew what my passion was

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.570 align:middle line:84%
and what I wanted to
do when we returned.

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.130 align:middle line:84%
So I was, I'm sure,
the nature spirits

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.930 align:middle line:84%
were imprinting me and
giving me information

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.030 align:middle line:90%
on how to create fairy gardens.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:50.940 align:middle line:84%
So I, not knowing that at the
time, but when I look back,

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.150 align:middle line:90%
I see how that worked.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.990 align:middle line:84%
So when I got back, I knew that
this is what I wanted to do.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.310 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know how to
go about it, because I

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.830 align:middle line:90%
didn't go to school and learn.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.070 align:middle line:84%
But I did go to the
school of Roger's Gardens

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:07.200 align:middle line:84%
in Corona Del Mar
for three years.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.270 align:middle line:84%
They gave me a job
doing flower gardens

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:10.930 align:middle line:90%
for their existing clients.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how did the fairies
dovetail in with this work,

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.790 align:middle line:90%
then?

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:18.070 align:middle line:84%
Because your gardens
were different.

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: Well,
after the first trip

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.000 align:middle line:90%
is when I woke up spiritually.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.580 align:middle line:84%
I knew there's got
to be something

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:30.870 align:middle line:84%
beyond the material, the
garnering of material stuff.

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Because we had it all at the
age of 33, and we were nutso.

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:38.560 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, you know, there's
something's missing here.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And I hadn't really
lived a religious,

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.910 align:middle line:90%
an organized religious life.

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:46.680 align:middle line:90%
It didn't make sense to me.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.840 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, after
the first trip, I

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.050 align:middle line:84%
realized that there's
something's going on.

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And I want to find
out what it is.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:58.190 align:middle line:84%
So two of my friends, who
didn't know each other,

00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:59.635 align:middle line:84%
suggested that I
go to this woman

00:07:59.635 --> 00:08:00.950 align:middle line:90%
and get a psychic reading.

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:03.210 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, wow, what's that.

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:06.320 align:middle line:90%
So I made an appointment.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing I asked
her is do fairies exist.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And she says, "Well,
of course, my dear."

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And she goes into the
library and she brings back

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:20.830 align:middle line:84%
this book called
A True Fairy Tale

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.950 align:middle line:84%
that she'd had for
many, many years.

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And it was written
by Daphne Charters.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, it's the
best fairy information

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:31.280 align:middle line:84%
I have ever found
through all my years

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.600 align:middle line:84%
of searching for
fairy knowledge.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And Daphne had-- she was alive
like from the 1930s '40s,

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:43.270 align:middle line:90%
to the '80s.

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And she had a relationship
with the fairies in her garden.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And she wrote this
book, A True Fairy Tale,

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:54.550 align:middle line:84%
that were literally
documented information

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:59.620 align:middle line:84%
that she telepathically received
from the fairies in her garden.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And it was the fairies basically
telling the story, what they do

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:06.990 align:middle line:84%
and how they do it, and what
their daily life is like,

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.950 align:middle line:84%
and how they have relationships
and what their homes look like.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:12.340 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, does that
overlay Geoffrey Hodson's

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:16.150 align:middle line:90%
work from the 1920s?

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:19.020 align:middle line:84%
Are there some crossovers
or similarities?

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.254 align:middle line:84%
Because he's describing,
very similarly--

00:09:21.254 --> 00:09:22.670 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: Yeah
could very well be.

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:25.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Their lives, what they
look like, how they interact,

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:28.370 align:middle line:84%
the levels of intelligence
in the realms.

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:32.220 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: Yes well, chances
are-- I mean Geoffrey Hodson's

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:34.480 align:middle line:84%
book, I have that book,
too, and I love it.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.140 align:middle line:84%
But I haven't been able to read
it like I've been able to read

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:37.700 align:middle line:90%
Daphne's.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:37.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.296 align:middle line:84%
There's a different
quality to it.

00:09:39.296 --> 00:09:40.971 align:middle line:90%
I'd love to read it.

00:09:40.971 --> 00:09:41.470 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:43.690 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Well, she's passed on.

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And the original book
my teacher Gladys

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.250 align:middle line:90%
gave me was printed in the '50s.

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's just like the
most treasured thing I own.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:52.950 align:middle line:90%
And it's falling apart.

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:55.920 align:middle line:84%
But interestingly
enough, she handed

00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:02.520 align:middle line:84%
over her writings and her
experiences to a gentleman

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.590 align:middle line:90%
by the name of Michael Pilarski.

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:08.775 align:middle line:84%
And in my book, I recommend
that people get that book

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:13.880 align:middle line:84%
if they want a more in-depth
knowledge of the fairy realm.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And he got all of her writings,
which is like 3/4 more

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.960 align:middle line:90%
than the original book.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:27.359 align:middle line:84%
And it's called 40 Years With
the Fairies by Daphne Charters.

00:10:27.359 --> 00:10:27.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.670 align:middle line:90%
So I have to get that one.

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:31.990 align:middle line:90%
These books are magical.

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And these people are very
credible seers of their day.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.230 align:middle line:90%
This is not a hallucination.

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:39.030 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Exactly.

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There
are brains that are

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:41.700 align:middle line:84%
wired for seeing
into other realms.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And these people are able to
see into these other realms,

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.860 align:middle line:84%
and so they brought
back the documentation.

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:51.370 align:middle line:84%
Now for you, you were able
to feel into the other realms

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:52.510 align:middle line:90%
and receive information.

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:55.540 align:middle line:84%
But you were kind of
frustrated that, why can't, I

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:56.350 align:middle line:90%
can feel you.

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:57.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm interacting with you.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm downloading
your information.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.659 align:middle line:90%
But you couldn't see them.

00:11:00.659 --> 00:11:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: No.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so,
you brokered a deal

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.920 align:middle line:84%
when you were told to
write your fairy book.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.710 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Exactly.

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:12.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, after 25 years
of doing gardens

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:17.840 align:middle line:84%
in Orange County, California,
I kept asking god, goddess,

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:22.180 align:middle line:84%
all that is, OK, how many
more gardens do I have to do.

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:26.200 align:middle line:84%
So I finally got the
download to leave,

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.540 align:middle line:84%
because I wanted to
move to the Sedona area.

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:31.230 align:middle line:84%
I knew that this was
where I was going.

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:34.690 align:middle line:90%
And I retired.

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And I got there and
I was sitting around.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:41.050 align:middle line:84%
And the fairies came to me
and asked me to do a book.

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:45.820 align:middle line:90%
And I said no, I'm not a writer.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:47.110 align:middle line:90%
Don't want to go there.

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:49.390 align:middle line:84%
Not ready to step
on the world stage

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:51.502 align:middle line:90%
and deliver fairy information.

00:11:51.502 --> 00:11:54.204 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'd rather
keep it private.

00:11:54.204 --> 00:11:55.870 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: I didn't
really want everybody

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:58.200 align:middle line:84%
to know what goes on
in my mind, you know,

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.340 align:middle line:90%
and how I deal with fairy life.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:05.730 align:middle line:84%
So after about three times,
I finally acquiesced.

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:07.520 align:middle line:90%
I said OK fine.

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.140 align:middle line:90%
I'll make a deal with you.

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:14.290 align:middle line:84%
If you will show yourself
through the lens of my camera,

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:15.630 align:middle line:90%
I'll do that for you.

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:17.010 align:middle line:90%
I'll do the book.

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:21.710 align:middle line:84%
So honestly, the first
photo of the last garden

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:25.880 align:middle line:84%
I did in Orange County, a flying
fairy shows up with a wand.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.590 align:middle line:90%
So then I was committed.

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:29.260 align:middle line:84%
So I had to learn--
then I had to learn

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:34.490 align:middle line:84%
to be a writer, and
self-publish, and a promoter.

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:37.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's interesting
because when you're

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:40.940 align:middle line:84%
looking at images, some
of the fairy images

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.140 align:middle line:84%
that you've captured,
and some of the things

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:44.970 align:middle line:84%
you have in your
book, some of them

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:50.850 align:middle line:84%
are like light figures that are
appearing in front of water,

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:52.690 align:middle line:84%
in front of flowers
or landscapes.

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:55.520 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are
obvious like Wizard of Oz,

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.370 align:middle line:90%
like trees with faces.

00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:02.200 align:middle line:84%
Like, in Sedona for example,
those amazing gnome-like

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.930 align:middle line:84%
faces that look like gigantic,
good natured entities

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:07.270 align:middle line:90%
that are overlooking the land.

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:09.853 align:middle line:84%
And anyone who spends a lot of
time out on the land in Sedona,

00:13:09.853 --> 00:13:11.310 align:middle line:90%
you can feel these beings.

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:12.110 align:middle line:90%
You can feel them.

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:14.360 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: Well, when I
started on this quest,

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.110 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
they looked like.

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:21.920 align:middle line:84%
So what happened is,
I went into meditation

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.710 align:middle line:84%
and asked them to
please reveal themselves

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:27.510 align:middle line:90%
in the lens of my camera.

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know, I had no
clue what they looked like.

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:32.380 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I've seen orbs.

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.830 align:middle line:84%
And many of us have seen
those in our photographs.

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that that's
their natural state.

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:42.200 align:middle line:84%
So I just intuited going through
the garden where one of them

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.170 align:middle line:90%
might be.

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:46.540 align:middle line:84%
So I would take a picture
here and take a photo there.

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd go
back to my computer,

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:50.720 align:middle line:90%
put the chip into the computer.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.710 align:middle line:90%
And then I'd study them.

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly enough,
at first I didn't see them.

00:13:56.250 --> 00:14:00.980 align:middle line:84%
But then as I just kept
at it and at it and at it,

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:03.150 align:middle line:84%
they started revealing
themselves to me

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:06.330 align:middle line:84%
in the photographs, some of
which you will see today.

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And what I found is
that they're hiding

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:16.400 align:middle line:84%
in plain sight, which
is really remarkable.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:20.520 align:middle line:84%
It's just that our
visual is so linear.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:24.000 align:middle line:84%
But once you see them in
photographs, then what happens

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.450 align:middle line:84%
is your awareness expands
and then your sight expands.

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And my purpose of asking them
to show up in the photographs

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:36.400 align:middle line:84%
is because I have read
almost every single book

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:42.500 align:middle line:84%
on fairies known to womankind,
or my kind, humankind,

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:43.930 align:middle line:90%
and mankind.

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And I have never seen
a photograph of one.

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.840 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, you know,
I've seen drawings,

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:53.600 align:middle line:84%
like in Geoffrey Hodson's book,
and even in Daphne Charter's

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:59.200 align:middle line:84%
book 40 Years With the Fairies,
they've got drawings in there.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.760 align:middle line:84%
So I feel what's so
pertinent in the book

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:06.610 align:middle line:84%
that I've co-created with the
fairies is that they showed up

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:07.830 align:middle line:90%
in physicality.

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:09.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
all items of nature.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.380 align:middle line:90%
Some of them can be very dense.

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.630 align:middle line:84%
They can be the mineral
kingdom, where you simply

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:15.210 align:middle line:90%
see the face shining through.

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Or they can be as fleeting
as a little sprite that's

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.850 align:middle line:84%
at the water, when
the water is moving.

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:21.600 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Exactly.

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
is a part-- this

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.650 align:middle line:84%
is where people have
trouble with fairies.

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:28.670 align:middle line:90%
They think it's a rock.

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:30.050 align:middle line:90%
So what if it looks like a face.

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:32.180 align:middle line:84%
It's just coincidental
it looks like that.

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:33.000 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: It's not.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's just the
tree looks like a face.

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:36.610 align:middle line:90%
It's coincidental.

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's what people
who are naysayers

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:41.200 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to
fairies would say.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.460 align:middle line:84%
Is that, yeah, well you can
make a face in anything.

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:47.160 align:middle line:90%
Tell them why that isn't so.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: Well, I choose
to call them nature spirits

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:55.880 align:middle line:84%
because fairies are an aspect
of the nature spirit realm.

00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:01.570 align:middle line:84%
So if you see a rock with a face
in it, it is actually a gnome.

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And if you see an
angel in the clouds,

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:06.830 align:middle line:90%
that's considered a fairy.

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And the fairies and the gnomes,
and all of the nature spirits

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:17.210 align:middle line:84%
are an aspect, or an
evolutionary aspect

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:19.180 align:middle line:90%
of the angelic realm.

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:26.370 align:middle line:84%
So they are literally the worker
bees of the angelic realm.

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And they have an
evolution that they

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.840 align:middle line:90%
follow through divine will.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.590 align:middle line:84%
I learned a lot of
this information

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:37.920 align:middle line:84%
through Daphne Charter's work,
because the fairies actually

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.470 align:middle line:84%
were letting her know
what their job is.

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:43.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I want to
ask you to go through.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:45.210 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted you
to address that.

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:48.270 align:middle line:84%
Because someone who's
skeptical about this would say,

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:49.270 align:middle line:90%
it's a rock.

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.120 align:middle line:84%
It just happens to
look like a face.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And from the work of Hodson, of
Daphne, of yourself and others,

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:56.770 align:middle line:90%
no, that's not true.

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:58.145 align:middle line:84%
It appears that
way for a reason.

00:16:58.145 --> 00:17:00.594 align:middle line:84%
There's intelligence
that fashions everything.

00:17:00.594 --> 00:17:01.760 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: This is very true.

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.926 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's the
point that we need to make.

00:17:03.926 --> 00:17:06.710 align:middle line:84%
So I want to start out
on the fairy realm,

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:09.990 align:middle line:84%
starting with the microscopic
little fairies and the nature

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:11.720 align:middle line:84%
of them and their
evolutionary path.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll go
into the more--

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:15.150 align:middle line:84%
we'll go into the more
recognizable ones.

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:17.569 align:middle line:84%
But before we do that, you
mention in your book someone--

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:19.839 align:middle line:90%
a being called Lord Kuthumi.

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:21.460 align:middle line:90%
Who is Lord Kuthumi?

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:25.640 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: Well, in
creating this book,

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:29.570 align:middle line:84%
I got the download
on some level,

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:31.830 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with
the nature spirits

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:36.750 align:middle line:84%
in the photographs that came
through the lens of my camera.

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:40.280 align:middle line:90%
So I decided well, I'll try it.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.494 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've never really
channeled that much before.

00:17:43.494 --> 00:17:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And I thought well,
I'm just going

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:46.800 align:middle line:84%
to ask them and
see what happens.

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:47.870 align:middle line:90%
And it was amazing.

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:51.010 align:middle line:84%
I had these telepathic
communications with them.

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And on one of the
communications,

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:56.432 align:middle line:90%
it was of Pan, who is an over--

00:17:56.432 --> 00:17:57.015 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Pan.

00:17:57.015 --> 00:17:57.515 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:57.515 --> 00:17:58.120 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Pan.

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.720 align:middle line:90%
One of the demigods of nature.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And his job is to
oversee agriculture

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:10.890 align:middle line:84%
and to also oversee the herds of
animals, as in sheep and cows,

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:13.720 align:middle line:84%
to make sure they don't
overlap one another.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:18.391 align:middle line:84%
And he also communicates with
all the different nature spirit

00:18:18.391 --> 00:18:18.890 align:middle line:90%
realms.

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:24.740 align:middle line:84%
So I asked him in channeling,
or telepathic communication

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:27.230 align:middle line:90%
with him, well who do you go to.

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:29.830 align:middle line:90%
And he told me Lord Kutumi.

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And I thought-- I'd
never read that.

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:34.010 align:middle line:90%
I had never seen it anywhere.

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:37.320 align:middle line:84%
So I just trusted that
that was accurate.

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:42.110 align:middle line:84%
So Lord Kutumi,
through my exploration,

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:46.690 align:middle line:84%
is apparently the
over-lighting being

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:51.669 align:middle line:84%
that takes care of all
the nature spirits.

00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:52.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:54.260 align:middle line:84%
So and from there,
then the download

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.510 align:middle line:84%
started as to the nature
of some of these beings.

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:58.520 align:middle line:90%
And also, your research into it.

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:02.430 align:middle line:84%
So give us an idea of what the
most minute little beings there

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:03.230 align:middle line:90%
are like.

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:06.340 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll start
graduating into gnomes

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:07.721 align:middle line:90%
and elves and fairies and on.

00:19:07.721 --> 00:19:08.262 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: OK.

00:19:08.262 --> 00:19:13.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, I learned that the
Rudimes are the initial stage

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.040 align:middle line:84%
of the fairy-- I
mean, the whole nature

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:18.360 align:middle line:90%
spirit angelic evolution.

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.000 align:middle line:90%
And they are like insects.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.140 align:middle line:84%
If you look up into a blue
sky-- not into the sun,

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:26.580 align:middle line:84%
but into a blue sky-- if
you just stare up there,

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:27.549 align:middle line:90%
you'll see like--

00:19:27.549 --> 00:19:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Those
sparkling white bits.

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:30.560 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: You'll see white bits.

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And you'll also see like,
insect-like movements.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And also, when you look
on a lake, or on a river,

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:41.987 align:middle line:84%
on the ocean, and you see those
beautiful sparkles of sunlight.

00:19:41.987 --> 00:19:42.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:44.028 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: Those
are nature spirits.

00:19:44.028 --> 00:19:44.760 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that magic?

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:45.676 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:19:45.676 --> 00:19:46.530 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: I know.

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:48.040 align:middle line:90%
I just love that.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:50.880 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so they just
live a very short while.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And then they leave this
plane of demonstration

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:56.300 align:middle line:90%
and go into the etheric realm.

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:57.560 align:middle line:90%
And they go to school.

00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And then they come back as the
next evolution of nature spirit

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.360 align:middle line:90%
angelic.

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.336 align:middle line:84%
And then they live
on this plane.

00:20:06.336 --> 00:20:07.210 align:middle line:90%
And they do the work.

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:08.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they're like, I
remember reading in the book,

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.450 align:middle line:84%
they're anywhere from
an 1/8 of an inch,

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:12.585 align:middle line:84%
those little tiny sparkles
you first spoke of,

00:20:12.585 --> 00:20:15.260 align:middle line:84%
the little insect-like
ones, up to 1/2 an inch.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And then keep
growing from there.

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:16.980 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:17.604 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Yeah.

00:20:17.604 --> 00:20:22.490 align:middle line:84%
See, their job is that
they infuse energy coming

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:25.880 align:middle line:84%
from our sun, which
looks like the rainbow.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:28.800 align:middle line:84%
When we see a rainbow,
you see all these colors

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.030 align:middle line:90%
falling to earth.

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:32.940 align:middle line:84%
Well those colors are
always falling to the earth.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:38.540 align:middle line:84%
So their job is to learn
to infuse that energetic

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:41.680 align:middle line:84%
and expel it out
to their charges.

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:46.190 align:middle line:84%
So once they've mastered each
evolution of the nature spirit

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:48.910 align:middle line:84%
realm, going all the
way up to archangel,

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:52.520 align:middle line:90%
they go back to the other side.

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.680 align:middle line:84%
They go to the other side,
just like we do when we pass.

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:57.400 align:middle line:90%
We shed our physical vehicle.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.060 align:middle line:90%
We go to the other side.

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:00.620 align:middle line:90%
We go to the halls of learning.

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:09.140 align:middle line:84%
We learn our next focus of
what we desire to experience.

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:11.040 align:middle line:90%
And so, they do the same thing.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.290 align:middle line:90%
So by the time--

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:15.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As they say,
as above so below.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:15.715 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Exactly.

00:21:15.715 --> 00:21:16.315 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everything
we go through

00:21:16.315 --> 00:21:18.410 align:middle line:84%
is reflected throughout
all of nature,

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:21.326 align:middle line:84%
right up to the size
of the cosmos itself.

00:21:21.326 --> 00:21:22.450 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: That's very true.

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:23.260 align:middle line:90%
It's very true.

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:24.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So these
tiny little beings

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:25.560 align:middle line:90%
are going through this as well.

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.351 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: They go
through the same process.

00:21:27.351 --> 00:21:30.791 align:middle line:84%
And then they will
evolve to being--

00:21:30.791 --> 00:21:34.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's say
to-- the little minutes,

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:35.860 align:middle line:84%
those are tiny
little things again.

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.150 align:middle line:84%
But by the time
you get to gnomes,

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:41.061 align:middle line:90%
these are more sizable beings.

00:21:41.061 --> 00:21:41.560 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.930 align:middle line:84%
Anywhere from like six
to eighteen inches.

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: Yeah many
people have seen them.

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And they work in the earth,
you know, like in Snow White

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.610 align:middle line:90%
and her dwarfs.

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:54.950 align:middle line:84%
The dwarfs and
gnomes and trolls,

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:59.230 align:middle line:84%
they're all sort of of
the same earth matrix.

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:00.150 align:middle line:90%
Let's put it that way.

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:03.154 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Disney was apparently
quite tapped into the mystical.

00:22:03.154 --> 00:22:04.320 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: He must have been.

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:07.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When he did these
various films for animation,

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:10.312 align:middle line:84%
he was actually drawing
on-- and I know in Hodson,

00:22:10.312 --> 00:22:11.520 align:middle line:90%
I haven't read Daphne's book.

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.800 align:middle line:84%
I only have these to go by,
because I love his books.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.030 align:middle line:84%
Hodson's books about
the fairies and the way

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:18.300 align:middle line:84%
he's describing them
back in the '20s-- when

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:21.600 align:middle line:84%
he'd go into the forest and
this information would come

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:26.840 align:middle line:84%
through him-- is very similar to
what people in different lands

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.200 align:middle line:90%
characterize.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And I always found it
amusing that-- why not,

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:37.300 align:middle line:84%
we wear clothes-- that these
little brownies and dwarfs that

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:39.980 align:middle line:84%
work with the trees and
the grass and the land,

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:41.970 align:middle line:84%
and come out of the
bark, have their little--

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:43.006 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: They have
their own look.

00:22:43.006 --> 00:22:43.362 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:43.362 --> 00:22:43.987 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:43.987 --> 00:22:45.290 align:middle line:90%
They have their little coats.

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:46.540 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: They have
their own style.

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:48.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They have
their own style.

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about the
levels of consciousness,

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:52.770 align:middle line:84%
because I found that
fascinating, too.

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:56.160 align:middle line:84%
Not all of these beings are
as intelligent or conscious

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.150 align:middle line:90%
as some of the others.

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:00.420 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: No, because it's
an evolutionary process.

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:05.350 align:middle line:84%
So you know, when they're
learning to be gnomes,

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:07.830 align:middle line:84%
or when they come
here to be gnomes,

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:09.540 align:middle line:84%
they're working with
the earth elements.

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And they're bringing
the nutrients

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:14.010 align:middle line:84%
to the roots of the
trees and to the water

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:16.481 align:middle line:90%
and to the mineral kingdom.

00:23:16.481 --> 00:23:18.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the ones you have
in your book of the red rock,

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:23.330 align:middle line:84%
the huge rocks, the huge rock
face, and also the tree face,

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:24.960 align:middle line:84%
those would be
considered gnomes?

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:25.880 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: They would.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:26.380 align:middle line:90%
They would.

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:31.100 align:middle line:84%
Because they're holding the
form of the rock or the mineral

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:32.150 align:middle line:90%
kingdom.

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:34.400 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, can you imagine
that kind of a lifetime?

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.560 align:middle line:90%
How many years?

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.580 align:middle line:84%
How many millenniums
you'd be sitting

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:38.726 align:middle line:90%
there holding that energy.

00:23:38.726 --> 00:23:39.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:40.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.340 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: So that's their job.

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:44.390 align:middle line:90%
And then they evolve to fairies.

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And when they go
to the other side,

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.380 align:middle line:84%
they learn about
how to be a fairy.

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:54.900 align:middle line:84%
Then they get to choose, for the
first time in their evolution,

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.870 align:middle line:84%
about what they want to
do, meaning the focus,

00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:02.500 align:middle line:84%
whether they want to be air,
earth, fire, water fairy

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:04.870 align:middle line:90%
or, you know, nature spirit.

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:09.120 align:middle line:10%
And also, it's the first time
they learn about suffering,

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:12.870 align:middle line:10%
which I thought was very
interesting, because we,

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:16.370 align:middle line:10%
as spiritual beings
having a human experience,

00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:20.460 align:middle line:10%
we have nature
spirits supporting us.

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Fairies, there house fairies,
there are people fairies,

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:27.492 align:middle line:84%
there are river fairies, there
are garden, flower fairies.

00:24:27.492 --> 00:24:28.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have
constant support.

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:32.450 align:middle line:84%
Plus, the archangelic realm
and the angelic realm.

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:33.530 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: So yeah.

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:36.100 align:middle line:84%
So they have to experience
suffering so that they

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.670 align:middle line:90%
know about the human condition.

00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And they know about
the animal condition,

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:42.400 align:middle line:90%
because animals suffer, too.

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure, the mineral
kingdom suffers on some level

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:46.320 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:47.299 align:middle line:90%
So it's interesting.

00:24:47.299 --> 00:24:48.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And those
are depicted more

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.390 align:middle line:90%
like Tinkerbell in Peter Pan.

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:51.098 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Mm-hmm.

00:24:51.098 --> 00:24:51.987 align:middle line:90%
They are.

00:24:51.987 --> 00:24:54.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The fairies are
a little larger in size.

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:55.486 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: But they
look different.

00:24:55.486 --> 00:24:58.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as I said, I didn't
know what they look like.

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And so I have found that--
and I may have said this--

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:04.759 align:middle line:84%
they're literally
hiding in plain sight.

00:25:04.759 --> 00:25:06.300 align:middle line:84%
So once you become
aware of what they

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:09.435 align:middle line:84%
look like, you will start seeing
them, which is so exciting.

00:25:09.435 --> 00:25:12.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've captured a
couple of them in the book.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.630 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: And this is what
I was so excited about,

00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:16.690 align:middle line:84%
was to be able to have
photographs of them.

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:17.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:18.610 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: So anyway, it's--

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:19.765 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
you have-- I like what

00:25:19.765 --> 00:25:22.260 align:middle line:84%
you did, in that you had little
line drawings next to it.

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:25.230 align:middle line:84%
So for people that don't
do pattern association

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:28.690 align:middle line:84%
or their brains don't
work in an abstract way,

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:32.210 align:middle line:84%
you can look at it, then go back
and look at it again and see

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:34.690 align:middle line:84%
where that is, where
that is hiding there.

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:37.100 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER:I felt that was
absolutely necessary when

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:38.920 align:middle line:84%
showing the photographs,
because, I mean,

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.050 align:middle line:90%
I instantly see it now.

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:43.520 align:middle line:84%
As I said, at first I didn't
know what I was looking for.

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And then it was like,
wow, there it is.

00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, by
the end of the book

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:48.160 align:middle line:84%
you start, even just
reading through your book,

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:49.960 align:middle line:84%
you start seeing the
patterns much more quickly.

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:50.626 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER:Mm-hmm.

00:25:50.626 --> 00:25:51.440 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:54.770 align:middle line:84%
So some people have
difficulty even seeing things.

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:57.390 align:middle line:84%
But then the other
thing I noticed,

00:25:57.390 --> 00:25:59.780 align:middle line:84%
everybody sees
something different.

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And through the evolution
of these photographs,

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:04.630 align:middle line:84%
even though the book's
been out for a few years,

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:06.460 align:middle line:84%
I will look at these
photographs sometimes

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:08.930 align:middle line:84%
and see something I've
never seen before.

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:13.190 align:middle line:84%
So I think that they play with
us, too, and reveal themselves,

00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:14.580 align:middle line:90%
which is fascinating.

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:16.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:16.550 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:18.730 align:middle line:84%
So we were talking
about fairies.

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:21.200 align:middle line:84%
That's where a little bit
of free will comes in.

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:26.100 align:middle line:84%
And they can go into any of the
realms, again, that they wish,

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:27.910 align:middle line:90%
and start expressing themselves.

00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And they have a much longer
lifespan by this time.

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:31.600 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Exactly.

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they do.

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:39.390 align:middle line:84%
They actually stay until they've
mastered whatever the focus is.

00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And they don't necessarily have
a physical form like we do.

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:47.610 align:middle line:90%
But they can-- they showed up.

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:50.180 align:middle line:84%
They showed up in the
photographs in forms

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:53.250 align:middle line:90%
that I could associate with.

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:55.010 align:middle line:84%
I may have said
this, but I think

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:59.870 align:middle line:84%
their normal form
is like light orbs.

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:03.300 align:middle line:84%
So I asked them to show up in
ways that we could identify

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:06.190 align:middle line:84%
them, as in faces, as
in physical bodies,

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:08.220 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly enough,
when I went looking for them,

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:14.530 align:middle line:84%
I found that I was
exhausted after going

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:16.784 align:middle line:84%
through a garden
looking for fairies.

00:27:16.784 --> 00:27:18.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I thought
that was interesting.

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:20.570 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: And I thought
well, why is that.

00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:22.420 align:middle line:84%
It felt like I'd
installed the garden.

00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:25.620 align:middle line:84%
Because when I'd go and do
installations for people,

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:26.490 align:middle line:90%
physically--

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:27.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A lot of work.

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:27.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:30.120 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: I was
transforming their land,

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:34.840 align:middle line:84%
and transmuting their
whole environment

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:37.920 align:middle line:84%
through changing
their landscape.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.510 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I asked the
questions and what

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:44.010 align:middle line:84%
came to me was that the nature
spirits, to show themselves

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:49.020 align:middle line:84%
in form, have to take from our
physicality or our ectoplasm.

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow, that
makes so much sense.

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:54.220 align:middle line:84%
Because honestly,
I was exhausted

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:55.304 align:middle line:90%
after going fairy hunting.

00:27:55.304 --> 00:27:56.678 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that
they can appear

00:27:56.678 --> 00:27:59.255 align:middle line:84%
in a form that is recognizable
to you and through the camera

00:27:59.255 --> 00:27:59.420 align:middle line:90%
lens.

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:00.045 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Yeah.

00:28:00.045 --> 00:28:02.247 align:middle line:90%
Because they don't necessarily--

00:28:02.247 --> 00:28:04.455 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They have to come
from a different density.

00:28:04.455 --> 00:28:08.229 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: Exactly, in the same
dimensional reality that we do.

00:28:08.229 --> 00:28:09.770 align:middle line:84%
But for them to show
themselves, they

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:12.714 align:middle line:84%
have to pull from
our physicality.

00:28:12.714 --> 00:28:14.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well
some of them that I

00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:17.070 align:middle line:84%
find the most beautiful
in various depictions,

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:19.910 align:middle line:84%
including in one of the
photographs in your book,

00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:23.040 align:middle line:84%
are the undines,
the water spirits.

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And when I was reading
about the water spirits

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.010 align:middle line:84%
in-- I think it was this little
Fairies at Work and Play book--

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:31.450 align:middle line:84%
they're mostly
female and usually

00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:33.750 align:middle line:84%
have a flowing kind
of hair to them.

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:37.010 align:middle line:84%
But what excited me,
reading about them,

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:41.507 align:middle line:84%
is it was saying that these
particular ones were all

00:28:41.507 --> 00:28:42.280 align:middle line:90%
female.

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And they would fly up, against
the current of a waterfall,

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:48.150 align:middle line:84%
with the sun shining
on the waterfall.

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And the electromagnetics
would charge them

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:52.690 align:middle line:84%
in such a way that,
by the time they

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:55.710 align:middle line:84%
went through enough friction,
they would literally

00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:59.080 align:middle line:84%
burst into light,
back into light,

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:02.350 align:middle line:84%
and then go through the
process again after a time,

00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:05.890 align:middle line:84%
reform into more of a physical
appearance by the seer,

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:08.090 align:middle line:84%
and then just keep doing
this, charging the water,

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:11.970 align:middle line:84%
but exhilarating
themselves in the process.

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Yes.

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:16.610 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough,
in Daphne's story,

00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:20.670 align:middle line:84%
she says that the inland
water fairies, or the Nerines,

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:25.620 align:middle line:84%
are mostly female, whereas the
sea fairies are mostly male,

00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:29.250 align:middle line:84%
because they have to deal
with the intense waves

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:30.692 align:middle line:90%
and the weather conditions.

00:29:30.692 --> 00:29:31.275 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:31.275 --> 00:29:32.858 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: So I found
that fascinating.

00:29:32.858 --> 00:29:35.240 align:middle line:84%
And there again,
in what you read

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:38.330 align:middle line:84%
about how-- what
they were doing,

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:41.040 align:middle line:84%
the water fairies
going up the waterfall,

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:46.670 align:middle line:84%
they were absorbing the energy
from-- the solar energy infused

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:48.020 align:middle line:90%
with the rainbow colors.

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And they were infusing
it into the waterfall.

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:53.050 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
saw it in that way.

00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:56.200 align:middle line:84%
So it goes to show you,
that's exactly what they do.

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:56.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:59.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, I can't wait to go
under a waterfall again,

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:01.200 align:middle line:90%
knowing what I know now.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.970 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: Yeah, just
call them in and say,

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:06.890 align:middle line:84%
infuse me with all
that rainbow magic.

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about the fire fairies.

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:10.910 align:middle line:84%
You have some beautiful
imagery in your book

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:14.675 align:middle line:84%
of those elementals
that go along with fire.

00:30:14.675 --> 00:30:15.300 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Yeah.

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:19.460 align:middle line:84%
They are called
salamanders or Shallores.

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly enough, my
name is Linda Shaylor Cooper.

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:29.650 align:middle line:84%
So I realized I must have been
part of the fire fairy realm

00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:31.140 align:middle line:90%
at one point.

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:35.750 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough,
when we call in fire,

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:40.880 align:middle line:84%
we cannot get fire without
a salamander or a Shallore.

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.310 align:middle line:90%
They come into being.

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:46.120 align:middle line:84%
They spark the flame
when we light a match.

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:51.070 align:middle line:84%
It's they that come in and
create the fire for us.

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And obviously as we
know, fire gives life,

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:57.500 align:middle line:84%
and it gives warmth, but
it also is a destroyer.

00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:02.230 align:middle line:84%
So they play a very vital
role in our rebuilding

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:11.250 align:middle line:84%
of forests, in our transmuting
physicality into ether,

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:11.970 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:13.400 align:middle line:90%
And into ash.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:16.800 align:middle line:84%
So they're responsible for
the recycling of matter

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.270 align:middle line:90%
on our planet.

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And without them, we
wouldn't have heat.

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:23.420 align:middle line:90%
We wouldn't have food.

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:25.060 align:middle line:90%
We wouldn't have anything.

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:28.610 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, they are
aligned to the sunlight,

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:29.790 align:middle line:90%
which makes sense.

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:31.060 align:middle line:90%
They all are.

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:31.640 align:middle line:90%
But yeah.

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:35.240 align:middle line:84%
So every time you light a
match to build your fire,

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:38.732 align:middle line:84%
thank a salamander
or a Shallore.

00:31:38.732 --> 00:31:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
start, maybe, watching

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:44.325 align:middle line:84%
for the faces and the images
emerging from your flames.

00:31:44.325 --> 00:31:45.075 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Exactly.

00:31:45.075 --> 00:31:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, the way that I
got these photos were I

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:49.540 align:middle line:84%
just sat in front of
my wood-burning stove

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:54.050 align:middle line:84%
in the winter and just took
multiple digital shots.

00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:55.800 align:middle line:90%
Like one after the other.

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:59.927 align:middle line:84%
The ones where you, it's
like the fast moving shots.

00:31:59.927 --> 00:32:00.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:01.010 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:04.030 align:middle line:90%


00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: Anyway, that's the way
I got them, which was fabulous.

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And then the water pictures
that I have in my book

00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:11.750 align:middle line:84%
are from the waterfall
in my garden.

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:13.880 align:middle line:90%
But I asked them to show up.

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like
it doesn't matter

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:20.210 align:middle line:84%
where it is, it's your
connection with them,

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:25.800 align:middle line:84%
your intention around
what you want to create.

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:26.680 align:middle line:90%
And they'll show up.

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.140 align:middle line:90%
They're just fabulous.

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:29.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's
talk about, then,

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:33.467 align:middle line:84%
the faces in the clouds,
the fairies of the air.

00:32:33.467 --> 00:32:34.050 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Yes.

00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:37.100 align:middle line:84%
Those are commonly
referred to as the sylphs.

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And you know, we
wouldn't have weather

00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:42.500 align:middle line:84%
without all of these
nature spirits.

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:46.080 align:middle line:84%
Every single one of them,
including the earth ones.

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:49.530 align:middle line:84%
The ones in the air,
they will show themselves

00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:54.480 align:middle line:84%
as formations in the clouds,
either as angelic beings

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:58.899 align:middle line:90%
or faces, or animal shapes.

00:32:58.899 --> 00:33:00.482 align:middle line:84%
They'll also show
up as animal shapes.

00:33:00.482 --> 00:33:01.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and we're
all familiar with those.

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:03.380 align:middle line:84%
I think all of us
have seen those.

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:04.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking for a name here.

00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:08.070 align:middle line:84%
The name of the woman who
illustrated these drawings.

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:10.025 align:middle line:90%
Ethel Winn Quayle.

00:33:10.025 --> 00:33:11.470 align:middle line:90%
Ethel Winn Quayle.

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:16.610 align:middle line:84%
Because we're going to talk now
a little bit about the healing

00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:22.820 align:middle line:84%
fairies, spirits, and how
that kingdom of elementals

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:26.270 align:middle line:84%
and angelic realm works
with us from the other side.

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And she was able to, back
in the '20s and '30s,

00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:36.500 align:middle line:84%
drew these amazing images of
watching these beautiful beings

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:41.447 align:middle line:84%
utilizing light and color
in working with the ill.

00:33:41.447 --> 00:33:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: Yes there
are those fairies,

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:44.800 align:middle line:84%
remember I mentioned
the ones that

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:49.990 align:middle line:84%
have to learn-- they choose
to experience suffering--

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:54.120 align:middle line:84%
and they choose
a path of helping

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:57.170 align:middle line:84%
humans heal from
their sicknesses.

00:33:57.170 --> 00:34:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And most of us are not
even aware that they exist.

00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:04.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they will be
there no matter what.

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:09.429 align:middle line:84%
But when we consciously
choose to call them in and ask

00:34:09.429 --> 00:34:15.230 align:middle line:84%
for their help, the amount
of the energy that is infused

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:18.429 align:middle line:84%
is so much grander
and so much greater.

00:34:18.429 --> 00:34:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And one point I
want to make is, now

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:23.889 align:middle line:84%
that you've become aware
of these beings and the way

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:28.810 align:middle line:84%
they serve us, to take the
time to give gratitude and be

00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:33.580 align:middle line:84%
in joy, and thank them
for the beautiful service.

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:36.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Imagining them is
as important as seeing them.

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: And also communicating
with them telepathically.

00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:42.560 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to look silly
and speak to them out loud.

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:45.630 align:middle line:90%
But I must admit, I do.

00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:46.360 align:middle line:90%
And it's fun.

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:48.120 align:middle line:90%
They love being acknowledged.

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:49.800 align:middle line:90%
They love the gratitude.

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And they love the
co-creation with we humans.

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:56.699 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a friend
or a family member,

00:34:56.699 --> 00:34:59.860 align:middle line:84%
or you yourself are
not feeling well,

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:02.970 align:middle line:84%
call on the healing
fairies or angels.

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And they will, because
they're educated

00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:09.820 align:middle line:84%
as to the different
light frequencies

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:13.810 align:middle line:84%
and how they can support
whatever distress that we might

00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:16.680 align:middle line:84%
be in, they know
exactly which colors

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:25.670 align:middle line:84%
to transmit and to infuse in us
to harmonize our energy field.

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:28.340 align:middle line:84%
So they'll keep
infusing it until they

00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:31.987 align:middle line:84%
see our energy
fields balanced out.

00:35:31.987 --> 00:35:32.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:36.085 align:middle line:84%
And that's something,
oh gosh, maybe 25,

00:35:36.085 --> 00:35:38.780 align:middle line:84%
30 years ago, I had my first
experience of that nature

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:41.320 align:middle line:84%
that, at the time I
thought, this is weird.

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:43.050 align:middle line:90%
This is very bizarre.

00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:44.870 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting
cross-legged on the floor

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:47.780 align:middle line:84%
and it felt like someone
pushed me over from behind.

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:49.760 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, what was that.

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:51.830 align:middle line:90%
There was no one there.

00:35:51.830 --> 00:35:53.710 align:middle line:84%
But I thought, well,
I'll just flow with it.

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And I bent forward so that
my head was on the floor.

00:35:57.350 --> 00:35:57.980 align:middle line:90%
And I stayed.

00:35:57.980 --> 00:35:59.540 align:middle line:84%
I could not make
myself go back up.

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:02.970 align:middle line:84%
It's like someone was holding
me there in that pattern.

00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:05.920 align:middle line:84%
I had had a problem at that
time with my lower back

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:09.010 align:middle line:84%
and I wasn't giving
that any thought.

00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:12.900 align:middle line:84%
But after this experience,
when I finally sat back up,

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:16.540 align:middle line:84%
all of the pain in that region
was gone and had been, I guess,

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:19.090 align:middle line:84%
properly diffused through
the meridians or something.

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:20.430 align:middle line:90%
And I just said, thank you.

00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And since then, I will often
work with my unseen helpers

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:27.515 align:middle line:84%
and friends, if I'm not feeling
well before I go to bed,

00:36:27.515 --> 00:36:29.680 align:middle line:84%
I'll just say, can you
work with my frequencies.

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:32.597 align:middle line:90%
And they're amazingly efficient.

00:36:32.597 --> 00:36:33.430 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: It's true.

00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:34.250 align:middle line:90%
It's very true.

00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:37.120 align:middle line:84%
So you had the nature
spirit of yoga pushing you.

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:39.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes I had the
nature spirit of yoga.

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.110 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: Pushing
you into release.

00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:42.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you say, they work
with-- they work thought forms,

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:43.530 align:middle line:90%
our human thought forms.

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:43.820 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Yes.

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:45.361 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
how this interaction

00:36:45.361 --> 00:36:47.107 align:middle line:90%
between us and that world works.

00:36:47.107 --> 00:36:47.690 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Yes.

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:50.270 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do
is think about them.

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And call them forth
and ask for their help.

00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And they will, 100% of the time,
show up, whether you believe it

00:36:58.220 --> 00:36:58.750 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:00.530 align:middle line:84%
But if you're
asking, then there's

00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:06.325 align:middle line:84%
some fragment of a belief
that you're nurturing.

00:37:06.325 --> 00:37:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Darn, I should
have called them in.

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:09.700 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think to
call in my fairies

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:12.790 align:middle line:84%
when I got this nasty little
bug that I've been getting over.

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:15.860 align:middle line:84%
I actually never called on
them, now that I think of it.

00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Tried to use the other
elements upon the earth.

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:19.760 align:middle line:90%
What about house fairies?

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:20.380 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned them.

00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:21.790 align:middle line:84%
You kind of skipped
over that quickly.

00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:22.665 align:middle line:90%
What's a house fairy?

00:37:22.665 --> 00:37:23.410 align:middle line:90%
What's their job?

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:26.139 align:middle line:84%
And then I want to get
to the mineral kingdom.

00:37:26.139 --> 00:37:26.680 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: OK.

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:29.314 align:middle line:84%
Well, house fairies--
every one of us

00:37:29.314 --> 00:37:30.980 align:middle line:84%
that live in a house
have house fairies.

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:36.350 align:middle line:84%
It's a choice that they make
to keep the structure intact,

00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:41.470 align:middle line:84%
to keep the humans in harmony,
to keep the water flowing,

00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:42.820 align:middle line:90%
to keep the fire going.

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:45.322 align:middle line:90%
So we have them.

00:37:45.322 --> 00:37:47.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They basically
keep the home fires burning.

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:48.890 align:middle line:84%
Structurally, they
keep it going.

00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:50.973 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: But what they
like is, they like beauty.

00:37:50.973 --> 00:37:54.160 align:middle line:84%
All nature spirits love beauty,
because look around you,

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:56.920 align:middle line:84%
everything is so
beautiful that we look at.

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:59.090 align:middle line:84%
So they really
appreciate if you have

00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:02.320 align:middle line:84%
sparkly things in your house
and you acknowledge them.

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You said
they like sweets, too.

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:04.890 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: They do.

00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:08.310 align:middle line:84%
I have these little trays,
about this big, that are black.

00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And they have flowers
painted on them.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And I've got the little
miniature sets of tea cups

00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:20.610 align:middle line:84%
where I put honey and
flowers and sparkly things.

00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:21.720 align:middle line:90%
And they love that.

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:24.147 align:middle line:84%
They really appreciate it
when you acknowledge them.

00:38:24.147 --> 00:38:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So put a little
something out for the fairies.

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:27.105 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Yeah.

00:38:27.105 --> 00:38:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And also, if you have things
hanging in your window that

00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:35.180 align:middle line:84%
bring in the rainbow light, they
like that kind of thing, too.

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:37.550 align:middle line:84%
But they mostly love
to be acknowledged.

00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:40.022 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have
to worry about it,

00:38:40.022 --> 00:38:42.230 align:middle line:84%
there are fairies holding
the structure of your house

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:45.480 align:middle line:84%
together and bringing
you everything

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:47.080 align:middle line:90%
that comes in your home.

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:49.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, your home--
I have been to your home.

00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:53.680 align:middle line:84%
You invited me over to take a
look at and feel the energy,

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:56.500 align:middle line:90%
which it's an astounding place.

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:59.150 align:middle line:84%
Not only does the garden
just have this harmonious--

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:01.560 align:middle line:84%
you just want to
live in it, but you

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:05.080 align:middle line:84%
have probably the most
extensive collection

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:07.360 align:middle line:84%
of crystals and
minerals I've ever seen.

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:10.195 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have more than a
lot of stores in Sedona have.

00:39:10.195 --> 00:39:10.820 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: I do.

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:12.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And more
spectacular pieces

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:15.240 align:middle line:84%
than most of the crystal
stores in Sedona.

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Talk about that world, why
you incorporated it in the way

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:19.570 align:middle line:90%
you did.

00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:22.750 align:middle line:90%
Talk about beauty and power.

00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:26.430 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: Well, I became
aware of the mineral kingdom

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:31.540 align:middle line:84%
around the time I first
started traveling.

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:34.730 align:middle line:90%
And also woke up spiritually.

00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:37.880 align:middle line:84%
So I became absolutely
fixated on these minerals.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And my first mineral was a
geode, just a quartz geode.

00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:46.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, through the years, I
just couldn't help myself.

00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:47.360 align:middle line:90%
It was a passion.

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:51.360 align:middle line:84%
I'd go to the Tucson Gem
and Mineral Show every year.

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:53.610 align:middle line:90%
And I'd go to Quartzsite.

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:55.460 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, I lived
close enough to be

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:57.690 align:middle line:90%
able to drive to those places.

00:39:57.690 --> 00:40:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And after, like, 10 or 15
years, I had so many minerals,

00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:03.700 align:middle line:84%
I was like, what am I
doing with these things.

00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:05.140 align:middle line:90%
But I couldn't help myself.

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:07.410 align:middle line:84%
Running alongside,
creating the gardens.

00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Then I'd run to the
gem and mineral shows

00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:12.230 align:middle line:90%
and purchase them.

00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:14.160 align:middle line:84%
So I ended up having
so many that I

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:18.240 align:middle line:84%
had to try to put them
in order or something.

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:21.360 align:middle line:84%
So being a landscape
designer, I developed a way

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:24.632 align:middle line:84%
of organizing them into
what I call crystal scapes.

00:40:24.632 --> 00:40:25.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm hmm.

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:26.370 align:middle line:90%
Oh, they're beautiful.

00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:27.350 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: They are.

00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:29.440 align:middle line:90%
And they love being together.

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:31.640 align:middle line:84%
You know, like, I'd
have tall points

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:38.190 align:middle line:84%
and rough pieces together,
like a garden of minerals.

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And what I love about
them is, energetically,

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:47.080 align:middle line:84%
because they're connected to
the center of Mother Earth

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:48.220 align:middle line:90%
and to the galaxy.

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:50.020 align:middle line:90%
And they run the frequency.

00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:53.400 align:middle line:84%
So there are transmitters
and there are receivers.

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:55.540 align:middle line:84%
So when you have
them in your home,

00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:59.330 align:middle line:84%
not only are they beautiful
to look at-- and especially

00:40:59.330 --> 00:41:02.450 align:middle line:84%
if you create crystal
scapes with them--

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:05.540 align:middle line:84%
but they are literally
opening up your field

00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:10.810 align:middle line:84%
to be more receptive
to what's going

00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:13.520 align:middle line:84%
on in the galaxy and the
center of Mother Earth.

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:17.240 align:middle line:84%
So they are like a telephone
system on some level.

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:20.492 align:middle line:84%
And each mineral has
numerous nature spirits

00:41:20.492 --> 00:41:21.700 align:middle line:90%
that are holding it together.

00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And they're all in communication
with the other nature spirits.

00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:26.727 align:middle line:84%
It's like the nervous
system of Mother Earth.

00:41:26.727 --> 00:41:27.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And I even, just because I
knew I'd be seeing you here,

00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:32.710 align:middle line:84%
I grabbed one of my
favorite little pieces.

00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:35.030 align:middle line:84%
I love it, because I like
to hold it in my hand,

00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:36.570 align:middle line:90%
called celestite.

00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:39.505 align:middle line:84%
And it's this beautiful,
egg-shaped crystal

00:41:39.505 --> 00:41:42.540 align:middle line:90%
of this sky blue, gray color.

00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And you felt it a
little while ago.

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And it just has these
extraordinarily soft,

00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:50.790 align:middle line:84%
lovely energies, that almost
connect you with the cosmos

00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:52.550 align:middle line:90%
when you hold them.

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And so, that would be an
indicator of the kind of beings

00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:57.820 align:middle line:84%
that I assume that would be
associated with that stone.

00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: And this one has
a lot of water energy to it,

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:03.550 align:middle line:84%
you know, with the color
of it and the softness.

00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:04.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:04.050 --> 00:42:08.120 align:middle line:84%
So each stone-- there have been
people who have written books

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:12.782 align:middle line:84%
that describe what each
stone's physical attributes--

00:42:12.782 --> 00:42:14.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, those
are wonderful books.

00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:16.080 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER:Healing, metaphysical.

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:17.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes there
are a few of them.

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:20.350 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: I've made a
huge study of the mineral

00:42:20.350 --> 00:42:24.875 align:middle line:84%
realm and their
metaphysical potentials.

00:42:24.875 --> 00:42:26.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And do you
find, intuitively,

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:29.100 align:middle line:84%
that what you read in the
books like the Crystal Bible

00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:31.212 align:middle line:84%
and so forth are the
same thing you're

00:42:31.212 --> 00:42:32.670 align:middle line:84%
dialing into on an
intuitive level?

00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:36.110 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: Yes I've used
these minerals as tools

00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:39.370 align:middle line:84%
to support me on my
transformation of shifting

00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:42.870 align:middle line:84%
from a fear-based reality
to a love-based reality.

00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:46.830 align:middle line:84%
So I highly recommend
the mineral kingdom

00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:51.480 align:middle line:90%
to support you in this way.

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:54.321 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you use the mineral
kingdom in your nature scapes

00:42:54.321 --> 00:42:54.820 align:middle line:90%
as well?

00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:58.040 align:middle line:84%
Do you have crystals
embedded in gardens and such?

00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And how do those
kingdoms work together?

00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:04.510 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: Well, I
used to, intuitively,

00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:07.750 align:middle line:84%
when I would meet a client, if
they had someone in the home

00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:12.360 align:middle line:84%
suffering, or whatever
their issues were,

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:14.960 align:middle line:90%
I'd use the feng shui guide.

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And I would literally put small
points of clear quartz crystals

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:22.090 align:middle line:84%
in specific areas
of their gardens.

00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:25.940 align:middle line:84%
I'd put them in the
earth with my intention

00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:29.500 align:middle line:84%
around creating a
benefit for them.

00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:32.340 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't normally--
I would sometimes

00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:34.360 align:middle line:90%
let them know that I did that.

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:37.450 align:middle line:84%
But oftentimes, these
people would share with me

00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:40.820 align:middle line:84%
what's going on in their
world, whether they needed more

00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:43.100 align:middle line:84%
abundance to pay for
their garden fairy,

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:48.599 align:middle line:84%
or whether they were having
someone ill in the family.

00:43:48.599 --> 00:43:49.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And was it effective?

00:43:49.890 --> 00:43:50.473 align:middle line:90%
Is it usually?

00:43:50.473 --> 00:43:51.240 align:middle line:90%
Very.

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:51.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:53.045 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: It was amazing.

00:43:53.045 --> 00:43:53.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And that level of intuition
has kept flowing through you.

00:43:57.460 --> 00:44:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And people call you up
for garden fairy readings,

00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:05.110 align:middle line:84%
for crystal garden
fairy readings.

00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:05.860 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Exactly.

00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:07.336 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What is that like?

00:44:07.336 --> 00:44:08.919 align:middle line:84%
What do you do when
you're doing that?

00:44:08.919 --> 00:44:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: Well, I've been
blessed with the delicious

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:15.120 align:middle line:84%
invitation of doing fairy
readings in a crystal

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:16.910 align:middle line:90%
shop in Sedona.

00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And I've been doing this
for like a year and a 1/2.

00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's been an
amazing experience,

00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:27.020 align:middle line:84%
because the longer
I've done it, the more

00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:29.300 align:middle line:90%
open is my psychic gate.

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And the more information
comes through.

00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And the more I trust the
information coming through.

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:39.160 align:middle line:84%
So I do fairy readings
for people privately,

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:41.300 align:middle line:84%
or if they come
into the shop where

00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:43.170 align:middle line:90%
I work for three days a week.

00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's just been the
most delightful experience

00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:49.230 align:middle line:84%
because I get to meet the
most amazing people from all

00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:50.630 align:middle line:90%
over the world.

00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:54.857 align:middle line:84%
And I get to just go in
and hook up and deliver.

00:44:54.857 --> 00:44:55.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:58.700 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: And the
energy is so amazing.

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:00.290 align:middle line:90%
And my clients feel the energy.

00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:01.484 align:middle line:90%
And I feel the energy.

00:45:01.484 --> 00:45:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's boosted by
all the crystals surrounding

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:04.740 align:middle line:90%
you.

00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:05.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:05.989 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Exactly.

00:45:05.989 --> 00:45:12.670 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, it's my next
level of giving, of service.

00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so grateful that this
was, number one, given to me,

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:22.050 align:middle line:84%
and number two, that I am so
passionate about doing it.

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:23.219 align:middle line:90%
It's just the best.

00:45:23.219 --> 00:45:25.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I know you said
you've done over 3,000 gardens.

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And occasionally you
will still do one.

00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:30.680 align:middle line:84%
But once I manifest
a little windfall,

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:33.670 align:middle line:84%
I want you to do my horrid
looking little backyard

00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:34.450 align:middle line:90%
in Sedona.

00:45:34.450 --> 00:45:35.234 align:middle line:90%
It's just raw.

00:45:35.234 --> 00:45:35.900 align:middle line:90%
It's not horrid.

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:38.240 align:middle line:90%
It's just nature at its wildest.

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:40.700 align:middle line:84%
I can't wait to see what
that can be transformed

00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:42.930 align:middle line:84%
into, because as you
talk about, when you put

00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:45.520 align:middle line:84%
the right kind of bush, a
little butterfly bush here,

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:48.030 align:middle line:84%
a little something in
companion with that,

00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:51.150 align:middle line:84%
there's a shimmering
effect to these gardens.

00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:52.050 align:middle line:90%
They're alive.

00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:54.300 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: It would be an honor,
Regina, to work in your garden.

00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:55.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm going to do
it, I'm going to make that--

00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: And you met
me at the best time,

00:45:57.050 --> 00:45:58.630 align:middle line:84%
because I'm so
much more involved

00:45:58.630 --> 00:46:00.460 align:middle line:90%
with fairy communication now.

00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:01.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And finally, as we
wrap this up, what

00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:08.950 align:middle line:84%
is your broad message to
people who maybe, yeah,

00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:11.920 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to believe in that,
but I mean, where's the proof.

00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:13.460 align:middle line:90%
We're showing some proof.

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:15.265 align:middle line:84%
But what would you
like to say to people

00:46:15.265 --> 00:46:18.250 align:middle line:84%
as the final statement about
engaging with these realms?

00:46:18.250 --> 00:46:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: The fairies,
the angels, the animals,

00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:26.300 align:middle line:84%
the minerals, nobody is
going to achieve heaven

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:29.010 align:middle line:84%
on earth without all
of us going together.

00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:32.030 align:middle line:90%
We're a unified family or field.

00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And so, the whole point of
the fairy realm coming up

00:46:34.850 --> 00:46:40.440 align:middle line:84%
to be visible again is to
work, to co-create with us,

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:42.110 align:middle line:84%
because they know
the same thing.

00:46:42.110 --> 00:46:45.500 align:middle line:10%
They have the same agenda:
to bring heaven on earth.

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:47.170 align:middle line:10%
So they're coming out of hiding.

00:46:47.170 --> 00:46:52.370 align:middle line:10%
And our job as spiritual humans
is to shift out of the fear

00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:53.830 align:middle line:10%
and into love.

00:46:53.830 --> 00:46:56.140 align:middle line:10%
We have to release
the fear-based reality

00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:57.654 align:middle line:10%
and embrace the
love-based reality.

00:46:57.654 --> 00:46:59.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
you're a walking testimony

00:46:59.570 --> 00:47:02.290 align:middle line:84%
to your own thinking on
this, because you life

00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:05.350 align:middle line:84%
flows in a very beautiful and
harmonious manner as a result

00:47:05.350 --> 00:47:07.240 align:middle line:90%
of going into that relationship.

00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:07.990 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Exactly.

00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:09.520 align:middle line:90%
And I'm ever so grateful.

00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'm ever so grateful that
the nature spirit realm called

00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:17.787 align:middle line:84%
me to do-- to be their
representative in human form.

00:47:17.787 --> 00:47:18.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:18.370 --> 00:47:19.870 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much for your time.

00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:21.614 align:middle line:90%
And it is magical.

00:47:21.614 --> 00:47:22.780 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Thank you, Regina.

00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:24.200 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:26.380 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: In the West, we're
so harsh with ourselves

00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:28.810 align:middle line:10%
due to programming and
scientific materialism

00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:31.150 align:middle line:10%
that we won't allow
ourselves to imagine and dial

00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:33.380 align:middle line:10%
in to the magical
world around us.

00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:34.560 align:middle line:90%
We have been robbed of this.

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:37.125 align:middle line:84%
So here's our chance to
pick it back up again.

00:47:37.125 --> 00:47:38.500 align:middle line:84%
