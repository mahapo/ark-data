>>MARCO VIGATO: What really
prompted me on this search

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.200 align:middle line:84%
for Atlantis was starting
with the evidence of it,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.288 align:middle line:90%

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.660 align:middle line:90%
It's about us.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.200 align:middle line:10%
>>MARCO: These Atlanteans
were human divine hybrids.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.470 align:middle line:84%
They had a physical body, but
it was possessed, divine, highly

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.120 align:middle line:90%
spiritual souls.

literal interpretation,

of the esoteric meaning
of the spiritual truths

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.200 align:middle line:84%
that these people tried
to communicate to us.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.783 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's a sort
of a catastrophobia.

00:00:42.783 --> 00:00:43.583 align:middle line:90%
That's a term we--

00:00:43.583 --> 00:00:45.250 align:middle line:90%

for this lost civilization

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.140 align:middle line:90%
is available than back then.

what life on that magnificent

continent may have been like.

about what you've

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.430 align:middle line:10%
done here with your book--

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.780 align:middle line:10%
you're a very good writer,
wonderful research,

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.040 align:middle line:10%
amazing pictures.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.940 align:middle line:10%
You have put your body all
over the world in search

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.750 align:middle line:10%
of this story, but you
also do put together some

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.360 align:middle line:10%
of the esoteric elements of it.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.890 align:middle line:84%
I would like you--
before we even

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.885 align:middle line:84%
get going to lay
the framework of why

00:01:57.885 --> 00:02:01.170 align:middle line:84%
your deep curiosity
about Atlantis

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.225 align:middle line:84%
and how these two sides
of you come together.

00:02:04.225 --> 00:02:05.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: Yeah, I
think there are always

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.229 align:middle line:90%
two sides to the Atlantis story.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.919 align:middle line:10%
On the one hand, you have the
scientific Atlantis, the search

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.440 align:middle line:10%
for the physical
evidence of Atlantis,

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.180 align:middle line:10%
but then on the
other hand, you also

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.900 align:middle line:10%
have the esoteric Atlantis,
that of the esoteric tradition.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.030 align:middle line:10%
And for me, these
two sides, they

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.900 align:middle line:10%
were always coexisted, like
living next to each other.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.630 align:middle line:10%
What really prompted me
on the search for Atlantis

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.730 align:middle line:10%
was starting with
the evidence of it

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.338 align:middle line:10%
or the physical evidence,
of visiting, as you say,

00:02:32.338 --> 00:02:34.380 align:middle line:10%
hundreds of archeological
sites around the world.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.500 align:middle line:84%
I started getting the
picture that the way we

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.370 align:middle line:84%
are told the history, the
evolution of civilization

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.330 align:middle line:90%
was fundamentally flawed.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.740 align:middle line:84%
There was a missing episode
in our past in, our history,

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.110 align:middle line:84%
and that's how we
made the connection

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.240 align:middle line:84%
with these esoteric
traditions of Atlantis.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.110 align:middle line:84%
I really came to the conclusion
that Atlantis was really

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.990 align:middle line:84%
the missing piece
that could make sense

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.860 align:middle line:84%
of all these inexplicable,
unexplained structures

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.882 align:middle line:84%
and advanced science that
you find in ancient times

00:03:04.882 --> 00:03:06.090 align:middle line:90%
at these archeological sites.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And similar symbolism,
similar artwork but in parts

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.260 align:middle line:84%
of the world that
theoretically had no connection

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.690 align:middle line:84%
with one another at the
time, but in fact, all

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.820 align:middle line:84%
had a connection with
one big item sitting

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.420 align:middle line:84%
right in the midst of all of
these different continents

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.770 align:middle line:90%
and also cultures.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:23.700 align:middle line:90%
And it's true.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.530 align:middle line:84%
Everyone was left
scratching their head.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.440 align:middle line:84%
How did that thing
in the Yucatan

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.180 align:middle line:84%
end up with the
exact same symbol

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.020 align:middle line:84%
we saw on that piece
in Ireland for example?

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCO: Yeah.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:33.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.257 align:middle line:90%
So Atlantis is the piece?

00:03:35.257 --> 00:03:36.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCO: Absolutely, absolutely.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The missing piece?

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.377 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: I think
this is something

00:03:38.377 --> 00:03:41.940 align:middle line:84%
that is largely missing in our
modern scientific worldview.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.430 align:middle line:84%
I think there is a strong
push towards specialization,

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.920 align:middle line:84%
and we have specialists in so
many different fields, which

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:48.720 align:middle line:90%
are--

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.750 align:middle line:84%
it's a great thing
in many aspects,

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.520 align:middle line:84%
but in a field like the study
of our past, our history,

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.490 align:middle line:84%
I think one needs to
also piece together

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.530 align:middle line:90%
all these different pieces.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.410 align:middle line:84%
One needs to take a
much more holistic view

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.810 align:middle line:84%
because otherwise, one
runs the risk of not seeing

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.040 align:middle line:90%
the forest for the trees--

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's true,
and I noticed this.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.300 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed quite
a few people that

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.130 align:middle line:84%
look at the
archeological evidence

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.190 align:middle line:84%
and have devoted decades
of their life to doing so,

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.310 align:middle line:84%
but what I'm also finding
is I interview other people

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.500 align:middle line:84%
who, for example, in their
regression practices,

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.020 align:middle line:84%
their hypnotherapy practices
have people suddenly popping

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.540 align:middle line:84%
through and talking
about a time that they

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.255 align:middle line:84%
identify as Atlantis
and technology

00:04:29.255 --> 00:04:30.450 align:middle line:90%
they were using in the day.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, this, there's a lot
of this out there now.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.130 align:middle line:84%
It's not uncommon
for this to pop up

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.180 align:middle line:84%
in any random housewife's
regression right?

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.750 align:middle line:84%
And when I say housewife, I mean
someone you would kind of least

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.490 align:middle line:84%
expect to be pondering the theme
when you've got a bunch of kids

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.290 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.690 align:middle line:90%
So that's common now.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.390 align:middle line:84%
To me, the story of our
past, because it's about us,

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.840 align:middle line:84%
we forget, it's not just
about a lost continent

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.540 align:middle line:90%
of mythological proportions.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.153 align:middle line:90%
It's about us.

00:05:00.153 --> 00:05:02.070 align:middle line:84%
That's where the story
is getting interesting,

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.740 align:middle line:84%
and you and I are going to
have a story taking both

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.940 align:middle line:90%
of these elements into account.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.510 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, you
live in Mexico City now,

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.047 align:middle line:84%
but your background, you
were in Harvard Business

00:05:12.047 --> 00:05:12.880 align:middle line:90%
School at one point.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.255 align:middle line:84%
So people say,
how did you end up

00:05:14.255 --> 00:05:16.223 align:middle line:90%
from there to studying Atlantis?

00:05:16.223 --> 00:05:17.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: Yeah, I
think I've always

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.960 align:middle line:84%
had this passion for ancient
civilizations since a very

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.630 align:middle line:84%
early age, visiting
archeological sites

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.610 align:middle line:84%
throughout much of
Europe, the Middle East,

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.910 align:middle line:84%
so I've always have
had that to the side

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.960 align:middle line:84%
and more recently, particularly
also after I moved to Mexico,

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.360 align:middle line:84%
started getting very
interested in the archeology

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.180 align:middle line:84%
of Mesoamerica, Central
America, South America

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.640 align:middle line:84%
as well within many of the
archeological sites there.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
really what started

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.570 align:middle line:84%
piquing your curiosity even
more about Atlantis, right?

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: Yes, yes, I think
that curiosity about Atlantis

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.910 align:middle line:84%
started also earlier,
but that gave me

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.970 align:middle line:84%
the opportunity of really
trying to go on the field,

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.030 align:middle line:84%
looking for some of the evidence
like the physical evidence

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.830 align:middle line:90%
for that.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're
originally from Italy?

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCO: Yes, yes.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:00.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Where?

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.103 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCO: From Milan.

00:06:01.103 --> 00:06:03.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: From Milan,
OK, wonderful city.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:04.920 align:middle line:90%
I love the Duomo.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.290 align:middle line:84%
Of course, everybody
loves the Duomo there.

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:12.810 align:middle line:84%
OK, so first of all, let's begin
the story with the peopling.

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.320 align:middle line:84%
Let's assume that
Atlantis exists, existed,

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.910 align:middle line:90%
and is now under the sea.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:24.010 align:middle line:84%
You have maps of what happened
during the various phases

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.860 align:middle line:84%
of Atlantis, up through
its final destruction.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And in these maps, you'll see
how far North Atlantis reached.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.140 align:middle line:84%
To me, what's
always been curious

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:40.060 align:middle line:84%
about that was the nature of the
beings or humans that occupied

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.140 align:middle line:90%
that land at that time.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.180 align:middle line:90%
It was very different reality.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.970 align:middle line:84%
So explain to us
your understanding

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.510 align:middle line:84%
into the Hyperborean
story as well of

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:54.520 align:middle line:84%
the people that were
incarnating to that continent,

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.980 align:middle line:84%
the upper part of that
continent in particular,

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:57.820 align:middle line:90%
the northern parts.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:58.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCO: Yeah, absolutely.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.418 align:middle line:84%
So you have to
think about Atlantis

00:07:00.418 --> 00:07:02.890 align:middle line:84%
as a huge continental
landmass that

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.560 align:middle line:84%
stretched across much of
the Atlantic Ocean or even

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.330 align:middle line:90%
the North Atlantic Ocean.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.510 align:middle line:84%
So it would have had a very
broad variety of climates

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.510 align:middle line:84%
and ethnicities as well
as different people that

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:14.860 align:middle line:90%
inhabited Atlantis.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, something that is suggested
both by the esoteric tradition

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.710 align:middle line:84%
as well as by some of the
latest anthropological

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:24.370 align:middle line:84%
and scientific evidence
is that modern humans

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:27.580 align:middle line:84%
or what we consider as
anatomically modern humans may

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.600 align:middle line:84%
have first appeared on a now
sunken mid-Atlantic landmass.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.480 align:middle line:84%
So Atlantis is really
in a way the place

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.640 align:middle line:90%
of origin of all of mankind.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.993 align:middle line:84%
It's the first
place on Earth where

00:07:38.993 --> 00:07:41.410 align:middle line:84%
if you believe in the accounts
of the esoteric traditions,

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:46.360 align:middle line:84%
some higher spiritual beings
incarnating by taking bodily

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.550 align:middle line:84%
form on Atlantis,
and this is what

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:51.580 align:middle line:84%
also prompted the
cycle of physical,

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:55.540 align:middle line:84%
as well as mental and
spiritual evolution of mankind,

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.910 align:middle line:84%
eventually giving rise
to our modern humanity.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:00.850 align:middle line:84%
So I really believe and that's
what it suggests in the book

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:04.630 align:middle line:84%
that Atlantis was a true
cradle of the human race.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And from there, humanity spread
to all these other continents.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and our audience,
a lot of our audience are

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:17.350 align:middle line:84%
versed in different aspects
of Atlantean information,

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:21.940 align:middle line:84%
a knowledge of Atlantis, from
different traditions but also

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:27.160 align:middle line:84%
are versed, in as much as
anyone knows, right, in Lemuria,

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.380 align:middle line:90%
which was now--

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:32.440 align:middle line:84%
at one time, it was thought
everything was sequential.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's thought to
believe that Lemuria

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:38.215 align:middle line:84%
and the people there who
you say in early Atlantis

00:08:38.215 --> 00:08:40.345 align:middle line:84%
were a little less
substantial in nature.

00:08:40.345 --> 00:08:41.470 align:middle line:90%
We're going to get to that.

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:43.630 align:middle line:84%
The same thing
was going on there

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:48.070 align:middle line:84%
as many accounts say that
you had them existing

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:50.320 align:middle line:90%
simultaneously or concurrently.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.550 align:middle line:84%
So here you have
people that you say

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:58.270 align:middle line:84%
were advanced in their knowledge
and understanding, that

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:01.000 align:middle line:90%
were insubstantial.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.980 align:middle line:84%
When now, what do you
mean by that in the book

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.370 align:middle line:90%
when you say insubstantial?

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: Yeah, I think there is
a lot in the esoteric tradition

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:14.260 align:middle line:84%
about the idea that some
spiritual beings or entities

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:15.970 align:middle line:90%
incarnated on Earth.

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.040 align:middle line:90%
They took on a bodily form.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.260 align:middle line:84%
You can call these
entities however

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.745 align:middle line:90%
you want as an advanced soul.

00:09:21.745 --> 00:09:25.000 align:middle line:84%
It's a multidimensional being,
but there is this very strong

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.510 align:middle line:84%
suggestion, this is
something that we

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:31.780 align:middle line:90%
find since the earliest times.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.630 align:middle line:84%
So even in Plato's
account of Atlantis,

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:37.660 align:middle line:84%
it talks about this incarnation
of a divine principle.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.030 align:middle line:10%
So from the very
beginning, these

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:43.480 align:middle line:10%
Atlanteans who were sort
of human-divine beings,

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.670 align:middle line:10%
human-divine hybrids in a way.

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:48.070 align:middle line:84%
They had a physical body,
but it was possessed,

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:50.470 align:middle line:90%
divine highly spiritual souls.

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:52.870 align:middle line:84%
This is a key part of
the Atlantis narrative.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:54.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, a
key part, I mean,

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:56.830 align:middle line:84%
that's a critical
part for us today.

00:09:56.830 --> 00:10:01.150 align:middle line:84%
We are the progeny
of that, and this

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:05.590 align:middle line:84%
is what you call the conflicts
we have inside that are

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:07.960 align:middle line:90%
called having a dual nature.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.360 align:middle line:84%
You can really go
right back to that time

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:15.045 align:middle line:84%
where that new kind of hybrid
being was created of sorts.

00:10:15.045 --> 00:10:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: And I think it's always
a cyclical repetition in a way,

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:19.840 align:middle line:84%
in the same way
as Plato suggests

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:24.390 align:middle line:84%
that the original Atlanteans
were these semi-divine beings.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.230 align:middle line:84%
They were still
very much attached

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:28.150 align:middle line:84%
to their spiritual
roots, so then

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:29.770 align:middle line:84%
what happened then,
what eventually

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:33.460 align:middle line:84%
led to Atlantis' downfall
was a fall into matter,

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:35.920 align:middle line:84%
fall into materialism, which
is very similar to what

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.530 align:middle line:84%
is happening today to
our own civilization,

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:39.730 align:middle line:90%
to our own society.

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:42.560 align:middle line:84%
We're losing sight of
our spiritual origin.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.590 align:middle line:84%
So we're falling into
this materialism,

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:48.950 align:middle line:84%
like the cult of science
in a certain way.

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the reasons if not

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:55.570 align:middle line:84%
the main reasons why the
Atlantis story resonates so

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:57.145 align:middle line:90%
much with our modern audiences.

00:10:57.145 --> 00:10:58.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with you.

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.280 align:middle line:84%
There's this deep
curiosity we have.

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.005 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I think
at Gaia, whenever

00:11:02.005 --> 00:11:04.360 align:middle line:84%
they do research and kind
of look at what people

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.960 align:middle line:84%
are interested in, Atlantis
comes out almost number one

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:08.760 align:middle line:90%
most of the time.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.470 align:middle line:84%
It's way at the top of
our audience interest.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:13.030 align:middle line:90%
Why is that, right?

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:16.362 align:middle line:84%
Well, perhaps, it's because
many of the people who

00:11:16.362 --> 00:11:18.070 align:middle line:84%
are watching that,
many of the people who

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:21.740 align:middle line:84%
are researching and writing
were there in the day.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.965 align:middle line:84%
If you look at that,
where souls continue

00:11:23.965 --> 00:11:27.010 align:middle line:84%
on their own cycles of
learning, and reincarnation,

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:29.350 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, it
would make sense

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:32.410 align:middle line:84%
that we'd have an intense
curiosity about Atlantis

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:36.125 align:middle line:84%
but also something else, an
intense fear and propagation

00:11:36.125 --> 00:11:38.840 align:middle line:90%
of the story of mass extinction.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: Yeah, yeah, it's
a sort of catastrophobia.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:41.880 align:middle line:90%
That's a term--

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.138 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, catastrophobia.

00:11:43.138 --> 00:11:44.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCO: --which we find.

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And I think as we say, there
are many different explanations

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:49.130 align:middle line:90%
for that.

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:50.960 align:middle line:84%
One possibility is
that we still keep

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.470 align:middle line:84%
a sort of genetic memory
in a way of these times,

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:56.060 align:middle line:90%
so it's part of us.

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.040 align:middle line:84%
As we, our ancestors,
at least, they

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.680 align:middle line:84%
live through all these
events, and right now,

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.500 align:middle line:84%
because the circumstances,
you can call them

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.320 align:middle line:84%
the cosmic cycles,
or the point where

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:10.370 align:middle line:84%
we are in the path of human
evolution sort of mirrors

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:13.280 align:middle line:84%
the circumstances that
existed back then.

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:16.370 align:middle line:84%
We're forcing a way
to relive all of that

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:18.710 align:middle line:84%
or that triggers an
activation in a way

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:20.990 align:middle line:90%
of these genetic memories.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.840 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, there's
also the very strong suggestion

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:28.070 align:middle line:84%
in many traditions that or
a belief in reincarnation

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:30.035 align:middle line:84%
that souls that
lived at that time

00:12:30.035 --> 00:12:33.200 align:middle line:90%
are reincarnating again today.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:40.355 align:middle line:84%
So that makes me believe that
in a way, our civilization,

00:12:40.355 --> 00:12:43.730 align:middle line:84%
we're at the place, at
the time in history when

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:46.220 align:middle line:84%
we are repeating many
of the events that

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:48.090 align:middle line:90%
occurred in the Atlantean past.

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm on
the same page as you

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:55.385 align:middle line:84%
OK so as we tell this story, I
think let's begin first with,

00:12:55.385 --> 00:12:57.650 align:middle line:84%
as you said, you
had these beings.

00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the Hyperboreans

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.810 align:middle line:84%
and who they were,
what they were, what

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:04.250 align:middle line:90%
the nature of the beings were.

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:06.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: Well, in the
esoteric tradition, going back

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:08.990 align:middle line:84%
to theosophy, the
Hyperboreans were

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:12.980 align:middle line:84%
considered to be the
first human race in a way.

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:16.610 align:middle line:84%
So theosophy had this system,
this very complex system

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:18.330 align:middle line:84%
of multiple different
human race and--

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:18.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:19.610 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCO: --and have races, so--

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:20.645 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Races and--

00:13:20.645 --> 00:13:20.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCO: Right.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:21.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, uh-huh.

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: Right, so the
Hyperboreans were really

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:23.920 align:middle line:90%
the first.

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.940 align:middle line:84%
There were still
a spiritual race,

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:29.120 align:middle line:84%
meaning they did not
have a bodily form,

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:29.975 align:middle line:90%
a body necessarily.

00:13:29.975 --> 00:13:32.900 align:middle line:84%
They would be identified
as purely spiritual souls

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.690 align:middle line:84%
or multidimensional
beings, and according

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.660 align:middle line:84%
to the esoteric
tradition, they settled

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:43.533 align:middle line:84%
in a now lost northern land
that was called Hyperborea.

00:13:43.533 --> 00:13:45.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, it is particularly
interesting also

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:50.045 align:middle line:84%
for the Atlantis story because
there is actually a possibility

00:13:50.045 --> 00:13:53.810 align:middle line:84%
that this Hyperborea later
became Atlantis or was

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:58.430 align:middle line:84%
in a way, a northern Atlantis
where these incarnation first

00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:59.570 align:middle line:90%
took place.

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And then because of geological
upheavals, that originally

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:06.200 align:middle line:84%
northern polar
land was displaced

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.625 align:middle line:90%
towards the mid-Atlantic Ocean.

00:14:07.625 --> 00:14:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
I love how clear

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.290 align:middle line:84%
you are in your
articulation of this

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:14.630 align:middle line:84%
because most people
don't go this far on it.

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:17.287 align:middle line:84%
You stick to there's this
landmass, and this evidence,

00:14:17.287 --> 00:14:18.620 align:middle line:90%
and there was carving over here.

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:19.920 align:middle line:90%
I love what you do.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.260 align:middle line:84%
So taking that
story forward, you

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.290 align:middle line:84%
had then an embodiment,
as it was called,

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:27.050 align:middle line:90%
an embodiment into human form.

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:28.910 align:middle line:84%
What became the
human being, the Homo

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:31.340 align:middle line:90%
sapiens, Homo sapiens sapiens?

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:34.385 align:middle line:84%
Now, one account of that
is that those beings,

00:14:34.385 --> 00:14:39.230 align:middle line:84%
those original spiritual beings
were from, what you would call,

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:42.290 align:middle line:84%
a higher or less dense
dimension of Earth itself,

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:46.250 align:middle line:84%
coming into this lower
dimension or this physical third

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:47.960 align:middle line:90%
dimension of Earth.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.060 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Cayce talks about
the various reasons.

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.850 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has their reasons
for why these beings did it.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.560 align:middle line:90%
Some said it was adventure.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.140 align:middle line:84%
It was simply to look into
something, to experience

00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:59.210 align:middle line:90%
the senses for the first time.

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:02.270 align:middle line:84%
So we can speculate as to
why they chose to do it,

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.190 align:middle line:90%
but they chose to do it.

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:06.230 align:middle line:84%
So they came to
choose to be part

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:12.380 align:middle line:84%
of this incredibly diverse,
beautiful, physical creation,

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:14.590 align:middle line:84%
maybe not fully understanding
the implications.

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:15.390 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:17.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: Yeah,
yeah, and you have

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:19.220 align:middle line:84%
to ask yourself the
question, why it happened

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.900 align:middle line:90%
at that specific time, right.

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think the answer is
because it was at that time

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:27.710 align:middle line:84%
that a bodily form
became available

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:31.040 align:middle line:84%
for these spiritual beings
to incarnate and take

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.460 align:middle line:90%
on that bodily form.

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:38.330 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, I think the
theory of evolution, this idea

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:44.115 align:middle line:84%
that our bodies, our
like bodily form evolved

00:15:44.115 --> 00:15:45.740 align:middle line:84%
throughout millions
of millions of year

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.090 align:middle line:90%
is fundamentally correct.

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:50.630 align:middle line:84%
What these forget,
however, is that part

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:53.240 align:middle line:84%
of the process of spiritual
evolution as well.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.400 align:middle line:84%
What is it that really
triggered civilization?

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:56.630 align:middle line:90%
What makes us human?

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:58.610 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily
just our bodies.

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:01.160 align:middle line:84%
It's our mind, our
soul as well, and these

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:05.762 align:middle line:84%
is what came from
these, and according

00:16:05.762 --> 00:16:07.595 align:middle line:84%
to the esoteric tradition,
we're essentially

00:16:07.595 --> 00:16:11.990 align:middle line:84%
spiritual beings,
multidimensional beings that

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:15.860 align:middle line:84%
guided in a way also the process
of our physical evolution.

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:16.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:19.895 align:middle line:84%
And so now we have
physical beings

00:16:19.895 --> 00:16:24.440 align:middle line:84%
that are embodying these
souls with advanced knowledge.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:29.390 align:middle line:84%
But now you're down into a
complex of time, gravity,

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:35.040 align:middle line:84%
survival, even
survival, and wherever

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:39.120 align:middle line:84%
that part came in may not
have been the immediate part,

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:43.200 align:middle line:84%
but the reality is ultimately,
the human, the physical reality

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.940 align:middle line:90%
here has a time stamp on it.

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:47.730 align:middle line:84%
These other beings
did not have that.

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:50.400 align:middle line:84%
These beings were able
to live because they

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.260 align:middle line:84%
were nonphysical for vast,
vast expanses of time.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:54.900 align:middle line:84%
So now you have
these two together.

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:58.830 align:middle line:84%
In this Northern
part of Atlantis,

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:03.000 align:middle line:84%
what happened that lasted for
many, many, many thousands

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:03.930 align:middle line:90%
of years?

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:07.154 align:middle line:84%
What happened that
you can understand

00:17:07.154 --> 00:17:09.750 align:middle line:84%
from archeological
evidence that created

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:13.050 align:middle line:84%
the collapse of the first
upper part of Atlantis?

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:17.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: Well, as you see, there
were like spiritual root causes

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.130 align:middle line:84%
that had to do with the fact
that the primeval Atlanteans

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:21.435 align:middle line:90%
were dual beings.

00:17:21.435 --> 00:17:24.220 align:middle line:84%
They had this spiritual and
this physical component,

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:26.670 align:middle line:84%
so even Plato himself
suggested that the cause

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:30.420 align:middle line:84%
of the decadence of Atlantis
was a fall into materialism.

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:33.870 align:middle line:84%
In the end, the physical
aspect of these beings

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:36.270 align:middle line:84%
took the upper
hand, and this is--

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:37.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:40.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: --what caused
ultimately their downfall.

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:44.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, from a more like
archeological and geophysical

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.320 align:middle line:84%
point of view,
around that time, we

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.790 align:middle line:84%
have the first
Atlantean cataclysms.

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:52.890 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the time
around 35,000 years ago.

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:55.610 align:middle line:84%
This is confirmed by a number
of different sources, a number

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:58.050 align:middle line:84%
of different accounts
like Kingsley's

00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:02.160 align:middle line:84%
ancient chronologies, as well
as suggested it was at that time

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.240 align:middle line:84%
that a major terrestrial
upheaval occurred,

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:09.240 align:middle line:84%
which was identified for
instance in Babylonian accounts

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:13.140 align:middle line:84%
with the first Great Flood,
the first deluge, which

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:19.020 align:middle line:84%
caused the downfall of
the first Atlantean empire

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:22.470 align:middle line:84%
and trigger a new age
or a new time period

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:25.080 align:middle line:84%
in the history of the world,
which was the second Atlantean

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.406 align:middle line:90%
empire.

00:18:26.406 --> 00:18:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which there
was foreknowledge of.

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:33.070 align:middle line:84%
Again, these beings
had foreknowledge

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:38.830 align:middle line:84%
or had the capacities for even
telepathy and for precognizance

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:40.010 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:42.267 align:middle line:84%
So there were those
who left, right?

00:18:42.267 --> 00:18:43.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCO: Yeah, absolutely.

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:45.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They left, and they
took that knowledge with them.

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:49.160 align:middle line:84%
So not all was lost just
because the landmass went down.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.190 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that for a moment,

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:52.630 align:middle line:84%
and I just want
to say one thing.

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:57.310 align:middle line:84%
Even though the material
animalistic part of the mind

00:18:57.310 --> 00:19:00.730 align:middle line:84%
took over for its own
survival and started

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:06.010 align:middle line:84%
blunting the effect and the
information coming from spirit,

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:07.660 align:middle line:90%
we are still that dual nature.

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:10.735 align:middle line:84%
We just aren't letting it talk
to us so much because survival

00:19:10.735 --> 00:19:11.770 align:middle line:90%
has been at stake.

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:14.225 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what
happened when that went down,

00:19:14.225 --> 00:19:15.025 align:middle line:90%
the beings.

00:19:15.025 --> 00:19:16.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: Yeah,
absolutely, so according

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:19.000 align:middle line:84%
to the esoteric tradition,
two different factions

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.670 align:middle line:84%
developed on Atlantis
when it was still

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:24.040 align:middle line:84%
attached to the
original spiritual roots

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:26.380 align:middle line:90%
of these early Atlanteans.

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And another one that was
much more materialistic

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:35.650 align:middle line:84%
was rapidly degenerating, so
war ensued between these two

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:37.720 align:middle line:84%
factions, which
is what triggered

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:41.620 align:middle line:84%
the first mass migrations
outside of Atlantis.

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:44.480 align:middle line:84%
It was, in part, caused
by geological upheavals,

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.635 align:middle line:84%
so the first major
sinking of landmass

00:19:47.635 --> 00:19:49.930 align:middle line:84%
in the mid-Atlantic
Ocean but was also

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:52.060 align:middle line:84%
triggered by this intense
warfare between these two

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:52.860 align:middle line:90%
different factions.

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What was that
warfare like from the Vedas

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:58.240 align:middle line:84%
and other documents you've
been able to discern?

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: Well, there
is this suggestion

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:05.450 align:middle line:84%
that this warfare involved
the use of devastating weapons

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:08.200 align:middle line:84%
so what we would call today
weapons of mass destruction

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.530 align:middle line:90%
in a way.

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And so it was quite possibly
as a consequence of this war

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.505 align:middle line:84%
that the first major sinking
of Atlantis occurred.

00:20:17.505 --> 00:20:19.792 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Such as an
atomic explosion of sorts

00:20:19.792 --> 00:20:20.875 align:middle line:90%
but some other technology?

00:20:20.875 --> 00:20:24.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: Of sorts, and
there are some suggestions--

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.110 align:middle line:84%
you mentioned the
Vedas for instance,

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:29.770 align:middle line:84%
in the ancient Hindu text
that it was in fact the case

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:32.740 align:middle line:84%
that weapons of mass
destruction were employed

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:36.070 align:middle line:84%
by these different
factions so that

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:39.007 align:middle line:84%
through some sort of
technological imbalance

00:20:39.007 --> 00:20:40.465 align:middle line:84%
in a way that we
do not necessarily

00:20:40.465 --> 00:20:42.580 align:middle line:84%
understand that
actually triggered

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:44.875 align:middle line:84%
the first major
sinking of Atlantis.

00:20:44.875 --> 00:20:47.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So according to what
you've been able to discern,

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:51.550 align:middle line:90%
roughly around 35,000 years ago?

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:55.240 align:middle line:84%
Then culture started
receding itself.

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.060 align:middle line:90%
Now, let me look through this.

00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:00.360 align:middle line:84%
You call it something like this
great vast period, I think,

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.620 align:middle line:84%
after the second
destruction was it?

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Long period of time there's
nothing, can't find anything.

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:11.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, timing is always
the most difficult part

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:12.640 align:middle line:90%
of all of these things.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.660 align:middle line:84%
So what happened then at
that 35,000-year mark,

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:18.870 align:middle line:84%
after the-- first, the top
part broke off and sunk.

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:21.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have the
middle Atlantean period,

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:23.880 align:middle line:84%
which still had very
sophisticated technology

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.750 align:middle line:90%
and beautiful technology.

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:27.795 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
how that was receded.

00:21:27.795 --> 00:21:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: Yeah, so that's
the time period that

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:33.360 align:middle line:84%
lasted for over 20,000 years,
and as you say, immediately

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.910 align:middle line:84%
after the first
Atlantean cataclysm,

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:39.660 align:middle line:84%
there was sort of a hiatus
in a way in which we do not

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:41.230 align:middle line:90%
have many records.

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:46.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's as if Atlantean
civilization receded or almost

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:52.260 align:middle line:84%
went back to a stage of
much lesser development

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:53.760 align:middle line:90%
and sophistication.

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:57.540 align:middle line:84%
But it's also a time in which
Atlantean civilization spread

00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:59.250 align:middle line:90%
to other parts of the world.

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:01.620 align:middle line:84%
There is evidence
around that time,

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:05.150 align:middle line:84%
a second center
of a civilization

00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:08.670 align:middle line:84%
had developed in Central Asia,
in the region of the Gobi

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:10.890 align:middle line:84%
Desert in particular,
that was, in a way,

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:15.390 align:middle line:84%
antagonistic to the original
Atlantic or mid-Atlantic center

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:17.460 align:middle line:90%
of Atlantean civilization.

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:20.400 align:middle line:10%
And so you have these
two same factions

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:24.150 align:middle line:10%
that were responsible for the
first downfall of Atlantis,

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:30.000 align:middle line:10%
around 35,000 BC that continued,
in a way, this struggle,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.360 align:middle line:10%
this warfare but from
two different centers.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.720 align:middle line:10%
So on the one hand, you
still had an Atlantic center

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:40.470 align:middle line:10%
located on what was left
of the Atlantean landmass

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:42.150 align:middle line:10%
in the mid-Atlantic
Ocean, but then

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:44.250 align:middle line:10%
you also had a new
center of civilization

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:45.960 align:middle line:10%
established in Central Asia.

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And that this two
culture, which by the way,

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:52.290 align:middle line:84%
this Asian center was what
in the Theosophical doctrine

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:54.820 align:middle line:84%
was called the center
of Aryan humanity--

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:55.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Aryan, yes.

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:56.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: --meaning
the fifth world race.

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:58.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: India, out of
India, and yes, and--

00:22:58.500 --> 00:22:58.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCO: Correct.

00:22:58.860 --> 00:22:59.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:00.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: Correct, and
so you have to imagine,

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:02.305 align:middle line:84%
you have to picture
this struggle

00:23:02.305 --> 00:23:05.880 align:middle line:84%
between the remnants of
Atlantis, which in time, were

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.510 align:middle line:84%
also able to reestablish a new
Atlantean civilization, what

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:12.870 align:middle line:84%
they call the second Atlantean
empire and this new Aryan

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:17.040 align:middle line:84%
humanity that detached itself
from the main body of Atlantean

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.950 align:middle line:84%
humanity to give rise to
a wholly new civilization

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:21.360 align:middle line:90%
in Central Asia.

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.282 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now, let's
for just one moment,

00:23:23.282 --> 00:23:24.990 align:middle line:84%
we're going to just
go back and finish up

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:27.210 align:middle line:84%
the story of the North because
we went there and didn't finish

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:28.010 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And that is the more spiritually
oriented, highly knowledgeable,

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.470 align:middle line:84%
understanding laws of
nature, harmony with nature,

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:39.480 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, those people were
able to emigrate elsewhere,

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:43.680 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of this happened on
the Western coast of the UK,

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:47.880 align:middle line:84%
and even going up somewhat
into Scandinavia, right?

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:52.590 align:middle line:84%
So that knowledge was
kept, and in some circles,

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:54.670 align:middle line:84%
in Freddy Silva's
work, for example,

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:58.020 align:middle line:84%
is called the Tuatha de Danaan,
who ultimately later became

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:02.010 align:middle line:84%
the druids as some knowledge is
lost but still much retained.

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:04.935 align:middle line:84%
So you have that knowledge
still going both directions,

00:24:04.935 --> 00:24:07.425 align:middle line:84%
and being maintained,
and probably

00:24:07.425 --> 00:24:10.000 align:middle line:84%
taken to many other places
around the world as well,

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:10.800 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.900 align:middle line:90%
So that knowledge still exists.

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:16.080 align:middle line:84%
Now we have the re-establishment
from the remnants.

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:22.200 align:middle line:84%
Technology has been in a
sense has overtaken wisdom

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.170 align:middle line:84%
and spirituality by this
time, too, in a sense,

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:28.980 align:middle line:84%
and you go into this
destruction at 35,000 years.

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, it starts reestablishing
with some of those higher

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:33.150 align:middle line:90%
principles again, right?

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:37.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: Yes, so there is the
suggestion that at that time,

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.820 align:middle line:84%
you had once again the
incarnation of some spiritual

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:40.620 align:middle line:90%
beings--

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:41.537 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Same beings.

00:24:41.537 --> 00:24:43.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: --who, they were
called some spiritual guides

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:45.000 align:middle line:90%
of mankind.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.640 align:middle line:84%
In the Hindu tradition
for instance,

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:52.680 align:middle line:84%
the manu of that age that
preincarnated on Earth in order

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:56.220 align:middle line:84%
to help guide humanity
towards the path of survival,

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:58.770 align:middle line:84%
spiritual evolution
after the cataclysm

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:00.380 align:middle line:90%
or the first Atlantean period.

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:01.880 align:middle line:84%
But then you see
again a repetition.

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:04.398 align:middle line:84%
So you see how history
is cyclical again--

00:25:04.398 --> 00:25:05.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
same kind of beings

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:09.720 align:middle line:84%
described the same way show up
all over, all over the planet

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:10.830 align:middle line:90%
after cataclysm.

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And indigenous peoples
all over the world

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:16.810 align:middle line:84%
talk about these beings, these
magnificent, advanced beings

00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:19.060 align:middle line:84%
who came and helped them get
back on their feet again.

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:21.210 align:middle line:84%
So the same thing was
happening in Atlantis,

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:27.420 align:middle line:84%
and so now what kind of life
from what you've seen emerges?

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
share with you a piece

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:31.950 align:middle line:84%
from a couple of regressions
with Dolores Cannon

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:34.290 align:middle line:84%
and what I saw from
that era, which

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:37.920 align:middle line:84%
was at the very, very, very,
very end, very unpleasant end,

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.375 align:middle line:90%
I might add.

00:25:39.375 --> 00:25:42.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: Yeah, so it
was towards the end

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.005 align:middle line:84%
of that second Atlantean
period that another cataclysm

00:25:46.005 --> 00:25:47.410 align:middle line:90%
occurred.

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:51.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, in this specific case,
and we're talking about a time

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:55.870 align:middle line:84%
around 13,000 years
ago, around 11,000 BC,

00:25:55.870 --> 00:26:01.210 align:middle line:84%
there is a suggestion that this
cataclysm had a cosmic origin.

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:03.175 align:middle line:84%
It was probably the
impact of a comet,

00:26:03.175 --> 00:26:06.340 align:middle line:84%
like something completely
beyond the control of the people

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:08.740 align:middle line:90%
that existed at the time.

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:13.840 align:middle line:84%
But it had the effect on
one hand of once again,

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:16.540 align:middle line:84%
causing this
civilization to collapse,

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:21.460 align:middle line:84%
to go back to a much
lesser stage of evolution

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:23.140 align:middle line:90%
and sophistication.

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:26.975 align:middle line:84%
It caused a further exodus,
a migration from Atlantis

00:26:26.975 --> 00:26:27.775 align:middle line:90%
to other lands.

00:26:27.775 --> 00:26:28.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, large exodus.

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCO: Yes.

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because the
destabilization of the land

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:33.910 align:middle line:84%
was taking place over such
a long period of time,

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:36.910 align:middle line:84%
it was known this was
coming, this seismic

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:39.310 align:middle line:84%
or whatever activity
you want to call it.

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:41.140 align:middle line:84%
You diagram it in
the book actually.

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:42.730 align:middle line:84%
So what I've been
trying to figure out

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:46.330 align:middle line:84%
all these years is after
having this experience, totally

00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:49.330 align:middle line:84%
unexpected regression
experience with Dolores Cannon,

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:51.280 align:middle line:84%
I ended up right in
the middle of that.

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And I was one who was still
among those who could work well

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.570 align:middle line:84%
with the mind, and
we were working

00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:58.570 align:middle line:84%
with the mind and our
energies to subdue

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:02.460 align:middle line:84%
the mounting disruption
that was going to happen.

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.230 align:middle line:90%
And everyone knew of it.

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:06.180 align:middle line:90%
This wasn't a secret.

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.870 align:middle line:90%
Many had already left.

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:09.570 align:middle line:84%
Some were still
working with it because

00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:13.920 align:middle line:84%
of the concern for the loss
of knowledge, technology,

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:17.290 align:middle line:84%
and everything once again
because that's painful, right?

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And what we were
not aware of is--

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:22.630 align:middle line:84%
we'd only heard
rumors of the ones

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:25.000 align:middle line:84%
in the city who were working
with the high technology.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.570 align:middle line:84%
This is pyramidal,
crystalline, and other types

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:30.970 align:middle line:84%
of very advanced
focused technologies,

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:32.590 align:middle line:84%
and our understanding
was they were

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:35.350 align:middle line:84%
trying to play god and mess
things up, and it blew.

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:38.727 align:middle line:84%
When I was able to speak
with my own group of beings

00:27:38.727 --> 00:27:40.810 align:middle line:84%
later on in that, they
said, no, you misunderstood

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:42.148 align:middle line:90%
because you were myopic.

00:27:42.148 --> 00:27:44.440 align:middle line:84%
Doing just what you did, you
didn't have full knowledge

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:45.820 align:middle line:90%
of what they were doing.

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:48.580 align:middle line:84%
They were doing the same
thing but with technology.

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:51.235 align:middle line:84%
I think this has
been misinterpreted

00:27:51.235 --> 00:27:55.060 align:middle line:84%
and misunderstood
historically unless I'm

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:58.563 align:middle line:84%
in the wrong destruction,
unless it was the first,

00:27:58.563 --> 00:27:59.980 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know
which one it was.

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:01.570 align:middle line:84%
I've never known
which one it was.

00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:03.490 align:middle line:84%
I just know what Earth
life was like then,

00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:06.640 align:middle line:84%
which was pretty
sophisticated and magnificent

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:08.990 align:middle line:90%
on many, many levels.

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:12.940 align:middle line:84%
But when that went down, these
other people with technology

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:15.970 align:middle line:84%
were trying to subdue
it the same as we were.

00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:20.350 align:middle line:84%
No one wanted to see this
land mass loss again.

00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And what I also
noticed is that there

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:25.330 align:middle line:90%
were beings from other places.

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:29.380 align:middle line:84%
You could see little
spaceships in near atmosphere.

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:31.570 align:middle line:84%
They were working
with humans, too.

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:33.640 align:middle line:84%
Everyone was trying
to stop this,

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.890 align:middle line:84%
and there was nothing
that was going to stop it.

00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And so with the ramping
up of that technology that

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.360 align:middle line:84%
was used from the city center,
it became a very violent end,

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:48.150 align:middle line:84%
and I remember
everything blowing.

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:48.950 align:middle line:90%
It was horrible.

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:53.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, fish were boiling, and
the thing I said to Dolores,

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:57.300 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, we're going to
sleep for a very long time.

00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:58.820 align:middle line:90%
We've lost everything.

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's the
part you write about

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:03.530 align:middle line:84%
in the book is this long
fallow period, right?

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:04.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCO: Yeah.

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:07.700 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it really sounds like it
was almost a second chance that

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:11.360 align:middle line:84%
was given to mankind after
the first Atlantean cataclysm,

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:12.680 align:middle line:90%
after this time of decadence.

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:14.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
did well with it.

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:16.640 align:middle line:84%
They were using technologies
in a beautiful way.

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:19.160 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't all corrupt,
but then again, those

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.010 align:middle line:90%
are from my prospectus.

00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:22.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: Yeah, and
I think this is

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:26.870 align:middle line:84%
a pre- what happened during this
second Atlantean period, when

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:29.690 align:middle line:84%
Atlantean civilization
itself transitioned

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:32.390 align:middle line:90%
from a mastery of water.

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:34.640 align:middle line:84%
In the esoteric tradition
it's called the life force,

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.280 align:middle line:84%
so certain things that
came naturally, in a way,

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.725 align:middle line:84%
to the Atlanteans because
of their spiritual

00:29:39.725 --> 00:29:41.840 align:middle line:84%
and mental faculties
in earlier times

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.390 align:middle line:90%
that did not require technology.

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:47.030 align:middle line:84%
It transitioned towards
a technological type

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:50.780 align:middle line:84%
of civilization, and technology
was almost a development

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:54.252 align:middle line:84%
that was required in order to
compensate for the loss of some

00:29:54.252 --> 00:29:55.460 align:middle line:90%
of these spiritual faculties.

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:57.835 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly, and even
though it was high technology

00:29:57.835 --> 00:30:00.320 align:middle line:84%
and even though it was used
for beautiful purpose in terms

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:02.960 align:middle line:84%
of healing, and growing,
and so forth, that

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:04.610 align:middle line:84%
is step down from
what was originally

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:08.180 align:middle line:84%
done where you could just use
the mind, pretty much used

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:13.040 align:middle line:84%
the mind, and work with soils,
and work with elements, and so

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.090 align:middle line:90%
forth with mind only.

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:17.510 align:middle line:84%
So here we have it stepped
down, still lovely, way

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:19.440 align:middle line:90%
beyond where we are now.

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:21.240 align:middle line:90%
So what do you think?

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.790 align:middle line:90%
What was the lesson then?

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:27.230 align:middle line:84%
Was it still trying to
assist humanity or suggest

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:29.675 align:middle line:84%
to humanity, let go
of the technology

00:30:29.675 --> 00:30:32.930 align:middle line:84%
and go back into
the true knowledge?

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that's what was
attempting to express itself?

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:38.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: I think
the same forces are

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:41.660 align:middle line:84%
the caused the first destruction
in the first fall of Atlantis,

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:44.465 align:middle line:84%
so they were still
at work in a way.

00:30:44.465 --> 00:30:49.640 align:middle line:84%
So for a time, yes, Atlantean
civilization did resurrect.

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:53.120 align:middle line:84%
In a way, it also went back
to the original purity,

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:58.520 align:middle line:84%
but then the same forces, same
materialistic forces came back.

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:02.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's what pre-led
towards the second cataclysm,

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:05.290 align:middle line:90%
the second fall of Atlantis.

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:08.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so that was then
about 13,000 years ago, right?

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:09.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCO: Yes.

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:14.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So then the
fall or the Great Deluge

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:19.068 align:middle line:84%
that Plato recounted in
his day, when was that?

00:31:19.068 --> 00:31:20.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCO: Well, there were many.

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:23.885 align:middle line:84%
Plato himself says there were
many destructions of humanity

00:31:23.885 --> 00:31:26.790 align:middle line:84%
by fire and water, will
you remember the last one?

00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:28.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fire and water, yes.

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:31.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: The cataclysm
that Plato alludes to

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:35.060 align:middle line:84%
is probably this last Atlantean
cataclysm that ended up

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:38.975 align:middle line:84%
with the sinking of the largest
portion of the Atlantean

00:31:38.975 --> 00:31:41.240 align:middle line:84%
landmass, but there
were certainly others

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:44.030 align:middle line:84%
before that, which are
recorded in a number

00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:47.580 align:middle line:84%
of both esoteric and
historical traditions.

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:50.480 align:middle line:84%
So what Plato describes
is a very specific point

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:53.300 align:middle line:84%
in time in human
history, which is

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:55.850 align:middle line:84%
a call that use a more
scientific language,

00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:57.830 align:middle line:90%
the Younger Dryas cataclysm.

00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:59.000 align:middle line:90%
So this is a time--

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 11,600 years ago.

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:01.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCO: Right, correct.

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:05.000 align:middle line:84%
This is a time around at
the end of the last Ice Age,

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.710 align:middle line:84%
and now, interestingly,
scientists

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:08.690 align:middle line:84%
are coming up with
the idea that this

00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:10.730 align:middle line:90%
was in fact a dual cataclysm.

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:13.460 align:middle line:84%
There was probably an
initial first cometary impact

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:15.950 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning of
the Younger Dryas,

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:20.420 align:middle line:84%
around 13,000 years ago, which
was followed by a second impact

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:25.190 align:middle line:84%
around 1,500 years later,
which remarkably points

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:28.970 align:middle line:84%
to the same date given
by Plato around 9,600

00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:32.840 align:middle line:84%
BC for the final sinking
and destruction of Atlantis.

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:35.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now,
again, at this time,

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:39.470 align:middle line:84%
there were people who were able
to get out, take knowledge out.

00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:41.750 align:middle line:90%
I mean, technology was lost.

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:44.480 align:middle line:84%
Basically, technology
was lost except for those

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:48.510 align:middle line:84%
who still had the spiritual,
mental technologies.

00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And so we had
civilization developing.

00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:54.857 align:middle line:84%
You write here, at
that time, 16,000 BC

00:32:54.857 --> 00:32:57.440 align:middle line:84%
seemed to have been an important
time in "development," right?

00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:00.980 align:middle line:10%
And you have here, in
Egypt, in South America,

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:05.600 align:middle line:10%
but also Sardinia where we went
on an adventure here at Gaia,

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:10.280 align:middle line:10%
and looking at the Nuraghe
and such of that area,

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:17.020 align:middle line:10%
and psychically tuning
in to what had happened

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:18.470 align:middle line:10%
in these places at that time.

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:22.030 align:middle line:84%
So tell us what about 1,600
BC was really important

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:25.787 align:middle line:84%
for distribution of that
knowledge and these people.

00:33:25.787 --> 00:33:27.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: Yeah, that
actually, when you

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:29.170 align:middle line:84%
think about the
fall of Atlantis,

00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:31.540 align:middle line:84%
this was not a point
in time episode.

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:32.980 align:middle line:90%
It took thousands of years.

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:33.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Long,
long period of time.

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:35.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: There was a
process during which

00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:38.800 align:middle line:84%
Atlantean civilization and
culture spread to other lands

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:39.950 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:41.950 align:middle line:84%
So towards that time,
Atlantean civilization

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:46.210 align:middle line:84%
did, in a way, become almost
like a colonial type of society

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:47.585 align:middle line:84%
because of geological
instability

00:33:47.585 --> 00:33:48.668 align:middle line:90%
in the mid-Atlantic ocean.

00:33:48.668 --> 00:33:50.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
very unstable, yes.

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:52.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: Massive
migrations of people

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:56.110 align:middle line:84%
were triggered from that
mid-Atlantic homeland

00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:58.030 align:middle line:84%
towards both the old
world and the new world,

00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:00.670 align:middle line:84%
where civilizations
were established,

00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:03.250 align:middle line:84%
modeled on that of the
motherland, the model

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:04.630 align:middle line:90%
on the civilization of Atlantis.

00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:07.330 align:middle line:84%
So that's the time
when the first step

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:09.760 align:middle line:84%
pre-dynastic
Egyptian civilization

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:13.480 align:middle line:84%
appeared in Egypt, some of the
earliest megalithic monuments

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:16.210 align:middle line:84%
in the European continent
that were constructed.

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:18.765 align:middle line:84%
You have a great surge of
construction in South America,

00:34:18.765 --> 00:34:19.940 align:middle line:90%
for instance.

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:22.315 align:middle line:84%
Think of these incredible
megalithic ruins

00:34:22.315 --> 00:34:23.830 align:middle line:90%
of Peru and Bolivia.

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:26.492 align:middle line:84%
These are all relics from that
time, from what we call the--

00:34:26.492 --> 00:34:27.909 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
pyramids everywhere.

00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:30.117 align:middle line:84%
It could be a ziggurat,
which has a different purpose

00:34:30.117 --> 00:34:31.060 align:middle line:90%
than a smooth side.

00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:33.310 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere, whether it's
in Egypt or South America,

00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:35.905 align:middle line:84%
you can have smooth sides,
ziggurats, stepped pyramids,

00:34:35.905 --> 00:34:36.920 align:middle line:90%
and the like.

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.850 align:middle line:84%
So this was that same
technology from Atlantis

00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:43.978 align:middle line:84%
that had been brought
into these other regions

00:34:43.978 --> 00:34:45.145 align:middle line:90%
through those who emigrated.

00:34:45.145 --> 00:34:48.359 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: Yes, yes, so they
spread their technology,

00:34:48.359 --> 00:34:50.980 align:middle line:84%
their science, and
that's the reason

00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:55.130 align:middle line:84%
why you find the same symbols
pretty much all over the world,

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:56.489 align:middle line:90%
so starting from the pyramid.

00:34:56.489 --> 00:34:59.860 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that
the pyramid, it

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:03.940 align:middle line:84%
might originally have had some
functional purpose, right.

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:07.000 align:middle line:84%
But then it became a symbol as
well of the cosmic mountain,

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.950 align:middle line:84%
and so that's the
reason why we find it

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:11.172 align:middle line:84%
in so many different
places around the world.

00:35:11.172 --> 00:35:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And many of these
monuments were actually

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:17.320 align:middle line:84%
built on very specific points
on the Earth's surface,

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:23.920 align:middle line:84%
characterized by certain
levels of terrestrial energy,

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.295 align:middle line:84%
so particular
hotspots of activity--

00:35:26.295 --> 00:35:27.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Ley
lines and so forth.

00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:30.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: Yes, these type
of things like ley lines,

00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:31.755 align:middle line:90%
telluric current--

00:35:31.755 --> 00:35:32.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Telluric, yes.

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:34.868 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: --and so you have this
idea that these people were

00:35:34.868 --> 00:35:41.530 align:middle line:84%
really engaged in creating a
world grid of ancient sites,

00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:46.360 align:middle line:84%
locating pyramids and megalithic
monuments, specific places,

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:48.940 align:middle line:84%
specific points of
the Earth's surface

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:54.130 align:middle line:84%
in order to produce some
sorts of effects that

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:56.590 align:middle line:84%
have to do with the
advancement of consciousness,

00:35:56.590 --> 00:35:58.400 align:middle line:90%
the advancement of knowledge.

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:01.180 align:middle line:84%
There's also the suggestion
that this global network

00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:04.997 align:middle line:84%
may have served the purpose
of generating energy as well.

00:36:04.997 --> 00:36:07.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going to bring
that up next, absolutely,

00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:09.520 align:middle line:84%
energy generators,
and many, many people

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:12.100 align:middle line:84%
who've been in regressed states
have seen that, that these

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:13.150 align:middle line:90%
were energy generators.

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:14.692 align:middle line:84%
And for the very
earliest people that

00:36:14.692 --> 00:36:17.740 align:middle line:84%
used them, perhaps
generating their own personal

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:21.590 align:middle line:84%
or sustaining their own
personal energies as well.

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:23.627 align:middle line:84%
And so here you
have things, then

00:36:23.627 --> 00:36:25.210 align:middle line:84%
things start getting
bastardized where

00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:27.700 align:middle line:84%
you start building a
pyramid because hey,

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:30.490 align:middle line:84%
they were in the hot spots of
the great cultures of the day.

00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:33.310 align:middle line:84%
But it reminds me of more
like the Mayan cultures

00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:37.180 align:middle line:84%
where you have these
awful blood sacrifices

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:40.750 align:middle line:84%
at the feet of these amazing
pyramids, who were not

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:42.670 align:middle line:90%
necessarily built by them.

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:44.590 align:middle line:84%
They were built far,
far, far in advance,

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:47.740 align:middle line:84%
and all they have is a distant
memory of the powerful beings

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:48.730 align:middle line:90%
that once occupied it.

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And then it descends
into something

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:53.200 align:middle line:84%
as barbaric as
sacrificing someone

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.480 align:middle line:84%
to serve that
intelligence force,

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:57.890 align:middle line:84%
so this is a lowering
of consciousness.

00:36:57.890 --> 00:37:00.895 align:middle line:84%
So how does that work with all
of this, the waves of rising

00:37:00.895 --> 00:37:02.020 align:middle line:90%
and lowering consciousness?

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:04.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: Well, the purpose
of many of these structures

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:06.610 align:middle line:84%
was no longer
understood, and that's

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:10.090 align:middle line:84%
why some practices
like human sacrifices

00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:12.400 align:middle line:90%
just degenerated over time.

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.080 align:middle line:84%
It was because, for
instance, if you

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:16.810 align:middle line:84%
think about the Maya
pyramids and many

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:21.340 align:middle line:84%
of these structures clearly
built in specific hotspots,

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:23.560 align:middle line:84%
there might have
been still a memory

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:27.400 align:middle line:84%
of some of the
scientific practices that

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.110 align:middle line:90%
were performed at these places.

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:31.840 align:middle line:84%
They might have had to do
with the release of energy

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:35.080 align:middle line:84%
at these spots, but in
the degenerated practices

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:39.280 align:middle line:84%
of later cultures that took
the form of human sacrifice, so

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:41.335 align:middle line:84%
the real meaning of
many of these rituals

00:37:41.335 --> 00:37:43.825 align:middle line:84%
or operations that were
conducted at these places,

00:37:43.825 --> 00:37:44.625 align:middle line:90%
it was lost.

00:37:44.625 --> 00:37:46.375 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's why
it gets so confusing,

00:37:46.375 --> 00:37:48.880 align:middle line:84%
when people are reading
history, the Mayans built

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.640 align:middle line:84%
these pyramids, and they have
them with blood dripping down

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:52.780 align:middle line:90%
the sides of their altars.

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, that doesn't
quite make sense to me,

00:37:57.250 --> 00:37:58.750 align:middle line:90%
that those people built those.

00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:00.322 align:middle line:84%
And this is true
all over the world.

00:38:00.322 --> 00:38:01.780 align:middle line:84%
We have these same
kinds of stories

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:04.150 align:middle line:84%
as we have a degeneration
of knowledge, memory,

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:05.450 align:middle line:90%
and consciousness.

00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'd like to ask you
now, the pictures in your book

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:09.560 align:middle line:90%
are amazing.

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:10.852 align:middle line:90%
You've been all over the place.

00:38:10.852 --> 00:38:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And you took some
fabulous photos,

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:15.570 align:middle line:84%
and you're in them, a lot of
selfies at a long distance.

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:19.280 align:middle line:84%
So let me ask you, with this
incredible curiosity of yours,

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:21.170 align:middle line:84%
and I would even
speculate-- it's not

00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:23.630 align:middle line:84%
for me to do that-- you may
well very well have been one

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:26.210 align:middle line:84%
of those people there long ago
that are trying to bring back

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:31.130 align:middle line:84%
an understanding of what can
be and what has gone wrong.

00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Which of the places you've
been to blew your mind

00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:36.860 align:middle line:84%
and was far more than you ever
expected when you went there?

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:41.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: I think I had this very
strong feeling of connection

00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:42.650 align:middle line:90%
in Egypt.

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:45.590 align:middle line:84%
Again, I think there
is something special

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:50.540 align:middle line:84%
about the temples of Egypt
or the pyramids there.

00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:54.200 align:middle line:84%
You can still feel the
presence in a way of that very

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:55.850 align:middle line:90%
ancient civilization.

00:38:55.850 --> 00:38:59.330 align:middle line:84%
They have these very strong
feeling, particularly

00:38:59.330 --> 00:39:03.410 align:middle line:84%
at Luxor in Egypt like
this magnificent temple

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:06.740 align:middle line:84%
in ancient Thebes
because not only

00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:10.625 align:middle line:84%
there is evidence that many
of the temples, the megaliths

00:39:10.625 --> 00:39:13.890 align:middle line:84%
there may actually date back
to much earlier than the dates

00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:14.690 align:middle line:90%
at the beginning--

00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:16.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, Robert
Schoch said privately--

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:18.350 align:middle line:84%
I probably shouldn't say it
because then it's not private,

00:39:18.350 --> 00:39:19.150 align:middle line:90%
but--

00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:21.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he has said
privately, he can't publicly

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:23.750 align:middle line:84%
speak of what his
first impressions

00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:27.740 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Pyramid were,
but he told another person

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:29.300 align:middle line:84%
that his first
impression is this

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:30.680 align:middle line:90%
could be 100,000 years old.

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:32.430 align:middle line:84%
But then you have to
go find the evidence,

00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:34.130 align:middle line:84%
and you have to stay within
the framework of that

00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:36.050 align:middle line:84%
for whatever you're
going to do academically.

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:37.190 align:middle line:90%
Of course, that's natural.

00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:38.630 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
be made fun of.

00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:41.750 align:middle line:84%
You want to lose tenure,
but then John Anthony

00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:43.562 align:middle line:90%
West, at least 35,000 years.

00:39:43.562 --> 00:39:44.645 align:middle line:90%
So what's your perception?

00:39:44.645 --> 00:39:46.645 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: Well, to me,
what is impressive is also

00:39:46.645 --> 00:39:47.670 align:middle line:90%
the continuity.

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:49.980 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at many
of these buildings, many

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:51.380 align:middle line:84%
of these structures,
I do believe

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:53.660 align:middle line:84%
that some of these,
they can go back

00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:56.510 align:middle line:84%
to at least the
neo-Atlantean periods, over

00:39:56.510 --> 00:40:00.860 align:middle line:84%
10,000 years ago, immediately
after the last terrestrial

00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:01.758 align:middle line:90%
cataclysm.

00:40:01.758 --> 00:40:03.425 align:middle line:84%
But what is remarkable
is the continuity

00:40:03.425 --> 00:40:05.990 align:middle line:84%
because that civilization
did not stop.

00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:08.960 align:middle line:84%
These are places that
continue to be rebuilt.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:11.580 align:middle line:84%
They continue to
be sacred places.

00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:14.030 align:middle line:84%
So even if you look
at a site like Giza,

00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:15.830 align:middle line:84%
you actually find
a stratification

00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:16.970 align:middle line:90%
of different cultures.

00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:20.930 align:middle line:84%
The origins of the site may
be well over 10,000 years old,

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:23.300 align:middle line:84%
but then multiple
different civilizations,

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:25.460 align:middle line:84%
including the
dynastic Egyptians,

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:28.460 align:middle line:84%
they kept building
on top of that.

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:31.040 align:middle line:84%
They continued, in a
way, this project so

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:35.270 align:middle line:84%
that this great project that
was started during the Atlantean

00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:37.930 align:middle line:84%
period did not
just stop there, it

00:40:37.930 --> 00:40:39.900 align:middle line:84%
continued for thousands
and thousands of years.

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:41.240 align:middle line:90%
There is evidence.

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:44.300 align:middle line:84%
This project continues to
the modern day in a way,

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:46.160 align:middle line:84%
and always, there
were people that

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:50.540 align:middle line:84%
kept the fire alive in a certain
way, this fire of Atlantean

00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:51.680 align:middle line:90%
civilization.

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:55.520 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I think it's even
more important that we, today,

00:40:55.520 --> 00:41:00.500 align:middle line:84%
rediscover those roots because
that can really bring forth

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:05.345 align:middle line:84%
a new Renaissance, a rediscovery
of the Atlantean past.

00:41:05.345 --> 00:41:07.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What for you
on a personal level

00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:10.490 align:middle line:84%
have you learned that really
has kind of changed where

00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:13.658 align:middle line:84%
you thought you would go
with this whole endeavor,

00:41:13.658 --> 00:41:15.200 align:middle line:84%
with this story,
and the development,

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.670 align:middle line:90%
and the research of it?

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:18.757 align:middle line:90%
What has changed in you?

00:41:18.757 --> 00:41:21.215 align:middle line:84%
And I want to know then what
you're going to be doing next.

00:41:21.215 --> 00:41:23.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: Well, to
me is it's really

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:28.397 align:middle line:84%
the search for the
remnants of that past.

00:41:28.397 --> 00:41:30.230 align:middle line:84%
As you also mentioned
before, I do believe--

00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:32.215 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The spiritual,
psycho spiritual, mental?

00:41:32.215 --> 00:41:32.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCO: Yes.

00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:33.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:35.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: The records
of that time, I really

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:38.420 align:middle line:84%
do believe that
before, particularly

00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:42.310 align:middle line:84%
before the last cataclysm,
people who had foreknowledge

00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:44.610 align:middle line:84%
of the events that
were going to happen,

00:41:44.610 --> 00:41:46.580 align:middle line:90%
they created time capsules.

00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:49.080 align:middle line:84%
They concealed part
of that knowledge,

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:51.230 align:middle line:84%
so it could be rediscovered
for the benefit

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:52.580 align:middle line:90%
of a future humanity.

00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:55.040 align:middle line:84%
So you come to a
realization that many of us

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:59.910 align:middle line:84%
nowadays are tasked with the
rediscovery of that knowledge.

00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:03.270 align:middle line:84%
You're rediscovering
those time capsules.

00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:05.645 align:middle line:84%
We're rediscovering
that ancient knowledge

00:42:05.645 --> 00:42:08.000 align:middle line:84%
for the benefit
of modern humanity

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.300 align:middle line:84%
so that we do not repeat the
same mistakes of the past

00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:13.490 align:middle line:84%
and we don't go down
the same way that led

00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:14.855 align:middle line:90%
to the downfall of Atlantis.

00:42:14.855 --> 00:42:16.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beautifully said.

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:19.640 align:middle line:84%
If we take into consideration
as the Hermetics would say,

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:23.120 align:middle line:84%
for example, that early,
early, early Egypt

00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:25.220 align:middle line:90%
was concurrent with Atlantis.

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:27.320 align:middle line:84%
As you said, this
is even evidenced.

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:32.750 align:middle line:84%
So we have then the survival of
great amounts of hieroglyphics

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:36.860 align:middle line:84%
and such, and it was told to
me one time that if humans

00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:39.560 align:middle line:90%
learned how to really read it--

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:41.270 align:middle line:84%
and there are those
being born and those

00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:44.090 align:middle line:84%
that exist now who are learning
how to actually, really read

00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:47.240 align:middle line:84%
it, not just Budge's work, but
way beyond that-- that that

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:49.250 align:middle line:84%
is going to tell
us of our history.

00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:50.930 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe
there's truth in that?

00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:52.555 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: Yeah, yeah,
I do believe that.

00:42:52.555 --> 00:42:54.515 align:middle line:84%
I think particularly with
hieroglyphic writing,

00:42:54.515 --> 00:42:57.275 align:middle line:84%
there's a literal interpretation
and a symbolic interpretation.

00:42:57.275 --> 00:42:58.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: I think
we have focused too

00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:00.960 align:middle line:84%
much on the literal
interpretation,

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:02.780 align:middle line:90%
so we can read hieroglyphs.

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:05.595 align:middle line:84%
But we do not necessarily
understand them, meaning that--

00:43:05.595 --> 00:43:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We don't
understand them yet.

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:08.240 align:middle line:90%
That's what I was told.

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:12.020 align:middle line:84%
If some people take it
upon them in this lifetime

00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:14.210 align:middle line:84%
to truly understand
them, the answers

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:15.950 align:middle line:84%
we're looking for
regarding Atlantis

00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:17.645 align:middle line:84%
and the laws of
nature, et cetera,

00:43:17.645 --> 00:43:18.770 align:middle line:90%
are all right there for us.

00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:19.850 align:middle line:84%
They're just
sitting right there.

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:21.515 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: Yeah, and
there is this idea,

00:43:21.515 --> 00:43:24.200 align:middle line:84%
there has always been
that esoteric knowledge,

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:27.545 align:middle line:84%
true esoteric knowledge at least
cannot be conveyed with words

00:43:27.545 --> 00:43:29.300 align:middle line:90%
or with the language of logic.

00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:31.820 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly the purpose
of hieroglyphic writing,

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:34.950 align:middle line:84%
what to convey, a
deeper level of meaning.

00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:38.150 align:middle line:84%
So if we only stick to the
literal interpretation of that,

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:40.655 align:middle line:84%
we are never going to
really get to the core

00:43:40.655 --> 00:43:43.820 align:middle line:84%
of the esoteric meaning
of the spiritual truths

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:45.620 align:middle line:84%
that these people try
to communicate to us.

00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:48.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely, and
finally, yeah, we're just about

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:49.400 align:middle line:90%
out of time.

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:53.210 align:middle line:84%
Finally, Edgar Cayce
had said that there

00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:55.460 align:middle line:84%
would come a time
in the near future

00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:57.320 align:middle line:90%
where Atlantis would rise again.

00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And it seemed like he was
speaking quite literally.

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:02.390 align:middle line:84%
We still have in the
Azores Mount Picos

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:04.970 align:middle line:84%
for example, little tiny
remnants of Atlantis

00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:07.700 align:middle line:84%
that exist, but said that
it would be rising again.

00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:09.290 align:middle line:90%
What do you take that to mean?

00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:11.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: Well, I think
that time is now.

00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:13.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know if
we have necessarily

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:15.170 align:middle line:90%
to take it literally.

00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:17.930 align:middle line:84%
I think one needs to
think about what--

00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:19.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it the
knowledge, the spirit--

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:22.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MARCO: Right, right,
that's the way I see it.

00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:25.040 align:middle line:10%
I see it much more as a
Renaissance of Atlantean

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:29.240 align:middle line:10%
knowledge, of Atlantean
spirituality in a way that

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:31.715 align:middle line:10%
is going to be triggered by
rediscovery of the Atlantean

00:44:31.715 --> 00:44:35.030 align:middle line:10%
past, very much in the same
way as during the 15th,

00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:38.330 align:middle line:10%
the 16th century, a rediscovered
classical civilization

00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:41.570 align:middle line:10%
of Greece and Rome was what
triggered the Renaissance,

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:44.870 align:middle line:10%
this incredible surge of human
culture and civilization.

00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:48.250 align:middle line:84%
I do think we're at the edge
of a very similar rediscovery,

00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:51.020 align:middle line:84%
that the rediscovery
of the Atlantean past

00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:55.120 align:middle line:84%
is going to really bring forth
a new golden age for mankind.

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:57.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, thank you.

00:44:57.110 --> 00:44:58.620 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:00.720 align:middle line:90%
You have a very elegant mind.

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:02.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm very, very pleased
to be sitting here

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:06.390 align:middle line:84%
with you because you're not
just turning over stones,

00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:10.293 align:middle line:84%
you're also esoterically
curious and courageous.

00:45:10.293 --> 00:45:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And you've put this all
together in your book,

00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:15.460 align:middle line:84%
and you've taken it even
further in terms of conversation

00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:16.260 align:middle line:90%
with me.

00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very happy to
have been part of it

00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:21.750 align:middle line:84%
because you had such clarity
and elegance of thought

00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:24.120 align:middle line:84%
to all of these things
we're so interested in.

00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:24.930 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Marco.

00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:26.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MARCO: Thank you so much.

00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:27.375 align:middle line:90%
It's been a pleasure.

00:45:27.375 --> 00:45:29.250 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Again, the
