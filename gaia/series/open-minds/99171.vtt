00:00:27.871 --> 00:00:30.370 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: In my last
conversation with Jerry Wills,

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.229 align:middle line:10%
we learned of his
unique start in life

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:35.170 align:middle line:10%
as a baby who was dropped
off at a military base

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.290 align:middle line:10%
and began his interesting life.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.840 align:middle line:84%
Today, we speak
about the knowledge

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.470 align:middle line:84%
that was shared with him
and how humans can truly

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.520 align:middle line:84%
begin to master their
world and their lives.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.210 align:middle line:84%
But first, we've got to pick
up the story with the cafe

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.945 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the universe.

00:00:47.945 --> 00:00:50.070 align:middle line:84%
>>JERRY WILLS: The cafe at
the end of the universe.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so we have
a good hour to chat.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.330 align:middle line:84%
So tell us about
the cafe at the end

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.550 align:middle line:84%
of the universe,
parallel timelines,

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.330 align:middle line:84%
some of the
interesting individuals

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.550 align:middle line:84%
you met over there from other
timelines, and so forth.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.842 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLS: Yeah, it's a very
interesting story to me.

00:01:05.842 --> 00:01:07.800 align:middle line:10%
I'm sure your viewers
will find it fascinating.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.240 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It is to me, too.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.640 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLS: The place that I ended
up finding-- or being taken to,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.775 align:middle line:10%
really-- by M, was a
place that I call the cafe

00:01:17.775 --> 00:01:19.660 align:middle line:10%
at the end of the universe.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.200 align:middle line:84%
It has wood floors, tables
and chairs made of wood.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.340 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of rustic.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.700 align:middle line:84%
There are walls along a
couple of the back sides.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.060 align:middle line:84%
But on the left, where you're
sitting, there are no walls.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.820 align:middle line:84%
You just look out, and you're
looking out into space.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.990 align:middle line:84%
You see, really, the end of
the universe right there.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.392 align:middle line:90%
And that's why I called it that.

00:01:43.392 --> 00:01:45.350 align:middle line:84%
At least it looks like
the end of the universe.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.350 align:middle line:90%


00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And this is a place where I go
to periodically just to sit,

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.067 align:middle line:90%
have a cup of coffee.

00:01:55.067 --> 00:01:56.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I remember
you said orange muffin.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.870 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Orange muffins.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.380 align:middle line:90%
They're really good.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.550 align:middle line:84%
I've never had an orange
muffin taste like that.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.160 align:middle line:90%


00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.199 align:middle line:84%
It's a very open and
friendly environment.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.840 align:middle line:84%
You can sit there, have a
cigarette, nobody bothers you.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And occasionally,
there will be others

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.800 align:middle line:90%
who show up there as well.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And on quite a few
occasions-- because I've

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.410 align:middle line:84%
been going there now for
quite a number of years--

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.480 align:middle line:84%
the people that you meet there
are from their own timelines,

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.560 align:middle line:90%
their own realities.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.190 align:middle line:84%
And what that means
is this-- for example,

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.375 align:middle line:84%
you might meet someone from
what we in our current timeline

00:02:38.375 --> 00:02:43.570 align:middle line:84%
would consider, oh, Ancient
Greece or Ancient Egypt,

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.880 align:middle line:90%
or some ancient, ancient time.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.510 align:middle line:84%
These are people that are
very much like myself,

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.330 align:middle line:84%
whether they're
from Earth or not,

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.740 align:middle line:84%
but they're highly
developed spiritually.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And they projected out, and
they were brought to this place

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.060 align:middle line:90%
by their own guides, I suppose.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.530 align:middle line:84%
In their manner of thinking
and their experience,

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.250 align:middle line:84%
they're still alive in
their particular timeline.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And when they leave, they
go back to their lives

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.240 align:middle line:90%
in their timeline.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which looks
very similar to what

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.780 align:middle line:90%
we would think of as the past.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.510 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: For us, it's the past.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.640 align:middle line:90%
And for them, we're the future.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And others are coming from
other worlds and other timelines

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.980 align:middle line:90%
on other worlds.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.410 align:middle line:84%
It's a bit of a conundrum to
try and get your mind around it,

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.630 align:middle line:90%
so I just stopped trying to.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.690 align:middle line:84%
There are those moments where
the invitations are extended.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you wanted
to go and visit,

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.940 align:middle line:84%
see what it's like
there, then you can.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And there's a way
that it's done.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.430 align:middle line:84%
It's, again, a little
difficult to try and explain.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.450 align:middle line:84%
One example was I
wanted to see what

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.230 align:middle line:90%
it was like in the Mayan times.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.280 align:middle line:84%
So they said, well, we're
going to do a ceremony.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'm there at the
cafe with this guy who's

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.300 align:middle line:90%
a shaman from that time.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.420 align:middle line:90%
He says, all right.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.630 align:middle line:90%
Then let's go.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.850 align:middle line:84%
And so we go, and
then time kind of

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.660 align:middle line:90%
has a deviation of some sort.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And I show up, and
he's already there.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And he's got the incense
burning, the drums are going,

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.490 align:middle line:84%
and the people are sitting
around in a semicircle

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.990 align:middle line:84%
making prayers and
holding their hands out

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.710 align:middle line:90%
like this towards the ground.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.350 align:middle line:90%
And then I'm there.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're seeing me as
some kind of a shining being.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And then there's something that
happens, and I become solid.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.300 align:middle line:84%
They put a jaguar pelt
over me, they walk me

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.840 align:middle line:84%
into the jaguar
temple, and that's

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.230 align:middle line:90%
where we sit and do a ceremony.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And then, you can't
stay there that long.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.970 align:middle line:84%
Come back down the pyramid,
and the whole thing

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.160 align:middle line:84%
is done in reverse,
and a shining being.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly it all fades out of
view, and I'm back in the cafe.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, what did
you learn, for example,

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.250 align:middle line:84%
from your time among
the Mayan shaman?

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.620 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: It wasn't very long.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.510 align:middle line:84%
You just kind of went
there, got the cape, left.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:05.760 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: I had the experience.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.540 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like, well,
let's go into the mysteries

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.920 align:middle line:90%
of the Mayan civilization.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:10.990 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't like that.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.129 align:middle line:84%
It was just a very quick
time, maybe 30 minutes.

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:17.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you have any
idea why you were taken there

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:18.100 align:middle line:90%
through that?

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.680 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Oh, because I wanted
to see what it was like.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.221 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:05:20.221 --> 00:05:22.450 align:middle line:84%
So because it was your
curiosity driving that thing.

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:23.033 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:05:23.033 --> 00:05:25.575 align:middle line:84%
And they offered, well,
sure, if you want to see it.

00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:26.950 align:middle line:84%
There's no difference
in language

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:32.490 align:middle line:84%
in this particular circumstance,
which I find quite interesting.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:33.950 align:middle line:90%
But that's the nature of it.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.060 align:middle line:84%
There have been other people
who have passed through.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.777 align:middle line:84%
For example, Joan
Grant showed up once.

00:05:39.777 --> 00:05:40.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love her work.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And she's a
beautiful, tall lady.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And came over and sat down, and
we talked about Ancient Egypt

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.100 align:middle line:90%
stuff.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And she was very eloquent
and-- evocative comes to mind.

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, her
work's very evocative.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:01.560 align:middle line:90%
"Winged Pharaoh" on.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Oh, it
was just-- having

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.220 align:middle line:84%
a conversation like
that with her was-- I

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.050 align:middle line:90%
didn't even know who she was.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.660 align:middle line:90%
So I went to find out later.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:11.966 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:06:11.966 --> 00:06:12.856 align:middle line:90%
Surprise.

00:06:12.856 --> 00:06:14.980 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: So that's why it
was like, oh really, that

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.450 align:middle line:90%
was Joan Grant.

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.250 align:middle line:84%
But there are others
who have gone through

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.446 align:middle line:90%
and met up with them.

00:06:21.446 --> 00:06:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a place
I go to to relax,

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:30.370 align:middle line:84%
to get away from this world and
find a bit of solace otherwise.

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.149 align:middle line:90%
And I go there sometimes.

00:06:33.149 --> 00:06:34.440 align:middle line:90%
I don't know when I'll go next.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it for, as
you say, mostly relaxation?

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.330 align:middle line:84%
Or is there
sometimes information

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:39.623 align:middle line:90%
that can kind of pass through?

00:06:39.623 --> 00:06:40.660 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: There's always
information that comes through.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:40.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.910 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to know about
a little bit of that.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:43.126 align:middle line:90%
What type of things are--

00:06:43.126 --> 00:06:44.210 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, there
are these guys that

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.640 align:middle line:90%
show up on a regular basis.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.590 align:middle line:90%
I call them the ancient dudes.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.450 align:middle line:84%
They have names, but I
can't pronounce them.

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:51.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why do you
call them ancient?

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.040 align:middle line:90%
What do they look like?

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.640 align:middle line:90%
Where are they from?

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.014 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well,
they all look kind

00:06:54.014 --> 00:06:57.810 align:middle line:90%
of old, white hair, curly hair.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:04.560 align:middle line:84%
They're from the ancient
times of, I suppose,

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:09.540 align:middle line:84%
Greece and other parts within
that part of the world.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:16.340 align:middle line:84%
I think Greece, maybe
Rome-- I don't know exactly,

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.929 align:middle line:84%
but they're all very,
very smart, real smart.

00:07:19.929 --> 00:07:21.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
sort of information

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:22.550 align:middle line:90%
do they share with you?

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:26.140 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, we just
didn't have talks.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.760 align:middle line:90%
They're healers.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And so whenever someone
has an issue that they're

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.682 align:middle line:84%
dealing with in their own
particular timeline, if they're

00:07:35.682 --> 00:07:37.890 align:middle line:84%
having a real problem with
it, they'll come and talk.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:41.470 align:middle line:84%
Or it they have a personal
bit of angst about something,

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:42.880 align:middle line:90%
they'll come and talk.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.890 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a meeting of
friends who share information.

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:49.820 align:middle line:84%
A good example of what
happened one time was Kathy

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:50.597 align:middle line:90%
was working--

00:07:50.597 --> 00:07:51.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Your wife.

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:52.500 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: My wife, uh-huh.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.660 align:middle line:84%
She's the only person
that made my life better.

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.440 align:middle line:90%
She's my hero.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And she was building,
constructing

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:05.399 align:middle line:90%
this nutrient drink.

00:08:05.399 --> 00:08:07.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to
get a little bit of that

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.750 align:middle line:90%
into the conversation too.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:14.425 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, it was
like-- it tasted like, yuck.

00:08:14.425 --> 00:08:15.440 align:middle line:90%
It was green.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.985 align:middle line:90%
You know how green drinks taste.

00:08:16.985 --> 00:08:18.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, like yuck.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: I said, it's got to
taste good if I want to use it.

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:27.500 align:middle line:84%
So she figured out almost all
of it and made it taste good.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And then the ancient
dudes, I'm talking to them.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.260 align:middle line:84%
They says, well, here's
what we would use.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.549 align:middle line:90%
Try some of this, some of that.

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:39.210 align:middle line:84%
So I told her, the
next opportunity I had,

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:41.429 align:middle line:90%
what they had said.

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And she tried it, and
it made it incredible.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.300 align:middle line:84%
It was, like, 27 different
ingredients she used.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.510 align:middle line:90%
It's called living food.

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And she made this
up, and I swear,

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:59.360 align:middle line:84%
you can drink a big glass of
juice with the stuff in it

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.230 align:middle line:84%
and not have to eat
for six or seven hours.

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:03.990 align:middle line:90%
You're completely nourished.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:07.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I think
when I saw the two of you,

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:09.830 align:middle line:84%
I asked her if there's any
way that that recipe would

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:10.930 align:middle line:90%
be shared.

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And what we did come to was
a few of the key ingredients

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:16.540 align:middle line:90%
in the cocktail.

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if
it's worth sharing,

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.087 align:middle line:84%
since it doesn't have some
of the secret sauce or not.

00:09:22.087 --> 00:09:22.670 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:24.885 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's all just
off-the-shelf stuff,

00:09:24.885 --> 00:09:26.010 align:middle line:90%
but it's how it's combined.

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:27.787 align:middle line:90%
It's a synergistic blend.

00:09:27.787 --> 00:09:30.370 align:middle line:84%
Talk to her, and I'm sure she'd
be happy to share it with you.

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:30.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.100 align:middle line:84%
On behalf of all of
us, I'll see if she'll

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.564 align:middle line:90%
share that recipe with us.

00:09:33.564 --> 00:09:34.730 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: It was really good.

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:36.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so the
inspiration for the green

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.640 align:middle line:84%
drink came initially
through her?

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.181 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Mm-hmm.

00:09:40.181 --> 00:09:40.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.721 align:middle line:84%
And there are those times--
I don't talk about it

00:09:42.721 --> 00:09:44.770 align:middle line:90%
very much because it bothers me.

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:47.220 align:middle line:84%
But there are those
times where I just

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:53.420 align:middle line:84%
get so tired that I can't remain
conscious, 2:00 in the morning,

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:54.980 align:middle line:90%
3:00 in the morning.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:10:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And Kathy is just the most
inquisitive, thorough person

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:04.760 align:middle line:90%
I've ever met.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:10.330 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, she will be
talking to me about things,

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:13.170 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not present any longer.

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And she'll be talking
to the ancient dudes.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.460 align:middle line:90%
They think she's fun.

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:21.460 align:middle line:84%
So she has conversations
with the ancient dudes

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.090 align:middle line:90%
while I'm sleeping.

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's where she got
a lot of her information.

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's
what I was wondering.

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:31.086 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And it
bothers me, because I--

00:10:31.086 --> 00:10:32.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
not privy to it.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:33.043 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:10:33.043 --> 00:10:35.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, I thought
I was asleep.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:38.670 align:middle line:90%
So anyway, it's a bit strange.

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:41.577 align:middle line:84%
I don't talk about
that very much.

00:10:41.577 --> 00:10:43.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, the
green drink thing.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, a couple of years ago when
I was doing my own checking

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:51.000 align:middle line:84%
in with was given information
about the green drink

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.670 align:middle line:84%
thing in terms of
what this means

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:55.000 align:middle line:84%
to our future of
the species as well,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.450 align:middle line:84%
and our healing
and the adaptations

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:00.330 align:middle line:84%
that will be taking
place within one to two

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.960 align:middle line:84%
generations in our
digestive systems,

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.800 align:middle line:84%
and that this is
the precursor to how

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.160 align:middle line:90%
we're going to be eating.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:08.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: That's what
they were saying too.

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:09.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Were they?

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:09.700 align:middle line:90%
OK, yeah.

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.883 align:middle line:84%
And so might as well
start getting used to it

00:11:11.883 --> 00:11:14.436 align:middle line:84%
and figure out how
to make friends

00:11:14.436 --> 00:11:16.685 align:middle line:84%
with it, because it might
be burgers and fried chicken

00:11:16.685 --> 00:11:19.700 align:middle line:84%
and all that are off the menu
in a couple of generations

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:21.250 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:21.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.440 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: This is a very
nutritious way of living.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.664 align:middle line:90%
We did it for, gosh, years.

00:11:26.664 --> 00:11:29.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so it really keeps
your energy high and sustained?

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:30.080 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Oh, sure.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.745 align:middle line:84%
We would have it with
us on expeditions.

00:11:32.745 --> 00:11:34.690 align:middle line:84%
You can take all the
ingredients with you?

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:36.110 align:middle line:90%
She just mixes it up.

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:39.040 align:middle line:84%
All you need is a papaya
or a pineapple or a mango

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.620 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, and just juice
it up and put it in there.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:46.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was interesting,
because you like street food.

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:48.000 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: I do.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.780 align:middle line:90%
I always have.

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:53.440 align:middle line:84%
But she bent me
in that direction,

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.347 align:middle line:84%
and I found it very
easy to accommodate.

00:11:57.347 --> 00:11:58.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's why I trust it.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:01.740 align:middle line:84%
If you like the flavor of it,
that means the rest of us will.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.200 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Oh, it was good.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.009 align:middle line:90%
It was really good.

00:12:05.009 --> 00:12:05.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:07.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'll see if I can find
out from her about that,

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:09.320 align:middle line:90%
and then we'll post it later.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.780 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:15.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, among all of this
going on through the years,

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:19.700 align:middle line:84%
you brought your own memory
and also were shown more about

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:21.700 align:middle line:90%
how people utilize energy.

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.187 align:middle line:84%
We talked a little bit about
this in the last show, where

00:12:24.187 --> 00:12:25.770 align:middle line:84%
you were saying one
thing you don't do

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:28.030 align:middle line:84%
is you don't force
or push energy.

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And since we are nothing
but energy-- electricity

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:35.850 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, magnetic fields--
you began teaching this.

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:37.910 align:middle line:90%
And you still do.

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I would like
to-- let's just pretend

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.090 align:middle line:90%
we're in one of your courses.

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And take us where you
normally begin with people.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:50.430 align:middle line:84%
What's the entry point into
beginning to master energy?

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.260 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, you know,
it's pretty much the same

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:57.680 align:middle line:84%
for every person depending upon
what their skill level or skill

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:58.680 align:middle line:90%
sets are.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:02.650 align:middle line:84%
But considering the person
has the most-- you know,

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:05.310 align:middle line:84%
what they feel is really a
good skill set, and the person

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:07.935 align:middle line:84%
who doesn't have a clue is like,
I really want to do something,

00:13:07.935 --> 00:13:11.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how, the
inception in all of this

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:14.360 align:middle line:84%
is to first understand
who you are.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.200 align:middle line:84%
Because most people in this
world have forgotten who

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.710 align:middle line:84%
they really are, and they've
lost sight of themselves.

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:28.380 align:middle line:84%
Most people have this
need to be accepted.

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:30.280 align:middle line:90%
It's a natural thing.

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And within that
need, you are trying

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:39.620 align:middle line:84%
to accommodate what other
people expect of you in order

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.680 align:middle line:90%
to be accepted.

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And keeping in mind, the
first thing that you learned

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.770 align:middle line:90%
was the word no.

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:47.736 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't the word yes.

00:13:47.736 --> 00:13:48.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's true.

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: If you're in a
situation where you're

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:56.850 align:middle line:84%
wanting to progress spiritually
to evolve yourself--

00:13:56.850 --> 00:14:00.080 align:middle line:84%
and spiritually to me
means not just, oh, well,

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:04.190 align:middle line:84%
I feel very spiritual-- it's
like, I want to do something.

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:09.950 align:middle line:84%
I want to use this energy
in a constructive way

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:13.580 align:middle line:84%
so I can have something change,
whether it's the taste of water

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:18.940 align:middle line:84%
or a tumor go away,
whatever it might be.

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:24.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have to
rediscover yourself first.

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And the way that you do that
is by looking at yourself,

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:31.210 align:middle line:84%
really seeing who you
are, and not seeing

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:33.950 align:middle line:84%
who you've been told you
are, because we've all

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:38.970 align:middle line:84%
been told that we are either
not smart enough or pretty

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:41.450 align:middle line:84%
enough or good
enough, or who do you

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:44.950 align:middle line:84%
think you are sort of comment,
and we've taken that to heart.

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:48.720 align:middle line:84%
All the things that would
keep us from being great

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.750 align:middle line:90%
have been pretty much abated.

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:55.600 align:middle line:84%
So you have to get
away from that.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And what I tell
folks to do is I want

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:02.460 align:middle line:84%
you to imagine how good it
feels when someone who loves you

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:05.250 align:middle line:84%
is just holding you,
and you close your eyes,

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:09.320 align:middle line:84%
and you're floating in that
feeling of being loved.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.855 align:middle line:90%
It's a really neat feeling.

00:15:10.855 --> 00:15:14.290 align:middle line:90%


00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:18.870 align:middle line:84%
To take it a step beyond
that, because the next step is

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:23.920 align:middle line:84%
important, look in the
mirror and see yourself truly

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.630 align:middle line:90%
see yourself.

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:28.640 align:middle line:84%
You're going to see the
flaws and the problems

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:33.360 align:middle line:84%
and everything you've ever been
told-- you this is not right

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.910 align:middle line:90%
or your that, or whatever.

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:39.722 align:middle line:84%
Look at yourself as though
you didn't know any of that

00:15:39.722 --> 00:15:41.930 align:middle line:84%
and you're fascinated, and
you're looking at yourself

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:44.940 align:middle line:84%
and seeing all of the
beauty that's there.

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:45.750 align:middle line:90%
Try to find it.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:48.290 align:middle line:90%


00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:51.570 align:middle line:84%
And the third thing
is to start breathing.

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:53.240 align:middle line:84%
And breathe in
the essence of who

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.620 align:middle line:90%
you are looking at yourself.

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:59.470 align:middle line:84%
And feel that love, like
when someone's holding you.

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And start feeling
that towards yourself.

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:06.820 align:middle line:84%
When you can master that--
and by master, I mean,

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:08.940 align:middle line:84%
when you reach that
point when you can really

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:12.230 align:middle line:84%
start feeling it,
now you've just

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:17.830 align:middle line:84%
identified that aspect of
God that lives within you,

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:21.730 align:middle line:84%
and you're starting
to nurture that.

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:23.350 align:middle line:90%
No one can take that from you.

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And all these things
that people told you,

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:27.060 align:middle line:84%
that you weren't good enough,
pretty enough, smart enough,

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:28.684 align:middle line:84%
you couldn't sing
well enough, whatever

00:16:28.684 --> 00:16:31.950 align:middle line:84%
it is, it starts to
just sort of fade away,

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:34.310 align:middle line:84%
because that was their
impression of you.

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And because of
whatever reason, this

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:40.780 align:middle line:84%
is what they wanted you
to believe about yourself.

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:42.840 align:middle line:84%
You stop believing these
things about yourself

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.700 align:middle line:90%
and start knowing who you are.

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And who you are in
every person I've ever

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:57.710 align:middle line:84%
met is a divine spark of
the creator, another facet,

00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:00.520 align:middle line:84%
and that light coming
off of you comes

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:04.369 align:middle line:84%
from God, whatever you
conceive God to be,

00:17:04.369 --> 00:17:07.829 align:middle line:90%
and it just radiates outward.

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:09.609 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of people
say, well, I'm

00:17:09.609 --> 00:17:11.920 align:middle line:84%
trying to protect myself
with the white light

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:17.980 align:middle line:84%
or I'm trying to bring in the
light, all the stuff-- silly.

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:21.822 align:middle line:84%
Number one, you're made
of what God is Made of.

00:17:21.822 --> 00:17:24.315 align:middle line:90%
God's essence runs through you.

00:17:24.315 --> 00:17:25.920 align:middle line:84%
If you go looking,
you're not going

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.580 align:middle line:84%
to find that place where
you end and God begins.

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:29.825 align:middle line:90%
It's homogeneous.

00:17:29.825 --> 00:17:31.575 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, can I
ask a quick question,

00:17:31.575 --> 00:17:33.670 align:middle line:84%
and you'll remember
where we are right now?

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:36.339 align:middle line:84%
Is that true from out
throughout the universe

00:17:36.339 --> 00:17:37.130 align:middle line:90%
and other cultures?

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:37.790 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: It is.

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:38.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Throughout
the universe,

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:40.350 align:middle line:84%
they understand
this the same way?

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: This is why
I'm bringing it forward,

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:46.650 align:middle line:84%
because this is the,
quote unquote, religion

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:51.220 align:middle line:84%
from other worlds, people who
are successfully living aware.

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:54.002 align:middle line:90%
And it's time it happens here.

00:17:54.002 --> 00:17:56.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so then back to
what you were saying about we

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:57.850 align:middle line:90%
are that stuff.

00:17:57.850 --> 00:17:59.780 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: You are that stuff.

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And instead of trying
to find the light

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:08.200 align:middle line:84%
or bring the light in or
protect yourself with the light,

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.100 align:middle line:84%
there isn't anything
that's not of God

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:13.300 align:middle line:84%
you have to protect
yourself from, number one.

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And instead of looking for
the light, be the light.

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:23.000 align:middle line:84%
It's time to stop looking
for it and start being it.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.540 align:middle line:84%
You are the light that
you've been looking for,

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:27.270 align:middle line:84%
and trying to find
it externally just

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:29.520 align:middle line:84%
means you haven't found
it within yourself.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.770 align:middle line:90%
Find it now within yourself.

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you do,
what's going to happen

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:36.660 align:middle line:84%
is that there are
going to be people

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:39.670 align:middle line:84%
who won't like you
because you are not

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:41.770 align:middle line:90%
what they expect you to be.

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:45.160 align:middle line:84%
They're going to think there's
something wrong with you

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:49.889 align:middle line:84%
because they need you to be
this person that they have--

00:18:49.889 --> 00:18:51.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
they're familiar with.

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:52.055 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Right.

00:18:52.055 --> 00:18:52.889 align:middle line:90%
And it's unfamiliar.

00:18:52.889 --> 00:18:54.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what's
wrong with that person.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:55.820 align:middle line:90%
They just sort of changed.

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:57.420 align:middle line:90%
Well, you did change.

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.000 align:middle line:90%
You became you.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
have these people that

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:01.970 align:middle line:84%
are just going to
drop out of your life,

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:03.260 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes it hurts.

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:04.030 align:middle line:90%
It hurt in mine.

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:08.080 align:middle line:90%


00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.730 align:middle line:90%
It hurt a lot.

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:14.820 align:middle line:84%
But what happens next is magical
because the universe does not

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:18.000 align:middle line:90%
like there to be a vacuum.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And those empty places
will be populated

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:25.050 align:middle line:84%
by people who think
you're really neat

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:27.210 align:middle line:90%
and want to be around you.

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find that you're
suddenly just surrounded

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:34.390 align:middle line:84%
by folks who just think that
you're special, just like you

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:36.340 align:middle line:90%
think you're special.

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:40.770 align:middle line:84%
Not in an egotistical way--
you're just, I am who I am.

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's where
that comment comes from.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:46.110 align:middle line:90%
No, God, I am that I am.

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:48.740 align:middle line:90%
And that's the god within you.

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And that light that
goes out is going

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:54.749 align:middle line:84%
to help to illuminate the path
of the people that haven't

00:19:54.749 --> 00:19:56.290 align:middle line:84%
found their own
light, and it's going

00:19:56.290 --> 00:20:01.394 align:middle line:84%
to inspire them to become
what you found yourself to be.

00:20:01.394 --> 00:20:04.490 align:middle line:90%
Be that inspiration.

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:07.860 align:middle line:84%
It's nothing to do at all
except just to breathe

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:11.180 align:middle line:84%
and just to be and
to know yourself.

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:14.570 align:middle line:84%
The light finds its own way
into the lives of others,

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:17.660 align:middle line:84%
and it shows them-- just
the way that you find it

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:20.050 align:middle line:84%
within yourself--
how that they too

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:22.120 align:middle line:84%
can become something more
special than they ever

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.830 align:middle line:90%
realized.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:27.230 align:middle line:84%
In doing this sort
of exercise, you

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:32.000 align:middle line:84%
start noticing little tingling
and warmth that every time you

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.900 align:middle line:84%
see something that
needs attention--

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:40.945 align:middle line:84%
maybe you got a cut, or maybe
it's worse-- and you go,

00:20:40.945 --> 00:20:45.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't need that
any longer, and this

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:48.730 align:middle line:90%
is the next part of it.

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:53.250 align:middle line:84%
People pray, and they pray and
they pray, I have this wrong,

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:55.250 align:middle line:90%
I need to pray about it.

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's still wrong, I need to
pray some more, compelling God

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:00.460 align:middle line:90%
to do something.

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:02.260 align:middle line:90%
God lives within you.

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:05.185 align:middle line:84%
If something's wrong,
I don't need it like

00:21:05.185 --> 00:21:08.055 align:middle line:90%
that anymore, it'll just fixed.

00:21:08.055 --> 00:21:12.810 align:middle line:84%
It needs to be done quickly
and go about your business.

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:16.150 align:middle line:90%
And it just goes away.

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:21.250 align:middle line:84%
That is the next level of our
experience in our continuing

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:26.250 align:middle line:84%
evolution towards being
in harmony with God

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:30.580 align:middle line:84%
and walking the same steps
at the same moment, which

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:31.840 align:middle line:90%
is in harmony.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:37.850 align:middle line:84%
But it's realizing the state
of the divine within ourselves.

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that,
everything changes.

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:42.045 align:middle line:90%
You want to project energy.

00:21:42.045 --> 00:21:44.810 align:middle line:90%


00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:48.980 align:middle line:84%
This is another strange
thing that I find here.

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:50.460 align:middle line:84%
People are wanting
to be healers.

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:51.690 align:middle line:90%
I want to be an artist.

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:55.470 align:middle line:84%
I want to be a this,
I want to be a that.

00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:59.145 align:middle line:84%
Just saying that you want to be
is admitting that you aren't.

00:21:59.145 --> 00:22:02.340 align:middle line:90%


00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:04.280 align:middle line:90%
Be a healer.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.820 align:middle line:90%
Be an artist.

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:10.200 align:middle line:84%
Because someone else judges that
you aren't, does that mean that

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.680 align:middle line:90%
you aren't?

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:16.890 align:middle line:84%
What do you judge
about yourself?

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:19.980 align:middle line:84%
It isn't the opinions of others
that make it so within you.

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:23.730 align:middle line:84%
It's the opinion of
you that makes it so.

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:28.190 align:middle line:84%
So stop trying to be what you
think you aren't and start

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:30.210 align:middle line:90%
living as though you were.

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:31.940 align:middle line:84%
The one thing that
I can tell you

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:34.280 align:middle line:84%
that is absolutely
certain is whatever

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:38.430 align:middle line:84%
you believe yourself to be is
what you'll start becoming.

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:42.900 align:middle line:84%
But when you know yourself
to be this, you're that.

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:44.610 align:middle line:84%
So know yourself
to be whatever it

00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:49.580 align:middle line:84%
is that you're hoping and
dreaming and not succeeding at.

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:51.550 align:middle line:84%
You're not succeeding
because you have doubt.

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:53.342 align:middle line:84%
You want to be,
but well, I'm not.

00:22:53.342 --> 00:22:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
you feel separate

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:58.540 align:middle line:84%
from that divine
aspect of light,

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:00.540 align:middle line:84%
energy, harmonics, whatever
you want to call it,

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:04.920 align:middle line:84%
inside-- you say God inside--
because you've separated

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.290 align:middle line:84%
yourself from it, is
you're not allowing it

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:09.340 align:middle line:84%
to manifest things
very naturally

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:10.660 align:middle line:90%
and easily as it should.

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:11.640 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: No.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:16.440 align:middle line:84%
It's time to be who you
are, pure and simple.

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:20.240 align:middle line:84%
So when I teach my
classes, I take my students

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.780 align:middle line:84%
on this journey
of self-discovery.

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And once they've
gotten to that point,

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:28.460 align:middle line:84%
then I show them how
to project energy,

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:33.110 align:middle line:84%
the process that I use in
healing, whatever it is they're

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:34.730 align:middle line:90%
wanting to become.

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Because not everybody's going to
be a healer, and not everyone's

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:39.970 align:middle line:90%
going to be an artist.

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:40.960 align:middle line:90%
But some will.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And some will be psychometrists,
or fill in the blanks.

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:48.036 align:middle line:84%
They'll be something, but
it's what they see themselves

00:23:48.036 --> 00:23:48.535 align:middle line:90%
as being.

00:23:48.535 --> 00:23:50.600 align:middle line:90%
And that's the important part.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.860 align:middle line:84%
Here are the tools to
get you to that point.

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:58.790 align:middle line:84%
So I try to make sure that every
bit of what I teach a person

00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:03.584 align:middle line:84%
is based in fact and that they
have a tangible bit of evidence

00:24:03.584 --> 00:24:04.750 align:middle line:90%
that it's actually occurred.

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:07.083 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, for you, it's
important, it sounds like,

00:24:07.083 --> 00:24:11.080 align:middle line:84%
that they have an experience
of being able to see energy,

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:11.777 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:24:11.777 --> 00:24:12.360 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Sure.

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
how do you begin

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.990 align:middle line:84%
working with people in that way
so they can start fine-tuning

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:20.220 align:middle line:84%
their abilities to
see the ordinarily

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:21.880 align:middle line:90%
unseen world about them?

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, I told
you about the guardian

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:26.960 align:middle line:84%
and how it lights
up the auric field.

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.910 align:middle line:84%
It's a certain
thing, you see it.

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:31.520 align:middle line:90%
It isn't imagined at all.

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.340 align:middle line:84%
So I built a much
larger device based

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:38.540 align:middle line:84%
on the same principles that
illuminates a much larger area,

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:41.760 align:middle line:84%
and groups of people can
see the aura at that point

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.420 align:middle line:90%
around themselves and others.

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And so I've used
this in the class

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:50.410 align:middle line:84%
so that they can take some time
and start seeing the energy.

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And once you see it, it's
like, how about that?

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:55.975 align:middle line:84%
And you're looking at the
energy around your hands.

00:24:55.975 --> 00:24:58.020 align:middle line:84%
The longer you watch
it, the more you

00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:02.045 align:middle line:84%
see little wisps of light,
little fibers coming off,

00:25:02.045 --> 00:25:04.320 align:middle line:90%
little sparks in the air.

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.109 align:middle line:84%
And the more you
practice, the more

00:25:06.109 --> 00:25:08.400 align:middle line:84%
you see with it, until finally
you don't need the tool.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.600 align:middle line:90%
You just do it automatically.

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I see
the progress evolving

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.640 align:middle line:90%
within each person.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And so from that
point, where they're

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.830 align:middle line:84%
able to now see their
aura and kind of marvel

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:26.470 align:middle line:84%
in the glory of
it all, then where

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:30.390 align:middle line:84%
do you go with that
in teaching people

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:34.890 align:middle line:84%
essentially to be the creator
of their own experience?

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:37.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, once you've
seen energy, it really

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:41.270 align:middle line:84%
throws a trigger in your mind,
because you probably saw it

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:43.290 align:middle line:84%
when you were a child,
and you were told, oh no,

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:44.254 align:middle line:90%
that's not there.

00:25:44.254 --> 00:25:45.170 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with you?

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:46.260 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I want to be accepted.

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:46.760 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.040 align:middle line:90%
OK, I won't see it.

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:51.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, once you've seen
it, it throws the switch.

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:52.660 align:middle line:90%
And now you're going to see it.

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:56.315 align:middle line:84%
And what you want to do
next is figure out, what

00:25:56.315 --> 00:25:57.820 align:middle line:90%
are you going to do with it?

00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:01.960 align:middle line:84%
You just want to see it
and watch it, or what?

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And so I show them the process
that I use to play with it.

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:12.080 align:middle line:84%
I show them how to focus
it, how to direct it,

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:13.770 align:middle line:84%
how to make it do
the things you're

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:17.600 align:middle line:84%
wanting it to do-- not by
force but just by cooperating

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:18.910 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And then once they
get to that point

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:27.250 align:middle line:84%
to where they've successfully
managed that, then I say,

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:30.270 align:middle line:90%
OK, here's a thing.

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:31.230 align:middle line:90%
Make it move.

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's a real simple
little toy, really.

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:38.190 align:middle line:84%
But it isn't going to move
unless you actually get

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:40.540 align:middle line:90%
the energy going just right.

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:41.705 align:middle line:90%
And without exception--

00:26:41.705 --> 00:26:42.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like telekinesis.

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:43.870 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: It is.

00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:45.200 align:middle line:90%
So I show them telekinesis.

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.380 align:middle line:84%
OK, now they've
seen that it's true

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:50.080 align:middle line:84%
and that can happen, what
will you do with this?

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.390 align:middle line:84%
Will you use it in your
painting, in your drawing?

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:53.640 align:middle line:90%
Will you use it in your music?

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:56.450 align:middle line:90%


00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:58.944 align:middle line:84%
You want to look
inside the body?

00:26:58.944 --> 00:27:00.860 align:middle line:84%
Project the energy in,
and just start looking,

00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:04.920 align:middle line:84%
see what's there,
the way that I do.

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:07.760 align:middle line:84%
It takes some time to really
develop that as a talent,

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:09.270 align:middle line:90%
just like anything.

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:10.770 align:middle line:84%
But if you want
to do it, why not?

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:11.270 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:14.120 align:middle line:90%


00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:19.710 align:middle line:84%
They get this tangible
response each step of the way.

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And in having done that, their
confidence grows and grows,

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:26.830 align:middle line:90%
and now they know.

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:30.330 align:middle line:84%
They're not believing, they're
not thinking, they know.

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:32.380 align:middle line:90%
And now, what can happen?

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:33.791 align:middle line:90%
It's up to them.

00:27:33.791 --> 00:27:35.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So at what
point in the journey,

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:40.280 align:middle line:84%
then, do people begin looking
into their own timelines,

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.065 align:middle line:84%
their own personal--
we call it history,

00:27:42.065 --> 00:27:46.480 align:middle line:84%
but you could say parallel
timelines and so on?

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.010 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Well, I don't know.

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:50.690 align:middle line:84%
It really depends on the
person and what they feel

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:52.490 align:middle line:90%
is appropriate for them.

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:54.910 align:middle line:84%
So I leave that part
of the personal journey

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:56.260 align:middle line:90%
in their hands.

00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you feel
there's value in that?

00:27:58.520 --> 00:27:59.730 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Not necessarily.

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:01.750 align:middle line:90%
People get lost in that.

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:05.820 align:middle line:84%
I just happen to know
a lot about my own.

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure there are
other people who do too.

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:09.160 align:middle line:90%
But here's the thing.

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:14.700 align:middle line:84%
It really doesn't matter
who you are-- I'm sorry,

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.640 align:middle line:90%
who you were in another life.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:22.020 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter what you did.

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:26.240 align:middle line:84%
What really matters
is this moment.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.785 align:middle line:84%
Who are you now, and
what are you doing?

00:28:28.785 --> 00:28:31.640 align:middle line:90%


00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:35.250 align:middle line:10%
And when you answer
those questions, whatever

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:42.480 align:middle line:10%
it is that you were before
and you had done before,

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:44.490 align:middle line:10%
it's like, what did
you have for breakfast

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:48.940 align:middle line:10%
in 1974 versus September?

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:50.440 align:middle line:90%
What did you have?

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:52.590 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I don't have a clue.

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:53.800 align:middle line:90%
It must have nourished you.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.760 align:middle line:90%
You're still here.

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what
about the notion-- I've

00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:00.340 align:middle line:84%
mucked around in past
lives here and there

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:02.010 align:middle line:90%
over the last few decades.

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And I find the value in
very specific things,

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:11.600 align:middle line:84%
such as if you
have a subconscious

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.290 align:middle line:84%
inclination towards something,
and you just can't figure it

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:17.720 align:middle line:84%
out, sometimes by
understanding, oh, I

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:20.290 align:middle line:84%
see that's not
necessarily from now,

00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:21.720 align:middle line:90%
I see what that came from--

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:22.720 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Well, that's fun stuff.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:23.344 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:23.344 --> 00:29:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And then it can
clarify and say, aha, I

00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:27.610 align:middle line:84%
knew I was feeling
it for a reason.

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost as
though it gives the mind

00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:33.990 align:middle line:84%
some kind of--
enough understanding

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:36.490 align:middle line:84%
that you can begin accepting
and then working on it.

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:37.850 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah, of course.

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:41.540 align:middle line:84%
That can work for all the good
things and all of the things

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:43.560 align:middle line:84%
that are detrimental
in your life.

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:46.250 align:middle line:84%
So I can see where
the benefit is of it.

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:48.320 align:middle line:84%
But I would say not
to get so wrapped up

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:51.775 align:middle line:84%
in it that it becomes more
of a focus than this moment.

00:29:51.775 --> 00:29:52.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:56.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Because there certainly
will be another lifetime.

00:29:56.070 --> 00:30:01.796 align:middle line:84%
And that being the case,
why not evolve now--

00:30:01.796 --> 00:30:02.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:06.159 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: --so the next one's
going to be even more fun?

00:30:06.159 --> 00:30:06.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:10.140 align:middle line:84%
I had another question along in
here that I wanted to ask you.

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:13.080 align:middle line:84%
When you're talking about
this kind of integration,

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:16.110 align:middle line:84%
this wholeness,
this peace, being

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:18.260 align:middle line:84%
the religion
throughout the cosmos

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:24.840 align:middle line:84%
and other developed places, how
do these beings view humans?

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:26.510 align:middle line:84%
Did they go through
the same schism

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:30.920 align:middle line:84%
of animal and highly developed
spirits kind of scrunched

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:34.650 align:middle line:84%
into one, or is this an
anomaly more on this planet?

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:36.550 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: It's not an anomaly.

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:39.375 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's important
to remember-- or not

00:30:39.375 --> 00:30:43.370 align:middle line:84%
to remember but to know--
that this world has

00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:46.389 align:middle line:84%
been kept from evolving
for a very long time.

00:30:46.389 --> 00:30:47.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Can you explain that?

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:48.640 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Certainly.

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:51.020 align:middle line:84%
This world's been used
as a point of harvesting

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:53.560 align:middle line:84%
for a long time by
beings that came here

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:57.630 align:middle line:84%
and used the resources of this
planet, including the people.

00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:01.090 align:middle line:84%
Keeping the people asleep
means that they can

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:03.020 align:middle line:90%
continue doing what they do.

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:05.090 align:middle line:84%
You see evidence
of it everywhere,

00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:07.820 align:middle line:84%
except it's hard to
put your finger on it

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:09.580 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, this
is this and this

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:15.510 align:middle line:84%
is that, because it falls into
such a grand scheme of things.

00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:17.070 align:middle line:84%
How did it work
for other worlds?

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:17.729 align:middle line:90%
Well--

00:31:17.729 --> 00:31:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did other worlds
go through similar processes

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:22.145 align:middle line:84%
where they were taken
advantage of as well perhaps?

00:31:22.145 --> 00:31:23.200 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Oh, certainly.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And they took advantage
of each other,

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.296 align:middle line:84%
and others took
advantage of them.

00:31:26.296 --> 00:31:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's just the
nature of life.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:33.890 align:middle line:84%
It's a part of a process where
we evolve and change and grow

00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:37.720 align:middle line:84%
and become greater than
we were the day before.

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:42.375 align:middle line:84%
Some of these places, the
people are-- their culture

00:31:42.375 --> 00:31:45.430 align:middle line:84%
and their civilization is
vastly older than here,

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:49.489 align:middle line:84%
and they've had fewer problems
there than we've had here.

00:31:49.489 --> 00:31:51.030 align:middle line:84%
So they've had more
of an opportunity

00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:54.510 align:middle line:84%
to grow unimpeded
or uninterrupted.

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:56.010 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't make
them any better,

00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:58.705 align:middle line:84%
it just means they happen
to have had an opportunity

00:31:58.705 --> 00:32:00.481 align:middle line:90%
that we didn't have.

00:32:00.481 --> 00:32:02.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how is that
viewed throughout the cosmos,

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:04.940 align:middle line:84%
looking at the human
species and what

00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:09.010 align:middle line:84%
we have been-- what we've gone
through and been subjected to

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:12.720 align:middle line:84%
and been blind to
with intention?

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:15.830 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, part of the
reason why people were brought

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:21.670 align:middle line:84%
here is to stop that process
of being used, to just put

00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:25.790 align:middle line:90%
an end to it, at least try.

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And as far as how other
worlds view the people here,

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:35.350 align:middle line:84%
well, they don't
feel sorry for them.

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:36.500 align:middle line:90%
There isn't any of that.

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:39.670 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of a co-dependent
state of affairs.

00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:41.980 align:middle line:84%
But instead, they just
look at it and go,

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:43.230 align:middle line:90%
well, it's like this.

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And if we do this and this,
then it might get better.

00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:48.220 align:middle line:90%
They're very realistic about it.

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:55.700 align:middle line:84%
People will be people depending
upon the cultural circumstance,

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:59.430 align:middle line:84%
how the society is organized,
the opportunities that

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:01.810 align:middle line:90%
are brought to bear.

00:33:01.810 --> 00:33:03.840 align:middle line:84%
These all have a
direct relationship

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:09.480 align:middle line:84%
on how an entire world of
people will move in a direction.

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:12.190 align:middle line:84%
There are always
going to be bad guys.

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:15.140 align:middle line:84%
There are always going to be
the people who have evil intent.

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:18.500 align:middle line:90%
They're psychopathic.

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:21.424 align:middle line:84%
There are always going to be
things falling out of the sky.

00:33:21.424 --> 00:33:23.090 align:middle line:84%
There are always going
to be bad things.

00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:27.050 align:middle line:84%
But there are always going
to be good things too.

00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And if more and
more people learned

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:33.640 align:middle line:84%
how to manage themselves and
the energy running through them,

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:35.450 align:middle line:84%
the decision to
make things better

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:39.840 align:middle line:84%
could be a process
where evolution

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:47.540 align:middle line:84%
is dynamically changed so that
it could happen more quickly.

00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:53.020 align:middle line:84%
Let's take for an example,
people can bend a spoon.

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:53.640 align:middle line:90%
I've done it.

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.110 align:middle line:90%
Other people have done it.

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:56.080 align:middle line:90%
No big magic there.

00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:59.940 align:middle line:84%
It's just like,
wow, how about that?

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And there's a quantum of
energy involved with that.

00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:08.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, what if we had 10 people
that could bend a spoon,

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:13.110 align:middle line:90%
and they focused on one spoon?

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:13.929 align:middle line:90%
What might happen?

00:34:13.929 --> 00:34:16.984 align:middle line:84%
It would probably bend
a lot easier, I think.

00:34:16.984 --> 00:34:17.900 align:middle line:90%
They're not competing.

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:20.310 align:middle line:84%
They're just cooperating
and doing it.

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:26.034 align:middle line:84%
Well, what if there were 1,000
people focused on the spoon?

00:34:26.034 --> 00:34:28.780 align:middle line:90%


00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And the spoon in this
particular circumstance

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:36.050 align:middle line:84%
represents what we
as a society think

00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:39.230 align:middle line:84%
is no longer necessary
in order for this world

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:42.189 align:middle line:84%
to continue evolving,
things keeping us back.

00:34:42.189 --> 00:34:45.190 align:middle line:90%


00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:46.880 align:middle line:90%
Let's say there's a drought.

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.580 align:middle line:90%
There's a drought in California.

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:51.080 align:middle line:84%
Farmers are losing their
homes and so on and so forth.

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.940 align:middle line:90%
Farms are failing.

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:56.929 align:middle line:84%
What if 1,000 people who can
bend spoons said, you know,

00:34:56.929 --> 00:34:57.780 align:middle line:90%
that's just too bad.

00:34:57.780 --> 00:34:58.790 align:middle line:90%
We need to change that.

00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:02.210 align:middle line:84%
Let's just focus on having
it rain there-- not crazy,

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:05.640 align:middle line:84%
but rain at the rate where
they will come back and things

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:07.350 align:middle line:90%
will be fine.

00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:10.475 align:middle line:90%
That could be done.

00:35:10.475 --> 00:35:11.130 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no.

00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:13.300 align:middle line:84%
There's an asteroid
heading for the Earth.

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:16.780 align:middle line:84%
It's going to just
wipe out life.

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:21.590 align:middle line:84%
What if everyone took
a look and said, yeah,

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:23.690 align:middle line:84%
this thing's come around
a few times before,

00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:27.750 align:middle line:84%
and this has happened on
several occasions in this world.

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:31.110 align:middle line:84%
We've evolved to the point where
it no longer needs to be there.

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:34.310 align:middle line:90%
Let's just cause it to be gone.

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:37.560 align:middle line:90%
And poof, it vanishes.

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:39.530 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to go and escape.

00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:41.280 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
go, oh my god, I

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.030 align:middle line:90%
hope the UFOs come pick us up.

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:44.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just alter the event.

00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:47.040 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: So it
isn't necessary now.

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:49.190 align:middle line:90%
That volcano wants to erupt.

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:51.270 align:middle line:90%
No, it doesn't need to.

00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:51.770 align:middle line:90%
Peace.

00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:54.510 align:middle line:90%


00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:58.512 align:middle line:84%
These things are possible,
and they're very real.

00:35:58.512 --> 00:35:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
reason why I've been

00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:01.430 align:middle line:84%
trying to teach
these classes, is

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:04.610 align:middle line:90%
so people can become empowered.

00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:09.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So as a sense,
mostly post World War II,

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:13.020 align:middle line:84%
we become increasingly aware
of the presence of grace,

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:13.630 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:16.550 align:middle line:84%
Those are the ones
most obviously depicted

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:18.670 align:middle line:90%
and most often depicted.

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And these are ones we talked
about in our last interview

00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:25.090 align:middle line:84%
as not necessarily having
the human being's best

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:26.600 align:middle line:90%
interest at heart.

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And I'm getting ready to do an
interview regarding an exchange

00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:35.350 align:middle line:84%
program in the military having
to do with human beings,

00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:40.590 align:middle line:84%
select human beings chosen, to
go to another planetary system

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:43.180 align:middle line:84%
and witness life
on another planet.

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Do you think it was important
over the last 60 years

00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:48.262 align:middle line:84%
for this particular
group of beings--

00:36:48.262 --> 00:36:49.720 align:middle line:84%
and I know there
are others and I'd

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:53.840 align:middle line:84%
like you to comment on that--
to come into our awareness?

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:55.560 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: They came
into our awareness

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:59.830 align:middle line:84%
because we're
becoming more aware.

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:02.250 align:middle line:84%
They've been here
for a very long time.

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:03.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:06.310 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, do you think that
coming into our awareness

00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:09.640 align:middle line:84%
is so that we can
actually potentially break

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.630 align:middle line:90%
the cycle of control?

00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:13.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, that's
the whole point.

00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:18.280 align:middle line:84%
Because until that cycle
of control has been abated,

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:21.140 align:middle line:84%
then anything that
this world tries

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:25.830 align:middle line:84%
to do to get past a certain
point will be equally abated.

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:28.310 align:middle line:90%
It'll be very, very difficult.

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:30.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're dealing with
people-- these are people.

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:32.059 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just because
they don't look

00:37:32.059 --> 00:37:34.750 align:middle line:84%
like what we think people look
like, but they're still people.

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And these are people that
have a vested interest

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:49.430 align:middle line:84%
in keeping this world in a very
confused and subservient state.

00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And their existence
and ability to work

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:56.090 align:middle line:84%
here is more and
more being interfered

00:37:56.090 --> 00:37:59.460 align:middle line:84%
with by people like
myself and others who

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:02.890 align:middle line:90%
know how to go up against them.

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:04.531 align:middle line:84%
Fear is the one
thing that they use,

00:38:04.531 --> 00:38:05.780 align:middle line:90%
and manipulation is the other.

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:06.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:07.830 align:middle line:90%
Keeping people in fear.

00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:10.480 align:middle line:90%


00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:14.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: I remember when--
I've gone up against them

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:17.240 align:middle line:84%
a few times in the way
they've tried to use

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:21.130 align:middle line:90%
fear and intimidation on me.

00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:22.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Telepathically?

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:25.130 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Oh, it's
all telepathic,

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:28.420 align:middle line:84%
but you don't know
that it's telepathic.

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I just look
at it and go, really?

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:34.140 align:middle line:90%


00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And then I get a little
indignant with them.

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:44.020 align:middle line:84%
But if this world
is going to evolve,

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:46.900 align:middle line:84%
then they're going to
have to get beyond this.

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:49.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You said in
our last conversation,

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:51.670 align:middle line:84%
these beings aren't
working alone.

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And so not to frighten
people, I don't

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:56.350 align:middle line:84%
want to go-- this
isn't about fright.

00:38:56.350 --> 00:39:00.300 align:middle line:84%
This is literally about
awareness, so one can say,

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:02.344 align:middle line:90%
you know what, enough?

00:39:02.344 --> 00:39:04.010 align:middle line:84%
That's really where
I'm going with this.

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:05.916 align:middle line:90%
So who do they work with?

00:39:05.916 --> 00:39:07.040 align:middle line:90%
Who are some of the groups?

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And who are some of the really
lovely groups that are also

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:13.330 align:middle line:84%
assisting us, maybe
even between dimensions

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:15.210 align:middle line:90%
or from other places?

00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:18.640 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, I
don't have names.

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:22.775 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to give you
descriptions without pictures,

00:39:22.775 --> 00:39:24.430 align:middle line:84%
and I don't have
any to show you.

00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:29.380 align:middle line:84%
But there are several,
suffice it to say,

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:32.560 align:middle line:84%
without a way of really
validating this for you.

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:33.480 align:middle line:90%
And I wish I could.

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:40.430 align:middle line:84%
But there are several
groups of people

00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:42.820 align:middle line:84%
that are not looking
at this world

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:45.860 align:middle line:84%
as though it's any
more than a cow lot.

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:47.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A cow lot?

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:47.770 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Mm-hmm.

00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:50.630 align:middle line:84%
It's a farm, and
it's being farmed.

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And we are unevolved, unaware,
and self-indulged, easily

00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:02.710 align:middle line:84%
controlled, easily manipulated,
feed them what they want

00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:04.800 align:middle line:84%
and they'll be
happy, and they'll

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:09.140 align:middle line:84%
continue doing exactly what
we need them to do and just

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:14.016 align:middle line:84%
be mindless and go
about their business.

00:40:14.016 --> 00:40:16.390 align:middle line:84%
But watch out for the ones
who are thinking because those

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:20.280 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that are
dangerous to those

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:22.870 align:middle line:90%
that control this world.

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:26.005 align:middle line:84%
And I think if you listen
to people like David Icke,

00:40:26.005 --> 00:40:27.120 align:middle line:90%
you get a glimpse.

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:30.730 align:middle line:90%


00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:32.982 align:middle line:84%
There are just several
different ones.

00:40:32.982 --> 00:40:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He speaks
specifically of reptilians.

00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:36.150 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: He does.

00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And some others,
but mostly the reptilians.

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:40.740 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: The reptilians
he's focused on.

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:42.070 align:middle line:90%
But there's the grays.

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:45.480 align:middle line:84%
There's these short guys
who are covered in hair.

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:47.500 align:middle line:90%
They're not very nice.

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:51.610 align:middle line:84%
So there are several
different representations

00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:53.935 align:middle line:90%
within this collective.

00:40:53.935 --> 00:40:55.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
work in the shadows?

00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:58.182 align:middle line:84%
Do they work also in
companion with the military

00:40:58.182 --> 00:41:00.140 align:middle line:84%
and some of the power
structures of the planet?

00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:02.580 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, they have,
because they offered them

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:03.774 align:middle line:90%
weapons.

00:41:03.774 --> 00:41:04.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Advanced weaponry?

00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:05.740 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Sure.

00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And of course it
wasn't until too late

00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:09.640 align:middle line:84%
they discovered,
well, the weapons they

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:11.940 align:middle line:90%
gave us don't work on them.

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:13.445 align:middle line:90%
So it's a bit of a conundrum.

00:41:13.445 --> 00:41:16.430 align:middle line:90%


00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:21.190 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, they are
scary people if you're

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:24.480 align:middle line:84%
allowed to go down the
scary road with them.

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:25.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And we talked off-camera
about the fact

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:29.960 align:middle line:84%
I was going to be doing
this other interview.

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And you said, indeed,
that you were aware,

00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:35.360 align:middle line:84%
there have been such projects
where people, groups of people,

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.460 align:middle line:90%
have been taken to other places.

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And can you tell us
maybe just an example

00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:41.990 align:middle line:84%
of-- because I'm
not saying they're

00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:43.580 align:middle line:90%
necessarily one and the same.

00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:45.800 align:middle line:84%
There may be multiple
projects throughout history

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:47.310 align:middle line:90%
that have occurred, right?

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And can you talk about
what that kind of program

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:52.790 align:middle line:84%
might look like and one
that you may know of,

00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:55.630 align:middle line:84%
where there's an exchange
program of sorts?

00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: The problem
with an exchange program

00:41:57.870 --> 00:41:59.860 align:middle line:84%
is being able to trust
the people that you're

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:00.700 align:middle line:90%
having the exchange with.

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:01.283 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:01.283 --> 00:42:03.432 align:middle line:84%
Those are some of the
questions I'm going to ask.

00:42:03.432 --> 00:42:05.640 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And how do you know
that you can trust them,

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:08.760 align:middle line:84%
just because they've given
you a psychic impression you

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:10.670 align:middle line:90%
should trust them?

00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:14.160 align:middle line:84%
There was an incident going on
down in South America, Brazil,

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:18.290 align:middle line:84%
where a UFO was showing up
periodically-- big, big UFO.

00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:20.530 align:middle line:84%
And people were going up
to the top of the mountain.

00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And finally, after
several weeks of this,

00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:27.740 align:middle line:84%
the people had someone else
there with them saying, well,

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:30.160 align:middle line:84%
would you like to go with
us, take you for a ride.

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:32.035 align:middle line:84%
So they took them for
a ride and brought them

00:42:32.035 --> 00:42:32.868 align:middle line:90%
back a couple times.

00:42:32.868 --> 00:42:35.770 align:middle line:90%


00:42:35.770 --> 00:42:37.650 align:middle line:90%
Then it all stopped.

00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:40.300 align:middle line:84%
But the people that had
been taken for a ride,

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:42.440 align:middle line:90%
they never came back.

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:43.495 align:middle line:90%
They're just gone.

00:42:43.495 --> 00:42:46.860 align:middle line:90%


00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:48.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't take
rides with strangers.

00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:50.970 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: That's true.

00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:52.230 align:middle line:90%
And I was warned off about it.

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:53.771 align:middle line:84%
I was going to go
and investigate it.

00:42:53.771 --> 00:42:56.647 align:middle line:84%
I was warned off
about it by a group.

00:42:56.647 --> 00:42:58.230 align:middle line:84%
They said they were
from the Pleiades.

00:42:58.230 --> 00:42:59.563 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if they are or not.

00:42:59.563 --> 00:43:03.040 align:middle line:84%
But after someone gets
sight of a UFO and says

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:06.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm from the Pleiades, who
am I to argue with them?

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:08.150 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, they
were very nice folks.

00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And I knew them
for several years.

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And they said, if
you go with them,

00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:13.620 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing we
can do to help you.

00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:16.560 align:middle line:84%
They're not who
you think they are.

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:18.750 align:middle line:90%
They're not humans.

00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:20.040 align:middle line:90%
They're not people.

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:22.292 align:middle line:90%


00:43:22.292 --> 00:43:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're so
intrigued with the phenomena

00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:26.820 align:middle line:84%
that we are standing there
at the base of the mountain,

00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:28.307 align:middle line:90%
take me, take me.

00:43:28.307 --> 00:43:30.390 align:middle line:84%
Human beings do that,
because we're giving, again,

00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:31.270 align:middle line:90%
our power away.

00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:33.805 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, it's like
the segment in the movie

00:43:33.805 --> 00:43:34.800 align:middle line:90%
"Independence Day."

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:37.450 align:middle line:84%
They're all standing up there
with the signs, dancing around.

00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And the whole building
just vaporizes.

00:43:41.290 --> 00:43:44.490 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, But I mean, you see
UFOs, and of course you're

00:43:44.490 --> 00:43:45.560 align:middle line:90%
going to be intrigued.

00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:48.740 align:middle line:84%
Someone comes up and says,
hi, I'm from another world.

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:51.330 align:middle line:90%
And this is my flying saucer.

00:43:51.330 --> 00:43:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go for a
ride if you'd like to, baby.

00:43:56.770 --> 00:44:02.155 align:middle line:84%
And it's probably
not a good idea.

00:44:02.155 --> 00:44:03.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's reverse it.

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:05.570 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about some
beings that are there

00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:10.590 align:middle line:84%
between spaces that
are also really hoping

00:44:10.590 --> 00:44:12.630 align:middle line:84%
that we can make
this leap and wake up

00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:14.900 align:middle line:84%
beyond the illusion
and the mind control.

00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:18.340 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, and these beings
in those in-between spaces,

00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:23.730 align:middle line:84%
we have a tendency to think
of them as spiritual beings

00:44:23.730 --> 00:44:28.900 align:middle line:84%
or, well, we have a lot of
different terminology for them.

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:31.910 align:middle line:84%
But there is an
alternate universe.

00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:36.330 align:middle line:84%
There's a part that is
in between universes.

00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:38.950 align:middle line:84%
This is the way it was
explained to me, anyway.

00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:41.360 align:middle line:84%
It's like, here's the
one boundary for one

00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:43.520 align:middle line:84%
universe, another
boundary for the other.

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:46.210 align:middle line:84%
There's something in
here in the middle.

00:44:46.210 --> 00:44:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's in this part
the pure energy resides.

00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's in this place where
pure energy resides that there

00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:55.990 align:middle line:90%
isn't time nor distance.

00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And this is the energy
spot that I work

00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:00.010 align:middle line:90%
from when I work on a person.

00:45:00.010 --> 00:45:03.250 align:middle line:90%
Time and distance don't exist.

00:45:03.250 --> 00:45:10.860 align:middle line:84%
In that particular
area, there are beings.

00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:12.335 align:middle line:90%
And we might say they're angels.

00:45:12.335 --> 00:45:15.960 align:middle line:84%
We might say it's divine
or a divine source.

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:18.200 align:middle line:84%
Or there's all sorts of
things you call them.

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:21.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what they
are, but they're there.

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And they're vastly more evolved
than anything that I've ever

00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:32.530 align:middle line:84%
encountered, and very smart and
very willing to work with you.

00:45:32.530 --> 00:45:34.270 align:middle line:84%
But even in that
realm, there are

00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:39.636 align:middle line:84%
those who would very much
like to take advantage of you,

00:45:39.636 --> 00:45:42.810 align:middle line:84%
if you're not familiar
with the territory.

00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:45.690 align:middle line:84%
It's like this
dichotomy that exists

00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:48.180 align:middle line:84%
no matter where you go,
what state you go into,

00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:51.530 align:middle line:84%
what level you happen
to venture towards.

00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:54.140 align:middle line:84%
Getting to the point
where you are really

00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:57.847 align:middle line:84%
focused in and sure of yourself
protects you from that.

00:45:57.847 --> 00:45:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what I
was going to ask you next,

00:45:59.930 --> 00:46:06.390 align:middle line:84%
yes-- holding our own integrity
of what we relate to as us.

00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And you know,
it's when you feel--

00:46:09.970 --> 00:46:12.660 align:middle line:84%
and I know it's an ambiguous
term, but it's true.

00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:17.579 align:middle line:84%
When you feel that something
isn't right, act upon it.

00:46:17.579 --> 00:46:18.120 align:middle line:90%
Do something.

00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:20.920 align:middle line:84%
Don't go, oh, I didn't have
a good feeling about that,

00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:22.380 align:middle line:90%
but I went anyway.

00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:25.230 align:middle line:90%
I wish I had my arm now.

00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:27.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:29.100 align:middle line:84%
So start using these
subtle feelings.

00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:31.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that has to be a
really huge part of it.

00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:31.895 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: It is.

00:46:31.895 --> 00:46:34.302 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For me,
I mean, there have

00:46:34.302 --> 00:46:35.760 align:middle line:84%
been times where
I haven't listened

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:38.567 align:middle line:84%
to my feelings or my
guidance, but not very often.

00:46:38.567 --> 00:46:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And when I haven't, I've gotten
myself in some serious trouble

00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:43.520 align:middle line:84%
a couple of times when I
was warned off and thought,

00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:45.310 align:middle line:84%
ah, what the heck,
let's do it anyway.

00:46:45.310 --> 00:46:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And so this is really
critical, is the noise

00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:52.990 align:middle line:84%
that's being created surrounding
our lives is really keeping us

00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:54.570 align:middle line:90%
from that voice.

00:46:54.570 --> 00:46:56.020 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: That's true.

00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:59.200 align:middle line:90%
Finding peace within yourself.

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I tell
my students as well,

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:09.050 align:middle line:84%
is that the first step in doing
any of this is to be at peace.

00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:11.160 align:middle line:90%
Get still and quiet inside.

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:13.050 align:middle line:84%
Be at peace--
whatever that means,

00:47:13.050 --> 00:47:14.810 align:middle line:90%
however you choose to do it.

00:47:14.810 --> 00:47:16.877 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes putting
on the headphones

00:47:16.877 --> 00:47:18.460 align:middle line:84%
and playing rock and
roll, and that'll

00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:20.040 align:middle line:90%
bring you a state of peace.

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:21.720 align:middle line:90%
Strange but true.

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:23.790 align:middle line:84%
Other times, it's
sitting by a waterfall,

00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:26.335 align:middle line:84%
or just being in an
isolation chamber.

00:47:26.335 --> 00:47:27.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Find that still point.

00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Yeah, the
still point is really

00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:30.731 align:middle line:84%
what you're looking
for, because it's

00:47:30.731 --> 00:47:33.862 align:middle line:84%
that still point that
everything else emerges from.

00:47:33.862 --> 00:47:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So find
ways to be quiet.

00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:38.009 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, we don't have
a lot of time left,

00:47:38.009 --> 00:47:39.550 align:middle line:84%
but we have enough
time that I wanted

00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:42.270 align:middle line:84%
to get into some of your
travels far and wide,

00:47:42.270 --> 00:47:46.750 align:middle line:84%
because you really hunt
down the stories that

00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:50.751 align:middle line:84%
seem to have what we
would consider mystery.

00:47:50.751 --> 00:47:52.500 align:middle line:84%
But to you, there's
something else in them

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:53.780 align:middle line:90%
that you're looking for.

00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And Id' like to have you share
with us some of the places

00:47:57.570 --> 00:47:59.970 align:middle line:84%
you've been and some
of the discoveries

00:47:59.970 --> 00:48:03.340 align:middle line:84%
that you've made along the
way and why you're doing this.

00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, we'll
start with why first.

00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:07.615 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I'm doing
it-- I'm not doing it alone.

00:48:07.615 --> 00:48:09.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing it with Kathy.

00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And Kathy is the most
incredible person I know.

00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:16.760 align:middle line:84%
She's my hero and an
amazing researcher.

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:19.580 align:middle line:84%
So the reason we're
doing it is because we

00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:24.780 align:middle line:84%
want to bring more knowledge to
ourselves, and in the process

00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:27.660 align:middle line:84%
be able to share our findings
with others who are also

00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:30.380 align:middle line:84%
curious about such
things, whether it's

00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:34.090 align:middle line:84%
ancient sites or ancient
mystical practices,

00:48:34.090 --> 00:48:36.410 align:middle line:90%
whatever it might be.

00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:37.260 align:middle line:90%
Where we go?

00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:39.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have gone
all over the world.

00:48:39.590 --> 00:48:43.460 align:middle line:84%
We've gone to South
America, Central America,

00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:48.040 align:middle line:84%
gone to Europe, and of course,
all over North America.

00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And we're trying to find
details that tell us

00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:58.930 align:middle line:84%
more about this world
and the ancient way

00:48:58.930 --> 00:49:03.230 align:middle line:84%
that it was, because history
as we know it, what we've been

00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:06.080 align:middle line:90%
fed, is just a bunch of lies.

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:09.800 align:middle line:84%
The details have been obscured,
and there's a reason for that.

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:11.860 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
it is exactly,

00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:14.580 align:middle line:84%
but we are trying to find
out what the details are,

00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:17.160 align:middle line:84%
and maybe that will tell us
why they are being obscured.

00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:21.730 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's been done
because if we know our past

00:49:21.730 --> 00:49:23.730 align:middle line:90%
we'll understand who we are.

00:49:23.730 --> 00:49:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And the people who
control this world

00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:29.850 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that are wanting
us to stay unenlightened,

00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:30.950 align:middle line:90%
uninformed.

00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:33.767 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what have been some
of the most startling artifacts

00:49:33.767 --> 00:49:35.350 align:middle line:84%
or discoveries you've
come across that

00:49:35.350 --> 00:49:37.490 align:middle line:90%
really were big ahas?

00:49:37.490 --> 00:49:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, we discovered
something called the Doomsday

00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:45.590 align:middle line:84%
Stone in 2000, down in a very
dangerous part of Peru, North

00:49:45.590 --> 00:49:48.010 align:middle line:90%
Central Peru.

00:49:48.010 --> 00:49:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Kathy found a human footprint
on top of a mountain

00:49:52.230 --> 00:50:00.150 align:middle line:84%
in Bolivia that is in
sandstone composite that's

00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:03.030 align:middle line:84%
a human footprint over
2 million years old,

00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:04.327 align:middle line:90%
maybe older than that even.

00:50:04.327 --> 00:50:06.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The same size
as humans are today?

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:08.522 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: It was about
size seven to eight.

00:50:08.522 --> 00:50:11.050 align:middle line:90%


00:50:11.050 --> 00:50:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Don't know if it
was male or female.

00:50:12.550 --> 00:50:14.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that was a couple
million years ago is the point.

00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:16.160 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: It was a few
million years ago when

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:18.040 align:middle line:84%
the Andes weren't there
and it was a swamp,

00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:21.400 align:middle line:90%
so however long that was.

00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Finding different things
about common sites--

00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:26.770 align:middle line:90%
for example, Chichen Itza.

00:50:26.770 --> 00:50:29.610 align:middle line:84%
Why did the Chichens
leave Chichen Itza?

00:50:29.610 --> 00:50:31.920 align:middle line:90%
They just abandoned this place.

00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:33.960 align:middle line:84%
They say it was because
of crops or whatever.

00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:35.460 align:middle line:90%
No, it wasn't.

00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:36.670 align:middle line:90%
Kathy discovered why.

00:50:36.670 --> 00:50:37.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why?

00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:43.790 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: A huge comet came over,
caused all kinds of failures.

00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:46.394 align:middle line:84%
And the people of
Chichen Itza left.

00:50:46.394 --> 00:50:47.810 align:middle line:84%
So she followed
them to where they

00:50:47.810 --> 00:50:52.760 align:middle line:84%
went and found that eight years
later, they started a new city

00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:55.860 align:middle line:90%
in the highlands of Colombia.

00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:58.560 align:middle line:84%
So you know, we're
finding these things,

00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:01.080 align:middle line:84%
we're looking for these
details, and we're

00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:04.880 align:middle line:84%
knowing inside
ourselves that there's

00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:07.560 align:middle line:84%
something way older
than us that's

00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:09.830 align:middle line:90%
still out there to be found.

00:51:09.830 --> 00:51:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And these way older places
should have a library

00:51:15.110 --> 00:51:18.250 align:middle line:84%
because everyone liked
to keep their records.

00:51:18.250 --> 00:51:21.870 align:middle line:84%
Everyone felt that
knowledge was important,

00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:26.820 align:middle line:84%
and we want to find this
and bring it forward.

00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I know that
you have made connection

00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:33.927 align:middle line:84%
with Klaus Dona, who is just
one of my favorite people.

00:51:33.927 --> 00:51:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: He's a great guy.

00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:36.135 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He's a great guy.

00:51:36.135 --> 00:51:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And I know he's onto some
really interesting discoveries

00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:42.030 align:middle line:84%
with his little mini team over
there in Europe right now.

00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:43.950 align:middle line:84%
Can you give us just
a peek without going

00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:46.350 align:middle line:84%
into any detail of some
of what looks like may

00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:48.540 align:middle line:90%
be emerging before long?

00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:51.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, I really
can't go into too much of it,

00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:56.680 align:middle line:84%
but it looks like there are
cross-cultural circumstances

00:51:56.680 --> 00:52:00.263 align:middle line:84%
going back to this really,
really old thing, age

00:52:00.263 --> 00:52:05.840 align:middle line:84%
that I was talking about,
and how this opens up

00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:08.760 align:middle line:90%
a whole new vista.

00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:11.180 align:middle line:84%
We thought it was
this, and suddenly

00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:15.580 align:middle line:84%
no, that was just a
little thing here.

00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:16.850 align:middle line:90%
It was actually that.

00:52:16.850 --> 00:52:20.070 align:middle line:84%
As it's this great
picture of what happened.

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:25.570 align:middle line:84%
We know that 48,000 years ago,
there was a supernova close

00:52:25.570 --> 00:52:27.060 align:middle line:90%
to the Earth.

00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:29.130 align:middle line:84%
We know that it
extinguished life

00:52:29.130 --> 00:52:32.730 align:middle line:84%
on one side of the planet
because of the gamma radiation.

00:52:32.730 --> 00:52:36.490 align:middle line:84%
It happened on the
Asian-Australian portion--

00:52:36.490 --> 00:52:37.240 align:middle line:90%
gone.

00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:40.220 align:middle line:84%
We know that 7,000
years later, the Earth

00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:43.070 align:middle line:84%
was starting to get hit
from the debris of this.

00:52:43.070 --> 00:52:46.615 align:middle line:84%
And we know that there
were people who survived.

00:52:46.615 --> 00:52:49.550 align:middle line:90%


00:52:49.550 --> 00:52:51.170 align:middle line:90%
And they went underground.

00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:53.600 align:middle line:84%
We know they took their
records with them.

00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And then they reemerged, and
it became an entirely new world

00:52:57.060 --> 00:52:58.020 align:middle line:90%
for them.

00:52:58.020 --> 00:52:59.603 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And where
did they reemerge?

00:52:59.603 --> 00:53:00.970 align:middle line:90%
Which culture was that?

00:53:00.970 --> 00:53:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, we don't know
the name of the culture.

00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:07.330 align:middle line:84%
They were just called
the shining ones.

00:53:07.330 --> 00:53:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's because they
dusted themselves with gold

00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:11.940 align:middle line:84%
because they couldn't stand the
sun since the atmosphere had

00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:12.440 align:middle line:90%
been taken.

00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:15.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And where in the
world did this emergence occur?

00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:18.520 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Euphrates Valley.

00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:22.590 align:middle line:84%
If you take a look into the
work of Edmund Marriage,

00:53:22.590 --> 00:53:24.723 align:middle line:84%
you'll find all kinds--
and there's another fella.

00:53:24.723 --> 00:53:26.150 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember his name now.

00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:31.940 align:middle line:84%
But Edmund Marriage has got
a wealth of information.

00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:32.994 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is he modern?

00:53:32.994 --> 00:53:34.064 align:middle line:90%
A modern writer?

00:53:34.064 --> 00:53:34.730 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Mm-hmm.

00:53:34.730 --> 00:53:36.200 align:middle line:90%
I've had him on my show.

00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:37.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.880 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like I need to find
out about this guy's work.

00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:40.930 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Amazing.

00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:44.325 align:middle line:84%
He's right up there with Klaus
Dona as far as incredible.

00:53:44.325 --> 00:53:45.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Artifacts
and so forth?

00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:46.400 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:47.060 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: The details
are staggering.

00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's basically over on the
European side of the world.

00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking over
here saying, wait a minute,

00:53:57.650 --> 00:54:00.360 align:middle line:84%
the same thing happened
and it's over here too.

00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking for that,
Kathy and I and Klaus Dona.

00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:09.810 align:middle line:84%
So these things are all kind
of merging and coming together.

00:54:09.810 --> 00:54:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And as long as information
is being shared,

00:54:13.390 --> 00:54:15.990 align:middle line:84%
then it helps all of
us to move forward.

00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:18.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, to start
remembering who we are.

00:54:18.210 --> 00:54:20.426 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And that's what
we started Xpeditions TV.

00:54:20.426 --> 00:54:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I was going to
ask you, do you allow people

00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:24.530 align:middle line:84%
to come along on
expeditions with you,

00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:26.767 align:middle line:84%
or do you usually
travel lightly?

00:54:26.767 --> 00:54:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: It depends.

00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:30.480 align:middle line:90%
We open it up for folks.

00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:32.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't have a problem
bringing people along,

00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:37.430 align:middle line:84%
so long as they understand,
if we find artifacts

00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:39.200 align:middle line:90%
they don't touch it.

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:44.250 align:middle line:84%
If they have to have certain
things in place-- these shoes,

00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:49.910 align:middle line:84%
these tents, these
food types-- as long

00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:54.349 align:middle line:84%
as they abide by the
criteria that I put down.

00:54:54.349 --> 00:54:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's not because I'm
trying to be a dictator,

00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:57.720 align:middle line:90%
but we've done it.

00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:00.147 align:middle line:90%
We know how dangerous it is.

00:55:00.147 --> 00:55:02.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it sounds like
you have a really exciting--

00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:04.980 align:middle line:84%
and in fact, maybe
even in a few months

00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:07.570 align:middle line:84%
you have this one possibility
to check out this thing

00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:09.670 align:middle line:84%
that you thought was
this that's this.

00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And once that happens, maybe
you can come back on the show

00:55:12.490 --> 00:55:14.397 align:middle line:90%
and tell us what you found.

00:55:14.397 --> 00:55:15.480 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And part of the vehicle
for doing this just

00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:23.760 align:middle line:84%
happened to start evolving
just a couple of weeks ago.

00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:26.650 align:middle line:84%
I've been invited to become the
bass player for a band called

00:55:26.650 --> 00:55:30.000 align:middle line:90%
Terranomaly, which is huge.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And they're going
to the Grammys.

00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And that could turn
into a vehicle that

00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:38.620 align:middle line:84%
allows us to get even farther
out, because Terranomaly

00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:42.710 align:middle line:84%
is all about getting this higher
awareness and this information

00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:43.940 align:middle line:90%
forward.

00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:50.080 align:middle line:10%
So there are key pieces
just linking together.

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:52.910 align:middle line:10%
And Kathy continues
to do her research,

00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:56.370 align:middle line:10%
and there are incredible
things coming out of that.

00:55:56.370 --> 00:55:59.040 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, I'm sure if we talk
again in another couple months,

00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:00.587 align:middle line:10%
there'll be more to tell you.

00:56:00.587 --> 00:56:01.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very good.

00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And the last couple hours have
been absolutely delightful.

00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And also, just to
let the viewers

00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:09.141 align:middle line:84%
know, Klaus Dona's work,
I've done a couple interviews

00:56:09.141 --> 00:56:09.640 align:middle line:90%
with him.

00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:12.590 align:middle line:84%
The last one was about two
years ago I think in the summer.

00:56:12.590 --> 00:56:15.300 align:middle line:84%
So everybody can take a look
at some of his artifacts

00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:16.550 align:middle line:90%
and what he's been working on.

00:56:16.550 --> 00:56:18.216 align:middle line:84%
Then we'll take your
piece of the story,

00:56:18.216 --> 00:56:20.001 align:middle line:84%
and we'll blend it all
together next time.

00:56:20.001 --> 00:56:21.000 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Sounds perfect.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.458 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank
you so much, Jerry,

00:56:22.458 --> 00:56:26.070 align:middle line:84%
for sharing-- what an amazing
and unique tale-- with us.

00:56:26.070 --> 00:56:27.930 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate that.

00:56:27.930 --> 00:56:30.820 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: I am so privileged
to have been invited.

00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:31.749 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:56:31.749 --> 00:56:34.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again, you can connect
with Jerry's work, including

00:56:34.290 --> 00:56:36.980 align:middle line:84%
his protocols on healing
and all of his adventures,

00:56:39.064 --> 00:56:43.310 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, thank you for
