00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:20.370 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: In my last
conversation with Freddy Silva,

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.610 align:middle line:10%
we spoke of the heralded and
mysterious Knights Templar.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.710 align:middle line:10%
We learned of their roots
in Burgundy, France,

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.710 align:middle line:10%
stretching to Jerusalem
and what was to become

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.300 align:middle line:10%
a new state, Portugal.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.130 align:middle line:84%
But in this story,
we're not seeing what

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.340 align:middle line:90%
the History Channel shows us.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.370 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.170 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY SILVA: Oh.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is a
completely new piece.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And this is the part that,
really, your work is based on,

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.766 align:middle line:84%
that's been
completely overlooked.

00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:43.107 align:middle line:84%
And you have a personal
kind of dog in the fight

00:00:43.107 --> 00:00:44.190 align:middle line:90%
because you're Portuguese.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.607 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: Si, I am
very Portuguese.

00:00:46.607 --> 00:00:46.990 align:middle line:10%


00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.790 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.005 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: I hide it well.

00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:50.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So let's do this.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.350 align:middle line:84%
Before we get going,
let's just do a very, very

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.400 align:middle line:90%
quick little recap.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.925 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we introduced
the cast of characters.

00:00:55.925 --> 00:00:57.300 align:middle line:84%
We introduced the
fact that there

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.250 align:middle line:84%
was this esoteric
knowledge being

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.530 align:middle line:84%
passed through these
bloodlines and that

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.630 align:middle line:90%
made its way into Jerusalem.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.790 align:middle line:84%
The pope has become
involved because he's trying

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.710 align:middle line:90%
to fight off the Arab hordes.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, the high-level
priestly class of Arabs

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.220 align:middle line:84%
are directly in association
with the Knights Templar

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.410 align:middle line:84%
because when you go to
the highest of anything,

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.360 align:middle line:84%
you're getting really
pure knowledge, right?

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And meanwhile,
there's blood in the streets,

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.290 align:middle line:84%
with people who are
barely surviving,

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.536 align:middle line:90%
Arab and Christian, right?

00:01:24.536 --> 00:01:26.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It sounds
like a movie script.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.743 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and
we've introduced--

00:01:27.743 --> 00:01:30.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Where's Ridley
Scott when you need him?

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.858 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, you
should do this, Freddy.

00:01:31.858 --> 00:01:34.082 align:middle line:90%
Seriously, we need a new movie.

00:01:34.082 --> 00:01:35.790 align:middle line:10%
And then we have the
cast of characters--

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.610 align:middle line:10%
Peter the Hermit, Godfroi
de Bouillon, and others.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.490 align:middle line:10%
And we left off just getting
ready to introduce, really,

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.600 align:middle line:10%
the big guy, Bernard
de Clairvaux.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.800 align:middle line:10%
So why don't we go ahead?

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.449 align:middle line:10%
And let's start with
who this man is.

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And you can start picking
up the threads of where

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.280 align:middle line:84%
we are in this story,
before we start moving over

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.790 align:middle line:90%
to Portugal, Portugale.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Exactly,
Portugale, yeah, I mean,

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.780 align:middle line:84%
I thought the story
about the Templar

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.450 align:middle line:90%
should be with the Templars.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.610 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea that
the real story

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.030 align:middle line:84%
lies in understanding
Bernard of Clairvaux.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.510 align:middle line:10%
Once you understand him-- and
I've read 500 of his surviving

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.960 align:middle line:10%
letters, to the point where I
kind of got under his skin--

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.220 align:middle line:10%
to find out that this
guy was extraordinary.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.460 align:middle line:10%
I mean, he was a renaissance man
who was technically Catholic,

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.310 align:middle line:10%
although he paid the
church lip service.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.670 align:middle line:10%
He was a great diplomat.

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:27.840 align:middle line:10%
He was a great healer.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.660 align:middle line:10%
And his whole concept
was to try and bring back

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.990 align:middle line:10%
Christianity to its original
and true roots, which is not

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.420 align:middle line:10%
to do with Jesus, but to do
with John the Baptist and Mary

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.460 align:middle line:10%
Magdalene.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.060 align:middle line:84%
And he was a great
supporter of both.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.480 align:middle line:84%
But he paid lip service
to the Catholic church.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.980 align:middle line:84%
So he was fed up with
the wonderful lifestyle

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.710 align:middle line:84%
that the church
people were having

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.200 align:middle line:90%
at the expense of the peasants.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.050 align:middle line:84%
He was afraid that the
Benedictine order was also

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.470 align:middle line:84%
too corrupt and too, you know,
full-bellied for its own good.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And he said, this is not what
real Christianity is about.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.070 align:middle line:90%
It's about asceticism.

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.980 align:middle line:84%
It's about spirituality and
being a beacon to others,

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.470 align:middle line:84%
to raise them from their
level, you know, obviously,

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.850 align:middle line:90%
trying to survive.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.210 align:middle line:84%
Bernard essentially
forms a splinter group

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.630 align:middle line:84%
called the Cistercian
Order, the Order of Cister.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.780 align:middle line:10%
And it turns out that
this order was also

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.840 align:middle line:10%
backed by the people
called the Order of Sion

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.310 align:middle line:10%
back in Burgundy--

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.780 align:middle line:10%
so again, interchanging
relationships going on here.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.517 align:middle line:84%
And the moment that
he actually finds out

00:03:29.517 --> 00:03:31.350 align:middle line:84%
that there's a window
of opportunity to send

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.050 align:middle line:84%
a few people over to
Jerusalem to dig up something

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.950 align:middle line:84%
on the Temple Mount, he
sends some of his own monks

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.620 align:middle line:84%
to Jerusalem, who then
become the Knights Templar.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.880 align:middle line:84%
So the Templars
aren't just Templars.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.930 align:middle line:84%
They are also members
of the Cistercian Order,

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.640 align:middle line:84%
and some of them are also
members of the Order of Sion.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.360 align:middle line:84%
So these three organizations
are essentially

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.600 align:middle line:84%
the groups that become the
central characters who are now

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.100 align:middle line:90%
known as the Knights Templar.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, they meander
over on boats in about 1125

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.420 align:middle line:84%
with a big secret and a mandate
by Hughes De Payens to go,

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.210 align:middle line:84%
and I quote, "to establish
the crown of Portugal."

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And this is, you know, the
biggest overlooked story

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.820 align:middle line:84%
in European history,
the creation of Europe's

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.660 align:middle line:84%
first independent
nation-state by the Templars,

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.420 align:middle line:84%
by the order of Sion,
and the Order of Cister,

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.029 align:middle line:84%
who essentially put up
a monastery literally

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:23.550 align:middle line:84%
within a year of the
Templars becoming official,

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.060 align:middle line:84%
even though by the time they
became official in 1118,

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.430 align:middle line:84%
they had already been in
Portugal for seven years.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.630 align:middle line:90%
They were given a castle.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.470 align:middle line:84%
Again, not many
people know this,

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.310 align:middle line:84%
which tells us that the Templars
are much older than we ever

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.180 align:middle line:90%
believed.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's what makes
this story fascinating.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now let's go
back another thousand years,

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.130 align:middle line:84%
just to capture this one
statement by Julius Caesar

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.579 align:middle line:84%
because, again, I really dug
through your book, Freddy.

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:48.870 align:middle line:90%
Every single page is dog-eared.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.460 align:middle line:90%
That's why I'm so lost.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: How did Julius Caesar
get involved with the Templars?

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.308 align:middle line:90%
You won't believe this.

00:04:53.308 --> 00:04:53.677 align:middle line:90%


00:04:53.677 --> 00:04:55.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, it's a
statement that he made.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:56.509 align:middle line:90%
And I want to read that.

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:59.160 align:middle line:84%
It says, "there
exists a civilization

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.650 align:middle line:84%
in the northern
confines of Iberia

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.670 align:middle line:84%
who refuses to govern itself
and who refuses to be governed."

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:06.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yes.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, you take it away.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: The original
people who settled

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.680 align:middle line:84%
in what is today Northern
Spain and, of course,

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Portugal were called
the Lusitanians.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.060 align:middle line:84%
It literally means those
who hold the light.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And they go back to a group
of traveling magician-gods

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.530 align:middle line:84%
who escape a sinking island
in the middle of the Atlantic

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:26.905 align:middle line:90%
about 11,000 years ago.

00:05:26.905 --> 00:05:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And they were very tall,
strangely long-handed,

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.510 align:middle line:84%
and they deposited some very
interesting sacred places,

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.060 align:middle line:84%
dedicated to the divine
virgin, in Portugal,

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.080 align:middle line:84%
and then they moved
towards the Basque area.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.880 align:middle line:90%
And they went AWOL.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.060 align:middle line:84%
No one knows what
happened to them.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And from this, you
get the vestiges

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.720 align:middle line:84%
of this independent
culture in Portugal

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.000 align:middle line:84%
who basically paid
lip service to anyone

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.112 align:middle line:84%
who came in and
told them, you know,

00:05:50.112 --> 00:05:51.820 align:middle line:84%
this is what you're
supposed to be doing.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.010 align:middle line:90%
They said, I'm sorry.

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.135 align:middle line:90%
We're not going to do that.

00:05:54.135 --> 00:05:56.737 align:middle line:84%
And especially the church, they
were no friends of the church.

00:05:56.737 --> 00:05:57.570 align:middle line:90%
And they said, look.

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.360 align:middle line:84%
The whole point of living
properly is to, you know,

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.040 align:middle line:84%
rule over nobody and to not
be ruled by anybody else.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.570 align:middle line:84%
So it's a right of
self-determination to respect

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.330 align:middle line:84%
others, which is actually the
true Christian brotherhood.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.850 align:middle line:90%
You know, love thy neighbor.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:13.650 align:middle line:90%
It's not that difficult, really.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.775 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't
rule over anybody.

00:06:15.775 --> 00:06:17.650 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want to be
ruled by anybody else.

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.590 align:middle line:84%
So Julius Caesar found
it really difficult

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.430 align:middle line:84%
to infiltrate that
part of the world.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's one of the
reasons why the Templars were

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.530 align:middle line:84%
so adamant on having that
piece of real estate,

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.850 align:middle line:84%
not only because it
was as far from Rome

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.867 align:middle line:90%
as possible in the Middle Ages--

00:06:31.867 --> 00:06:33.450 align:middle line:84%
so they can go in
and do whatever they

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:34.950 align:middle line:90%
wanted in complete secrecy--

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.790 align:middle line:84%
but because there was a rich
history of heresy and people

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:41.760 align:middle line:84%
who really wanted to do the
right thing spiritually.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.434 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, a heretic,
in its original term--

00:06:44.434 --> 00:06:45.725 align:middle line:90%
you're going to laugh at this--

00:06:45.725 --> 00:06:48.150 align:middle line:84%
a heretic is someone in
possession of the facts

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.050 align:middle line:90%
who is able to choose.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, that's
a better definition.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It's the
original definition.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Seeing as how--

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Isn't that funny?

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --hundreds of
thousands of heretics

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:56.190 align:middle line:90%
were killed.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Yeah, so if
someone calls you a heretic,

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.770 align:middle line:90%
you'll say, actually, yes.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.061 align:middle line:90%
I do have a lot of information.

00:07:00.061 --> 00:07:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I am, yes.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.730 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting
in this, Freddy,

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:05.760 align:middle line:84%
is that according
to the hermetics,

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.330 align:middle line:84%
one of the last remaining
visible remnants of Atlantis

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.760 align:middle line:84%
is Mount Pico in the Azores,
off the coast of Portugal.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.300 align:middle line:84%
So quite naturally, they
would have emigrated.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.240 align:middle line:84%
As this portion of
Atlantis was going down,

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.240 align:middle line:84%
they would have emigrated
over toward the land,

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.040 align:middle line:84%
toward Portugal, toward
the coast, right?

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:23.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yes.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.028 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The closest
coastline, now it's

00:07:25.028 --> 00:07:28.320 align:middle line:84%
said also that in earlier phases
of Atlantis, as it went down

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:32.000 align:middle line:84%
in three stages, they
emigrated to the British Isles.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And there we have the druids and
the druidic knowledge, right?

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: And the Yucatan.

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the Yucatan
in the opposite direction,

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:42.995 align:middle line:84%
again, seeded with the same
high, high knowledge, right?

00:07:42.995 --> 00:07:45.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And the thing that
links them all together

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.700 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that they were all
called people of the serpent.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:48.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:48.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: The [NON-ENGLISH].

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:49.845 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:49.845 --> 00:07:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Another misunderstanding
of what the word

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:53.250 align:middle line:90%
"serpent" and symbolism means.

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:55.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Energy,
it's energy currents.

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:57.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Energy, the
movement of energy, again.

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:58.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: The manipulation
of it and how to use it

00:07:58.890 --> 00:07:59.790 align:middle line:90%
for spiritual purposes.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:00.195 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:00.195 --> 00:08:00.995 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:08:00.995 --> 00:08:03.699 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It makes perfect sense
why a group of mystic Templar

00:08:03.699 --> 00:08:06.240 align:middle line:84%
Knights would then move to this
particular part of the world,

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.660 align:middle line:84%
because they already
had a rich history

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:08.350 align:middle line:90%
with this understanding.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:10.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They already
had that, absolutely.

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:11.400 align:middle line:84%
But we were talking
off camera, and you

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.050 align:middle line:84%
said there's
another place that's

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:15.120 align:middle line:84%
little known, that
it's also thought

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.860 align:middle line:90%
to be a remnant of Atlantis.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:17.790 align:middle line:90%
Just tease us.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:18.410 align:middle line:90%
Tell us.

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:18.930 align:middle line:90%
Don't tease us.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:19.460 align:middle line:90%
Tell us.

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:21.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Yeah, it was
something that not many people

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:21.980 align:middle line:90%
know about.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.815 align:middle line:84%
And it came about as a
result of a conversation

00:08:24.815 --> 00:08:26.190 align:middle line:84%
with a good friend
of mine who is

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:28.190 align:middle line:84%
one of the most respected
psychics in the world,

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:30.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, someone who really
understands psychic ability,

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:34.770 align:middle line:84%
who even the police in Britain
still use to this very day

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:36.190 align:middle line:90%
to solve crimes.

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:39.039 align:middle line:84%
And when I began on this
journey to look at the Templars

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:41.580 align:middle line:84%
and look at the history of that
particular part of the world,

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.020 align:middle line:84%
just said, well,
you really should

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:47.250 align:middle line:84%
go to this particular
promontory near Sintra

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:50.460 align:middle line:84%
because there's a vestige
of a citadel there

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:53.562 align:middle line:84%
that collapsed into the ocean
when big tidal waves came over

00:08:53.562 --> 00:08:55.395 align:middle line:84%
from the Atlantic, from
a sinking continent,

00:08:55.395 --> 00:08:56.625 align:middle line:90%
and wiped it out.

00:08:56.625 --> 00:08:58.860 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that's
exactly where I was born.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:08:59.680 align:middle line:90%
So I went there.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.388 align:middle line:84%
And if you just go
off the beaten tourist

00:09:01.388 --> 00:09:04.790 align:middle line:84%
track down this cliff, there
is the remains of a road.

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And quite clearly, there's
part of a big structure there.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.441 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of it, you
can see that it slid down

00:09:09.441 --> 00:09:10.350 align:middle line:90%
into the ocean.

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.600 align:middle line:84%
The currents are very
strong there, very hard

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.370 align:middle line:84%
to take any kind of
equipment to see properly.

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:17.694 align:middle line:84%
But, yes, the citadel
is still there.

00:09:17.694 --> 00:09:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's in the folklore
that there were people here

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.810 align:middle line:84%
that came from a
different continent,

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.620 align:middle line:84%
because back then Portugal was
also part of a big landmass,

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.580 align:middle line:84%
like the Sahara was
part of the ocean.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:29.684 align:middle line:84%
So our understanding of
where Atlantis was, we really

00:09:29.684 --> 00:09:31.600 align:middle line:84%
have little understanding
because the landmass

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.680 align:middle line:90%
is so different today.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.770 align:middle line:84%
So that was part of
one little outpost.

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And we do have in Portugal
some of the oldest sacred sites

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:38.430 align:middle line:90%
in Europe.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: True, and when
people think of Atlantis,

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:42.640 align:middle line:84%
they're only looking at
usually the final phase, which

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:46.440 align:middle line:84%
was the smallest portion, after
the others had broken off,

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.620 align:middle line:84%
sunken and so forth, to the
north, with very high culture,

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.510 align:middle line:84%
even, you know,
hundreds, thousands

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:53.290 align:middle line:90%
of years prior to that even.

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:55.362 align:middle line:84%
So we have a real
misunderstanding in that way--

00:09:55.362 --> 00:09:56.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, god, yeah.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --you know,
how history is running.

00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:58.450 align:middle line:90%
But you brought up something.

00:09:58.450 --> 00:09:59.610 align:middle line:90%
You're from that area.

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And I would say that you are
one of these people, right?

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.430 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, you have taken
a huge chunk of your life

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:11.820 align:middle line:84%
to invest yourself
into digging up

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.510 align:middle line:84%
the truth behind
what the Templar were

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:15.310 align:middle line:90%
and what they were upholding.

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:15.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Can you keep a secret?

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:17.641 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I believe
you were also in Egypt.

00:10:17.641 --> 00:10:20.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think that you
are one of the players who

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:23.600 align:middle line:84%
has come back throughout
history to bring us

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.960 align:middle line:84%
these pieces of information
for our understanding,

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.580 align:middle line:84%
so we can tap back into
our own higher forces.

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I've always
wondered why I'm 6 foot 5,

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:32.570 align:middle line:90%
and I'm Portuguese.

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.153 align:middle line:84%
You don't get the
two coming together.

00:10:34.153 --> 00:10:35.002 align:middle line:90%
So who knows?

00:10:35.002 --> 00:10:38.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I
mean, I know you.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:40.160 align:middle line:90%
I've seen you a lot of times.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And I have identified
you, too, from other eras.

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:47.060 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to
say that while we're

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:49.520 align:middle line:84%
doing this interview because
you are one of the people that

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.030 align:middle line:84%
comes back repeatedly and tries
to bring back the knowledge.

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:54.125 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: You'd think I would
have learned the first time

00:10:54.125 --> 00:10:55.100 align:middle line:90%
to go somewhere else.

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:56.599 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're a
slow learner, OK?

00:10:56.599 --> 00:10:57.671 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:57.671 --> 00:10:58.149 align:middle line:90%


00:10:58.149 --> 00:10:59.690 align:middle line:84%
Smart, but a slow
learner, all right.

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:01.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Are there
any other planets

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:03.290 align:middle line:84%
that look just like this,
though less troublesome?

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:04.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I just thought
it's worth putting that out

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:06.350 align:middle line:90%
so we can see this in context.

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:07.824 align:middle line:90%
You know of which you speak.

00:11:07.824 --> 00:11:09.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I actually
believe in that very much.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:12.122 align:middle line:84%
I think there are
people that go around,

00:11:12.122 --> 00:11:13.580 align:middle line:84%
people that I
respect as well, that

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.220 align:middle line:84%
seem to be following
on from a tradition

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.890 align:middle line:84%
that they didn't finish
the job the first time

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:21.110 align:middle line:84%
around, for whatever reason,
because sometimes you're

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:23.526 align:middle line:84%
hardwired with information
that you really shouldn't have.

00:11:23.526 --> 00:11:25.990 align:middle line:84%
Or you have a perception
way beyond your years.

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:28.550 align:middle line:84%
I was drawing pyramids
when I was three.

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:31.700 align:middle line:84%
I actually believed when I was
four that I had a pet dinosaur.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.540 align:middle line:90%
And we now know from strata.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:34.550 align:middle line:90%
I think it's in Texas.

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:36.845 align:middle line:84%
You find human footprints
next to dinosaur prints.

00:11:36.845 --> 00:11:37.928 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely, yes.

00:11:37.928 --> 00:11:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And I'm thinking, for
me, it's never been a big deal.

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:41.686 align:middle line:90%
I've always understood that.

00:11:41.686 --> 00:11:44.100 align:middle line:84%
So it does make you wonder
where you fit into the bigger

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:44.900 align:middle line:90%
scheme of things.

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:47.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But, you know,
it takes people like you

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:48.500 align:middle line:84%
and others that
are on the planet

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:54.740 align:middle line:84%
right now to come back and
not only thread it together.

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:57.800 align:middle line:84%
There's something more than
that because within, you're

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.470 align:middle line:84%
carrying forward
these native energies.

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And they have a certain
attractant with them, right,

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:07.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a magnetic pull
toward the information.

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, these people
end up in positions of profile.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:14.290 align:middle line:84%
They can be in any industry,
but start attracting something

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:15.090 align:middle line:90%
back.

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:17.150 align:middle line:84%
But usually, you
can identify them

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:21.980 align:middle line:84%
because they're bringing back
this kind of essential light.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:23.510 align:middle line:84%
You can see it or
feel the light.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes,
you'll even hear them

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:27.380 align:middle line:84%
start dropping terms
and words, even if it's

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.900 align:middle line:84%
an actor or a singer,
you know, that

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:34.400 align:middle line:84%
have to do with their deep past
because we are no longer run

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.320 align:middle line:90%
under, by and large--

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, OK, your
people in England,

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:41.700 align:middle line:84%
anyway, normally, we're not
run under a system of royalty

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:42.500 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.620 align:middle line:84%
We're more rogue than
that as a species.

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And so our cultural
icons are the leaders.

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:50.610 align:middle line:84%
So they're the ones that have
to, the authors and poets.

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is where bringing
hardcore evidence, science

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.740 align:middle line:84%
melded with what you're
talking about from the psychic,

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:05.300 align:middle line:84%
bringing it back with
intuitive remembrances,

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.847 align:middle line:84%
is going to be the thing that
will piece our past together.

00:13:07.847 --> 00:13:08.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: I think so, yeah.

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not going to
come through science alone.

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:11.120 align:middle line:90%
It can't.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:11.540 align:middle line:90%
It's too limited.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.331 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Yeah, I think
it's an amalgamation

00:13:13.331 --> 00:13:14.690 align:middle line:90%
of different disciplines.

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:15.430 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what
brings it together.

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:15.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:18.161 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I was having the
same conversation with Robert

00:13:18.161 --> 00:13:19.078 align:middle line:90%
Schoch, the geologist.

00:13:19.078 --> 00:13:21.161 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, he and I
talked about this as well.

00:13:21.161 --> 00:13:22.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: [INAUDIBLE]
the Sphinx, and just,

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:24.650 align:middle line:84%
you know, having a
little conversation.

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, yeah, the
more you actually see things

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:28.046 align:middle line:84%
from other people's
point of view,

00:13:28.046 --> 00:13:30.020 align:middle line:84%
from different disciplines,
now you can start

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:32.030 align:middle line:90%
bringing a picture together.

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:33.810 align:middle line:84%
Archeology, yeah,
it has its flaws,

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:35.710 align:middle line:90%
but it also has its good points.

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:37.597 align:middle line:90%
And geology adds its portion.

00:13:37.597 --> 00:13:38.930 align:middle line:90%
Historians add a little portion.

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:41.610 align:middle line:84%
The more open-minded you are
of sharing and seeing that

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:44.330 align:middle line:84%
actually the thread, if you
link these different disciplines

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.560 align:middle line:84%
together, from different
points of view,

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.682 align:middle line:84%
now you have a better
picture and understanding.

00:13:48.682 --> 00:13:51.140 align:middle line:84%
That's why it takes so long to
write a good book, you know.

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly, but if you
allow the intuitive viewpoint

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.329 align:middle line:84%
to come in as
well, you can start

00:13:55.329 --> 00:13:56.870 align:middle line:84%
getting some connective
tissue that's

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:58.200 align:middle line:90%
missing sometimes in science.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, it's much easier.

00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:00.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, it
makes it a lot easier, yes.

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:01.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Shortcut.

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:02.075 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:14:02.075 --> 00:14:04.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: The hard part is
then writing these things down

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.310 align:middle line:84%
and then saying, how the hell
am I going to prove this?

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, stuff comes
out of the woodwork.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:10.936 align:middle line:90%
Books fall out of shelves.

00:14:10.936 --> 00:14:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And in my case, it literally was
the case, finding unusual books

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:16.340 align:middle line:90%
and going, my God.

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:18.470 align:middle line:90%
I remember swearing in Harvard.

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:21.140 align:middle line:84%
You know, page 683 of
this massive book written

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:22.700 align:middle line:90%
by Cistercian monks, I went--

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:25.580 align:middle line:90%


00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:26.790 align:middle line:90%
and everybody turns around.

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:27.590 align:middle line:90%
And I went, sorry.

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:28.050 align:middle line:90%


00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Found it.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:28.550 align:middle line:90%
Found it.

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:30.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And they're
going, what has he found?

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, this is
going to change history.

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:32.830 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know this
was even here.

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:34.490 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, it's a
bit of blind luck

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:36.800 align:middle line:84%
but also a bit of intuition
and just following it.

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:37.740 align:middle line:90%
And see where it goes.

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And once you tap into it,
and if you just, you know,

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:44.390 align:middle line:84%
get out of your own way, don't
get moved by ego or anything,

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:46.700 align:middle line:84%
it's amazing how much work
and how quickly things move.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:46.815 align:middle line:90%


00:14:46.815 --> 00:14:47.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:50.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: You become this
magnet of information.

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly,
you realize, you know,

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.050 align:middle line:90%
I cannot make up the story.

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:56.180 align:middle line:84%
I have to go where
the information goes,

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:57.187 align:middle line:90%
where the evidence goes.

00:14:57.187 --> 00:14:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And if you just let the
evidence speak for itself,

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:00.350 align:middle line:90%
it writes itself.

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:03.122 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, as it did here.

00:15:03.122 --> 00:15:04.705 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It just
takes 15 years to do.

00:15:04.705 --> 00:15:05.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 15 years.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Things are a bit
slow on this planet, you know.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, they are.

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:10.790 align:middle line:84%
OK, Cistercians, also
now we get to the players

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:16.360 align:middle line:84%
because now we're over in the
badlands to the west, right?

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:19.110 align:middle line:84%
So now we're over
in Portugale, OK.

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:21.570 align:middle line:10%
And now the cast of
characters, let's

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:24.660 align:middle line:10%
start with Count Dom Henrique.

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:25.660 align:middle line:10%
Shall we start with him?

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:27.300 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: That's very good.

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.940 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Dom Henrique,
yes, we can start with him

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:31.950 align:middle line:10%
because it seems like
you started with him,

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:33.600 align:middle line:10%
and also the monks
and what's going

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.220 align:middle line:10%
on in the region at that time.

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And then start building the
story from the Portuguese side.

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:41.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Yeah, it turns
out that around about 1080,

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:43.860 align:middle line:84%
there's this group of
knights, two brothers.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.230 align:middle line:84%
They came all the way
over from Burgundy.

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And they settled in the
county of Portugale.

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:52.380 align:middle line:84%
Back then, it was
nothing more than--

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:54.840 align:middle line:84%
it was based around the
town of what today is called

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:57.090 align:middle line:90%
Porto, a very small place.

00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And they basically helped
the local king get rid

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:01.870 align:middle line:90%
of a lot of unfriendly people.

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And the knight was rewarded
with a piece of land, a dowry,

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:07.790 align:middle line:84%
and, of course, a
lovely princess,

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:09.780 align:middle line:84%
which he puts to good
use because he builds

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:13.140 align:middle line:84%
a little place called
the County of Portugale,

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:16.740 align:middle line:84%
turns it into this
wonderful, little paradise,

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:19.800 align:middle line:84%
literally raises it from
the dead, and then one day

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.780 align:middle line:84%
is given the permission
to go off to Jerusalem,

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:24.510 align:middle line:84%
meets a bunch of people
there that said, hey.

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:26.560 align:middle line:84%
We come from the same
place in Central Europe.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.200 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to
create a new country?

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And they said, hey,
that's a great idea.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:33.540 align:middle line:84%
We could start a whole
new real Christian place

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:36.270 align:middle line:84%
of veneration, where the true
Christian brotherhood can

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:37.260 align:middle line:90%
really develop itself.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, we have
some friends, to which he

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:42.030 align:middle line:90%
said, I have some friends, too.

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And they were the people,
members of my family

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:49.500 align:middle line:84%
called the De la Roche, were
actually members in Burgundy

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.740 align:middle line:84%
who helped found the Cistercians
and the Templar Order.

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:54.240 align:middle line:84%
So all of these
people from Burgundy

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.670 align:middle line:84%
are now in Northern
Portugal, helping

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:58.380 align:middle line:90%
to create this nation-kingdom.

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And as he's clearing the
unwelcome Arabs from that land,

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:04.119 align:middle line:84%
so the Templars are moving
in and helping him out.

00:17:04.119 --> 00:17:06.030 align:middle line:90%
This is a historical record.

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:08.430 align:middle line:84%
It's on record saying
that knights actually

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:11.490 align:middle line:84%
came back from Jerusalem
with Count Dom Henrique

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:14.740 align:middle line:84%
to actually help him
create this relationship.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And by 1111, we actually see
that he gives them a castle.

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:22.190 align:middle line:84%
So the Templars don't
exist yet, but yet they

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:23.190 align:middle line:90%
are already in Portugal.

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:26.069 align:middle line:84%
And they've been given a
castle and a piece of land.

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:27.990 align:middle line:84%
Now that changes
the history totally

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:29.580 align:middle line:84%
because it puts them
at the wrong time

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:31.440 align:middle line:84%
and in the wrong place
in a different part

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:34.380 align:middle line:84%
of the world, where they ought
not to be, but yet they are.

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:37.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now this brings
us to a couple of things.

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:40.560 align:middle line:84%
The town of Tomar, which is also
dedicated to Mary Magdalene,

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:41.360 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, yes.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They were teaching
the Templar values there, right?

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:46.860 align:middle line:90%
But let's talk about--

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:47.700 align:middle line:90%
the grail values.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, the
grail values there,

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:51.450 align:middle line:84%
which we're going to start
getting into the grail in a bit

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:53.491 align:middle line:84%
because this is really
where it's all leading to.

00:17:53.491 --> 00:17:54.291 align:middle line:90%


00:17:54.291 --> 00:17:55.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yummy.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about the Cistercians

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.790 align:middle line:84%
and what they were
offering society,

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:01.800 align:middle line:84%
what they were
teaching, the knowledge

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:04.770 align:middle line:84%
they had at that time as well,
and bring the story together

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:06.200 align:middle line:90%
through those two lenses.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh, they were
trying to recreate a utopia.

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't really
difficult in Europe,

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.740 align:middle line:84%
where everything was basically
being ravaged to the ground.

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.710 align:middle line:84%
And the church is pretty much
central to that ravaging.

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:19.140 align:middle line:84%
So, of course, the
church was hated.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.180 align:middle line:90%
You know, they literally were.

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, the Cistercians
show up and say, hey.

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:28.050 align:middle line:84%
We can actually show you how
to grow crops and tend animals.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:29.862 align:middle line:84%
We will help you
put schools together

00:18:29.862 --> 00:18:32.070 align:middle line:84%
to teach your children, so
that they understand right

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:34.280 align:middle line:84%
from wrong and
understand information,

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.134 align:middle line:84%
so that when you're fed
propaganda that is not

00:18:37.134 --> 00:18:39.300 align:middle line:84%
information, that's actually
someone else's opinion,

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.200 align:middle line:90%
you can think for yourself.

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And in order to do this,
we need your support.

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:44.460 align:middle line:90%
We need land.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:45.793 align:middle line:90%
We need whatever money you have.

00:18:45.793 --> 00:18:47.940 align:middle line:84%
We'll put it into
escrow, and then we'll

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.010 align:middle line:84%
put that money where
it needs to go.

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:52.750 align:middle line:84%
When that group of people
raises itself from the dead,

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:56.681 align:middle line:84%
literally, they can then give
us back a little bit in tithe.

00:18:56.681 --> 00:18:57.930 align:middle line:90%
We'll put it back into escrow.

00:18:57.930 --> 00:18:59.388 align:middle line:84%
We'll help another
group of people,

00:18:59.388 --> 00:19:01.010 align:middle line:90%
and together we grow outwards.

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:01.810 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:05.130 align:middle line:84%
They would settle in the most
inhospitable part of the land

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:08.190 align:middle line:84%
and turn a desert into
a flourishing paradise,

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:10.290 align:middle line:84%
literally within three
years, to the point where

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:12.930 align:middle line:84%
they're selling surplus
food to the local villagers.

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:14.850 align:middle line:90%
And that's how the word got out.

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:18.350 align:middle line:84%
Someone here is not behaving
like those people in Rome.

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:20.350 align:middle line:84%
These people are doing
something very different.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:20.850 align:middle line:90%
We like them.

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:21.765 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they were the
ones who would not be governed.

00:19:21.765 --> 00:19:22.545 align:middle line:90%


00:19:22.545 --> 00:19:23.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And they
were the ones who

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.701 align:middle line:84%
would not be governed,
because it was

00:19:24.701 --> 00:19:26.460 align:middle line:90%
about respect, mutual respect.

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:27.540 align:middle line:90%
We give something.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:29.630 align:middle line:84%
You give it back, and
we all grow together.

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And if we grow, you know,
in little pods, apart,

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:33.740 align:middle line:90%
no one benefits.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.410 align:middle line:90%
You only benefit a few people.

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:39.720 align:middle line:84%
We have to grow together so
that the whole society elevates

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.650 align:middle line:90%
itself on an equal footing.

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:44.460 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very utopian
paradise situation,

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:46.950 align:middle line:84%
and it really began to work
in this little, tiny county

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:48.720 align:middle line:84%
on the opposite side
of Europe, where

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:51.737 align:middle line:84%
Rome had no idea what was going
on, because they were kept,

00:19:51.737 --> 00:19:53.820 align:middle line:84%
you know-- any time you
have any emissaries coming

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:56.026 align:middle line:90%
from the pope, bye-bye.

00:19:56.026 --> 00:19:57.150 align:middle line:90%
We'll give you lip service.

00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:58.380 align:middle line:84%
We'll tell you that
we're all dirt poor.

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.580 align:middle line:84%
We still believe in, you
know, the cross and Jesus

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:01.080 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:03.413 align:middle line:84%
And in the meanwhile, we're
worshipping John the Baptist

00:20:03.413 --> 00:20:05.610 align:middle line:84%
and the pagan gods,
you know, which

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:06.850 align:middle line:90%
are one and the same thing.

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:09.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about Dom Henrique's role

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:12.110 align:middle line:84%
and then his progeny and
where it goes from there.

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:12.910 align:middle line:90%


00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So he meets
a very untimely death

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:16.880 align:middle line:90%
around about 1114.

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
suddenly the Templar plan

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.220 align:middle line:84%
appears to have run
aground because they hadn't

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:24.200 align:middle line:90%
counted on him dying so early.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And there's, like,
a breathing space

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:29.000 align:middle line:84%
where nothing happens, at least
in terms of documentation.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.860 align:middle line:84%
We still have a
document in Jerusalem

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:34.550 align:middle line:84%
where the Order of Sion is still
working with the Templars, who

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:38.240 align:middle line:84%
are technically not yet the
Templars, but yet they are.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And they had to wait
until his son, who

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.370 align:middle line:84%
was only nine years of age at
the time, Afonso Henrique--

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:47.360 align:middle line:84%
they all had the same names
so it was very confusing.

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:50.090 align:middle line:84%
He had to govern under
the rule of his mother

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:53.120 align:middle line:84%
until he came of age around
the time of when he was 14

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.310 align:middle line:84%
because kids had to grow
up very early in those days

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:56.210 align:middle line:90%
in a time of warfare.

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:58.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: His brother was
an interesting character

00:20:58.850 --> 00:20:59.660 align:middle line:90%
amidst this.

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.493 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Very interesting
character, indeed.

00:21:01.493 --> 00:21:03.950 align:middle line:84%
So in the meantime, they are
grooming this little kid,

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:05.360 align:middle line:84%
who doesn't yet
realize that he's

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:08.210 align:middle line:84%
going to become the first king
of this brand-new, independent

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:10.010 align:middle line:90%
nation state called Portugal.

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:12.500 align:middle line:10%
And assisting him
and the Templars

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:16.580 align:middle line:10%
is also the head of the Knights
Hospitaller in Portugal, who

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:20.640 align:middle line:10%
also groomed this young child
to be the future monarch, you

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.640 align:middle line:10%
know, made sure that
this person was instilled

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.490 align:middle line:10%
with the right
spiritual qualities.

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And in the meantime,
it turns out

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:28.340 align:middle line:84%
from another document
that was very rare

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:31.310 align:middle line:84%
that the moment that
this young prince takes

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:33.154 align:middle line:84%
his side next to his
mother-- and still he

00:21:33.154 --> 00:21:34.070 align:middle line:90%
is not able to govern.

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:37.470 align:middle line:84%
His mother is writing
all the documents.

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:39.230 align:middle line:84%
Bernard of Clairvaux
sends a group

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:41.570 align:middle line:84%
of monks over to
Portugal, including

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:44.510 align:middle line:84%
one of the original Knights
Templar, Brother Roland--

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:46.550 align:middle line:84%
turns out he was a
Cistercian all along--

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:50.200 align:middle line:84%
to ask the young
Prince Afonso, oh,

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.550 align:middle line:84%
do you mind if we build the
first Cistercian monastery here

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:54.590 align:middle line:90%
in your county?

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And he said, absolutely, because
basically what was happening

00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:01.610 align:middle line:84%
is that young Afonso was
granting his uncle, Bernard

00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:05.510 align:middle line:84%
of Clairvaux, permission
to set up shop in Portugal.

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:08.840 align:middle line:84%
Now we're beginning to see how
the whole story begins to play

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.030 align:middle line:90%
itself out through family ties.

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:15.800 align:middle line:84%
Bernard of Clairvaux already
had a member of his family ready

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.260 align:middle line:84%
and propped up to go on
the throne of Portugal that

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:21.740 align:middle line:84%
was aided by the Templars, who
were essentially his monks.

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:25.610 align:middle line:84%
So the whole thing is one big,
very tightly committed family,

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:28.070 align:middle line:84%
very patient, the plan
that was taking place here.

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:31.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, he
was very young, OK.

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:35.300 align:middle line:84%
So Alfonso, his mother
started kind of interfering,

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:36.735 align:middle line:90%
you know, at one point, right?

00:22:36.735 --> 00:22:37.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, she was crazy.

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:38.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She was crazy.

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:39.650 align:middle line:90%
She was kind of bat--

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:39.890 align:middle line:90%
bat--

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:41.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Kind of
interesting, crazy.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.331 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, you know, crazy.

00:22:42.331 --> 00:22:44.240 align:middle line:84%
So now, first of
all, was that part

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.700 align:middle line:90%
of the Merovingian bloodline?

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Ah, I'm glad
you brought that up,

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:51.980 align:middle line:90%
because I don't know.

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:53.450 align:middle line:84%
At this point, I
had no intention

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:55.283 align:middle line:84%
of going to the bloodline
story in the book,

00:22:55.283 --> 00:22:58.100 align:middle line:84%
but somehow the evidence began
to throw me in that direction.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:22:59.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
they were grooming him

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.000 align:middle line:90%
at such a deep level.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:01.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: At such
a young age, they

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:04.550 align:middle line:84%
must have known
something about him.

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:06.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Exactly, and
he wasn't royalty.

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:07.430 align:middle line:90%
So why was he a prince?

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:08.604 align:middle line:90%
And he becomes a king.

00:23:08.604 --> 00:23:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Kind of like Godfrey
de Bouillion.

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:12.350 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't royalty, but he
becomes king of Jerusalem,

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:12.920 align:middle line:90%
which, of course, he denied.

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they identified
them, just like the--

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:14.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly, like the
lamas identify other lamas.

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:18.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And there were other players as
well who at a very young age--

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, literally,
nine years of age--

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:24.250 align:middle line:84%
they are groomed to become
the future of the Templar

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:25.165 align:middle line:90%
masters of Portugal.

00:23:25.165 --> 00:23:26.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, why
would you groom

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:32.220 align:middle line:84%
these child prodigies to become
heads of an entire nation?

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:34.406 align:middle line:84%
And there was also
the suggestion

00:23:34.406 --> 00:23:35.780 align:middle line:84%
that Bernard of
Clairvaux himself

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:38.540 align:middle line:84%
was related to the
Merovingian bloodline, quite

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:40.150 align:middle line:90%
a strong suggestion, actually.

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:44.090 align:middle line:84%
So Afonso Henrique, the
prince, being his nephew,

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:46.010 align:middle line:84%
naturally, he would
have been there.

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, then I came
across that wonderful phrase

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:52.550 align:middle line:84%
in one of the books written
by the Cistercian monks

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:57.080 align:middle line:84%
in Portugal on animal skin
about the Knights Templar

00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:00.320 align:middle line:84%
ceremony indoctrinating the
new Templar master in Portugal

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:03.480 align:middle line:84%
where he declares a vow to
protect the bloodline of David.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:06.200 align:middle line:84%
Now why would you put that as
a line item in a swearing-in

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.880 align:middle line:84%
ceremony unless
there is a bloodline

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.740 align:middle line:90%
to protect in Portugal?

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
suddenly I realized

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:15.230 align:middle line:84%
my nose has gotten too close to
the honeypot because I thought,

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:16.610 align:middle line:90%
let me just ask a few questions.

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And, bang, the door
starts slamming.

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:22.760 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very good friends
with a high-level Freemason

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:26.630 align:middle line:84%
here in America,
a lady, actually,

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:29.750 align:middle line:84%
part of the Scottish
Rite movement,

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:32.100 align:middle line:84%
because they allow
women into the movement.

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, I could
ask for that on your behalf

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:38.810 align:middle line:84%
when I go off to Belgium
to our yearly conclave.

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:40.650 align:middle line:84%
She comes back, and
I said, is there

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:41.983 align:middle line:90%
anything you could help me with?

00:24:41.983 --> 00:24:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And she says, well,
I was just told,

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:47.930 align:middle line:84%
quite firmly and politely,
just ask your friend to desist

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:49.610 align:middle line:90%
from pursuing this any further.

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:50.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There's your answer.

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:52.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I thought, that tells
me exactly what I need to know.

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:52.880 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:53.030 align:middle line:90%


00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:55.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so it's
quite possible that was

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:56.604 align:middle line:90%
part of that bloodline.

00:24:56.604 --> 00:24:58.145 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Yes, and
I think that's also

00:24:58.145 --> 00:25:00.380 align:middle line:84%
another reason why they
wanted a tract of land

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:02.880 align:middle line:84%
as far from Rome
meddling in their affairs

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:05.337 align:middle line:84%
as possible, because as
we know, if the Templars--

00:25:05.337 --> 00:25:07.670 align:middle line:84%
and we know this from the
fact that a lot of the Templar

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:10.220 align:middle line:84%
Knights were part of
the Order of Sion.

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And the Order of
Sion's declared aim

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:15.780 align:middle line:84%
was to bring back the bloodline
through the Merovingians that

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.390 align:middle line:84%
went back to Jerusalem,
that went back to Sumeria.

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:19.970 align:middle line:84%
Then, yes, that
makes a lot of sense.

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:23.700 align:middle line:84%
Put them as far away from the
grasp of the pope as possible.

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:25.495 align:middle line:84%
They may even still
be around today.

00:25:25.495 --> 00:25:27.120 align:middle line:84%
Hell, I could be part
of the bloodline.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:27.370 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:28.280 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I have land somewhere.

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:28.670 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:29.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
what I'm saying.

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:30.230 align:middle line:90%
No, I have no doubt.

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:31.500 align:middle line:90%
Good luck getting the deed.

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:33.535 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless,
I'm sure you do.

00:25:33.535 --> 00:25:35.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: But it is
a fascinating story.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, his brother,
Afonso's brother, the prince,

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:43.980 align:middle line:84%
he turns out to have started
a branch of the Templars

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:47.070 align:middle line:84%
which hardly anyone talks
about called the House of Avis

00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:48.090 align:middle line:90%
in Portugal.

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:51.959 align:middle line:10%
And their logo is the Templar
logo with the fleur-de-lis.

00:25:51.959 --> 00:25:54.250 align:middle line:10%
And you've got to look at
these symbols very carefully.

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:57.080 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot of crosses,
which people say, oh, these

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:57.880 align:middle line:10%
are all Templars.

00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:59.500 align:middle line:10%
Well, no, they are
different branches,

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:01.630 align:middle line:10%
and they all do very
different things.

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:04.400 align:middle line:10%
But if you look at the logo of
the House of Avis in Portugal,

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:07.020 align:middle line:10%
it is the Templar logo mixed
with the fleur-de-lis, which,

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:09.720 align:middle line:10%
of course, is the symbol of
the Merovingian bloodline

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.131 align:middle line:10%
in France.

00:26:11.131 --> 00:26:12.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
put that out there

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:15.650 align:middle line:84%
because anybody feels compelled
to pursue that further.

00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:17.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How about you?

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:20.044 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: If there's a
crowd-funded source that

00:26:20.044 --> 00:26:22.210 align:middle line:84%
will help me do that, I
would love to get into this.

00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:23.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You'll get
crowd funding, Freddy.

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:24.540 align:middle line:90%
Go for it.

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:26.910 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, on these lands
also, interestingly,

00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:30.900 align:middle line:84%
is a temple devoted
to Isis, right?

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Yes, wherever
they went in Portugal--

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:34.326 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
there's a connection

00:26:34.326 --> 00:26:37.730 align:middle line:84%
between Mary Magdalene and Isis
in some schools of thought.

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:41.530 align:middle line:84%
But Isis is misunderstood
in itself, anyway.

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:44.520 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, still,
there's a temple to Isis.

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Yes, and
they're everywhere.

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:48.760 align:middle line:84%
In fact, wherever the
Templars went around,

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:51.780 align:middle line:84%
and specifically in Portugal
and other parts of Europe,

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:53.900 align:middle line:84%
wherever they
founded their temples

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:56.400 align:middle line:84%
or they went to
actually retrieve

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.800 align:middle line:84%
certain places on the
land or rebuild them,

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.926 align:middle line:84%
they were always original
temples, dedicated to Isis.

00:27:01.926 --> 00:27:04.050 align:middle line:84%
So if you follow the story
line all the way back as

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:07.670 align:middle line:84%
far as it will go to
Egypt and also to Sumeria,

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:08.650 align:middle line:90%
why is this important?

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:10.150 align:middle line:90%
Why is this important?

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Why is Isis so important
in their understanding?

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:14.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the beginning,
it turns out,

00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:17.460 align:middle line:84%
the most remotest of
cultures talk about the fact

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:20.550 align:middle line:84%
that in the beginning
of all creation,

00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:24.660 align:middle line:84%
the world, the universe, was
created from a wonderful--

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:28.290 align:middle line:84%
not an explosion, but just
an outpouring of energy.

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And the source of this energy,
because it's, you know,

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:36.720 align:middle line:84%
creative, it has to
be a feminine quality.

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:39.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're on the same
page, prima materia itself.

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:42.127 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So it's not a guy with
a white that runs the universe.

00:27:42.127 --> 00:27:42.960 align:middle line:10%
And it's not really.

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:43.760 align:middle line:10%
It's an it.

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.870 align:middle line:10%
But the ancestors looked
at this and said, well,

00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:49.020 align:middle line:10%
if it's a creative
and outstanding force,

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:50.910 align:middle line:10%
then that would be
a feminine quality.

00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And because in the beginning
the universe was a dark place,

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.390 align:middle line:84%
because then there was
light and there was sound,

00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:00.140 align:middle line:84%
so before that, there had to
be darkness in the universe.

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:02.010 align:middle line:84%
But because the
universe was created,

00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:05.220 align:middle line:84%
therefore all the wisdom and
knowledge of the universe

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:07.530 align:middle line:90%
had to be contained in the dark.

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's where they got the
concept of the divine virgin

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:13.130 align:middle line:84%
that wears a black skin,
or the black Madonna,

00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:14.996 align:middle line:84%
as it became known
in Central Europe.

00:28:14.996 --> 00:28:15.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Great void.

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:18.380 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: Who is basically
an interpretation of Isis,

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:22.260 align:middle line:10%
who represents this ideal of
the embodiment of all knowledge

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:24.100 align:middle line:10%
in the universe, whose
husband, of course,

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:27.087 align:middle line:10%
is a resurrected hero who
goes into the other world

00:28:27.087 --> 00:28:29.170 align:middle line:10%
on December the 21st, comes
back three days later.

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:30.420 align:middle line:90%
He rises from the dead.

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:31.920 align:middle line:84%
So that's what the
Templars were following.

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.336 align:middle line:84%
And it's very important to
know because Mary Magdalene was

00:28:34.336 --> 00:28:35.869 align:middle line:90%
part of that lineage.

00:28:35.869 --> 00:28:38.160 align:middle line:84%
That's why they were supportive
of her and nobody else.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly, and that
was ancient, ancient, ancient

00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:43.140 align:middle line:84%
Atlantean knowledge,
the understanding

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:48.127 align:middle line:84%
of simply the creation of
all, and thus, Isis, Isis.

00:28:48.127 --> 00:28:50.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And it's amazing
that they kept the story going

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:52.380 align:middle line:84%
through different groups
of people for, what,

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:54.595 align:middle line:90%
11,000 years, at least?

00:28:54.595 --> 00:28:55.470 align:middle line:90%
That's extraordinary.

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: At least, at
least, yes, OK, so that's

00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:59.130 align:middle line:90%
the part I wanted to get into.

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:01.290 align:middle line:90%
So you've gone there.

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:04.590 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that's kind
of a manifestation of this

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:09.390 align:middle line:84%
that I found so beautiful
in your book, it was Afonso.

00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:11.780 align:middle line:84%
His uncle was Bernard
de Clairvaux, right?

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:12.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:17.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he
dedicated an incredible--

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:18.330 align:middle line:90%
it's not a cathedral.

00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:19.710 align:middle line:90%
Is it a chapel, a cathedral?

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:22.140 align:middle line:84%
What would you call it,
this incredible edifice?

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:23.384 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: In Tomar?

00:29:23.384 --> 00:29:24.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:26.520 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: Oh, it's a round--

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.250 align:middle line:10%
they call it a church,
the round church,

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:31.877 align:middle line:10%
except for there's a bit
of a problem with this.

00:29:31.877 --> 00:29:32.960 align:middle line:10%
And it's inside a citadel.

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.250 align:middle line:10%
It's inside a castle, of
course, because, you know,

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:38.490 align:middle line:10%
the Saracens were
after the land.

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:41.850 align:middle line:84%
So they basically settled in
this place called Tomar, which

00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:44.060 align:middle line:90%
literally means a palm tree.

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:46.336 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking at the
Weather Channel back then.

00:29:46.336 --> 00:29:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, it was too
cold to grow palm trees there.

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:50.293 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
now why would you

00:29:50.293 --> 00:29:53.610 align:middle line:84%
name a town after a plant that
doesn't grow in this location?

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:55.000 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't make any sense.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.200 align:middle line:84%
They would always name
things after local features.

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out
that Tomar literally

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:02.370 align:middle line:84%
is a corruption of
Tomara, which is

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:04.110 align:middle line:84%
the original name
of the town, which

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:07.260 align:middle line:84%
happens to be one of the
daughters of Mary Magdalene.

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:09.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
penny begins to drop.

00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And I went, holy mother,
this is extraordinary.

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:12.740 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's a coincidence.

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:16.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, they built the most famous
of their buildings, this round

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:19.740 align:middle line:84%
tower, except it was
never used as a church.

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:21.600 align:middle line:84%
They used a church
outside the citadel

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:22.817 align:middle line:90%
for their daily activities.

00:30:22.817 --> 00:30:24.900 align:middle line:84%
Why would you need two
churches within half a mile

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:25.980 align:middle line:90%
of each other?

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:27.700 align:middle line:90%
Then it got even weirder.

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:29.610 align:middle line:90%
The tower never had a door.

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:31.590 align:middle line:90%
So how would you get in?

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:35.010 align:middle line:84%
It turns out the Templars used
to go through a secret tunnel

00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:38.100 align:middle line:84%
and come out through
the actual floor, just

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:41.940 align:middle line:84%
exactly like the Essenes
used to do on Temple Mount

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:45.360 align:middle line:84%
because they had a secret
entrance that they had to reach

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:49.740 align:middle line:84%
via a secret chamber that
they had to pull part

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:53.040 align:middle line:84%
of the floor that had a ring
on it, through which they

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:55.931 align:middle line:84%
descended to do their
private and very most

00:30:55.931 --> 00:30:57.680 align:middle line:84%
secret of ceremonies,
which is the raising

00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:00.150 align:middle line:84%
the dead ceremonies, a
very misunderstood concept,

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:01.260 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:04.210 align:middle line:84%
This is the central tenet of the
third degree of Scottish Rite

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:05.010 align:middle line:90%
Freemasonry.

00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:06.360 align:middle line:90%
So it survives.

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:09.690 align:middle line:84%
So because the Scottish Rite
Freemasonry is essentially

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:11.685 align:middle line:84%
the renamed Templars
in Scotland,

00:31:11.685 --> 00:31:13.560 align:middle line:84%
we now know that the
Templars were practicing

00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:14.880 align:middle line:90%
the same thing in Tomar.

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And they built a
mirror image of what

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:19.870 align:middle line:84%
was happening on
Mount Zion and also

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:21.900 align:middle line:84%
on the Temple Mount
in Tomar in Portugal.

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:22.890 align:middle line:90%
And it's still there.

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:26.250 align:middle line:84%
The vestiges of the actual
secret chamber are still there.

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:29.280 align:middle line:84%
I found this in a local library,
in a newspaper account that

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:32.130 align:middle line:84%
talked about the
local people in 1940,

00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:35.049 align:middle line:84%
the craftsman, saying, well,
we had to shore up the building

00:31:35.049 --> 00:31:36.090 align:middle line:90%
because it was crumbling.

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:40.560 align:middle line:84%
We had to put sort of a gird
of concrete around the base.

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
we had to hide

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:45.030 align:middle line:84%
a door which was the
entrance, the second entrance,

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:47.580 align:middle line:84%
to a secret crypt,
where the knights used

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:50.444 align:middle line:84%
to conduct their most secret
and sacred of ceremonies.

00:31:50.444 --> 00:31:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
where we're headed.

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:55.232 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Exactly, for the inner
brotherhood of the Templars,

00:31:55.232 --> 00:31:56.190 align:middle line:90%
because there were two.

00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:57.940 align:middle line:84%
There's the outer
brotherhood, and there's

00:31:57.940 --> 00:31:58.980 align:middle line:90%
the inner brotherhood.

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:00.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Alcobaka.

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:01.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Alcobaca.

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Baca.

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:05.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh, yes, oh,
that's a beautiful place.

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.350 align:middle line:10%
If you ever want to
travel anywhere in Europe

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:11.130 align:middle line:10%
and see the true Gothic at
its most pure, where there's

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:15.210 align:middle line:10%
no adornment, and see the actual
vision of Bernard of Clairvaux

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:17.730 align:middle line:10%
in stone, the
monastery of Alcobaca.

00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:19.860 align:middle line:90%
I take people there on tour.

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:22.597 align:middle line:84%
And usually, I talk a lot
when, obviously, I go on tour

00:32:22.597 --> 00:32:23.430 align:middle line:90%
and describe things.

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:24.480 align:middle line:90%
I didn't say a word.

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And people were saying, are
you going to say something

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:29.124 align:middle line:90%
about the buildings?

00:32:29.124 --> 00:32:30.040 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with him?

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:31.140 align:middle line:90%
He's not saying anything.

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:32.580 align:middle line:90%
So I just let them walk in.

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:33.990 align:middle line:84%
And you walk in,
and people start

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:35.850 align:middle line:84%
bursting out crying
because there

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:38.400 align:middle line:90%
is no people nailed to a cross.

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:40.260 align:middle line:84%
There is no pictures
of dead saints.

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:41.640 align:middle line:90%
There's no stained glass.

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:45.340 align:middle line:84%
It's exactly what Bernard
of Clairvaux said.

00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:47.910 align:middle line:84%
The building, the
true building for you

00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:51.000 align:middle line:84%
to practice your spirituality
and your connection to God,

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.790 align:middle line:84%
you have to deny your ego
and elevate your soul, which

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:55.170 align:middle line:90%
means it's stone.

00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:58.414 align:middle line:84%
It's energy, and it's
light and nothing else.

00:32:58.414 --> 00:33:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the
dimensions are pure sound.

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:02.788 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it is so elegant,
and it's just so beautiful.

00:33:02.788 --> 00:33:05.349 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh, you breathe,
and it has a note to it.

00:33:05.349 --> 00:33:06.390 align:middle line:90%
And it comes back to you.

00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:08.471 align:middle line:84%
And you go, wow, and
you feel elevated.

00:33:08.471 --> 00:33:09.470 align:middle line:90%
It's not about religion.

00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:09.900 align:middle line:90%
It's about spirit.

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think you
said it's like having

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:12.360 align:middle line:90%
an out-of-body experience.

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:13.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It really is.

00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:15.090 align:middle line:90%
And you start just humming.

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, the
acoustics are so wonderful.

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:20.099 align:middle line:84%
And the Russians actually did
some experiments in buildings

00:33:20.099 --> 00:33:20.898 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:33:20.898 --> 00:33:23.200 align:middle line:84%
And they said that when you
stand in these buildings,

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.470 align:middle line:84%
in the Gothic cathedrals,
which, of course, are

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:28.080 align:middle line:84%
an extension of Arabic design
that the Templars brought

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:31.470 align:middle line:84%
into Europe, the first
skyscrapers in Europe.

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:35.070 align:middle line:84%
The Russians found out
by studying the myths

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:37.380 align:middle line:84%
that when you actually stand
a person inside the nave

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:40.760 align:middle line:84%
of a Gothic cathedral, and
you monitor their brainwaves,

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:43.040 align:middle line:84%
and you put them in
a receptive stage,

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:45.930 align:middle line:84%
pump a bit of Gregorian chant
in there, the kind of pop music

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:49.590 align:middle line:84%
that they were doing back then,
and your brainwaves go 4,000%

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:51.030 align:middle line:90%
above normal waking state.

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:53.820 align:middle line:84%
That's what the Templars
found under the Temple

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:56.250 align:middle line:84%
Mount, the secret
recipe of how to create

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:59.960 align:middle line:84%
a building on a specific piece
of land that elevates the soul.

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And Bernard knew about this
because where he lived,

00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:07.590 align:middle line:84%
he was also privy to
a group of mystics.

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:09.500 align:middle line:90%
I think Rashi was one of them.

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:12.823 align:middle line:84%
He was a Hebrew guy who was
fascinated with Kabbalah.

00:34:12.823 --> 00:34:14.489 align:middle line:84%
And they basically
exchanged information

00:34:14.489 --> 00:34:18.780 align:middle line:84%
about how to build a place that
allows you beyond meditation

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:21.489 align:middle line:84%
to literally leave the body and
have an out-of-body experience

00:34:21.489 --> 00:34:23.489 align:middle line:84%
that makes you have a
personal experience of God

00:34:23.489 --> 00:34:25.230 align:middle line:90%
without an intermediary.

00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:27.540 align:middle line:84%
That's what the Templar
secret was all about.

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it was
exemplified in Alcobaca.

00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:30.295 align:middle line:90%


00:34:30.295 --> 00:34:32.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Alcobaca, and there's
a good pastry store nearby

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:33.470 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:35.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, boy,
OK, no, have you

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:38.040 align:middle line:84%
found any other
structure that has

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:41.010 align:middle line:84%
had that degree of
perfection of understanding

00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:45.420 align:middle line:84%
of how the principles of light
and sound and form and geometry

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:48.090 align:middle line:84%
and the emanations of the
Earth all come together

00:34:48.090 --> 00:34:49.560 align:middle line:90%
beyond Alcobaca?

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:52.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh, yeah, Chartres
Cathedral is a great example.

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:54.030 align:middle line:84%
It's been ruined
recently, I have to say.

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:57.660 align:middle line:10%
They have completely turned the
inside into this monstrosity.

00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:59.826 align:middle line:10%
I mean, even the French
are annoyed about this.

00:34:59.826 --> 00:35:02.450 align:middle line:10%
But it's still a great building
to go and visit on a quiet day.

00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:03.960 align:middle line:90%
Any Gothic cathedral is.

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:05.430 align:middle line:84%
But even so, the
Gothic cathedrals

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:08.790 align:middle line:84%
are basically a
12th-century extrapolation

00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:10.350 align:middle line:90%
of the Great Pyramid.

00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:13.200 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at the
Great Pyramid, or Tiwanaku,

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:17.700 align:middle line:84%
or Sacsayhuaman, Chichen
Itza, any sacred site you

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:19.740 align:middle line:84%
care to talk about,
they are all built

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:21.920 align:middle line:90%
on exactly the same recipe.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:24.270 align:middle line:84%
They just couldn't build
pyramids in the Middle Ages

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:25.890 align:middle line:84%
because that would
give the game away

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:28.230 align:middle line:84%
that you're following
a heretical thought.

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:30.470 align:middle line:90%
So they had to redesign it.

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:33.190 align:middle line:84%
But ironically, the houses
of God that were eventually

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:35.340 align:middle line:84%
dedicated to the Catholic
Church and Christianity

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:38.757 align:middle line:84%
were borrowed from the
Arabs, their fiercest enemy.

00:35:38.757 --> 00:35:40.340 align:middle line:84%
It's a strange joke,
isn't it, really?

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:41.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:44.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So any time you go
to any of these buildings,

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:46.350 align:middle line:84%
you literally are
walking the footsteps

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:49.660 align:middle line:84%
of a very old recipe that
literally denies your ego

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:50.820 align:middle line:90%
and ascends your soul.

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:53.850 align:middle line:84%
You just have to be a little
bit open-minded and aware to it.

00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And it was all about
literally manipulating

00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:59.320 align:middle line:84%
the known laws of physics
and the laws of nature.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:00.600 align:middle line:90%
That's what was hidden.

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.670 align:middle line:84%
That was the treasure that was
hidden under the Temple Mount.

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:02.730 align:middle line:90%


00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's where
we're going now, the Essenes.

00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:07.740 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about the Essenes.

00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:11.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh, men in white
who had an outer brotherhood

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:13.230 align:middle line:84%
and an inner brotherhood,
who gave away

00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:15.510 align:middle line:84%
all of their possessions
to be held in escrow,

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:20.910 align:middle line:84%
followed the method of absenting
from sex with other women,

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:22.680 align:middle line:84%
because it wasn't
about celibacy.

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:26.055 align:middle line:84%
It was about having sex outside
your partner because there

00:36:26.055 --> 00:36:28.430 align:middle line:84%
was so much illegitimacy
in the period

00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:30.840 align:middle line:84%
that the only way to maintain
a group family together

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.490 align:middle line:90%
is to say, OK, look.

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:34.440 align:middle line:84%
There's a contract
between two people.

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And for you to go off, you know,
gallivanting and impregnating

00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:39.850 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of women is
not good for society.

00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:42.870 align:middle line:84%
So the vow of chastity,
obedience, and poverty

00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:45.350 align:middle line:84%
was not actually
absolutely true.

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:49.080 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes, like the Templars,
believed in abstinence

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:52.410 align:middle line:84%
for the sake of performing the
rites with their single partner

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:54.870 align:middle line:84%
and holding all of
their money in escrow.

00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:57.220 align:middle line:84%
So then they could use
it for the greater good.

00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:58.801 align:middle line:84%
That's what it was
really all about.

00:36:58.801 --> 00:37:00.300 align:middle line:84%
So the Essenes had
two brotherhoods,

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:01.590 align:middle line:90%
like the Templars.

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:03.120 align:middle line:84%
They believed in
life after death.

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:08.340 align:middle line:84%
They believed in ritual
bathing as a first act

00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:11.250 align:middle line:84%
towards the path of
initiation, which literally

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:13.350 align:middle line:90%
means to become conscious.

00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:15.000 align:middle line:90%
That's what initiation means.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.640 align:middle line:84%
The Templars practiced
exactly the same ritual.

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And there was a five-step
process, the end of which

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:25.050 align:middle line:84%
was going into a secret chamber
under your main sacred building

00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:27.420 align:middle line:90%
where you took a narcotic.

00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And you then declared a vow to
discover the joys of paradise,

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:34.890 align:middle line:84%
which is what the Templar
initiates, joining the order,

00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:36.420 align:middle line:90%
also declared the same vow.

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:39.961 align:middle line:84%
We join the Templar Order to
discover the joys of paradise.

00:37:39.961 --> 00:37:41.460 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't sound like
the kind of thing

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:45.960 align:middle line:84%
that a knight would declare
to go off and fight.

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:50.190 align:middle line:84%
People just don't do that
if they're into fighting.

00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:52.019 align:middle line:84%
So they practiced
this thing called

00:37:52.019 --> 00:37:54.310 align:middle line:84%
the living resurrection,
where the person was taken out

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:54.780 align:middle line:90%
of body.

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:56.488 align:middle line:84%
When they came back
into the living body,

00:37:56.488 --> 00:37:58.500 align:middle line:84%
they are declared
risen from the dead.

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And the Templars
practiced the same thing,

00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:03.550 align:middle line:84%
and the Freemasons that followed
did exactly the same thing.

00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:06.530 align:middle line:84%
So the Essenes were essentially
following a very old tradition

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:07.530 align:middle line:90%
by their time.

00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And 1,000 years
later, the Templars

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.750 align:middle line:84%
pick up on it, right
down to the white robes.

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:13.810 align:middle line:84%
The Cistercians, to
a certain degree,

00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:15.660 align:middle line:90%
did exactly the same thing.

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And the Scottish Rite Masons
followed on from that as well.

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:21.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's a continuation of a
very long tradition, borrowing

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:23.690 align:middle line:84%
from the same book,
which I believe

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:25.440 align:middle line:84%
is the Book of John
the Baptist, which

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.600 align:middle line:84%
the Mandaeans to this
very day, are still

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:29.550 align:middle line:90%
practicing in Southern Iraq.

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:30.870 align:middle line:90%
Now here's the irony.

00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:34.380 align:middle line:84%
The Mandaeans, who read
from the Book of John, which

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:36.420 align:middle line:84%
is called the
treasure, by the way,

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:40.490 align:middle line:84%
so the treasure literally goes
back to the concept of a book.

00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:42.240 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't a monetary
treasure because when

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:44.890 align:middle line:84%
you think about the etymology
of treasure, "tresaurus,"

00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:47.250 align:middle line:84%
it literally is a
treasure of words,

00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:49.500 align:middle line:84%
because that's where we get
the word "thesaurus" from.

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:51.291 align:middle line:84%
So when you are thinking
about the Templars

00:38:51.291 --> 00:38:53.120 align:middle line:84%
looking for a treasure
on the Temple Mount,

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:55.050 align:middle line:84%
yeah, if you're into
monetary things, yeah,

00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:57.000 align:middle line:84%
that makes a lot
of sense, but not

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.040 align:middle line:84%
if you're into
spiritual degrees, which

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:01.770 align:middle line:84%
is what the inner Templar
brotherhood was doing.

00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:04.440 align:middle line:84%
The original concept
of treasure was a book.

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And the book, literally
the [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:08.580 align:middle line:90%
it means "treasure" in Mandaean.

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And that book is
the Book of John

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:12.974 align:middle line:84%
the Baptist, which the church
says never was written,

00:39:12.974 --> 00:39:15.640 align:middle line:84%
which makes, of course, the book
that the Mandaeans were writing

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:17.950 align:middle line:90%
very inconvenient for them.

00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's go to the
Essenes, the political climate,

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:26.530 align:middle line:84%
and Temple Mount and
the Book of John,

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:28.720 align:middle line:84%
and start bringing this
all together for us.

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:31.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So the Romans are
closing in on Jerusalem.

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And the Essenes realize
they can't get away.

00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:34.384 align:middle line:84%
So the only way
they can get away

00:39:34.384 --> 00:39:38.470 align:middle line:84%
is to basically scurry across
Palestine and the Middle East

00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:42.760 align:middle line:84%
and bury all of their treasure
in caves or the Temple Mount.

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:45.430 align:middle line:84%
But they left a trail,
which kind of went very cold

00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:47.470 align:middle line:90%
and went very underground.

00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:49.210 align:middle line:84%
It was maintained by
the mystery schools.

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:51.280 align:middle line:84%
And they kept very,
very dark about it

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:54.920 align:middle line:84%
because obviously the church is
also going to be in ascendance.

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And at the time we
also had, you know,

00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:59.410 align:middle line:90%
obviously Jesus has gone AWOL.

00:39:59.410 --> 00:40:02.290 align:middle line:10%
The Gnostic Christians
always maintained, including

00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:05.770 align:middle line:10%
two of the prime apostles,
Thomas and Philip

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:08.490 align:middle line:10%
in their Gnostic gospels,
which were banned,

00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:10.240 align:middle line:10%
they said Jesus never
died on the cross.

00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:14.040 align:middle line:84%
You are mistaking a spiritual
truth with an event.

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:15.901 align:middle line:84%
And the Quran says
exactly the same thing.

00:40:15.901 --> 00:40:17.650 align:middle line:84%
No, they didn't nail
the guy to the cross.

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:18.900 align:middle line:90%
That's a symbol.

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:21.060 align:middle line:10%
It's a metaphor of
the risen initiate,

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:24.100 align:middle line:10%
the same as Quetzalcoatl
has exactly the same story

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:26.110 align:middle line:10%
500 years before Jesus.

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:29.147 align:middle line:84%
So the story was
maintained underground.

00:40:29.147 --> 00:40:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And they basically realized
that the only way this

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:33.700 align:middle line:84%
is going to survive,
this continuous thread

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:35.547 align:middle line:84%
of spirituality is
going to survive

00:40:35.547 --> 00:40:37.880 align:middle line:84%
if it's maintained with the
secret mysteries traditions.

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:39.070 align:middle line:90%
That's why they were secret.

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:40.630 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want
to be taken over

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:43.940 align:middle line:84%
by a group of despots, whether
they were religious leaders

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:45.542 align:middle line:90%
or whether they were kings.

00:40:45.542 --> 00:40:47.750 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want to be
misused for the wrong reasons,

00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:49.250 align:middle line:84%
because what we're
dealing with here

00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:52.000 align:middle line:84%
is the manipulation of
energy with natural forces

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.200 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.250 align:middle line:90%
Anybody can do this.

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:57.634 align:middle line:84%
You and I can do it all the
time, and we probably do.

00:40:57.634 --> 00:40:59.800 align:middle line:84%
But if you put this in the
hands of the wrong people

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.307 align:middle line:84%
with the wrong
spiritual ideal, you

00:41:01.307 --> 00:41:02.890 align:middle line:84%
can use that same
energy, that doesn't

00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:05.200 align:middle line:84%
know right or wrong,
into the wrong hands.

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And they can use it to
control populations.

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:09.610 align:middle line:90%
That's why they kept it secret.

00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And then through
the Order of Sion

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:14.080 align:middle line:84%
that said that we've
got this mandate that

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:17.260 align:middle line:84%
goes all the way back, so when
the monks calling themselves

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:21.880 align:middle line:84%
the Order of Sion show up
in I think it was about 1060

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:24.340 align:middle line:84%
in Northern Europe,
declaring themselves

00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:28.570 align:middle line:84%
to be the Order of Sion,
that are basically picking up

00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:30.520 align:middle line:84%
a thread that's 1,000
years old, now we

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:31.870 align:middle line:84%
know they're telling
the truth, because you

00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:32.911 align:middle line:90%
can't make this stuff up.

00:41:32.911 --> 00:41:34.240 align:middle line:90%
It's too convoluted.

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.740 align:middle line:90%
The story is so complex.

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:37.399 align:middle line:84%
Why would you make
this stuff up?

00:41:37.399 --> 00:41:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And they are saying
that we have maintained

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:41.470 align:middle line:84%
this tradition, this
hidden tradition

00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:45.040 align:middle line:84%
of the spiritual essence,
that now is the time

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:48.640 align:middle line:84%
to pick up on that because
there's a group of people that

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:51.640 align:middle line:84%
are desperate enough to go and
fight all the way across Europe

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:52.790 align:middle line:90%
and liberate Jerusalem.

00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:55.210 align:middle line:84%
This is our window to
recapture those books,

00:41:55.210 --> 00:41:58.090 align:middle line:84%
bring them back to Europe,
and create a new nation-state,

00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:00.880 align:middle line:84%
and rebuild this
true Christianity.

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:04.120 align:middle line:84%
It's a wonderful romantic story,
and complicated and difficult.

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:05.494 align:middle line:90%
But they stuck to it.

00:42:05.494 --> 00:42:06.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You
touched on something

00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:10.950 align:middle line:84%
a moment ago about, again,
this constant fight,

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:12.910 align:middle line:84%
a struggle between
light and dark,

00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:16.090 align:middle line:84%
between trying to preserve
this valuable knowledge so that

00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:17.290 align:middle line:90%
isn't misused.

00:42:17.290 --> 00:42:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And as we talked about earlier,
and I included you in it,

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:24.760 align:middle line:84%
that we have entities
that continue incarnating

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:27.640 align:middle line:84%
throughout history to
bring back knowledge,

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:30.430 align:middle line:84%
to bring back true tenets
of universal understanding

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:34.270 align:middle line:84%
and light to the population,
or those with ears to hear,

00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:35.860 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:38.800 align:middle line:84%
We have to remember,
the exact same thing

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.450 align:middle line:90%
exists on the other side.

00:42:40.450 --> 00:42:43.060 align:middle line:84%
We live on a planet
that is suspended

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:44.780 align:middle line:90%
between light and dark.

00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:47.050 align:middle line:84%
That's what makes it so
intriguing here, right?

00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:48.220 align:middle line:90%
We can choose our path.

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:49.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It's like a big,
experimental way station.

00:42:49.450 --> 00:42:51.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly,
so I would have

00:42:51.550 --> 00:42:54.910 align:middle line:84%
to assume that you have the
mirror image of those who

00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:58.660 align:middle line:84%
are doing it, bringing
the knowledge forth again

00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:01.690 align:middle line:84%
and again throughout history
at certain key windows, which

00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:03.460 align:middle line:90%
may be astrologically aligned.

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:04.690 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:07.040 align:middle line:90%
There's some thought on that.

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:09.400 align:middle line:84%
You also have the key
forces of dark coming back

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:12.657 align:middle line:84%
at the same time to
attempt to counter it.

00:43:12.657 --> 00:43:14.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And, of course,
the great symbol for that

00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:17.350 align:middle line:84%
is the checkerboard
pattern that was adopted

00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:20.860 align:middle line:84%
by the early Templars and
also by the Masonic Order

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:23.650 align:middle line:84%
because it's not really about
being very, very lighty,

00:43:23.650 --> 00:43:26.710 align:middle line:84%
because when you get to lighty,
you lose track of the fact

00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:29.650 align:middle line:84%
that there's a big darkness here
that you have to be aware of.

00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:32.080 align:middle line:84%
The idea is to look at
both sides of the equation,

00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:34.750 align:middle line:84%
kind of like Star
Wars, really, you know,

00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:36.690 align:middle line:84%
which is a great example
in this day and age.

00:43:36.690 --> 00:43:38.280 align:middle line:84%
It's the rewriting
of the Grail myth,

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:41.200 align:middle line:84%
essentially, where,
you know, Anakin

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:44.110 align:middle line:84%
is a Jedi, which is
actually an Egyptian name

00:43:44.110 --> 00:43:47.120 align:middle line:84%
for the pillar of the universe,
by the way, the Djed pillar.

00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And he starts off
being very lighty.

00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:50.077 align:middle line:84%
He gets seduced
by the dark side,

00:43:50.077 --> 00:43:51.160 align:middle line:90%
develops an understanding.

00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And he eventually has the
motivation and the essence

00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:55.780 align:middle line:90%
to say, well, wait a minute.

00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:58.510 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I have become too
unbalanced on both sides.

00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:01.360 align:middle line:84%
The trick is to walk the
fine line in between the two.

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:04.360 align:middle line:84%
That's the secret of doing
this properly-- the light

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:05.910 align:middle line:84%
and the dark, being
aware of both,

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:08.710 align:middle line:84%
and knowing when to
apply both, and also

00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:11.200 align:middle line:84%
to walk the fine line in
between, very hard to do.

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:12.700 align:middle line:84%
And you know who's doing it
because they usually have

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:13.908 align:middle line:90%
all the arrows on their back.

00:44:13.908 --> 00:44:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
no, exactly, it's

00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:18.780 align:middle line:84%
as though the pressure
between the two, as you say,

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:22.680 align:middle line:84%
we'll make a decision that
kind of tips us over into one.

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And then the
self-correcting mechanism

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:27.300 align:middle line:84%
is the pain from, say, if you've
tipped over into the dark.

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:29.700 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, you can
self-correct and move back

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:30.700 align:middle line:90%
over the other way.

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:32.730 align:middle line:84%
But then if you're lost
in the clouds again,

00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:36.660 align:middle line:84%
you're ineffective, and you're
really not using your will

00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:39.160 align:middle line:84%
and your abilities on the
planet at the same time.

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:41.250 align:middle line:84%
So you have to take that
light and, as you say,

00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:45.300 align:middle line:84%
focus it in this scene right
between light and dark.

00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think that a lot of the
misunderstanding on the planet

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:53.730 align:middle line:84%
is really about where you
choose to put your focus.

00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:55.419 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Exactly,
or over-associating

00:44:55.419 --> 00:44:57.960 align:middle line:84%
with a particular concept, where
you lose track of everything

00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:00.812 align:middle line:84%
else, kind of almost like being
lost in love with somebody.

00:45:00.812 --> 00:45:03.020 align:middle line:84%
It's wonderful, but you also
lose track of the bigger

00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:04.510 align:middle line:90%
picture around you.

00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:05.670 align:middle line:90%
And it's also just energy.

00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:07.720 align:middle line:84%
Energy doesn't give a
damn about anything.

00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:08.860 align:middle line:90%
It's just energy.

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:11.790 align:middle line:84%
It's your intent that you
give this energy that gives it

00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:15.150 align:middle line:84%
the direction, which is actually
kind of interesting because it

00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:17.010 align:middle line:84%
brings up the concept
of the Templar logo,

00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:20.370 align:middle line:84%
you know, with the two knights
riding one horse, which

00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:22.830 align:middle line:84%
a lot of mainstream
historians will say,

00:45:22.830 --> 00:45:26.880 align:middle line:84%
well, they were so poor that two
knights had to ride one horse.

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:29.310 align:middle line:10%
Well, any military
person will look at this

00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:31.410 align:middle line:10%
and say, how
absolutely ridiculous

00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:34.260 align:middle line:10%
to take two people weighing
down a horse going into battle?

00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:35.640 align:middle line:10%
Of course, it's a symbol.

00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:38.190 align:middle line:10%
The horse is the
symbol of knowledge.

00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:41.480 align:middle line:10%
It's literally the Western
equivalent of the Sphinx.

00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:43.900 align:middle line:10%
It's the symbol of knowledge.

00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:46.530 align:middle line:10%
So when you have two
people riding one horse,

00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:49.420 align:middle line:10%
that's the twin sides of
personality, the light

00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:50.310 align:middle line:10%
and the dark.

00:45:50.310 --> 00:45:52.900 align:middle line:84%
When you know that there's
a balance between the two

00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:54.450 align:middle line:84%
and you ride the
horse of knowledge,

00:45:54.450 --> 00:45:56.241 align:middle line:84%
you guide that horse
to where it's supposed

00:45:56.241 --> 00:45:57.670 align:middle line:90%
to go in this right direction.

00:45:57.670 --> 00:46:00.390 align:middle line:84%
That's what the true symbol of
the Templars riding the horse

00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:01.460 align:middle line:90%
is all about.

00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and,
of course, you know,

00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:06.750 align:middle line:84%
we want to applaud those who
are riding on the, quote,

00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:07.800 align:middle line:90%
"side of light."

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And we want to demonize those
riding on the side of dark.

00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:15.330 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is
each of these entities

00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:17.950 align:middle line:90%
is on their own path of growth.

00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:22.140 align:middle line:84%
They're providing their
own beingness or service,

00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:26.200 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want to call it,
to whatever realm they live in.

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And so we can say that certainly
the dark has a purpose because

00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:34.320 align:middle line:84%
by the sheer contrast
and pain, you

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:36.300 align:middle line:84%
can find your way
back into something

00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:38.540 align:middle line:84%
that's going to perhaps work
a little better for you,

00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:41.010 align:middle line:84%
you know, puts you into a
little higher frequency range.

00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:41.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They put
you into perspective.

00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: On the other
hand, those very same beings

00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:44.580 align:middle line:84%
are learning from
that that they're

00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:46.780 align:middle line:90%
witnessing in you as well.

00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:49.270 align:middle line:90%
And so it's nothing but growth.

00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:52.320 align:middle line:84%
I think if we can look
at it more as nothing

00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:55.200 align:middle line:84%
but growth on both sides,
neither finish growing.

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:56.502 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, you never do.

00:46:56.502 --> 00:46:57.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You never do.

00:46:57.460 --> 00:46:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And the
Templars were very

00:46:58.320 --> 00:46:59.385 align:middle line:84%
aware of this,
when you recognize

00:46:59.385 --> 00:47:01.876 align:middle line:84%
there were so many of them
that later on during the end

00:47:01.876 --> 00:47:04.500 align:middle line:84%
stages of the Templar movement,
when they were all being burned

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:06.749 align:middle line:84%
alive at the stake, a lot
of them went to their deaths

00:47:06.749 --> 00:47:09.302 align:middle line:84%
actually smiling
because they understood.

00:47:09.302 --> 00:47:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that you are taught

00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:13.380 align:middle line:84%
in the inner brotherhood
of the Templars

00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:16.530 align:middle line:84%
and the people like them
was the manipulation

00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:18.480 align:middle line:84%
of matter and
energy and emotion,

00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:21.570 align:middle line:84%
which is energy in motion,
once you understand

00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:23.910 align:middle line:84%
to disengage yourself from
the emotion of things,

00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:27.300 align:middle line:84%
you have a degree of control,
like a rishi in India

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:31.720 align:middle line:84%
or a yogi, that pain is
really a very temporal thing.

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:34.300 align:middle line:84%
If you can just learn to
overcome that pain as you're

00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:35.699 align:middle line:84%
being burned alive,
you recognize

00:47:35.699 --> 00:47:37.990 align:middle line:84%
there's a moment where it's
going to hurt a little bit.

00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:39.198 align:middle line:90%
And then you've crossed over.

00:47:39.198 --> 00:47:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And you're now on a
different level of reality.

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually
influence things here

00:47:43.110 --> 00:47:44.467 align:middle line:90%
on the physical world.

00:47:44.467 --> 00:47:46.800 align:middle line:84%
So for them, being burned
alive was actually a blessing.

00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:49.559 align:middle line:84%
They said, well, the Earth
is just a temporary stage

00:47:49.559 --> 00:47:50.850 align:middle line:90%
on the bigger scheme of things.

00:47:50.850 --> 00:47:52.620 align:middle line:84%
They already understood
these old concepts.

00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:54.036 align:middle line:84%
So for them, it
wasn't a big deal.

00:47:54.036 --> 00:47:55.770 align:middle line:84%
They were not leaving
anything behind

00:47:55.770 --> 00:47:58.061 align:middle line:84%
because they had already
renounced their worldly goods.

00:47:58.061 --> 00:47:59.640 align:middle line:84%
They weren't
possessive of anything.

00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:03.210 align:middle line:84%
They recognized the
transient nature of reality.

00:48:03.210 --> 00:48:05.370 align:middle line:84%
So for them, the
material position

00:48:05.370 --> 00:48:08.402 align:middle line:84%
that they held in this world and
going to their death for them

00:48:08.402 --> 00:48:09.610 align:middle line:90%
really didn't mean that much.

00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:11.430 align:middle line:84%
They said, well, we're about
to go on another adventure.

00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:12.340 align:middle line:90%
See ya.

00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:14.548 align:middle line:84%
We'll meet you on the other
side as well, by the way.

00:48:14.548 --> 00:48:16.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
and we'll be back.

00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:16.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: We'll be back.

00:48:16.530 --> 00:48:17.360 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:18.160 align:middle line:90%


00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:19.430 align:middle line:90%
We'll be back as [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:21.459 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly,
or something, right.

00:48:21.459 --> 00:48:22.875 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Or the
Invisible College,

00:48:22.875 --> 00:48:24.394 align:middle line:90%
as they were called in France.

00:48:24.394 --> 00:48:26.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they keep regurgitating
themselves again and again

00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:27.712 align:middle line:90%
and again.

00:48:27.712 --> 00:48:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK, let's
get to the punch line.

00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:31.120 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about the Grail now.

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:31.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: The Grail.

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:33.205 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:48:33.205 --> 00:48:34.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Now, you
know, I really didn't

00:48:34.830 --> 00:48:36.960 align:middle line:90%
want to go there in the book.

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:39.360 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like anathema
to any historian.

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, maybe I
just didn't have the depth

00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:44.415 align:middle line:84%
to go into the Grail because so
much had been written about it.

00:48:44.415 --> 00:48:46.300 align:middle line:84%
But inevitably, you
stroke the Templar urn,

00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:49.140 align:middle line:84%
and out comes the
genie with the Grail.

00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, this is why
the book took so long to write.

00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:54.515 align:middle line:84%
I had to go back
and relearn stuff,

00:48:54.515 --> 00:48:56.640 align:middle line:84%
and I had to see it from
a different point of view.

00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:58.110 align:middle line:10%
And the oldest
mention of the Grail

00:48:58.110 --> 00:49:00.940 align:middle line:10%
is actually in Sumeria,
the "Song of Inanna,"

00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:03.780 align:middle line:10%
which becomes a blueprint
for the "Song of Solomon."

00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And in the "Song of
Inanna," they talk about

00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:08.780 align:middle line:84%
the [NON-ENGLISH],, which is
where the word comes from.

00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And the [NON-ENGLISH]
essentially is symbolized

00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:15.150 align:middle line:84%
by this divine virgin holding
a ceremonial tray called

00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:19.540 align:middle line:84%
a salver, upon which sits
this gold-silver object.

00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:22.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at this, and
I'm going, wait a minute.

00:49:22.030 --> 00:49:23.730 align:middle line:84%
Everything being
equal in the mysteries

00:49:23.730 --> 00:49:25.780 align:middle line:90%
teachings, this is all a symbol.

00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:28.270 align:middle line:84%
That woman represents
the divine virgin.

00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:30.610 align:middle line:84%
She is holding a ceremonial
tray made of silver.

00:49:30.610 --> 00:49:34.210 align:middle line:90%
And the Grail is a gold cup.

00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:37.447 align:middle line:84%
That's an Egyptian concept
between the matter of the moon

00:49:37.447 --> 00:49:39.280 align:middle line:84%
and the sun, the masculine
and the feminine,

00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:42.410 align:middle line:84%
the two elements that make up
the top of all the pyramids,

00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:43.630 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:43.915 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Isis-Osiris.

00:49:43.915 --> 00:49:46.206 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I thought, so perhaps
what we're talking about

00:49:46.206 --> 00:49:48.130 align:middle line:90%
is not a real object.

00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:51.130 align:middle line:84%
But ironically and
paradoxically, actually, it

00:49:51.130 --> 00:49:54.310 align:middle line:84%
is, because the people that
held that understanding were

00:49:54.310 --> 00:49:56.920 align:middle line:84%
the holy bloodline, the
priestesses of the temple,

00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:59.590 align:middle line:84%
who, of course, was
Inanna, the woman in red,

00:49:59.590 --> 00:50:02.590 align:middle line:84%
who then through time,
eventually ends up the baton

00:50:02.590 --> 00:50:04.330 align:middle line:90%
gets handed to Mary Magdalene.

00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And she eventually
goes to France

00:50:05.770 --> 00:50:07.720 align:middle line:84%
and communicates with
the people in France,

00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:10.440 align:middle line:84%
transmits the information,
continues the holy bloodline

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:11.780 align:middle line:90%
in that part of the world.

00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:13.960 align:middle line:84%
The Templars picked
up on this, of course.

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And they basically
are the reason

00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:18.490 align:middle line:84%
that the only way to bring
this all back into focus

00:50:18.490 --> 00:50:21.510 align:middle line:84%
is to recreate the
Grail in Portugal.

00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:23.990 align:middle line:90%
And I still remember the day.

00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:25.710 align:middle line:84%
15 years later,
and I'm thinking,

00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:28.170 align:middle line:84%
there's something very
obvious that I'm missing here.

00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:30.500 align:middle line:10%
And I'm sitting in this
wonderful courtyard

00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:32.160 align:middle line:10%
near the Rotunda of Tomar.

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:33.830 align:middle line:10%
And the rotunda is
talking back to me.

00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:34.630 align:middle line:10%
And trust me.

00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:36.160 align:middle line:10%
It really does happen.

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.590 align:middle line:10%
And it says, well,
why don't you actually

00:50:38.590 --> 00:50:40.311 align:middle line:10%
find out what my
original name is?

00:50:40.311 --> 00:50:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I'd
better write this down.

00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:43.215 align:middle line:90%
This could be interesting.

00:50:43.215 --> 00:50:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And I found out
the original name

00:50:44.590 --> 00:50:46.423 align:middle line:84%
for the rotunda, which
is a word that exists

00:50:46.423 --> 00:50:47.730 align:middle line:90%
in Portuguese by the way--

00:50:47.730 --> 00:50:49.146 align:middle line:84%
and it means the
same things as it

00:50:49.146 --> 00:50:50.890 align:middle line:84%
does in English
and in Latin, which

00:50:50.890 --> 00:50:55.040 align:middle line:84%
is a round building, which never
had an altar, never had a door.

00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:57.979 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, why wouldn't they
have just called it a rotunda?

00:50:57.979 --> 00:50:59.520 align:middle line:84%
They called it a
[PORTUGUESE],, which

00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:01.200 align:middle line:84%
is a very unusual
word in Portuguese.

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:03.640 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, a
simple dictionary,

00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:05.890 align:middle line:84%
you go and find out
what's this all about.

00:51:05.890 --> 00:51:08.297 align:middle line:90%
It turns out the [PORTUGUESE]--

00:51:08.297 --> 00:51:10.630 align:middle line:84%
here is a big spoiler, if
you're going to read the book.

00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:12.850 align:middle line:90%
So don't hear this right now.

00:51:12.850 --> 00:51:16.450 align:middle line:84%
[PORTUGUESE] literally means
a salver, a ceremonial tray.

00:51:16.450 --> 00:51:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
penny suddenly drops.

00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:21.310 align:middle line:84%
Why would you call a
building, a round building,

00:51:21.310 --> 00:51:24.250 align:middle line:84%
a ceremonial tray,
unless, of course, my God,

00:51:24.250 --> 00:51:25.720 align:middle line:90%
the building is the Grail.

00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:26.860 align:middle line:90%
But it's not the building.

00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:30.010 align:middle line:84%
It's the action that takes
place inside the building, which

00:51:30.010 --> 00:51:33.750 align:middle line:84%
we now know was deliberately
sited on a hot spot of energy

00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:36.180 align:middle line:84%
with specific
geometry to elucidate

00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:39.280 align:middle line:84%
a certain state of mind,
which was recreated

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:42.040 align:middle line:84%
in a secret chamber where
the inner brotherhood did

00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:44.189 align:middle line:90%
their most secret initiation.

00:51:44.189 --> 00:51:45.230 align:middle line:90%
That's what it was about.

00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:47.930 align:middle line:84%
So the Grail technically
is in Portugal.

00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And yet it's also
everywhere else

00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:51.100 align:middle line:90%
where the Templars existed.

00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's also in any
other sacred site

00:51:53.290 --> 00:51:55.930 align:middle line:84%
where you connect with
the same sacred geometry,

00:51:55.930 --> 00:51:58.630 align:middle line:84%
the same designs, and
the same principles

00:51:58.630 --> 00:52:00.220 align:middle line:90%
which the Templars had designed.

00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:02.134 align:middle line:84%
So the Grail actually
is everywhere.

00:52:02.134 --> 00:52:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I found
that fascinating

00:52:03.550 --> 00:52:06.490 align:middle line:84%
because then the stories
start making sense.

00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And Jim Marrs' book, I don't
remember the name of it,

00:52:08.770 --> 00:52:13.750 align:middle line:84%
one I read many years ago about
the Scottish Rite Templars

00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:17.590 align:middle line:84%
housing the Grail, you know,
and then that the Grail had gone

00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:20.770 align:middle line:84%
to America and all
these different tales

00:52:20.770 --> 00:52:24.520 align:middle line:84%
I've read over the last
15, 20 years about who

00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:25.900 align:middle line:90%
houses the Grail.

00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:27.284 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: A lot of people.

00:52:27.284 --> 00:52:29.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is the
first time it's actually

00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:31.620 align:middle line:84%
made sense, including
under the Temple Mount.

00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:33.370 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: Including
under the Temple Mount,

00:52:33.370 --> 00:52:35.410 align:middle line:10%
exactly, including
under the Great Pyramid,

00:52:35.410 --> 00:52:38.380 align:middle line:10%
including under the Great
Pyramids of Chichen Itza

00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:40.630 align:middle line:10%
and the Pyramid of the
Magician, next to Chichen Itza,

00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:41.960 align:middle line:10%
which no one pays attention to.

00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:42.760 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere.

00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:44.160 align:middle line:90%
It's a concept.

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:46.930 align:middle line:84%
It's literally the meeting
of the heart and the mind.

00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:49.300 align:middle line:10%
The ultimate aim of
the spiritual initiate

00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:53.390 align:middle line:10%
is to basically
find him or herself.

00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:56.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's an object
insofar as it's

00:52:56.140 --> 00:52:58.329 align:middle line:84%
represented by a
cup that is filled

00:52:58.329 --> 00:52:59.870 align:middle line:84%
with the bloodline
of the people that

00:52:59.870 --> 00:53:02.260 align:middle line:84%
maintained that understanding,
but it's not an object.

00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:04.600 align:middle line:84%
If you're seeking an object,
you've lost the plot.

00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:06.250 align:middle line:90%
This is not about object things.

00:53:06.250 --> 00:53:07.720 align:middle line:90%
It's not about physical things.

00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:09.520 align:middle line:90%
It's about a spiritual concept.

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:11.330 align:middle line:84%
Now you're on the
right line of inquiry.

00:53:11.330 --> 00:53:12.910 align:middle line:84%
This is a thing
that the Templars

00:53:12.910 --> 00:53:14.890 align:middle line:90%
would protect to their death.

00:53:14.890 --> 00:53:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we will
protect the greatest secret

00:53:17.590 --> 00:53:20.212 align:middle line:84%
within our brotherhood
to the death

00:53:20.212 --> 00:53:21.670 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't
want this stuff

00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:24.730 align:middle line:84%
to be given to anybody who
would misuse this understanding.

00:53:24.730 --> 00:53:29.020 align:middle line:84%
You had to be a very
spiritualized, balanced person

00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:31.120 align:middle line:84%
to just understand
the concept of what

00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:34.420 align:middle line:84%
it means to be a truly risen
and spiritualized initiate.

00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:36.640 align:middle line:90%
Jesus knew that.

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:39.320 align:middle line:84%
He was following on from people
like Zoroaster and Mithra,

00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:42.860 align:middle line:84%
all these resurrected
god-men, Osiris, symbols

00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:44.200 align:middle line:90%
to this very day.

00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:47.150 align:middle line:84%
That was why they maintained
the secret to the very death

00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:49.510 align:middle line:84%
and why Templars,
or people wishing

00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:51.817 align:middle line:84%
to join the Templar
Order, and specifically

00:53:51.817 --> 00:53:54.400 align:middle line:84%
the inner brotherhood, which was
very different from the outer

00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:56.410 align:middle line:84%
brotherhood-- they just
did the menial stuff.

00:53:56.410 --> 00:53:58.790 align:middle line:84%
The inner brotherhood, they
were a ministerial college,

00:53:58.790 --> 00:53:59.610 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:53:59.610 --> 00:54:01.480 align:middle line:90%
They were Essenes, essentially.

00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:05.260 align:middle line:84%
They had to declare a vow to
discover the joys of paradise.

00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, people
who want to go into battle

00:54:07.810 --> 00:54:11.410 align:middle line:84%
don't say things like that
unless joining the Templars

00:54:11.410 --> 00:54:13.150 align:middle line:90%
came with a spiritual benefit.

00:54:13.150 --> 00:54:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
it all made sense,

00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:17.670 align:middle line:84%
that the pursuit of the
Grail, this treasure, which

00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:19.955 align:middle line:84%
was a book of
information, that's

00:54:19.955 --> 00:54:21.330 align:middle line:84%
what they were
trying to protect.

00:54:21.330 --> 00:54:24.060 align:middle line:84%
It was about the treasure
that enabled the initiate

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:26.552 align:middle line:84%
to discover his or
her gold within.

00:54:26.552 --> 00:54:28.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this points
back to your previous work,

00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:30.570 align:middle line:90%
"The Lost Art of Resurrection."

00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:33.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Go ahead.

00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:34.947 align:middle line:84%
We've got just a
couple of minutes left.

00:54:34.947 --> 00:54:37.071 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I thought, what
am I doing this Wednesday?

00:54:37.071 --> 00:54:38.426 align:middle line:90%
Hey, that's a good story.

00:54:38.426 --> 00:54:41.070 align:middle line:84%
No, it led me to then
question the concept

00:54:41.070 --> 00:54:42.540 align:middle line:90%
of Jesus's resurrection.

00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:44.670 align:middle line:84%
Why were the early
Christians, the Gnostics,

00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:48.887 align:middle line:84%
being killed, massacred
by the fundamentalists?

00:54:48.887 --> 00:54:50.220 align:middle line:90%
And they nearly won, by the way.

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:53.130 align:middle line:90%
It was a very, very close fight.

00:54:53.130 --> 00:54:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And I began to look into the
concepts of the apostle Thomas

00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:59.220 align:middle line:84%
and the writings of
Philip, the ones that

00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:00.840 align:middle line:90%
didn't make it into the Bible.

00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:03.600 align:middle line:84%
And, oh, Susannah, we're
talking about two very different

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:06.570 align:middle line:84%
stories here because they're
talking about the whole concept

00:55:06.570 --> 00:55:08.220 align:middle line:90%
that the church is an impostor.

00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:10.960 align:middle line:84%
They have taken the place of
the true Christian brotherhood.

00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:11.760 align:middle line:90%
Wait a minute.

00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:12.885 align:middle line:90%
I was raised as a Catholic.

00:55:12.885 --> 00:55:14.739 align:middle line:84%
Where does this
come onto question?

00:55:14.739 --> 00:55:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And the Essenes were
saying the same thing,

00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:18.580 align:middle line:84%
and the Mandaeans were
saying the same thing.

00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, they were
protecting a very old concept

00:55:22.290 --> 00:55:23.190 align:middle line:90%
of spirituality.

00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:26.310 align:middle line:84%
It was an inner concept,
and it was about the idea

00:55:26.310 --> 00:55:29.850 align:middle line:84%
that the true concept of
living Resurrection never

00:55:29.850 --> 00:55:33.330 align:middle line:84%
had anyone dying, never had
anyone being nailed to a cross.

00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:36.490 align:middle line:84%
It was a metaphor
like anything else.

00:55:36.490 --> 00:55:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And the idea was that
you would undertake

00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:40.730 align:middle line:84%
this secret initiation for
which you would give up

00:55:40.730 --> 00:55:42.085 align:middle line:90%
three years of your life.

00:55:42.085 --> 00:55:44.190 align:middle line:90%
And you discard your property.

00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:45.750 align:middle line:90%
You put it into escrow.

00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:47.400 align:middle line:90%
You would wear white robes.

00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:48.560 align:middle line:90%
You do a ritual baptism.

00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:49.840 align:middle line:90%
Sound familiar?

00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And then you would
undertake a final act

00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:54.330 align:middle line:84%
where you go into
a secret chamber

00:55:54.330 --> 00:55:56.100 align:middle line:90%
under a specific building.

00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:59.700 align:middle line:84%
You were guided by a priestess
who would give you a narcotic.

00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:03.000 align:middle line:84%
And it was usually undertaken
on the 21st of December.

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:06.240 align:middle line:84%
Three days later, you would
come back into your living body

00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:08.880 align:middle line:84%
after having gone walk away
and AWOL in the other world.

00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:09.960 align:middle line:90%
You would return.

00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:12.540 align:middle line:84%
You would be taken out
onto this sacred mound.

00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And you were declared risen
from the dead, still today

00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:18.970 align:middle line:84%
practiced, metaphorically,
in the third degree

00:56:18.970 --> 00:56:20.077 align:middle line:90%
of Freemasonry.

00:56:20.077 --> 00:56:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And so this is exactly what the
concept of living resurrection

00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:24.010 align:middle line:90%
was all about.

00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:26.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this was part of
the work of John the Baptist.

00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:28.503 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And John the
Baptist was practicing

00:56:28.503 --> 00:56:30.436 align:middle line:84%
exactly the same thing
because his lineage

00:56:30.436 --> 00:56:32.310 align:middle line:84%
goes all the way back
to the Sumerian priests

00:56:32.310 --> 00:56:34.710 align:middle line:90%
and priestesses.

00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:36.030 align:middle line:90%
It is mind-blowing, isn't it?

00:56:36.030 --> 00:56:37.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is mind-blowing.

00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And the book is so worth the
time, because it takes time.

00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:46.200 align:middle line:84%
You have to go through, and
you have to think about it

00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:48.642 align:middle line:84%
and process it and
put the dots together.

00:56:48.642 --> 00:56:49.850 align:middle line:90%
You're putting them together.

00:56:49.850 --> 00:56:52.410 align:middle line:84%
But you can't help yourself but
try to put the dots together

00:56:52.410 --> 00:56:53.730 align:middle line:90%
as you go along.

00:56:53.730 --> 00:56:54.900 align:middle line:90%
I did this all the time.

00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
page, boom, you

00:56:56.430 --> 00:56:58.337 align:middle line:90%
put the dots together for me.

00:56:58.337 --> 00:57:00.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I actually did
it as a bit of an antidote

00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:01.360 align:middle line:90%
to today's society.

00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:04.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I watch people in
airport lounges and everywhere

00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:07.140 align:middle line:84%
losing and giving
their God-given ability

00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:09.910 align:middle line:84%
to a little piece of
glass and technology

00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:12.090 align:middle line:84%
that's about that big,
sitting there and doing this

00:57:12.090 --> 00:57:12.960 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:15.360 align:middle line:84%
The first time in history,
we've given away our power

00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:17.640 align:middle line:90%
to a little device.

00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:20.940 align:middle line:84%
We're no longer thinking
and being interactive

00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:22.440 align:middle line:90%
with our surroundings.

00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And I see this as a
big Achilles' heel.

00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I am
going to doggedly write

00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:28.950 align:middle line:84%
a book that is
difficult, that you

00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:31.064 align:middle line:84%
have to keep your eye
on the ball so well.

00:57:31.064 --> 00:57:31.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Boy, do you.

00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:34.438 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Because we're dealing
with three different periods

00:57:34.438 --> 00:57:36.300 align:middle line:84%
of time in three
different parts of Europe,

00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:37.970 align:middle line:90%
and they're all intertwined.

00:57:37.970 --> 00:57:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's written like
a play, the only way

00:57:39.810 --> 00:57:43.380 align:middle line:84%
I could do this in a very
entertaining, non-dry way.

00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
give you the knife,

00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:49.350 align:middle line:84%
you know, the real important
thing, in the last paragraph.

00:57:49.350 --> 00:57:51.720 align:middle line:90%
So don't move to the back.

00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And I want this
to be an antidote,

00:57:53.370 --> 00:57:55.350 align:middle line:84%
because it's going
to make you think.

00:57:55.350 --> 00:57:56.850 align:middle line:90%
You have to work at this.

00:57:56.850 --> 00:57:59.314 align:middle line:84%
Just like an initiate,
you have to do the work.

00:57:59.314 --> 00:58:00.730 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
be done for you.

00:58:00.730 --> 00:58:02.940 align:middle line:84%
Enlightenment doesn't come
out of a box or a book

00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:04.860 align:middle line:90%
or a television program.

00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:06.600 align:middle line:84%
You have to get the
tools, and then you

00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:08.560 align:middle line:90%
have to do the work yourself.

00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:10.380 align:middle line:84%
So for me, I was a bit
of a personal joke,

00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:14.370 align:middle line:84%
a comment on personal reality
in this particular 21st century,

00:58:14.370 --> 00:58:16.735 align:middle line:84%
where we are losing these
wonderful connections.

00:58:16.735 --> 00:58:18.500 align:middle line:10%
And the benefits
at the end, unlike,

00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:21.570 align:middle line:10%
you know, losing your hair
through all the research,

00:58:21.570 --> 00:58:22.860 align:middle line:10%
they actually do come true.

00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:25.318 align:middle line:10%
And I get a lot of feedback
from people that say, you know,

00:58:25.318 --> 00:58:27.630 align:middle line:10%
that book, well, it
was one hell of a slog.

00:58:27.630 --> 00:58:28.680 align:middle line:10%
But you know what?

00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:30.090 align:middle line:10%
It was a great adventure.

00:58:30.090 --> 00:58:31.290 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I totally agree.

00:58:31.290 --> 00:58:32.910 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: You know, and I
thought, well, thank you.

00:58:32.910 --> 00:58:35.326 align:middle line:10%
It's wonderful to hear that
because, yes, it is difficult.

00:58:35.326 --> 00:58:37.660 align:middle line:10%
But like most difficult
things, ultimately, there's

00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:38.460 align:middle line:10%
so much fun.

00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:40.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah,
well, as I said,

00:58:40.110 --> 00:58:43.920 align:middle line:84%
I had at least every
other page dog-eared.

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:45.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: We'll send
you another one.

00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:46.343 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:58:46.343 --> 00:58:47.220 align:middle line:90%
It's a mess.

00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:49.179 align:middle line:84%
Freddy, thank you so much
for 15 years of work.

00:58:49.179 --> 00:58:50.053 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: My pleasure.

00:58:50.053 --> 00:58:52.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And for millennia
after millennia of hard work

00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:52.930 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:58:52.930 --> 00:58:54.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, not another one.

00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:55.870 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:55.870 --> 00:58:57.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:58:57.240 --> 00:58:59.400 align:middle line:84%
I find this topic
absolutely fascinating,

00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:01.609 align:middle line:84%
as the time has arrived to
embrace the mysteries once

00:59:01.609 --> 00:59:02.408 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:59:02.408 --> 00:59:04.230 align:middle line:84%
Personally, I'm not
particularly interested

00:59:04.230 --> 00:59:05.590 align:middle line:90%
in data for data's sake.

00:59:05.590 --> 00:59:07.320 align:middle line:84%
But for functional
use, to elevate

00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:10.320 align:middle line:84%
our perceptive abilities,
following the Templar story

00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:12.840 align:middle line:84%
lays bread crumbs in
the spiritual pursuit.

00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:15.240 align:middle line:84%
It's excellent, again,
the title of the book,

00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:16.980 align:middle line:90%
"First Templar Nation."
