00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:15.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
We recently spoke

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.020 align:middle line:84%
with Dr. Patrick Flanagan, who
possesses one of the greatest

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.860 align:middle line:90%
minds alive, in my opinion.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.740 align:middle line:84%
He's believed to be the
reincarnation of Nikola Tesla

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.140 align:middle line:84%
and thus possesses the
knowledge of energy

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.050 align:middle line:90%
in many of its expressions.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.220 align:middle line:84%
In this conversation, we speak
about the secrets of longevity

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.110 align:middle line:84%
and the electrical nature of
our universe and ourselves.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And we need to get going because
we have a lot to discuss.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to run out
of time like we did last time.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.760 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back, Patrick.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.010 align:middle line:90%
>>PATRICK FLANAGAN: Thank you.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Last time we talked
about all of your inventions

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.830 align:middle line:84%
starting at the age of
eight, your remembrance

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.450 align:middle line:84%
of having been Nikola
Tesla, having proved out

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.200 align:middle line:84%
by drawing his diagrams to an
FBI agent out of the blue, who

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.640 align:middle line:84%
had his old documents
sequestered, and on and on,

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.010 align:middle line:84%
and some of the inventions
through time, the neurophone,

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.210 align:middle line:84%
the book "The Pyramid Power,"
because you understand

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.090 align:middle line:84%
the intrinsic nature of pyramids
and what they're here for.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.880 align:middle line:90%
And we only started.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.100 align:middle line:90%
There's more.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And you really started
dedicating your life

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.800 align:middle line:84%
to human longevity and
health and well-being.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.500 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about--
we'll talk about that.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.750 align:middle line:84%
But I want to start it out by
looking at us, as Tesla would,

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.860 align:middle line:84%
as an electrical being
in an electrical universe

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.040 align:middle line:84%
and how that works
with the sun and us.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.140 align:middle line:84%
So I know that's not
a small question.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.120 align:middle line:84%
So let's take that
wherever you'd like to,

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.520 align:middle line:84%
about the electrical nature
of human beings, the universe,

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.140 align:middle line:90%
and our health and well-being.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.730 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: The entire
universe is electrical.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And everything is an electrical
plasma, ionized plasma,

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.910 align:middle line:84%
whether it's liquid, liquid
crystals, like in human body,

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.900 align:middle line:90%
or gaseous plasma.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.470 align:middle line:84%
It's all-- we have a gaseous
ionized plasma surrounding

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.020 align:middle line:90%
our body.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.350 align:middle line:90%
Some people call it an aura.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And so Tesla took
electrical baths.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And I take electrical
baths all the time.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How do you
take electrical baths?

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.380 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: I have a Tesla coil.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And you adjust it so that
the energy is not actually

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.870 align:middle line:84%
sparking like lightning
bolts to your body,

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.700 align:middle line:84%
but it's creating an
electrical plasma.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.790 align:middle line:90%
And you bathe your body in it.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
just start recharging?

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.830 align:middle line:84%
Obviously your
energy-- you must have

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.170 align:middle line:90%
some energy that comes back.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.620 align:middle line:84%
But there are other
things that are going on

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.640 align:middle line:90%
on a cellular level as well?

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.440 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: On every level.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.390 align:middle line:84%
It adjusts the
water in your body.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.210 align:middle line:84%
It adjusts the-- It feeds
ions, electrical ions,

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.280 align:middle line:84%
and the electrons in all your
acupuncture points on your body

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.410 align:middle line:90%
as you bathe yourself in it.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.730 align:middle line:84%
You can focus on specific
acupuncture points,

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.220 align:middle line:84%
on the kidney meridians on
the bottoms of the feet,

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.066 align:middle line:84%
on the third eye,
on the crown chakra,

00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:14.380 align:middle line:84%
on various parts of
the body, the throat,

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.250 align:middle line:84%
the lymphatic system,
all of these things.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.470 align:middle line:90%
It's all electrical.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.827 align:middle line:90%
We are electrical.

00:03:21.827 --> 00:03:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when
you're saying this,

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.739 align:middle line:84%
I'm reminded of some of
the Rife technologies

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:26.530 align:middle line:90%
that are out there.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.669 align:middle line:84%
And Royal Raymond Rife--
I mean, what a journey.

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:29.960 align:middle line:90%
You've had a difficult journey.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.000 align:middle line:10%
Tesla had a difficult journey.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.500 align:middle line:10%
Royal Raymond Rife's journey
was equally difficult

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.320 align:middle line:10%
and what he was doing with
his universal microscope

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.880 align:middle line:10%
and applying very
specific frequencies

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:41.990 align:middle line:10%
to healing the body.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.000 align:middle line:84%
How do frequencies
differ from, or how

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.380 align:middle line:84%
are they part of this
field you're talking about?

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Well,
Rife, again, was

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.800 align:middle line:84%
using-- his device was
an electrical plasma.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.670 align:middle line:84%
He had these globes
that had gases in them.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And then he was feeding
essentially a Tesla coil

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.120 align:middle line:90%
into the gases.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.150 align:middle line:90%
And they were glowing.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And then he pulsed them
at different frequencies.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And basically bathing the body
in this energy from the plasma.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.779 align:middle line:84%
And so he was using
Tesla technology.

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:23.675 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did he and Tesla
know each other in the day?

00:04:23.675 --> 00:04:24.692 align:middle line:90%
Do you know?

00:04:24.692 --> 00:04:25.650 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Not really.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They didn't really.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.100 align:middle line:84%
It's just he was
aware-- it just happen

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.180 align:middle line:84%
to be that technology
he was working through.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.570 align:middle line:84%
So when you're looking at
very specific frequencies,

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.190 align:middle line:84%
in terms of these little
Rife-style-- I know

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.500 align:middle line:84%
you can't say it's Rife--
but Rife-style frequency

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:46.440 align:middle line:84%
generators, for example, are
they calibrated in such a way

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.580 align:middle line:84%
that you would
consider that they're

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.250 align:middle line:84%
more or less safe to
use on the human body?

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.945 align:middle line:84%
Or is there some
missing component

00:04:52.945 --> 00:04:56.860 align:middle line:84%
that left when his
microscope was taken?

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.540 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: I'm
already jumping ahead.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.206 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:04:59.206 --> 00:05:00.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.860 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Well,
basically, there's

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.400 align:middle line:84%
something called a
direct pulse, which

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.350 align:middle line:90%
is very sharp pulse of energy.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And a lightning strike--
a lightning bolt

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.870 align:middle line:90%
generates a direct pulse.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.650 align:middle line:90%
And Tesla knew this.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And that direct pulse
contains all the frequencies,

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.740 align:middle line:90%
from DC all the way up.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're
bathing yourself

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.270 align:middle line:84%
in a Tesla kind of
device-- Rife got it wrong

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.690 align:middle line:84%
because he was focusing
on specific frequencies.

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.600 align:middle line:84%
If you feed a direct pulse
like little miniature lightning

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.130 align:middle line:84%
bolts to your body,
what that's doing

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.120 align:middle line:84%
is stimulating cellular
resonance at all levels.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And so the body's taking care
of itself and healing itself,

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.847 align:middle line:84%
and you don't need to get
into specific frequencies.

00:05:48.847 --> 00:05:50.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well that sounds
so much more efficient.

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: It is.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] And
so what can actually

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.390 align:middle line:84%
be corrected by using
that kind of direct pulse,

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.379 align:middle line:90%
as you call it?

00:05:58.379 --> 00:05:59.337 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Everything.

00:05:59.337 --> 00:06:00.191 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:06:00.191 --> 00:06:01.024 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All right.

00:06:01.024 --> 00:06:04.150 align:middle line:84%
So chronic diseases, internal
inflammation, heart disease,

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.520 align:middle line:84%
cancers-- can anything be
put back into resonance?

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: It's restoring
resonance to the body.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:17.050 align:middle line:84%
There are unnatural connections
in the body, unnatural chemical

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.570 align:middle line:90%
bonds and things like that.

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is that these
little lightning bolts-- what

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:26.920 align:middle line:84%
happens is they cause
the materials themselves

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.710 align:middle line:84%
to resonate like tuning forks at
their own natural frequencies.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is that the
unnatural bonds separate.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.880 align:middle line:90%
And this unnatural--

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The unnatural bonds
separate with the direct pulse.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.215 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Unnatural bonds
separate with these pulses.

00:06:41.215 --> 00:06:41.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:44.790 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: And what happens
is that then the cells go

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:48.500 align:middle line:90%
into resonance and eliminate.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And the cells that are
in great imbalance die.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.890 align:middle line:90%
They go into apoptosis and die.

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well I think
probably the foremost question

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.420 align:middle line:84%
on everyone's mind
is, do these things

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.490 align:middle line:90%
exist besides in your garage?

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.020 align:middle line:84%
And can people
actually have access

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.310 align:middle line:90%
to that kind of technology?

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.020 align:middle line:90%
What's it known as?

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.350 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: They
existed in the 1930s.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:15.790 align:middle line:84%
All hospitals in the world
were using Tesla devices back

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:17.090 align:middle line:90%
to the 1930s.

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And they were curing cancer and
healing all kinds of things.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:24.170 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is that
they came in and declared

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.220 align:middle line:84%
electronic medicine
to be illegal.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.130 align:middle line:90%
And they started using drugs.

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And the pharmaceutical
companies came in.

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
end of that story.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.660 align:middle line:90%
And now we have new things.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:38.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm not selling them.

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:40.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to put
them on the market.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.950 align:middle line:84%
I'll give all the
technology away,

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:47.970 align:middle line:84%
because I have no desire
whatsoever to make money on it.

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:50.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm not trying to sell anything.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it a
simple enough device

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:55.730 align:middle line:84%
that someone with a degree
in mechanical engineering

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:56.520 align:middle line:90%
could create it?

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.310 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Absolutely.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You don't
need-- you just

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:00.534 align:middle line:84%
need to have an interest and
a basic understanding of it?

00:08:00.534 --> 00:08:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Mhm.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.620 align:middle line:90%
Electrical engineering--

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Electrical
engineering, yes.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: I can't
reveal certain things

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:09.830 align:middle line:84%
because if I were,
there would be

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:14.510 align:middle line:84%
a run on certain devices in
all the stores and things.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And then what would
happen is that somebody

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.570 align:middle line:90%
would make them unavailable.

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:21.340 align:middle line:84%
So we have to figure
a way to make them

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:26.310 align:middle line:84%
so that people can
build them easily using

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:28.530 align:middle line:84%
standard parts,
more common parts.

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:32.614 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So have you
already figured this out?

00:08:32.614 --> 00:08:34.169 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: I have.

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:35.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, that's
a cheeky little smile.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.376 align:middle line:84%
Is it something
you're going to be

00:08:37.376 --> 00:08:39.549 align:middle line:90%
making available to the public?

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:40.919 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: I intend to.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:45.830 align:middle line:84%
It's a matter of--
we're working on-- I

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:47.422 align:middle line:90%
have so many things going on.

00:08:47.422 --> 00:08:48.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:49.754 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
get to some of that.

00:08:49.754 --> 00:08:51.960 align:middle line:90%
But that's so important.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:55.440 align:middle line:84%
Can you make them on a scale
that is relatively small so you

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.340 align:middle line:84%
could have them
in your own home,

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.490 align:middle line:84%
give yourself
these energy baths?

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:00.590 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Absolutely.

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:02.070 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:02.580 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.750 align:middle line:90%
Real easy to do.

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:07.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a gift
of gifts to the planet.

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:10.490 align:middle line:84%
Because we are in such
a quagmire regarding

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:13.925 align:middle line:84%
the HMOs and health
care reform, all of it.

00:09:13.925 --> 00:09:15.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't even like
to think of it.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.190 align:middle line:90%
It makes me nauseous.

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:20.020 align:middle line:84%
When in reality,
such simple things,

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:22.930 align:middle line:84%
like what you're talking
about, are theoretically--

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:25.380 align:middle line:84%
should be, can be
there at our disposal

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.130 align:middle line:84%
to take care of our own
selves and loved ones.

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:29.700 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Absolutely.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.020 align:middle line:90%
And they should be available.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:37.960 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that you can
make small handheld devices,

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:42.740 align:middle line:84%
little tiny handheld
devices, that you can--

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:43.810 align:middle line:90%
it'd be a little thing.

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And you move it around your
body, lymphatic system,

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:52.330 align:middle line:84%
treat your arteries
and your veins

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:56.590 align:middle line:84%
and your lymphatic
glands and your third eye

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:59.620 align:middle line:84%
and various parts of
your body with it.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:04.650 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very simple,
very easy to use.

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:06.230 align:middle line:90%
And we should all have one.

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And that should be
something that people

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:12.770 align:middle line:84%
can buy the parts at
Radio Shack or something

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:15.790 align:middle line:84%
like that-- you can't really
get them at Radio Shack--

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:19.010 align:middle line:84%
but something fairly
easy to build.

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:23.020 align:middle line:90%
And then we should all do this.

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I will
be waiting for that day,

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:27.740 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure all of you
will be waiting for that day

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.440 align:middle line:84%
when we can get our
hands on, whether it's

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:35.570 align:middle line:84%
the schematics or whatnot,
and the list of materials

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:40.800 align:middle line:84%
and do it ourselves until
somebody else does it for us.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:43.200 align:middle line:90%
That's so exciting.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:47.740 align:middle line:84%
In the interim, we started
out talking about our body

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:50.420 align:middle line:84%
as an electrical
vehicle, so to speak,

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:53.100 align:middle line:84%
the ultimate electrical
vehicle, and feeding

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.160 align:middle line:90%
the electrical vehicle.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.650 align:middle line:84%
So it sounds like
this is one way

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:57.570 align:middle line:90%
to feed the electrical vehicle.

00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:00.470 align:middle line:84%
But there are other ways, too,
that are very much oriented

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:02.430 align:middle line:84%
towards nature and the
electrical universe

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:03.640 align:middle line:90%
and the sun.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
that a little bit?

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:05.590 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Sure.

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:08.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The common things, how
they resonate with our being.

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:11.580 align:middle line:84%
You want to get that out
there badly, that technology.

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:15.300 align:middle line:84%
You get very emotional when
we talk about technologies

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.530 align:middle line:84%
that are being withheld
from the people.

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:19.347 align:middle line:84%
Your whole being--
I can-- well--

00:11:19.347 --> 00:11:20.180 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Oh yeah.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:21.346 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You get teared up.

00:11:21.346 --> 00:11:21.970 align:middle line:90%
It's very sad.

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:22.690 align:middle line:10%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:23.864 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's beyond sad.

00:11:23.864 --> 00:11:24.780 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of criminal.

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:25.990 align:middle line:90%
That-- yeah.

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:30.470 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: What's
been done to humanity

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:32.330 align:middle line:84%
to stop these things
from getting out.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:34.390 align:middle line:90%
It's all greed not need.

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:37.680 align:middle line:84%
It's all nothing-- you
know, it's all just greed.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.240 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And forcing
us onto pharmaceuticals,

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.230 align:middle line:84%
where one person I interviewed
a few years ago, a doctor,

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:45.660 align:middle line:90%
said she had quit.

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.670 align:middle line:84%
She said she had about
four or five reps

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:49.480 align:middle line:84%
come around her office
a day with baskets

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:52.740 align:middle line:84%
of cookies and sandwiches,
pumping their wares.

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And she said the idea
is really simple.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.490 align:middle line:84%
If you can find
something you can

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:59.100 align:middle line:84%
get a five-year-old
on medication for,

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.440 align:middle line:90%
you've got them for life.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.180 align:middle line:84%
Because then you have
contraindications,

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:06.040 align:middle line:84%
so then you have to have another
drug to-- you know how it goes.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And you stay on them your entire
life at a huge profit to them.

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:12.932 align:middle line:84%
And it's total loss of
vitality to the species.

00:12:12.932 --> 00:12:14.290 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:15.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:15.768 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:12:15.768 --> 00:12:16.880 align:middle line:90%
Completely.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:20.830 align:middle line:90%
And you know, it's very simple.

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:23.160 align:middle line:84%
One of the simplest
things you can do

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.650 align:middle line:90%
is walk barefoot on the ground.

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:28.800 align:middle line:90%


00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:38.320 align:middle line:84%
Walk barefoot on the ground,
because the sky above us

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.580 align:middle line:90%
is a positive charge.

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.540 align:middle line:90%
The Earth has a negative charge.

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And the electrons flow through
the kidney meridian one,

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:48.760 align:middle line:84%
the center, the ball
of your feet, up

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.790 align:middle line:84%
through your entire
body, filling you

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:54.120 align:middle line:84%
with negative ions
and electrons.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:59.100 align:middle line:84%
So walking daily outside
barefoot on the ground

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:03.580 align:middle line:84%
is one of the easiest,
least expensive things

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.790 align:middle line:90%
you can do for yourself.

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's something accessible
and available for anyone.

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:17.090 align:middle line:84%
But if you're living in a
skyscraper and you're inside,

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:18.930 align:middle line:84%
you're disconnected
to the earth.

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And of course wearing
rubber shoes and so forth

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:24.020 align:middle line:84%
and walking around
in those, you're

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:26.250 align:middle line:90%
disconnected from the Earth.

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And so our bodies--
you don't need

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.200 align:middle line:90%
to buy antioxidants or anything.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.770 align:middle line:90%
At least this will help.

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:39.170 align:middle line:84%
It won't solve everything,
but it will help.

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:43.100 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the easiest,
least expensive things

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:43.770 align:middle line:90%
you can do.

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:45.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What if you're
living in a skyscraper,

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:47.710 align:middle line:84%
and you're wearing
rubber-soled shoes

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:51.390 align:middle line:84%
and you're walking on
concrete and all of that?

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:54.285 align:middle line:84%
What is essentially happening
to you and your body

00:13:54.285 --> 00:13:56.540 align:middle line:84%
and your circuitry
under those conditions?

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.636 align:middle line:84%
And you're carrying
your wireless?

00:13:58.636 --> 00:14:00.510 align:middle line:84%
You have your wireless
technologies with you?

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: You're
disconnected from the Earth.

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:05.370 align:middle line:84%
You're disconnected from
the Earth's magnetic field.

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:08.050 align:middle line:84%
You're disconnected
from everything.

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And your body's becoming
more and more oxidized

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:15.190 align:middle line:90%
and imbalanced.

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to kill you, you
know, in one way or another.

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And the best thing
is that, no matter

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.350 align:middle line:84%
what skyscraper you're
in, somewhere nearby

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:28.891 align:middle line:84%
is a piece of dirt
somewhere, a park.

00:14:28.891 --> 00:14:29.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A park, right.

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:33.420 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Something where you
can go and walk barefoot, take

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:35.220 align:middle line:84%
your shoes off
and walk barefoot.

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What if you're
just lying down so

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.746 align:middle line:90%
you're parallel with the ground?

00:14:38.746 --> 00:14:40.370 align:middle line:84%
What if you're just
lying on your back?

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:41.310 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Oh yeah, yeah.

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:42.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It flows
into you the same way?

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:43.520 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Gets your
spine in the back.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:44.027 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:44.027 --> 00:14:44.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:47.710 align:middle line:84%
So lying under a tree in
the grass is one cure.

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:48.490 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And also, prop your feet up
while you're lying on the back,

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:56.240 align:middle line:84%
and put the soles of your feet
in contact with the ground,

00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:00.750 align:middle line:84%
because the qi meridian,
the number one point

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:04.580 align:middle line:84%
of the qi meridian is
called kidney number one.

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.860 align:middle line:84%
Look it up on
acupuncture charts.

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And you want that energy
to flow through your body.

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:16.262 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the least
expensive and most wonderful

00:15:16.262 --> 00:15:16.970 align:middle line:90%
thing you can do.

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:20.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are products
on the market where,

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:25.260 align:middle line:84%
if you're in a skyscraper,
you can connect

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.580 align:middle line:84%
through the electrical
system, the building.

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:30.120 align:middle line:84%
You can connect
through the ground,

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:33.110 align:middle line:84%
and you can connect
that up to your body.

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:34.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How does that work?

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:35.830 align:middle line:90%
Or what are they called?

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:39.034 align:middle line:90%


00:15:39.034 --> 00:15:39.950 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Grounding.

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:40.940 align:middle line:90%
It's called grounding.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.224 align:middle line:84%
Look up grounding
on the internet.

00:15:43.224 --> 00:15:44.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it called
grounding devices

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:46.410 align:middle line:84%
you would look for
in your search term?

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:46.840 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah, right.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about
those Earthing blankets?

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: That's grounding.

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:50.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
one of them, right?

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:52.614 align:middle line:84%
Because I hear good
things about those.

00:15:52.614 --> 00:15:53.596 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yes.

00:15:53.596 --> 00:15:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you can
artificially induce this

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:57.984 align:middle line:84%
by sleeping on one of those
Earthing blankets, for example.

00:15:57.984 --> 00:15:58.650 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yes.

00:15:58.650 --> 00:15:59.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:15:59.860 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:00.780 align:middle line:90%
That's one good way.

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:04.390 align:middle line:84%
What about food and the
electrical properties of food?

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people are doing
all the green, the green juices

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.340 align:middle line:90%
and fluids.

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:12.610 align:middle line:84%
How does chlorophyll,
green, minerals, and fluid

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:14.320 align:middle line:90%
work with our body?

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:17.460 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Well, the
thing is, raw foods contain

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:21.190 align:middle line:84%
negative hydrogen
ions, which is the most

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:24.610 align:middle line:84%
powerful primordial
antioxidant on Earth.

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And basically, when you cook
your food or if you juice food,

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:34.750 align:middle line:84%
and then you don't drink
the juices right away,

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:38.170 align:middle line:84%
you're not getting your
negative hydrogen ions.

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And that was a good
portion of my life

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:42.570 align:middle line:84%
was spent trying
to figure out why

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:47.050 align:middle line:84%
it is that fresh juices
invigorate you so much,

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:49.260 align:middle line:84%
and yet if you
wait half an hour,

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.780 align:middle line:84%
the juices no longer
invigorate you.

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:54.325 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not only that, I
notice if I wait more than 5,

00:16:54.325 --> 00:16:57.090 align:middle line:84%
10 minutes, 15 minutes
after juicing something,

00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:59.500 align:middle line:84%
it actually makes me kind
of sick to my stomach.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:00.900 align:middle line:90%
Something changes.

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:03.700 align:middle line:84%
But if I drink it right
out of the juicer,

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:05.290 align:middle line:90%
it flows through and feels fine.

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:06.160 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: That is correct.

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:11.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, what's going
on is that the juices

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:14.099 align:middle line:90%
contain negative hydrogen ions.

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:15.440 align:middle line:90%
And that's my research.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:18.109 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I developed
an antioxidant based on that.

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:20.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and we're
going to talk about that.

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:23.500 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: And basically
that is the difference

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.215 align:middle line:84%
between cooked food
and fresh, raw food.

00:17:26.215 --> 00:17:28.089 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So essentially,
after it sits there

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:31.579 align:middle line:84%
for 20 or 30 minutes, it
loses its raw food property.

00:17:31.579 --> 00:17:33.120 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Oh, well
it's still got--

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even if it's not
cooked, it loses that property.

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:36.686 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Well,
it's still got enzymes

00:17:36.686 --> 00:17:38.350 align:middle line:84%
and it's got
antioxidants, but it

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:40.540 align:middle line:84%
loses the most
powerful antioxidant

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:46.490 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, which is called
negative ionized hydrogen.

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:47.710 align:middle line:90%
And you lose that.

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's the one that
we all need and want.

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:53.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, and when we
were coming over in the car

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:56.590 align:middle line:84%
together, we were talking
a little bit about that.

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:59.260 align:middle line:84%
We were talking with our
wonderful driver, who

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.070 align:middle line:84%
has a little bit of
a lung condition.

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking
about the product

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:09.730 align:middle line:84%
that you ultimately found as
a result of this curiosity

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:12.160 align:middle line:84%
as to why these raw foods
weren't holding up and giving

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.826 align:middle line:84%
the health benefits after they'd
been sitting around 20 minutes.

00:18:14.826 --> 00:18:18.360 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's time to get
into the whole Mega H story

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:22.170 align:middle line:84%
and what happened in the story
of telomeres and all of that.

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:23.680 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Sure.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:31.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was-- all my
life, I've wondered

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.960 align:middle line:84%
about the difference
between fresh juices.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And somebody said
it was enzymes.

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:42.400 align:middle line:84%
But even after an hour, your
enzymes in your fresh juices

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.160 align:middle line:90%
are still there.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.030 align:middle line:90%
So it's not enzymes.

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And so in 1982, I
made a discovery

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.480 align:middle line:84%
and discovered that
it was something

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.900 align:middle line:84%
called negative
ionized hydrogen.

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.920 align:middle line:84%
That's hydrogen with
an extra electron.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:01.720 align:middle line:84%
It turns out hydrogen has a
tightly bound primary electron,

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:05.000 align:middle line:84%
but that it can take
off an extra electron,

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.500 align:middle line:84%
making it H minus, or
negative ionized hydrogen.

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that is
your most powerful-- that

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:15.800 align:middle line:84%
is the thing that carries the
electrons throughout our bodies

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:19.220 align:middle line:84%
and is the most
rejuvenating substance

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:21.060 align:middle line:90%
in the entire universe.

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:23.657 align:middle line:84%
And it's the
primordial antioxidant.

00:19:23.657 --> 00:19:25.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now if we were
living a normal, primal kind

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:28.876 align:middle line:84%
of life, how would we be
keeping this in supply

00:19:28.876 --> 00:19:30.000 align:middle line:90%
and balanced in our bodies?

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.810 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: By eating raw meat
and raw fruit and vegetables

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:39.740 align:middle line:84%
right off the vine and
grapes and raw leaves

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:41.120 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:44.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So anything that is
just immediately been removed

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:45.810 align:middle line:90%
from its--

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:46.702 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Is best.

00:19:46.702 --> 00:19:47.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --force.

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.063 align:middle line:90%
It's life force or-- yeah.

00:19:49.063 --> 00:19:49.896 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Is best.

00:19:49.896 --> 00:19:50.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:51.208 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Absolutely.

00:19:51.208 --> 00:19:52.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:53.540 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:55.980 align:middle line:84%
So in lieu of that, since
that's not what's happening,

00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:00.170 align:middle line:84%
you have to buy big, fancy food
masicaters to make your juice

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:02.379 align:middle line:84%
and not destroy them and
pulverize them to begin with

00:20:02.379 --> 00:20:04.045 align:middle line:84%
and cooking your food
and everyone else.

00:20:04.045 --> 00:20:04.945 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Right.

00:20:04.945 --> 00:20:06.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So as you
discovered this,

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:15.232 align:middle line:84%
how were you able to isolate
that particular element?

00:20:15.232 --> 00:20:22.360 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Well, I
was able to-- I always

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.180 align:middle line:84%
knew that there was
something going on.

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:29.210 align:middle line:84%
And so I got some very
sophisticated instruments.

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:32.460 align:middle line:84%
I have a nuclear magnetic
resonance spectrometer,

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.710 align:middle line:90%
a $1.5 million instrument.

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And I started analyzing foods
to figure out what it was.

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered this
negative ionized hydrogen ion

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:50.230 align:middle line:84%
and began working on that and
discovered that not only it

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:54.620 align:middle line:84%
increases the length
of telomeres, which

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:58.190 align:middle line:84%
it can at least quadruple the
lifespan of ourselves, which

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:00.530 align:middle line:84%
means theoretically
we could live at least

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:05.710 align:middle line:84%
300 years with no
problem whatsoever.

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:06.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 300 years.

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:09.802 align:middle line:84%
If this were in fresh supply
and plentiful within our bodies.

00:21:09.802 --> 00:21:10.760 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Absolutely.

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:14.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that would have
to mean you start from birth.

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:16.135 align:middle line:84%
And obviously you
don't start it at 70

00:21:16.135 --> 00:21:19.190 align:middle line:84%
and expect you're going
to live 300 years, right?

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:21.810 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Well,
theoretically, it

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:24.720 align:middle line:84%
could increase the
length of your telomeres,

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:27.580 align:middle line:84%
and you would become
physically immortal.

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:28.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Theoretically.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:29.950 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Theoretically.

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:32.890 align:middle line:84%
But then we have all the
toxins in our environment

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:33.980 align:middle line:90%
that we have to fight.

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And then you have all the
accumulated toxins in your body

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:38.770 align:middle line:90%
that you have to fight.

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And so we're not sure
where it's at right now.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And personally, I don't
care how long I live.

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.757 align:middle line:84%
I just want to be healthy
when I die. [LAUGHS]

00:21:48.757 --> 00:21:50.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well that's the thing.

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:51.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, then you look
at soul contracts

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.420 align:middle line:84%
and all that other
kind of thing.

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:55.636 align:middle line:84%
How long do you need to
be here at a given pop

00:21:55.636 --> 00:21:58.260 align:middle line:84%
to do what you need to do before
you might want to change even.

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:02.770 align:middle line:84%
So physical immortality
is a loaded subject.

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:03.520 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: It is.

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you realized
what was going on

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:08.660 align:middle line:84%
with this hydrogen,
and then what

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:12.400 align:middle line:84%
did you do by way
of isolating it

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.030 align:middle line:84%
so that it can be
artificially reintroduced

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:17.600 align:middle line:84%
into the system
via a supplement?

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.280 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Well
that was the problem.

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:22.150 align:middle line:84%
It's not very stable and
doesn't last very long.

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And so I found out
that it was actually

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.220 align:middle line:84%
present in water
from Hunza Land,

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.620 align:middle line:90%
from the glaciers in Hunza Land.

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's also present in fresh,
raw fruits and vegetables.

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.830 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't last very long.

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:44.090 align:middle line:84%
So I spent all this time
trying to figure out

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:46.280 align:middle line:90%
how to stabilize it.

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to
do so and capture it

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:54.720 align:middle line:84%
in a special form of
silica that I discovered.

00:22:54.720 --> 00:23:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's able to balance the
body and restore the cells.

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And so that's been the
main topic of my research

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:07.700 align:middle line:90%
for a very long time.

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.158 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
for about 20 years.

00:23:09.158 --> 00:23:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And at first, people
are like, yeah, right.

00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:12.031 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:23:12.031 --> 00:23:12.780 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Right.

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But these
papers have been peer

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:15.680 align:middle line:90%
reviewed long ago now.

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:18.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's no
real arguing that this

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:20.680 align:middle line:84%
is doing what you
say that it's doing.

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:21.020 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Right.

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:22.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
maybe you can tell us

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:24.190 align:middle line:84%
a little bit about telomeres,
because a lot of people

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:25.950 align:middle line:84%
don't even know-- they
don't know that is.

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:28.880 align:middle line:84%
They've never heard the term
before and their function.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.350 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah,
well, telomeres

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:36.750 align:middle line:84%
are little-- they're on the
ends of our chromosomes.

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And telomeres are
little-- they're

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:47.110 align:middle line:84%
made up of-- let's
see, what is it?

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:47.610 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:50.520 align:middle line:90%


00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.160 align:middle line:90%
Right now it's escaping me.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:59.580 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, they're little things
on the end of our cells, and--

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:01.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like little
hairs or projectiles?

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:05.440 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Little projectiles
on the ends of our cells.

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And they're actually
made up of DNA codes.

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:18.690 align:middle line:84%
And basically, when our
cells divide, they break off.

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And every time they break
off, it prevents the cells

00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:26.560 align:middle line:90%
from dividing that many times.

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And so over time,
generally a lifetime,

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:33.700 align:middle line:84%
your cells can only
divide about 50 times.

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And then they stop dividing
and goes into senescence,

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:38.380 align:middle line:90%
and we die.

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And basically, the
holy grail of medicine

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:45.900 align:middle line:84%
is looking for telomerase,
which is an enzyme that

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:48.810 align:middle line:84%
restores the link
of the telomeres

00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:51.820 align:middle line:84%
so that your cells
can divide forever.

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:56.000 align:middle line:90%
And so that's the holy grail.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And basically I've discovered
the holy grail of medicine.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
work on telomeres.

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:07.120 align:middle line:84%
They've discovered herbs
from China and various kinds

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:11.250 align:middle line:84%
of things that increase
the length of telomeres.

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:14.780 align:middle line:90%
But basically, I've done it.

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:18.630 align:middle line:90%
And we can restore that.

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And theoretically our cells
should be able to divide

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:23.120 align:middle line:90%
forever.

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:27.110 align:middle line:84%
But what it really means is
that when we hit 60 years old,

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:33.330 align:middle line:84%
we don't need to go into
cellular senescence and die.

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when
you go on, I mean

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:37.950 align:middle line:84%
if you're online doing a search,
it'll have telomerase in there.

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like, hey, you
can take it in a pill form.

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:41.810 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: No, no.

00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:42.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
it's sounding like.

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:43.180 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: It's not
available anywhere.

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah,
it seems like it.

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I'm
saying you go online,

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.250 align:middle line:90%
and that's what it seems like.

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain the
reality of that?

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:52.280 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Well,
there are devices

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:57.300 align:middle line:84%
that activate
telomerase in your body.

00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:04.240 align:middle line:84%
There are devices and nutrients
and herbs and things like that.

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
they're talking about.

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And so there's quite
a bit of research

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:11.090 align:middle line:84%
now showing that there
are few things that

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:13.390 align:middle line:84%
increase the length
of telomeres,

00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:16.580 align:middle line:84%
especially
mitochondrial telomeres.

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:21.170 align:middle line:84%
The DNA of our mitochondria
is different from the DNA

00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:22.830 align:middle line:90%
of our own body.

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:26.360 align:middle line:84%
The mitochondria are actually
little bacterial organisms

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:29.520 align:middle line:84%
that come from our mothers
that live in our bodies

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.280 align:middle line:90%
and provide us with energy.

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And they have nothing
to do with our DNA.

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:38.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they have their
own-- essentially not only

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:41.770 align:middle line:84%
just communities, colonies,
life force, their own agendas,

00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:43.257 align:middle line:84%
they have their
own consciousness.

00:26:43.257 --> 00:26:44.090 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Exactly.

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:46.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now you're saying they
have their own DNA, obviously.

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:47.128 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:26:47.128 --> 00:26:47.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to keep
the mitochondria happy.

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:53.550 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: The mitochondria,
we keep them happy

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:55.285 align:middle line:90%
and they keep us happy. [LAUGHS]

00:26:55.285 --> 00:26:57.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] We had
Compton Rom on recently,

00:26:57.550 --> 00:26:59.670 align:middle line:90%
who's a microbiologist.

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And his work is really
in reintroducing

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:05.850 align:middle line:84%
the friendly
microbes in the body.

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:07.530 align:middle line:84%
But more so what I
love about his work

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:11.880 align:middle line:84%
is he's saying you need to come
into harmony as a community

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:15.180 align:middle line:84%
and love these organisms,
because they run the show.

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:16.820 align:middle line:90%
They're not happy, you die.

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And so you might as well learn
to respect and honor them.

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.660 align:middle line:84%
Because they're the
ones who are in charge.

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:23.919 align:middle line:84%
So with that, we're going
to take a tiny little break,

00:27:23.919 --> 00:27:25.960 align:middle line:84%
come back, and talk a
little bit more about this.

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:26.793 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:27:26.793 --> 00:27:30.495 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:30.495 --> 00:27:31.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're back.

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And Jay is sitting off to the
side saying, more on telomeres,

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:37.050 align:middle line:84%
more on telomeres.
[LAUGHS] So we can--

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:38.300 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Telomere about it.

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:39.466 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Telomere about it.

00:27:39.466 --> 00:27:40.740 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGH]

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:43.120 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about it.

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:47.090 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now, so the Mega H
is in a-- and I've taken it.

00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:51.040 align:middle line:84%
I've known you off and on for
about 12 years, here and there.

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And I've taken
Mega H off and on.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.077 align:middle line:84%
And I remember one time we
were in a conference together,

00:27:56.077 --> 00:27:58.660 align:middle line:84%
and you and your wife Stephanie
were sitting across the aisle.

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And about 3 o'clock, I was
like this with the lecture.

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:03.870 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't stay awake, and
you handed me a bottle.

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And that was my first
experience of Mega H.

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And immediately my mind
started perking back up.

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:10.179 align:middle line:90%
My energy was fine.

00:28:10.179 --> 00:28:11.720 align:middle line:84%
I was good to go
the rest of the day.

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.620 align:middle line:84%
I didn't need
caffeine or anything.

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:19.000 align:middle line:84%
So what was it
doing to my brain?

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: What
it's doing is feeding

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:24.270 align:middle line:84%
negative ionized hydrogen
electrons to your brain,

00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:26.405 align:middle line:84%
neutralizing all
those free radicals

00:28:26.405 --> 00:28:28.990 align:middle line:90%
that were making you sleepy.

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And also hydrogen reacts
with oxygen in the body,

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:36.420 align:middle line:90%
releasing energy.

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And so your primary
source of energy

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:43.560 align:middle line:84%
in your body for your
mitochondria and for yourselves

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:45.850 align:middle line:90%
is coming from H minus ions.

00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:50.065 align:middle line:84%
And so I provided you all these
H minus ions in pill form.

00:28:50.065 --> 00:28:50.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:53.750 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it was, it made
my body and my brain happy.

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:57.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you're talking about
negatively ionized hydrogen,

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:01.730 align:middle line:84%
how is that different from just
the common term negative ions?

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Well, negative
ions can be oxygen

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:08.000 align:middle line:84%
or a water molecule with an
extra electron added to it.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.730 align:middle line:84%
The body can't use those
electrons for energy.

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:18.180 align:middle line:84%
What the body can use is those
electrons enter into your lungs

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:21.750 align:middle line:84%
and into your -- you
know, your throat.

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And it stimulates the
cilia, the little hairs,

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:27.797 align:middle line:90%
to cleanse better.

00:29:27.797 --> 00:29:30.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Clear out your lungs
and your bronchial tubes.

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:31.450 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah, clear
your lungs and so forth.

00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:31.991 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:29:31.991 --> 00:29:35.412 align:middle line:84%
Now recently, we were in
the Bosnian pyramid caves.

00:29:35.412 --> 00:29:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I
noticed down there when

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:39.880 align:middle line:84%
they had it measured was
that the further you went

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:43.470 align:middle line:84%
into the earth, instead of
having detrimental oxygen

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:47.610 align:middle line:84%
deprivation, was a 200
times boost to background

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:50.640 align:middle line:84%
atmospheric negative
ion levels, 200 times

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.749 align:middle line:84%
that level the
further in you went.

00:29:52.749 --> 00:29:54.290 align:middle line:84%
And it did-- when
you were breathing,

00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:57.590 align:middle line:84%
it was like-- you felt like
you were breathing something

00:29:57.590 --> 00:30:00.250 align:middle line:90%
fresh for the first time.

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And that was-- it's coupled
with pyramid technology there.

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:07.040 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not asking
you to explain it,

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:10.310 align:middle line:84%
but what might have
been going on there?

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:14.490 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Well,
you know, Earth

00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:18.350 align:middle line:84%
produces huge amounts
of negative ions

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:21.970 align:middle line:90%
anyway on its interior.

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:28.620 align:middle line:84%
But what I can say is that
pyramids built properly

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:30.994 align:middle line:90%
can increase that.

00:30:30.994 --> 00:30:33.160 align:middle line:84%
Since I haven't been there
and haven't measured it--

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
why I'm saying you

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.539 align:middle line:84%
can't comment on
that specifically.

00:30:35.539 --> 00:30:36.288 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Right.

00:30:36.288 --> 00:30:38.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Secondhand
information at this point.

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:38.870 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Right.

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:39.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:39.989 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:39.989 --> 00:30:43.350 align:middle line:84%
So again, we're going back
to in our last conversations,

00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:46.200 align:middle line:84%
the type of structures
we're living in, right?

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying a pyramidal
type of ratio or structure

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:53.710 align:middle line:84%
would not only create more
harmonious, greater resonance

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:56.980 align:middle line:84%
in the field around us,
but perhaps even increase

00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.599 align:middle line:84%
the level of negative
ions in the atmosphere?

00:30:59.599 --> 00:31:00.640 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: That's right.

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:02.090 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:03.710 align:middle line:90%
Just the space itself.

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:04.240 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And then, is there
such a thing as having

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.410 align:middle line:90%
too much negative ion?

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:11.050 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: No.

00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:11.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There's not?

00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:13.107 align:middle line:84%
Because some people
talk about, oh, you

00:31:13.107 --> 00:31:15.615 align:middle line:84%
can harm yourself with
too many negative ions.

00:31:15.615 --> 00:31:16.240 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: No.

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
saying that it's not.

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:17.420 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: It's impossible.

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:18.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's impossible.

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:19.770 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: It's
impossible, yeah,

00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:21.830 align:middle line:90%
to have too many negative ions.

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:25.110 align:middle line:84%
It's real easy to get
too many positive ions.

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:30.080 align:middle line:84%
Because they're just easily
available everywhere.

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But, OK,
so negative ions.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.906 align:middle line:84%
Now, have we kind of covered
the Mega H to the extent--

00:31:36.906 --> 00:31:38.530 align:middle line:84%
is there anything
else I haven't asked?

00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:40.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
papers and papers on it.

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:44.620 align:middle line:84%
But for our seventh grade
consumption on the subject,

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:47.290 align:middle line:84%
we've kind of covered what
it's able to do for the body.

00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And so, I would like to move
on some of the other things

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:52.720 align:middle line:90%
that you're working on.

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.930 align:middle line:84%
You alluded to something
in our last conversation.

00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you can explain
it just a little bit more.

00:31:58.210 --> 00:32:00.990 align:middle line:84%
I know you're ready not ready
to come out with it publicly

00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:03.800 align:middle line:90%
per se in its finished form.

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:07.700 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying that the
environments we live in,

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:11.680 align:middle line:84%
the space we live in in terms
of the geometry of the space,

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:14.390 align:middle line:84%
which can create a dissonance
in the energy field,

00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:18.600 align:middle line:84%
which is almost every
right angled space,

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:21.880 align:middle line:84%
is affecting our
field and our vitality

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:28.060 align:middle line:84%
and also all of the Wi-Fi and
various types of frequencies

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:31.900 align:middle line:90%
passing through our bodies 24/7.

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:33.940 align:middle line:84%
You said also in an
earlier conversation,

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:36.870 align:middle line:84%
if you were born
into this, it's not

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:39.080 align:middle line:84%
going to make you sick
because you somehow

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:41.709 align:middle line:84%
attune to it through the
pregnancy and the whole process

00:32:41.709 --> 00:32:42.750 align:middle line:90%
throughout your lifetime.

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:45.280 align:middle line:84%
It won't make you
visibly sick anyway.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:48.430 align:middle line:84%
As opposed to in Tesla's time,
where people were actually

00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:51.310 align:middle line:84%
becoming ill when electricity
was first introduced,

00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:55.060 align:middle line:84%
artificial electricity,
not organic, nature-based.

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:59.450 align:middle line:84%
So, laying out that, can
you talk a little bit

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:02.349 align:middle line:84%
about what you're
working on now?

00:33:02.349 --> 00:33:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Well,
I'm working on ways

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:07.390 align:middle line:84%
of correcting these energies
because these energy force

00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:13.510 align:middle line:84%
fields are actually killing us
and throwing us off balance.

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And the more Wi-Fi's that come
up and the more of these fields

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:19.480 align:middle line:84%
that come up, the
more destructive

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:21.730 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be
to our children.

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And the reason we
don't notice it--

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.680 align:middle line:84%
there was an old
Zen thing that said

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:34.780 align:middle line:84%
that if there was a really loud
noise before you were born,

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:39.250 align:middle line:84%
and you were born and
that loud noise continued

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:45.260 align:middle line:84%
your entire lifetime, and it was
there when you died, what would

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:47.200 align:middle line:90%
you call that noise?

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:50.970 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is silence.

00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:58.100 align:middle line:84%
Because if you were born into
it, and the noise wasn't there,

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:02.840 align:middle line:84%
and then halfway through your
life the silence turned on,

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:05.310 align:middle line:90%
it would greatly affect you, OK?

00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:07.170 align:middle line:84%
It would have a very
profound effect.

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And the same is true of
Wi-Fi and all these energies,

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:15.389 align:middle line:84%
is that if you're born-- if
it's there before you were born,

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:19.290 align:middle line:84%
and you live your life in it,
and it's continuing unabated

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:21.934 align:middle line:84%
until you die, you
don't notice it.

00:34:21.934 --> 00:34:23.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it still
having an impact.

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:24.620 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Oh, totally.

00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:25.786 align:middle line:90%
It's still having an impact.

00:34:25.786 --> 00:34:27.060 align:middle line:90%
So is silence.

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:30.389 align:middle line:90%
It's the sound of creation.

00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:33.340 align:middle line:84%
This noise is the
sound of creation.

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:35.280 align:middle line:90%
It's the ohm of the universe.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:39.570 align:middle line:84%
It's the great sound
of all creation.

00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And so that's going
on all the time.

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:47.330 align:middle line:90%


00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:48.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When
we're interjecting

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:52.719 align:middle line:84%
all these other signals,
including radio frequencies

00:34:52.719 --> 00:34:55.610 align:middle line:84%
and signals where we literally
have information and people's

00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:59.210 align:middle line:84%
voices passing through our auras
and our bodies and our heads

00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:02.630 align:middle line:84%
without even knowing it because
we can't discern the sounds.

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:03.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:06.060 align:middle line:84%
So that's really having a
deleterious effect on us.

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:07.850 align:middle line:90%
And you're looking at--

00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Ways
of correcting that.

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And I do have ways
of correcting it.

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm intending
on sharing them.

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to
make money on it.

00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:23.360 align:middle line:84%
I just want to help everyone,
humanity, and not only

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:28.160 align:middle line:84%
humanity, but every living
thing on this Earth, bees

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.490 align:middle line:90%
and animals and trees.

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:32.020 align:middle line:84%
They're all being
destroyed by Wi-Fi

00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:36.750 align:middle line:84%
and all these increased
use of equipment.

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:38.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the devices
you're working on

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:41.020 align:middle line:84%
are not necessarily localized
like the little things

00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:42.530 align:middle line:84%
you put on your
cell phone to stop

00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:45.615 align:middle line:90%
the effects into your brain.

00:35:45.615 --> 00:35:46.240 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: No.

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:49.870 align:middle line:84%
We could actually
put these devices

00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:54.920 align:middle line:84%
on every Wi-Fi transmitter
and every cell tower and all

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:57.030 align:middle line:84%
these things if
they would do it.

00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And it would actually generate
a coherent energy field

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:02.016 align:middle line:84%
that would actually
benefit all life.

00:36:02.016 --> 00:36:02.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: And that
can be done if we

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:06.751 align:middle line:84%
can get these people
to be willing to do it.

00:36:06.751 --> 00:36:08.250 align:middle line:84%
There are some
people out there that

00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:10.290 align:middle line:90%
don't want to benefit all life.

00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:12.027 align:middle line:84%
They actually want
to destroy it.

00:36:12.027 --> 00:36:12.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:13.600 align:middle line:90%
We are aware of that.

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:16.610 align:middle line:84%
Our audience is fairly
savvy and is aware of that.

00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:20.750 align:middle line:84%
Are there maybe certain
countries or principalities

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:23.570 align:middle line:84%
that might be open to
trying something new?

00:36:23.570 --> 00:36:24.820 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: I'm ready to talk.

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:25.694 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:36:25.694 --> 00:36:26.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:29.920 align:middle line:84%
Have you actually started
putting any feelers out

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:32.530 align:middle line:84%
globally as to this
technology to see

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:35.100 align:middle line:84%
if you can create an alliance
with an independent government

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:37.488 align:middle line:90%
or sovereign state of some kind?

00:36:37.488 --> 00:36:38.396 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Not yet.

00:36:38.396 --> 00:36:39.347 align:middle line:90%
But I've only been--

00:36:39.347 --> 00:36:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: My wheels are turning.

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:43.054 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: I've only been
doing this for six months now,

00:36:43.054 --> 00:36:45.400 align:middle line:90%
so this is brand new stuff.

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how long
in the development phase

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:50.180 align:middle line:84%
before-- roughly
somewhere in 2013

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:53.010 align:middle line:84%
you think you'll
have it refined?

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:56.070 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: I'm ready
right now, actually.

00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:58.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've already
got it figured out.

00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:01.940 align:middle line:84%
It's refined to the
point where all I need is

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:05.520 align:middle line:90%
some principality, yeah, or a--

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:07.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Some
sovereign government.

00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:09.730 align:middle line:84%
If any of you know
people who are

00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:12.920 align:middle line:84%
the heads of sovereign
governments or a principality,

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:14.400 align:middle line:90%
please give us the names.

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:14.850 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:16.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But yeah, there
are a few places out there.

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:18.360 align:middle line:84%
You might be able to
get that thing rolling

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.210 align:middle line:90%
sooner than later.

00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:21.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm very, very
excited to see what

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:22.970 align:middle line:90%
happens with that technology.

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:25.220 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: And we could do
a little underground thing

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:27.160 align:middle line:84%
where people take
this technology,

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:30.430 align:middle line:84%
and they make a
paint, and they go out

00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:33.650 align:middle line:84%
and paint cell tow--
Wi-Fi's and cell towers

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:35.950 align:middle line:90%
everywhere, all over the world.

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly the world
changes and everyone

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:41.470 align:middle line:90%
is benefiting from it.

00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:42.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, sneaky.

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:45.480 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying it can
be embedded in paint.

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Absolutely
embedded in paint.

00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:49.380 align:middle line:90%
An underground--

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:52.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not going to
be available at Home Depot.

00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:54.352 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Well,
I wish it would.

00:37:54.352 --> 00:37:57.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] OK, so
that that's a big hint, hint.

00:37:57.340 --> 00:38:00.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we heard about someone
recently who's-- I think

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:02.450 align:middle line:84%
they're pretty close
in their technology.

00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:05.310 align:middle line:84%
You're able to paint a
substance on a surface

00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:08.712 align:middle line:84%
and turn your side of your
house into a solar panel, right?

00:38:08.712 --> 00:38:09.670 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Absolutely.

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So why
couldn't you do this?

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:11.915 align:middle line:90%
It's all frequencies.

00:38:11.915 --> 00:38:12.220 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:13.013 align:middle line:90%
Yup.

00:38:13.013 --> 00:38:13.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, man.

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:14.660 align:middle line:90%
That is exciting.

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:15.910 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:17.130 align:middle line:90%
That is to be continued.

00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:17.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:19.750 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about that when
that's up and running.

00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile,
we'll enlist people

00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:26.280 align:middle line:84%
to see if you know
anyone that can help out.

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:28.330 align:middle line:84%
Now I'd like to talk
about some technology that

00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:30.200 align:middle line:84%
is starting to cross
to consciousness.

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:31.850 align:middle line:84%
We interviewed Sterling
Allan recently,

00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:34.860 align:middle line:84%
and he was telling us about
some of the technologies that

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:37.570 align:middle line:84%
are about to make
their way to market.

00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:39.290 align:middle line:90%
And they are demonstrable.

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is
the Keshe technology,

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:43.076 align:middle line:90%
which was mind-blowing.

00:38:43.076 --> 00:38:44.450 align:middle line:84%
He only told us
a sentence on it.

00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:45.741 align:middle line:90%
He said, I can't talk about it.

00:38:45.741 --> 00:38:48.614 align:middle line:84%
You, however, have
read the books.

00:38:48.614 --> 00:38:49.280 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yes.

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:52.647 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which most of us
would not be able to understand.

00:38:52.647 --> 00:38:53.938 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: You're not kidding.

00:38:53.938 --> 00:38:54.596 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGH]

00:38:54.596 --> 00:38:56.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've read
the technologies.

00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:59.250 align:middle line:84%
Please inform us in
lay people's terms.

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:01.100 align:middle line:84%
What are we looking
at here in terms

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:04.500 align:middle line:84%
of the profundity, the
world-altering profundity

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:05.999 align:middle line:90%
of this technology?

00:39:05.999 --> 00:39:07.040 align:middle line:90%
Keshe has it figured out.

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:09.710 align:middle line:90%


00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:11.410 align:middle line:90%
"Kesh-ee," or Keshe--

00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:12.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Keshe.

00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:15.400 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Keshe
has it figured out.

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:19.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if he's
some supernatural

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:20.559 align:middle line:90%
being from another universe--

00:39:20.559 --> 00:39:21.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Possibly.

00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:24.230 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: --or if supernatural
beings from other universes

00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:27.700 align:middle line:84%
are communicating
with him, but he's on.

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:29.360 align:middle line:90%
He's right on.

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:33.110 align:middle line:84%
His books, the way he's
got it figured out,

00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:35.980 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing
better, in my opinion.

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
I've said you're one

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:38.896 align:middle line:84%
of the most brilliant
people alive

00:39:38.896 --> 00:39:41.010 align:middle line:84%
that I've at least
been alerted to.

00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:44.490 align:middle line:84%
Would you say he's one of the
most brilliant people you've

00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:45.990 align:middle line:90%
ever been alerted to?

00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:48.190 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGH]

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:49.620 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Well, he is.

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:50.370 align:middle line:90%
He's brilliant.

00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:52.220 align:middle line:84%
But he doesn't
have my knowledge.

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:53.825 align:middle line:90%
And I don't have his.

00:39:53.825 --> 00:39:55.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
you're different.

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.050 align:middle line:90%
You're both brilliant.

00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:56.490 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:39:56.490 --> 00:39:57.031 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:39:57.031 --> 00:39:58.020 align:middle line:90%
So, all right.

00:39:58.020 --> 00:39:59.350 align:middle line:90%
What is the technology?

00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:01.740 align:middle line:84%
What are we looking at
when this is introduced

00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:04.240 align:middle line:84%
to the planet in
its full spectrum?

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:07.120 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to explain
how it works, but what is it?

00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.620 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: It's, again,
plasma technology.

00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:12.590 align:middle line:84%
The whole universe is a
plasma, all atoms are plasmas.

00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And neutrons, electrons,
and protons are plasmas.

00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:19.510 align:middle line:84%
They're made up of matter,
anti-matter, and dark matter

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:24.280 align:middle line:84%
and-- in different
proportions, different sizes.

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And then we have electromagnetic
waves and scalar waves.

00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:34.510 align:middle line:84%
We have standing waves and
travelling waves and all

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:35.220 align:middle line:90%
of these things.

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And we figure out how to
use these waves beneficially

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.980 align:middle line:90%
for humanity.

00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:43.290 align:middle line:90%
And it's all there.

00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, most
engineers, because of the way

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:51.600 align:middle line:84%
they've been educated
in school, don't even

00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:54.380 align:middle line:84%
begin to understand it,
nor are they interested,

00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:56.370 align:middle line:90%
nor do they care.

00:40:56.370 --> 00:41:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And so this has to be
kind of implemented

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:05.460 align:middle line:90%
on a ground root level.

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not from
academia down,

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:09.237 align:middle line:84%
not from the corporate
world down, yeah.

00:41:09.237 --> 00:41:10.070 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Exactly.

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:12.690 align:middle line:90%


00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:14.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's it bring us?

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:17.760 align:middle line:84%
What is the product
of this technology?

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Products
of this technology

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:22.850 align:middle line:90%
is free energy for all.

00:41:22.850 --> 00:41:28.870 align:middle line:84%
You're not gonna have to
be an energy slave to live.

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to be able
to understand technology

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:36.040 align:middle line:84%
and understand energy and
devote your life to art.

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:37.074 align:middle line:90%
Time is art.

00:41:37.074 --> 00:41:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know,
and I've heard

00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:41.200 align:middle line:84%
this said again and again by
really brilliant people who

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:43.690 align:middle line:84%
understand energy and are
concerned with the free energy

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:47.220 align:middle line:90%
movement, is that time is art.

00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And our life is our
tapestry, and that once

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:52.890 align:middle line:84%
we're no longer hooked
into these enslaving

00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:56.960 align:middle line:84%
systems of energy control,
monetary control, and so forth,

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:59.510 align:middle line:84%
we have the ability to
create and express ourselves.

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And this comes up
again and again.

00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:04.700 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Well,
my wife Stephanie

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:13.960 align:middle line:84%
is a Mayan calendar
student expert.

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And Jose Arguelles,
who is her teacher,

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:21.030 align:middle line:84%
he originated the
term "time is art."

00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And time is art because
right now, we're

00:42:26.830 --> 00:42:32.930 align:middle line:84%
in what's called
the 1260, which is

00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:37.960 align:middle line:84%
the standard calendar
developed by the Vatican.

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:41.150 align:middle line:90%
And time is money, OK?

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And what's going to
happen is that we're

00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:46.970 align:middle line:84%
going to come into a
world where times is art.

00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:49.740 align:middle line:84%
Because we all shouldn't
have to be energy slaves.

00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:55.870 align:middle line:84%
We shouldn't have to be
working just to make ends meet.

00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:58.310 align:middle line:84%
Because the universe
is abundant,

00:42:58.310 --> 00:43:00.430 align:middle line:90%
freely abundant for all.

00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:03.985 align:middle line:84%
And there should be
plenty of food and water

00:43:03.985 --> 00:43:06.540 align:middle line:84%
and clean water and
energy for all of us.

00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:09.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't care where
we are in the world.

00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:14.680 align:middle line:10%
And poor children who are
dying of cholera and all

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:18.580 align:middle line:10%
these other things
should be able to have

00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:22.670 align:middle line:10%
healthy water and fresh food
and function in the world

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:25.570 align:middle line:10%
and make time is art
instead of spending

00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:27.650 align:middle line:10%
their entire day trying to--

00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:28.400 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Survive.

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.960 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: --survive, yeah.

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:32.900 align:middle line:90%
And so that's what's needed.

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:35.260 align:middle line:84%
But there are
elements in the world

00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:36.950 align:middle line:84%
today that all
they want to do is

00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:38.640 align:middle line:90%
they want these people to die.

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:40.837 align:middle line:84%
They're considered
to be useless eaters.

00:43:40.837 --> 00:43:41.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:43.933 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I know about this.

00:43:43.933 --> 00:43:44.620 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:46.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, and you're doing
everything you can.

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:49.790 align:middle line:84%
Keshe is doing
everything he can.

00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And the other part of
his technology, just

00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:54.550 align:middle line:84%
the little bits,
what Sterling said,

00:43:54.550 --> 00:44:00.250 align:middle line:84%
is essentially you can
materialize physical substance

00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:01.262 align:middle line:90%
from the ethers.

00:44:01.262 --> 00:44:02.220 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Absolutely.

00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:03.460 align:middle line:90%
Water, food, vitamins.

00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
the stuff of sci-fi.

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:07.820 align:middle line:84%
This is the stuff
we see in movies

00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:09.650 align:middle line:84%
about very advanced
cultures who've

00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:11.222 align:middle line:90%
already learned this technology.

00:44:11.222 --> 00:44:12.430 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're saying
it's really that close now.

00:44:15.010 --> 00:44:15.800 align:middle line:90%
He's saying.

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:18.451 align:middle line:84%
And from what you've read, not
everyone will read his books.

00:44:18.451 --> 00:44:20.200 align:middle line:84%
Plus they're too
expensive for most of us.

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:22.212 align:middle line:84%
What, $180 a book,
I think you told me.

00:44:22.212 --> 00:44:22.920 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:27.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, from what you
can see, this is right here?

00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:28.730 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: It's right here.

00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And you know, combined
with my technology

00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:35.270 align:middle line:84%
and there are a lot of other
really brilliant people

00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:35.770 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:44:35.770 --> 00:44:37.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, amazing
technologies coming out.

00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:38.965 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah,
amazing technologies.

00:44:38.965 --> 00:44:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And when we put these together,
we can change the entire world.

00:44:44.050 --> 00:44:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And there are forces that
just don't want us to be free.

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:52.346 align:middle line:84%
They want us to-- they want
to control and destroy and--

00:44:52.346 --> 00:44:53.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we're
going to persevere.

00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:54.320 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: We are.

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:57.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're all are going
to do what our part is together

00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:02.860 align:middle line:84%
to see that this information
becomes not just commonplace,

00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:05.770 align:middle line:84%
but is truly embraced by
the people of the planet.

00:45:05.770 --> 00:45:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
people watching this

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:09.441 align:middle line:84%
are part of the way-showers
and the leading edge.

00:45:09.441 --> 00:45:11.340 align:middle line:84%
That's why they're
watching this right now.

00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to
exponentially grow.

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:15.950 align:middle line:84%
Because the frequencies
of this planet

00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:18.000 align:middle line:84%
are changing so
dramatically and rapidly.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk to you
about that, about just some

00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:23.530 align:middle line:84%
of the solar activity
and consciousness

00:45:23.530 --> 00:45:26.840 align:middle line:84%
and cellular health
that's going on.

00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:29.090 align:middle line:84%
But first I want to
make one little comment.

00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:31.920 align:middle line:84%
I did an interview
with Jose Arguelles.

00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:34.660 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking
about the notion of time

00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:36.600 align:middle line:90%
and being a slave to time.

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And he told me, and
this was just before he

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:42.380 align:middle line:84%
died, that in his opinion,
the Gregorian calendar was

00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:46.440 align:middle line:84%
introduced by those very
entities you're talking

00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:49.110 align:middle line:84%
about that do not wish
to see life flourish

00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:52.510 align:middle line:84%
into a work of art, that it
was introduced to put us out

00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:54.180 align:middle line:84%
of sync with all
natural rhythms,

00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:58.370 align:middle line:84%
the Gregorian calendar, and
that the Mayan calendar, as one,

00:45:58.370 --> 00:46:00.970 align:middle line:84%
is just simply a reflection
of something cyclical that's

00:46:00.970 --> 00:46:01.640 align:middle line:90%
more in harmony.

00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:03.056 align:middle line:84%
Not to say that
that's way we have

00:46:03.056 --> 00:46:06.590 align:middle line:84%
to-- what we have to adopt
as our personal calendar.

00:46:06.590 --> 00:46:09.270 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, he said
that was very intentional.

00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:12.090 align:middle line:84%
Take people off of
natural rhythms,

00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:15.710 align:middle line:84%
and you've taken them away from
their own internal harmonic

00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:17.705 align:middle line:90%
and resonance.

00:46:17.705 --> 00:46:18.684 align:middle line:90%
Is that?

00:46:18.684 --> 00:46:19.850 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: That is correct.

00:46:19.850 --> 00:46:20.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:23.270 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly what's going on.

00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And we need to acknowledge that
and acknowledge his greatness

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:31.310 align:middle line:90%
and what he brought forward.

00:46:31.310 --> 00:46:34.610 align:middle line:90%
And things are changing.

00:46:34.610 --> 00:46:35.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, they are.

00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:39.722 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: And so I think
it won't be very long now.

00:46:39.722 --> 00:46:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I don't
think so, either.

00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:43.070 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in the
conversation with Sterling,

00:46:43.070 --> 00:46:46.140 align:middle line:84%
the hopeful part of it was--
I remember a quote watching

00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:49.990 align:middle line:90%
a documentary I think in 2001.

00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:53.450 align:middle line:84%
I think it was Brian O'Leary,
who has since passed on.

00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:55.050 align:middle line:90%
And it was about free energy.

00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And Tom Bearden
was featured in it.

00:46:56.750 --> 00:46:59.170 align:middle line:84%
I just remember this one
comment where he said,

00:46:59.170 --> 00:47:01.490 align:middle line:84%
the time is
approaching-- because we

00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:04.191 align:middle line:84%
know what happens to the
scientists, the really

00:47:04.191 --> 00:47:05.190 align:middle line:90%
leading-edge scientists.

00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:07.190 align:middle line:90%
Oftentimes they're offed.

00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:10.740 align:middle line:84%
They disappear, they're
suicided, any number of things

00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:12.390 align:middle line:90%
to stop the technology.

00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And he said we're approaching
a time where they just

00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:17.210 align:middle line:90%
can't kill them all.

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And there are so many inventors
and technologies, even patents.

00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And the thing about the Keshe
technology, to address this,

00:47:26.570 --> 00:47:28.330 align:middle line:90%
it was so wise.

00:47:28.330 --> 00:47:31.130 align:middle line:84%
He has apparently
given that technology

00:47:31.130 --> 00:47:34.500 align:middle line:84%
to many other
scientists in Iran.

00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:36.000 align:middle line:90%
He's Iranian.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.322 align:middle line:84%
And he's given it to
other Iranian physicists.

00:47:39.322 --> 00:47:40.780 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: And
other governments--

00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:41.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And other governments

00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: --all
over the world,

00:47:42.110 --> 00:47:43.750 align:middle line:90%
who are not acknowledging it.

00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:47.450 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't want it to
be known that they're already

00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:48.900 align:middle line:90%
using the technology.

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:51.530 align:middle line:84%
He freely gives it
to any government.

00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And he doesn't restrict them
on what they can do with it.

00:47:55.450 --> 00:47:57.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
can, as a government,

00:47:57.660 --> 00:48:00.610 align:middle line:84%
if you're in a
drought-ridden region,

00:48:00.610 --> 00:48:03.260 align:middle line:84%
you could theoretically
create all the water

00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:05.060 align:middle line:90%
you need to grow your crops.

00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:08.290 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Create
water out of thin air.

00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:11.590 align:middle line:90%
You can feed the entire world.

00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:16.150 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing that can't
be created out of light.

00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:16.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:18.700 align:middle line:90%
Explain that just a little bit.

00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: OK, well.

00:48:19.650 --> 00:48:21.940 align:middle line:90%
It's condensed light.

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:26.230 align:middle line:84%
Everything is condensed light,
our bodies, food, vitamins.

00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:28.390 align:middle line:90%
Everything is condensed light.

00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:31.120 align:middle line:84%
And he's figured out
how to condense light

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:35.800 align:middle line:84%
and how to create food
and water so that we

00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:39.870 align:middle line:90%
have full access to all of it.

00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:42.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this--
this is something--

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:47.460 align:middle line:84%
what this is bringing to mind
is-- I was doing a little quiz.

00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was on some
esoteric materials.

00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And it had to do with the
subject of electricity.

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:53.749 align:middle line:84%
And I said, say,
Patrick, I'm going

00:48:53.749 --> 00:48:55.040 align:middle line:90%
to be seeing you in a few days.

00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And I called you up
and said, can you

00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:59.510 align:middle line:84%
tell me in one simple
sentence, what is electricity?

00:48:59.510 --> 00:49:02.820 align:middle line:84%
Because that's something
that obviously is not well

00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:05.620 align:middle line:84%
understood in the
academic circles just yet.

00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:08.060 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise we wouldn't be
living in this crude way.

00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And you said, if I
can remember exactly,

00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:15.780 align:middle line:84%
you said, electricity is the
flow of electrons from a higher

00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:19.270 align:middle line:90%
potential to a lower potential.

00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:20.320 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, that
has to interface

00:49:22.930 --> 00:49:25.740 align:middle line:84%
with the subject of light,
which has to interface

00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:30.710 align:middle line:84%
with the subject of a
multi-dimensional universe,

00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:31.210 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:32.250 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Yes.

00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:35.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're talking about
what is condensed as the light

00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:37.970 align:middle line:84%
here, maybe information
systems that

00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:40.380 align:middle line:84%
are being derived from
another dimensional field

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:45.594 align:middle line:84%
even and somehow
directed, or how does--?

00:49:45.594 --> 00:49:53.040 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Well, the thing is
is everything is simplicity.

00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:56.320 align:middle line:84%
If it's too complicated,
it's not true.

00:49:56.320 --> 00:50:00.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can get into higher
mathematical functions and all

00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:02.150 align:middle line:84%
these things, but
when it gets down

00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:10.450 align:middle line:84%
to the structure of the universe
and the way everything is

00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:12.420 align:middle line:90%
is simplicity itself.

00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:15.880 align:middle line:84%
Because if you can't boil
it down into something

00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:19.390 align:middle line:84%
where you can simply explain
it, then it's not true.

00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:21.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:22.250 align:middle line:90%
Well said.

00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:25.130 align:middle line:84%
OK, so another thing I
think Keshe was saying

00:50:25.130 --> 00:50:27.250 align:middle line:84%
is that it's
possible we will all

00:50:27.250 --> 00:50:31.380 align:middle line:84%
be operating our own
little anti-gravity devices

00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:34.050 align:middle line:90%
as our transport, right?

00:50:34.050 --> 00:50:37.550 align:middle line:84%
I read about that
decades ago, that that

00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:39.230 align:middle line:90%
should've been the case by now.

00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:41.231 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking-- what
are you seeing down

00:50:41.231 --> 00:50:47.599 align:middle line:84%
the road through your
lens as to our future--

00:50:47.599 --> 00:50:48.640 align:middle line:90%
just that, our transport?

00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:50.190 align:middle line:84%
What kind of future
transport do we

00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:53.300 align:middle line:84%
have waiting for
us as individuals?

00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:54.875 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Anti-grav cars.

00:50:54.875 --> 00:50:56.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just like-- yeah.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.166 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Floating around.

00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:02.235 align:middle line:90%
They won't bang into each other.

[BOTH LAUGH]

00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:06.990 align:middle line:84%
We'll be able to
transport ourselves

00:51:06.990 --> 00:51:09.086 align:middle line:90%
anywhere almost instantaneously.

00:51:09.086 --> 00:51:11.900 align:middle line:90%


00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:14.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Will they
programed by our thoughts?

00:51:14.170 --> 00:51:16.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do they work with
consciousness at that point?

00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:19.710 align:middle line:84%
Or do you still have to
put in a vector point?

00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:20.900 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: I'm not sure.

00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:24.280 align:middle line:84%
Pretty much I think it's
going to be a thought thing.

00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:27.090 align:middle line:90%
But not sure yet.

00:51:27.090 --> 00:51:29.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then once
they're using anti-gravity

00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:32.820 align:middle line:84%
for the purposes of
betterment of life

00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:34.320 align:middle line:84%
on the planet for
the people instead

00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:36.560 align:middle line:84%
of sequestered
black technologies,

00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:38.441 align:middle line:84%
then we're looking
at, like you say,

00:51:38.441 --> 00:51:40.440 align:middle line:84%
they won't bump into each
other, because they'll

00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:44.332 align:middle line:84%
have the whole understanding
of affinity and repulsion.

00:51:44.332 --> 00:51:46.290 align:middle line:84%
Nothing will ever have
to bump into each other.

00:51:46.290 --> 00:51:50.540 align:middle line:84%
We won't be bumping into
each other metaphorically,

00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:53.050 align:middle line:84%
hopefully on many
levels by then.

00:51:53.050 --> 00:51:54.216 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:54.216 --> 00:51:56.520 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGH]

00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:58.860 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about our
future power sources.

00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:00.480 align:middle line:84%
As Sterling was
saying, there are

00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:02.710 align:middle line:84%
many that are right
on the horizon,

00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:04.440 align:middle line:90%
cold fusion is already there.

00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:06.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just
waiting to kind of drop

00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:10.910 align:middle line:84%
into the marketplace, Keshe's
technology, motor generators.

00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:14.400 align:middle line:84%
What do you see as some
of the kind of top runners

00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:17.150 align:middle line:90%
yourself for this?

00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:18.590 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Wow.

00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:21.390 align:middle line:90%
I think Keshe is right on edge.

00:52:21.390 --> 00:52:27.310 align:middle line:84%
Keshe said that in December
he's going to deliver 10,000

00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:33.100 align:middle line:84%
5,000-watt plasma generators
to customers who have ordered

00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:33.750 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that's
just right on the edge.

00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:41.770 align:middle line:84%
If that's true,
then it's happening.

00:52:41.770 --> 00:52:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And I mean that said, there
are multiple other people who

00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:48.650 align:middle line:84%
are working on these
things, who have

00:52:48.650 --> 00:52:51.000 align:middle line:84%
multiple other
technologies, everything

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:56.480 align:middle line:84%
from magnetic motors
to electrostatic motors

00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:59.262 align:middle line:90%
and all kinds of--

00:52:59.262 --> 00:53:00.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Water motors.

00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>>FLANAGAN: Water motors
and things like that.

00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:07.030 align:middle line:84%
So that said, I think we're
right on the edge of all of it.

00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:10.960 align:middle line:90%
It's breaking loose right now.

00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:14.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So after
everything you've

00:53:14.770 --> 00:53:17.800 align:middle line:84%
been through in your lifetime
and everything going further

00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:22.960 align:middle line:84%
back into another lifetime that
your being has been through,

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:25.680 align:middle line:84%
do you feel now that we're,
like you just said, we really,

00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:27.860 align:middle line:84%
truly are on the
cusp of breaking free

00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:30.322 align:middle line:84%
of these more tyrannical
types of systems?

00:53:30.322 --> 00:53:31.780 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel we're
going to make it,

00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:34.530 align:middle line:84%
we're going to hop
across that chasm?

00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:35.400 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: I do.

00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:38.439 align:middle line:84%
I think we're going
to make it for sure.

00:53:38.439 --> 00:53:40.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I assume
you have more things

00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:43.290 align:middle line:84%
up your sleeve besides just
this one technology coming out

00:53:43.290 --> 00:53:44.345 align:middle line:90%
in six months?

00:53:44.345 --> 00:53:45.970 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm not going to
press you on that.

00:53:45.970 --> 00:53:48.370 align:middle line:84%
How about if we do
a third show later

00:53:48.370 --> 00:53:51.000 align:middle line:84%
on when you start getting a
little closer to some of those

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.160 align:middle line:84%
and when we start seeing
the first free energy

00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:55.830 align:middle line:90%
devices popping through?

00:53:55.830 --> 00:53:56.555 align:middle line:90%
How's that sound?

00:53:56.555 --> 00:53:57.180 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: OK.

00:53:57.180 --> 00:53:57.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:53:57.740 --> 00:54:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And then I also wanted
to ask you-- going back

00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:04.930 align:middle line:84%
in your own
reflections, what do you

00:54:04.930 --> 00:54:08.709 align:middle line:84%
think Tesla's
greatest legacy was?

00:54:08.709 --> 00:54:10.250 align:middle line:84%
Of all that he
brought to the planet,

00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:13.790 align:middle line:90%
what was his greatest legacy?

00:54:13.790 --> 00:54:15.980 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Powering the world.

00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:22.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if it wasn't for Tesla,
we'd still be in the Stone Age.

00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:26.170 align:middle line:84%
He made it possible to have
power all over the world.

00:54:26.170 --> 00:54:29.720 align:middle line:84%
It's just that there are
greedy corporations that

00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:31.810 align:middle line:84%
are charging an arm
and a leg for it

00:54:31.810 --> 00:54:34.010 align:middle line:90%
and making us energy slaves.

00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we don't
like those corporations.

00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:36.679 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:54:36.679 --> 00:54:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And we only have a
minute or so left.

00:54:38.570 --> 00:54:40.790 align:middle line:90%
And what about your own legacy?

00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:44.284 align:middle line:84%
What do you feel is now
and will be-- of course,

00:54:44.284 --> 00:54:46.450 align:middle line:84%
you don't know because
you're still inventing things

00:54:46.450 --> 00:54:47.533 align:middle line:90%
and have a long way to go.

00:54:47.533 --> 00:54:50.600 align:middle line:84%
But at this point, what
is your greatest legacy?

00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:51.384 align:middle line:90%
>>FLANAGAN: Love.

>>REGINA: You know what?

00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:55.460 align:middle line:90%
I have to say this, Patrick.

00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:57.390 align:middle line:84%
Because when it
comes down to it,

00:54:57.390 --> 00:54:58.940 align:middle line:84%
that's the fabric
of the universe.

00:54:58.940 --> 00:55:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And I had to say, I think
that is a very true answer.

00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:04.230 align:middle line:90%
I watch you with people.

00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:06.770 align:middle line:84%
And one thing you do
is you treat people

00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:10.660 align:middle line:84%
with so much love
and so much respect.

00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:14.910 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that is your legacy
above and beyond anything else.

00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Because I mean really, doesn't
that power the whole enchilada?
