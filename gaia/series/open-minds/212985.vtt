Thank you, Regina.

>> REGINA: What's so nice is
you don't have to go to a store

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.050 align:middle line:90%
or buy anything.

are right here.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.163 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
welcome to the show.

00:00:46.163 --> 00:00:47.080 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Thank you.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.880 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And you've had a
lifetime of palmistry

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.060 align:middle line:84%
that came about in a really
kind of interesting way.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.430 align:middle line:84%
So before we get
into the art itself,

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.340 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about
your own background

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.830 align:middle line:84%
and how basically you were
still a kid out of high school.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.870 align:middle line:84%
You end up in New York and
meeting this very Merlinesque

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.510 align:middle line:84%
character called
Patrick Geoffrois, yeah,

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.650 align:middle line:84%
and he ends up being this
huge influence in your life

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.100 align:middle line:84%
and showing you, really,
the path to one's soul

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.130 align:middle line:90%
is through one's hands.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.650 align:middle line:84%
So tell us about how you
met him and what he did.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.450 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Sure.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually, the beginning
of my palmistry career,

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.800 align:middle line:84%
if you will, it started
when I got a book

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.160 align:middle line:84%
when I was 17 years old
in my high school library

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.150 align:middle line:90%
on palmistry.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And it was just called,
"On Reading Palms."

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
looking through it.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.000 align:middle line:90%
I was intrigued by it actually.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Did you talk to
your career counselor about it?

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:40.090 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: [LAUGHS]

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.890 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.160 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: I'm glad I didn't.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.960 align:middle line:84%
They would have
dissuaded me, I'm sure.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.635 align:middle line:84%
But I started looking at
the book and the diagrams

00:01:47.635 --> 00:01:49.010 align:middle line:84%
and looking at my
friends' hands.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And my friends all
thought I was crazy.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And they said, just stick
with baseball, OK, Vernon?

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.680 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.420 align:middle line:10%
And then that kind of
put the idea in my head

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.010 align:middle line:10%
about the accuracy of palmistry
and the-- it just intrigued me.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.990 align:middle line:10%
It was a very mysterious
thing that you

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.510 align:middle line:10%
can understand a
person's personality

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.610 align:middle line:10%
and who they are by their hands.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.903 align:middle line:84%
So that kind of put
the seed in my heart.

00:02:15.903 --> 00:02:18.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And he'd let you
actually sit in on some of his

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.800 align:middle line:90%
readings.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.890 align:middle line:90%
He said, OK, kid.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.080 align:middle line:90%
If you want to watch, watch.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And you heard some really
interesting comments

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.440 align:middle line:90%
from people.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Yeah.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.320 align:middle line:84%
So I used to-- all
my friends used

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.730 align:middle line:84%
to hang out in St. Mark's Place
in the Lower East Side, the East

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:32.960 align:middle line:90%
Village in Manhattan.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And I used to go
there all the time

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:35.720 align:middle line:90%
and hang out with my friends.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And there was this
guy who used to have

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.080 align:middle line:84%
a table on St. Mark's Street and
he would look at people's hands.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And I would constantly
look at him, and I thought,

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.380 align:middle line:90%
what is this guy doing?

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I got
up enough nerve,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.420 align:middle line:90%
and I said, what are you doing?

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.690 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] And he said, hey, sit
down and watch what I'm doing.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And he told me, I'm
doing palmistry.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm reading people's fortunes.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.290 align:middle line:90%
That's what he said.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.863 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But it was
obviously much more than that.

00:03:02.863 --> 00:03:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And when we're
talking off camera,

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.100 align:middle line:84%
you said there was this one
gentleman who you happened

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.270 align:middle line:84%
to overhear saying he
learned more about his life

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.270 align:middle line:90%
than all these coaches--

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.520 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: That was the most--

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.750 align:middle line:84%
again, that put a seed in my
brain because he got a reading,

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.560 align:middle line:84%
and he said, you have
told me more about myself

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.040 align:middle line:84%
and my life than any career
consultant, or counselor,

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.390 align:middle line:84%
or any psychologist, who
I've been to many, ever.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.800 align:middle line:84%
So I just said, wow
that's interesting.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.140 align:middle line:84%
So I continued to
watch him read hands.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.818 align:middle line:84%
And after he would look at
people's hands, he would say,

00:03:40.818 --> 00:03:42.110 align:middle line:90%
did you see this in their hand?

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.400 align:middle line:90%
Did you see that in the hand?

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.780 align:middle line:84%
Did you remember what I
was telling him about this?

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.630 align:middle line:84%
So he was right on site,
showing me and teaching me

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.030 align:middle line:90%
how to read hands.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And he became my mentor
for five or six years.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:57.920 align:middle line:90%
I didn't go to college.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.340 align:middle line:84%
Just pretty much after high
school, he became my mentor.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.140 align:middle line:90%
And that's--

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Lucky you.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And so there obviously was
some kind of soul connection.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And what intrigues me
about the whole subject

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.320 align:middle line:84%
is that here, right
in front of us,

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.070 align:middle line:84%
our soul has found a way
to visually communicate

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.490 align:middle line:84%
with us through our hands,
because so often, we

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:22.490 align:middle line:84%
say, well, how do I know what
my soul is trying to tell me?

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.430 align:middle line:84%
It's so ethereal, or
ephemeral, so distant.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And I can't really hear
my soul speaking to me,

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.410 align:middle line:84%
but you're saying, no, it's
right in front of your face.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:32.550 align:middle line:90%
It's right there.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.720 align:middle line:84%
So before we get going,
one thing I wonder

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.350 align:middle line:84%
is, how old are we
before our hands actually

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.095 align:middle line:84%
have a solid formation of
lines that can be read?

00:04:44.095 --> 00:04:46.220 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: That's an
interesting question, Regina,

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.210 align:middle line:84%
because all our
lines, configurations,

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.290 align:middle line:84%
even the fingerprints, are
formed at seven months within

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.310 align:middle line:90%
the womb.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.080 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is what academia say.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.660 align:middle line:84%
This is what doctors
and physicians say.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.880 align:middle line:84%
They can actually see at
seven months in the womb,

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.260 align:middle line:84%
these configurations
are fully formed.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, the interesting thing
is that the Navajo Indians,

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.690 align:middle line:90%
they have a similar legend.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And they say that
at seven months,

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.440 align:middle line:84%
God blows his
breath on the child,

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:28.660 align:middle line:84%
and his breath becomes
the child's fingerprints.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:29.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And that if you look at it
from a soul perspective,

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.200 align:middle line:84%
it makes sense if the
soul is on the other side

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.960 align:middle line:84%
and it's agreed to
this incarnation

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.285 align:middle line:84%
through this little body,
this little vehicle.

00:05:39.285 --> 00:05:42.900 align:middle line:84%
So it's also impressing
upon it its desires

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.860 align:middle line:84%
and the way it wants to
work through its life.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And all of this has to
go into the formation

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.722 align:middle line:84%
of these handprints
that we have.

00:05:49.722 --> 00:05:50.680 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Absolutely.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is the aspect of the
fingerprints which is looking

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.950 align:middle line:90%
at our previous lifetimes.

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:02.140 align:middle line:84%
For instance, when
we look at a tree,

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.090 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing the
above ground tree.

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:11.680 align:middle line:84%
But the roots could be three,
four, five times as extensive.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.900 align:middle line:84%
So that's what the
fingerprints show.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.460 align:middle line:84%
The fingerprints show
one's previous lifetimes,

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.300 align:middle line:84%
what we accomplished in our
previous life, what talents we

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.090 align:middle line:90%
bring into this lifetime.

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And they must be
read because they

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.767 align:middle line:84%
show our roots, the
roots of our tree

00:06:31.767 --> 00:06:33.850 align:middle line:84%
and what we're going to
be doing in this lifetime,

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:38.500 align:middle line:84%
because this life is a continuum
from our previous lifetimes.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.870 align:middle line:90%
But we are eternal.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:41.990 align:middle line:90%
We're eternal beings.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.370 align:middle line:84%
So the soul has had
uncountable lifetimes.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.480 align:middle line:84%
We've been in this material
world since time immemorial.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.448 align:middle line:84%
But one needs to only
look at, let's say,

00:06:51.448 --> 00:06:52.990 align:middle line:84%
two or three lifetimes
to see where--

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's what
I was going to say.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.425 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: --our
soul's going to head.

00:06:55.425 --> 00:06:58.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You see what has most
impacted us coming out of one

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:00.070 align:middle line:90%
incarnation into the other.

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.810 align:middle line:84%
It seems you wouldn't
need all the rest of it.

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:02.110 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: [CHUCKLES]

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You
couldn't even read it.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.330 align:middle line:90%
There'd be so many lines.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:05.020 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: You're right.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:05.845 align:middle line:90%
And we're advancing.

00:07:05.845 --> 00:07:06.645 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:06.645 --> 00:07:09.530 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: In other words,
the consciousness that we had,

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.217 align:middle line:84%
let's say, 100 lifetimes ago
is not going to be as advanced.

00:07:12.217 --> 00:07:14.050 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be more
advanced because we're

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.630 align:middle line:90%
having more human bodies.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.920 align:middle line:84%
So the more human
bodies one has,

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.720 align:middle line:84%
the more one comes to this stage
of what's called in the Vedic

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.520 align:middle line:90%
view a [NON-ENGLISH].

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.080 align:middle line:90%
What's the purpose of life?

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.430 align:middle line:90%
What am I doing here?

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.350 align:middle line:84%
Just two or three
lifetimes won't bring that.

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:33.340 align:middle line:84%
But if a person's had a
hundred or 200 lifetimes,

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.560 align:middle line:84%
they're going to come
to this conclusion of,

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.730 align:middle line:90%
what am I here for?

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:37.630 align:middle line:90%
Is there a God?

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:38.950 align:middle line:90%
What's my purpose?

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:40.760 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
become a seeker.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: So this
is seen in the hands.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.965 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let me
ask you this then.

00:07:44.965 --> 00:07:47.920 align:middle line:84%
How many people that come
to you have that question?

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.030 align:middle line:90%
What am I here for?

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:50.680 align:middle line:90%
I don't know my life's purpose.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.700 align:middle line:90%
Is that common?

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.460 align:middle line:84%
Are people starting to
understand and connect

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.230 align:middle line:84%
with their life's
purpose before they even

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:58.210 align:middle line:90%
arrive in front of you?

00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:59.470 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Practically all.

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:00.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Really?

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: Especially people
who seek me out to get a reading

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.120 align:middle line:90%
from me.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.330 align:middle line:84%
It may not happen if I'm going
to a party or a social gathering

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.880 align:middle line:84%
and somebody asks me, can I
look-- can you look at my hands?

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.920 align:middle line:90%
But it will absolutely be there.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And practically
every hand I read,

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:16.870 align:middle line:84%
even if someone's asking
about their career

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:21.790 align:middle line:84%
or their relationship, the fact
that they're asking for services

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:26.345 align:middle line:84%
as a palmist, they know that
there's something metaphysical,

00:08:26.345 --> 00:08:27.145 align:middle line:90%
or spiritual--

00:08:27.145 --> 00:08:27.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Sure.

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.330 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: --or
astrological behind this.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.860 align:middle line:84%
So yes, 100% of the
time, I'm going to say,

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:36.820 align:middle line:84%
anyone who comes to me
or someone like what I do

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.820 align:middle line:84%
is going to be somewhat
of a seeker or a searcher.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And they're looking
for life's meaning

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:42.859 align:middle line:90%
beyond even their own life.

00:08:42.859 --> 00:08:43.659 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Good.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:44.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad to hear that.

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:45.770 align:middle line:90%
That's very encouraging.

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:46.570 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: And the interesting
thing too is that what I've seen

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:55.570 align:middle line:84%
since doing this since the late
'80s is that my work is becoming

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:56.530 align:middle line:90%
mainstream.

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:59.890 align:middle line:84%
The work of psychics,
astrologers, palmists,

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:02.495 align:middle line:84%
numerologists, we're
in the mainstream now.

00:09:02.495 --> 00:09:04.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Isn't that-- well,
it wasn't that way when you

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:05.380 align:middle line:90%
started.

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:06.190 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Oh, I--

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:09.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It was kooky stuff at
the circus, Madame Zelda stuff.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:09.850 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:11.770 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: Sometimes,
people would ask me, Regina,

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:13.880 align:middle line:84%
in the early '90s, what
do you do for a living?

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.172 align:middle line:90%
And I would say, I'm a palmist.

00:09:15.172 --> 00:09:16.565 align:middle line:90%
And they'd go, what's that?

00:09:16.565 --> 00:09:17.440 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: [CHUCKLES]

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:21.460 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: [CHUCKLES] And
then the next question was,

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.350 align:middle line:90%
you make a living from that?

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:28.550 align:middle line:84%
And after 2012, definitely,
people would say,

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:29.640 align:middle line:90%
I want a reading.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.235 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:31.235 --> 00:09:32.860 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: It's a
different world now.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:33.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, it is.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: So like
we were saying before,

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:38.470 align:middle line:84%
you go to a bookstore now, any
bookstore, Barnes and Nobles,

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:44.530 align:middle line:84%
anything, and there's four
racks of books on astrology,

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:46.510 align:middle line:90%
palmistry, numerology.

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:47.620 align:middle line:90%
We're mainstream.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:48.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:48.730 align:middle line:90%
That's wonderful.

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:49.563 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad to hear it.

00:09:49.563 --> 00:09:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: I'm definitely very
hopeful about the advancement

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:56.890 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness that I'm
seeing in the United States,

00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:58.580 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.040 align:middle line:90%
It's never been like this.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which countries,
in your own experience or that

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.110 align:middle line:84%
you're aware of, are the ones
that tend to have more people

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:10.247 align:middle line:84%
that are really looking
for that deeper question?

00:10:10.247 --> 00:10:11.080 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: England.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:11.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: England?

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.820 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: I lived in
England for a couple of years.

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:13.510 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, it seems so.

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:14.680 align:middle line:90%
I go there quite a bit.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:18.065 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: England is a hotbed
of metaphysical interests.

00:10:18.065 --> 00:10:18.865 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:10:18.865 --> 00:10:22.020 align:middle line:90%


00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:23.770 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: The
interesting thing, Regina,

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:28.370 align:middle line:84%
is that psychic
stuff, palmistry,

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:30.620 align:middle line:84%
astrology is part
of their culture.

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:31.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: They had palmists
and astrologers advising

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:37.040 align:middle line:84%
the Kings and the Queens
hundreds of years ago.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:37.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: So let's
say Dr. John Dee or--

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:43.550 align:middle line:90%
it's part of their culture.

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a fabric
of who they are.

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:49.880 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: So England is way
ahead of the game even more than

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.140 align:middle line:90%
other countries that I've seen.

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:55.400 align:middle line:84%
But when you look at a
country like, let's say,

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:59.870 align:middle line:84%
India, or even
Malaysia, or Singapore,

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:03.105 align:middle line:84%
they're also very
much into the--

00:11:03.105 --> 00:11:03.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wonderful.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:05.022 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: --these arts.

00:11:05.022 --> 00:11:07.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So the consciousness
is rising all over because we

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:10.190 align:middle line:84%
know it's aspects
of Russian culture.

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:12.693 align:middle line:84%
This is very deep as
well even if it was more

00:11:12.693 --> 00:11:13.610 align:middle line:90%
hidden for many years.

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:15.800 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: Palmistry and
astrology are huge in Russia.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.740 align:middle line:84%
So we can't make
assumptions like US

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.940 align:middle line:84%
is the leader in this or
that just because we have

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:22.190 align:middle line:90%
a lot of the bookstores that--

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:22.810 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: I'd like
it to be the leader.

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:24.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And
because we have Gaia.

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:26.780 align:middle line:84%
But I mean-- but it's being
well-supported in the US too.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:27.080 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Yes.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.955 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So now a
couple of questions here.

00:11:28.955 --> 00:11:31.140 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I have a whole lot
of questions for you.

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:32.360 align:middle line:90%
So we have these lines.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.320 align:middle line:90%
We have these mounds.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.550 align:middle line:90%
We have these fingerprints.

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:39.120 align:middle line:84%
Do they change over a
lifetime with our experience?

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.570 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: Our life
destiny does not change.

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:45.230 align:middle line:84%
You could look at a little
girl who's four years old.

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And if she'll keep her
hands open long enough,

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:50.880 align:middle line:84%
you can actually tell that, oh,
she's going to be an architect.

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.780 align:middle line:84%
She's going to be an interior
decorator, that type of thing.

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:56.690 align:middle line:90%
So we do have our destiny.

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:59.030 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
we have our free will

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:00.450 align:middle line:90%
to not do our destiny.

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:01.250 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:04.910 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: Or we have our
free will to even go beyond

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:05.720 align:middle line:90%
our destiny.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:11.053 align:middle line:84%
For instance, you look at
someone like the Apple creator--

00:12:11.053 --> 00:12:11.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Steve Jobs.

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:13.012 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: --Steve Jobs.

00:12:13.012 --> 00:12:15.740 align:middle line:84%
You could look at his hands
or his astrological chart

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:21.320 align:middle line:84%
and see that he went way
beyond his astrological karma

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.160 align:middle line:84%
and he did something
even bigger.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.480 align:middle line:84%
So that free will, he
was totally in alignment

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.710 align:middle line:90%
with his free will.

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll see sometimes
people are meant to be,

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:34.490 align:middle line:90%
let's say, architects or--

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:39.110 align:middle line:84%
they're meant to be in fields
like that and they don't--

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:42.960 align:middle line:84%
they'll just stay as a
secretary and not pursue it.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:47.355 align:middle line:84%
So my job is to get
people to understand, hey,

00:12:47.355 --> 00:12:48.230 align:middle line:90%
this is your destiny.

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:49.610 align:middle line:90%
This is what you're born to do.

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And if you do it, the
planets are behind you.

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:54.013 align:middle line:84%
You will be successful
if you do it.

00:12:54.013 --> 00:12:56.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what percentage
of people that show up

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:58.555 align:middle line:84%
on your doorstep are actually
doing what they're destined

00:12:58.555 --> 00:13:00.290 align:middle line:90%
to do, roughly?

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:02.002 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Less than 5%.

00:13:02.002 --> 00:13:04.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, because this is
really a very important part

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:05.335 align:middle line:90%
of this conversation.

00:13:05.335 --> 00:13:09.380 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: Our society
completely waylays us from

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:12.320 align:middle line:84%
our natural abilities
and talents.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.960 align:middle line:90%
Our school systems misalign us.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.740 align:middle line:84%
Our modern academic
aspects misalign us.

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:22.280 align:middle line:84%
People do not take the
time and they're not

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.890 align:middle line:84%
encouraged to take the time
to look within themselves

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:26.465 align:middle line:90%
and think, what do I want to do?

00:13:26.465 --> 00:13:27.265 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:13:27.265 --> 00:13:30.125 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: What is my purpose?

00:13:30.125 --> 00:13:31.730 align:middle line:90%
What is my passion?

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:32.780 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:36.470 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: And many times,
and this happens a lot, Regina,

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:39.930 align:middle line:84%
I'll look at someone's
hand and I'll say,

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:42.680 align:middle line:84%
you were destined to
become a psychologist.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And he or she will
say, yes, that's what

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.900 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to do after
I left high school,

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:49.820 align:middle line:84%
but my parents
talked me out of it,

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:53.120 align:middle line:84%
or, the college guidance
counselor talked me out of it.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.510 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:55.968 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: And
that happens a lot.

00:13:55.968 --> 00:13:57.427 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
why I was asking,

00:13:57.427 --> 00:14:00.210 align:middle line:84%
because I figured it's a fairly
small percentage that actually

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:02.970 align:middle line:84%
align and connect with what they
were born to do and their soul

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:04.830 align:middle line:90%
has chosen to come and express.

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:05.823 align:middle line:90%
So all right.

00:14:05.823 --> 00:14:06.990 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: It's very small.

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:07.907 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Very small.

00:14:07.907 --> 00:14:11.220 align:middle line:84%
So my understanding is
that as a practice in India

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:13.770 align:middle line:84%
through the ages, that,
depending on the family,

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:15.870 align:middle line:84%
an astrologer would
come at a child's birth

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:17.700 align:middle line:84%
and lay out the
chart for the parents

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:20.130 align:middle line:84%
and tell them their
strengths, and their purpose,

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:22.080 align:middle line:84%
and where their
weaknesses might lie

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.140 align:middle line:84%
so a parent had a roadmap
to their child, right?

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, doesn't it
seem like that's

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:30.730 align:middle line:84%
what we should be doing with
our palms of our children?

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:33.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, yeah, I'm putting you
in a bad position, of course.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:33.345 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: No.

00:14:33.345 --> 00:14:34.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This is what
you do, but isn't it--

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:36.780 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: This is what I
learned and what I was taught

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:37.440 align:middle line:90%
in India.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: Even the speaker
of Bhagavad Gita, Krishna,

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.040 align:middle line:84%
who is speaking to
Arjuna, he, himself,

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:49.080 align:middle line:84%
got an astrological reading
when he was days old.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:52.980 align:middle line:84%
So the entire culture of,
let's say, Vedic India

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:56.050 align:middle line:84%
is that an astrologer
or a palmist

00:14:56.050 --> 00:15:01.660 align:middle line:84%
will come to that person's
house and sometimes

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:03.140 align:middle line:90%
even give the child the name.

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:03.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:07.780 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: The child's name
was sometimes in alignment with

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:11.330 align:middle line:90%
the astrological frequencies.

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And so you had a
name that resonated

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.150 align:middle line:90%
with their astrological chart.

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:17.650 align:middle line:90%
What could be more powerful?

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:18.520 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, again, you
still have free will.

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:22.380 align:middle line:90%
If the parents were--

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.400 align:middle line:84%
if parents could
take this information

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.440 align:middle line:84%
and use it in subtle
and wise ways,

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.510 align:middle line:84%
and allow the child
to develop and watch

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:32.710 align:middle line:84%
its natural inclinations
and kind of propensities

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:34.900 align:middle line:84%
toward doing certain
activities, and say, oh,

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.090 align:middle line:84%
that's lining up
with what their hands

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:39.580 align:middle line:84%
or what their astrological
chart says, and let

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.670 align:middle line:84%
them do that, the child still
has the right in the end to say,

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:43.900 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to do this.

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:46.960 align:middle line:84%
You can always go against
whatever your soul has

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.030 align:middle line:90%
intended for you, if you wish.

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:51.252 align:middle line:84%
But it makes it less
likely that would happen.

00:15:51.252 --> 00:15:52.210 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Absolutely.

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And what I've seen
countless times, Regina, is

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:58.660 align:middle line:84%
that when I tell people
what their life purpose is,

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:01.370 align:middle line:84%
what they're born to do,
they resonate with it.

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:02.200 align:middle line:90%
They know it.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.020 align:middle line:84%
They always feel-- if
they're not doing that work,

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.000 align:middle line:84%
they always feel, this
is what I wanted to do,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.800 align:middle line:84%
or, this is what I've always
felt called to, but I never took

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:10.600 align:middle line:90%
the risk--

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:10.960 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That must bring--

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:11.230 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: --to do it.

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:13.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --tears to their
eyes to say, oh my god.

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:13.980 align:middle line:90%
It's right here.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.010 align:middle line:90%
I always wanted to.

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:17.570 align:middle line:84%
I've missed however
many years so far,

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:19.570 align:middle line:84%
because depending on where
you are in your life,

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:21.410 align:middle line:90%
you can't always go back.

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:25.330 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: And then I-- and
then my job is then to say, hey,

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:28.850 align:middle line:84%
sometimes people do accomplish
their best work in their 40s,

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:29.770 align:middle line:90%
50s, and 60s--

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:30.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And that's true.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.440 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: --because then
we have that maturity,

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.270 align:middle line:90%
then we have the understanding.

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:35.500 align:middle line:90%
We have the awareness.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:37.805 align:middle line:84%
There are so many things
that can work in our favor.

00:16:37.805 --> 00:16:38.605 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:38.605 --> 00:16:41.950 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: So sometimes, even
knowing what you should be doing

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:44.780 align:middle line:84%
when you're 20 years old, maybe
the person's not ready yet.

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:45.580 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:46.380 align:middle line:90%
No, that is true.

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:49.300 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: But you put
that idea in their mind

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:50.710 align:middle line:90%
and they'll always know it.

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:53.030 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that palmist told me
this is what I'm good at.

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:54.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
it'll come back.

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:54.640 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Yes.

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:55.440 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:58.720 align:middle line:84%
Let's dive into how astrology,
the soul, the hands,

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:01.040 align:middle line:84%
and how they show
themselves actually work.

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:06.670 align:middle line:84%
So in astrology, how do you see
the astrological configurations

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:07.510 align:middle line:90%
in your hands?

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:09.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know fingers
represent different things.

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about the
fingers, and the thumbs,

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:15.790 align:middle line:84%
and the just basic guidelines
about astrology in our hands.

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:17.960 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: Well,
my work in my field,

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:23.200 align:middle line:84%
I've always wanted to teach
my peers and my brethren that

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:28.900 align:middle line:84%
actually, these hands
that we have is actually

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.520 align:middle line:90%
our astrological chart.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:35.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you go to
India, many astrologers

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:39.580 align:middle line:84%
are aware that palmistry
and astrology are a brother

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.000 align:middle line:90%
or a sister to each other.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.422 align:middle line:84%
In fact, very few people know
what time they're born in India.

00:17:44.422 --> 00:17:46.630 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they don't even
know what day they're born.

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:46.900 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That is true.

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:49.885 align:middle line:90%
It probably happened at home.

00:17:49.885 --> 00:17:52.720 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: So an astrologer
will sometimes take

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:55.460 align:middle line:84%
a person's hand and look at,
oh, what is this person's rising

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:56.260 align:middle line:90%
chart?

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:57.730 align:middle line:84%
Because every--
it's all visible.

00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:00.430 align:middle line:84%
It's all-- it's on
the hand, you see.

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:04.990 align:middle line:84%
So in India, in the
Asian world, people

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:08.330 align:middle line:84%
are familiar that palmistry
and astrology are very closely

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:09.130 align:middle line:90%
aligned.

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:11.950 align:middle line:84%
But the hand is my
astrological chart.

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:14.290 align:middle line:84%
When I'm looking
at a person's hand,

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:19.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing exactly what
an astrologer can see--

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:24.420 align:middle line:84%
houses they have, what planets
they have, what signs they have,

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:25.220 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:26.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So show us
with your own hand.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.100 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: For instance,
give me your hand.

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:29.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:31.320 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: You have 12
segments on these fingers.

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.120 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:32.540 align:middle line:90%
Oh there you go.

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:32.600 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.270 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: Every one of
them deals with a particular

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:36.410 align:middle line:90%
astrological sign.

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:36.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: Aries, Taurus,
Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo,

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:39.680 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:40.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: The hand proper, the
palm proper is where the planets

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:44.170 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:46.520 align:middle line:84%
The thumb is not
ruled by a planet

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.290 align:middle line:90%
because it's our free will.

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:53.240 align:middle line:84%
The thumb has everything to
do with our personal drive,

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.508 align:middle line:90%
determination, and motivation.

00:18:54.508 --> 00:18:55.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's interesting--

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: And
that's why the thumb--

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:59.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --because the species
is known to be so capable

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.200 align:middle line:90%
because of our thumbs.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.040 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Yes.

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:05.090 align:middle line:84%
I think it was Thomas
Merton who said

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:09.320 align:middle line:84%
that the fact that
the thumb exists

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.990 align:middle line:90%
proves to me that there's a God.

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:16.580 align:middle line:84%
So if we look at the thumb, we
see that it's kind of looking,

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:19.250 align:middle line:84%
if you will, at the other
fingers and the palm.

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:21.120 align:middle line:90%
It's keeping everything in line.

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.440 align:middle line:90%
It's aware of everything.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:27.590 align:middle line:84%
So we have our astrological
aspects, our talents, abilities,

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:31.790 align:middle line:84%
potentials, capabilities,
and challenges here.

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's the thumb that gives us
the ability to rise above and do

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:38.800 align:middle line:90%
it, you see.

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:39.800 align:middle line:90%
So it is our free will--

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.842 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So can you look
at some thumbs and say

00:19:41.842 --> 00:19:46.218 align:middle line:84%
there's lesser motivation toward
free will than another thumb,

00:19:46.218 --> 00:19:48.260 align:middle line:84%
which is like, I'm going
to do it no matter what?

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:49.550 align:middle line:90%
Does that show on the thumbs?

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: Regina, that's
the very first thing I look

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:52.940 align:middle line:90%
at, the thumb.

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:55.670 align:middle line:84%
The thumb will tell me
if the person's actually

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:59.975 align:middle line:84%
achieving things or
hardly achieving things.

00:19:59.975 --> 00:20:05.840 align:middle line:84%
The soul will-- the soul
especially expresses itself

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.565 align:middle line:90%
through the thumb.

00:20:07.565 --> 00:20:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's the thumb
that will tell me,

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:11.150 align:middle line:90%
is this person getting results?

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:13.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't just mean
materially, but everything.

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:15.170 align:middle line:90%
Are they confident?

00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:17.030 align:middle line:10%
Are they moving forward in life?

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:21.230 align:middle line:10%
Or are they extremely cautious,
and careful, and reluctant?

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:22.770 align:middle line:90%
Are they afraid of life?

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:24.920 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you can
tell if someone's

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.638 align:middle line:84%
confident by how they
hold their thumbs.

00:20:26.638 --> 00:20:28.430 align:middle line:84%
If someone's talking
to you and their thumb

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:30.240 align:middle line:84%
is outstretched
like this, it means

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.550 align:middle line:84%
they have a great
amount of confidence.

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:33.963 align:middle line:90%
They feel capable.

00:20:33.963 --> 00:20:35.880 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that
they don't have problems,

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.680 align:middle line:84%
but they feel, hey,
I'll slay the dragon.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:40.437 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: And if
the thumb is closed--

00:20:40.437 --> 00:20:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: If you're speaking
and you're keeping it close like

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:43.230 align:middle line:90%
this?

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:44.430 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Like that, yeah.

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:44.970 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes people--

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:46.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: A little more fear?

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:48.900 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: --talk to you, or
they'll-- you'll put their hands

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.480 align:middle line:84%
like this and you'll see that
the thumbs are very close

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.740 align:middle line:90%
to the palm.

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:56.860 align:middle line:84%
These people are a lot
more shy, more inhibited.

00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:00.210 align:middle line:84%
They feel a little bit
of fear or sometimes even

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:01.990 align:middle line:90%
uncomfortability around people.

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And so just the placement
of the thumb tells a lot.

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:09.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, when someone's,
let's say, in a coma

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:11.700 align:middle line:84%
or they're doing very
poorly, sometimes we'll

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:16.830 align:middle line:84%
see the thumb inside the
hand like that sometimes.

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And that means that there's
no movement at all, you see.

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:23.772 align:middle line:84%
And one-- sometimes, you'll see
in a hospital situation, when

00:21:23.772 --> 00:21:25.230 align:middle line:84%
the thumb starts
coming out, that's

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:27.975 align:middle line:84%
a great sign because it means
that the person is coming to.

00:21:27.975 --> 00:21:29.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:29.900 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Yeah.

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't have to tell
you that someone who's

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:36.060 align:middle line:84%
living on the street, their
thumbs are not going to be out.

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Their thumbs are going
to be like this, you see,

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:40.830 align:middle line:84%
because they feel,
hey, life's against me.

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:41.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.120 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: When a person's
thumb is like this--

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:43.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They're under threat.

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:44.370 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Yeah.

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:45.930 align:middle line:84%
They feel, everything's
against me.

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:47.070 align:middle line:90%
They feel pessimistic.

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:48.300 align:middle line:90%
They feel suspicious.

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:49.650 align:middle line:90%
They feel distrustful.

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:53.790 align:middle line:84%
But when a person's thumb
is out like this, they feel,

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:56.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to overcome
everything that comes to me.

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:56.610 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:56.805 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:56.805 --> 00:21:57.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:58.920 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: Sometimes
they can be aggressive.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.540 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they could
be belligerent.

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:03.510 align:middle line:84%
But we'd like to see something
that's about 45 degree.

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:06.418 align:middle line:84%
If we see something
like this, OK, well--

00:22:06.418 --> 00:22:07.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's a risk-taker.

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:09.120 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: --you know
what you're going to get.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:09.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:11.790 align:middle line:84%
But if you see something
like this, this is about--

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:14.130 align:middle line:84%
this is average,
and I like this.

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:17.040 align:middle line:90%
It means someone has--

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.480 align:middle line:84%
they'll take risks,
but they also

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:22.080 align:middle line:84%
have the caution sometimes
to be prudent and watchful.

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.520 align:middle line:90%
So it's the best of both worlds.

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:27.150 align:middle line:84%
But a 45-degree angle
means that the person

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:28.360 align:middle line:90%
is getting things done.

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:29.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:29.997 align:middle line:90%
Good to know.

00:22:29.997 --> 00:22:31.830 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's looking at
their hands right now

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:33.450 align:middle line:84%
and whoever's
sitting next to them.

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:36.360 align:middle line:84%
What about the mounds
below the thumb?

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.240 align:middle line:10%
>> MAHABAL: And this is one
of the most often researched

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.510 align:middle line:10%
aspects of the hand.

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:43.920 align:middle line:10%
If you look at palmistry
books even from the 1800s,

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.500 align:middle line:10%
they'll talk about these--

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.620 align:middle line:10%
what we used to call
mountains or mounds.

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:53.880 align:middle line:10%
And so for instance, if
a mountain is upraised,

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:57.210 align:middle line:10%
it means you have a lot of
the planetary energy in you.

00:22:57.210 --> 00:23:00.245 align:middle line:90%
So if this area here is--

00:23:00.245 --> 00:23:01.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This
part of the hand.

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:02.160 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: This is the moon.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:02.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:03.230 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Yes.

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And it'll show someone has
an interest in metaphysics

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:08.100 align:middle line:90%
or spirituality.

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.300 align:middle line:90%
They're emotional.

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:11.475 align:middle line:90%
If this aspect has every--

00:23:11.475 --> 00:23:13.410 align:middle line:90%
is upraised-- this is Venus--

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:15.960 align:middle line:84%
so a person has a
lot of lust for life

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:19.502 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of joy de
vivre, as they say.

00:23:19.502 --> 00:23:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
lifeline is around it,

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:22.680 align:middle line:84%
because a lifeline
has everything

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:27.080 align:middle line:84%
to do with sexual energy
and relationships.

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And a lot of times,
you say you read the lifeline

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:32.880 align:middle line:84%
a little differently than
sometimes is classically done,

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.680 align:middle line:84%
that it's not always
the how long--

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:35.040 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: As far as I know--

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:35.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --you're
going to live.

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: --I'm the only
palmist in the world that--

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:39.840 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] it's
the second chakra.

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And most palmists
will always say,

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.950 align:middle line:84%
or most palmistry books--
and I can't tell you

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:48.150 align:middle line:84%
how many times, Regina, people
will tell me, oh my god, Vern,

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:50.730 align:middle line:90%
my lifeline is broken here.

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:51.930 align:middle line:90%
Am I going to die early?

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:52.730 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:54.780 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: Or, my
lifeline is skinny.

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:56.250 align:middle line:90%
Am I going to get sick?

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:58.840 align:middle line:90%
Or, there's an indentation here.

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:00.450 align:middle line:90%
Am I going to get hit by a car?

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:02.580 align:middle line:90%
There's so many falsities here.

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And it really affects people
because every palmistry book

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:07.590 align:middle line:84%
in the world talks
about how this line has

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:09.780 align:middle line:90%
everything to do with health.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.270 align:middle line:90%
Well, the line is actually--

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:15.480 align:middle line:84%
it starts from the
bottom of the hand

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.990 align:middle line:84%
and curves around this
mountain of Venus.

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And it has everything to do
with relationships, sexuality.

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:29.980 align:middle line:84%
It has everything to do
with where your kids are,

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:32.620 align:middle line:84%
how many kids you're
going to find.

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:34.660 align:middle line:84%
People always say, oh,
I have three lines here.

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:36.868 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh yeah, that's
the way I heard years ago.

00:24:36.868 --> 00:24:39.560 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: I'm gonna have
three relationships here.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:40.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:45.790 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: Again, that's to
be-- that's to be thrown away.

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:50.240 align:middle line:84%
All your relationships and all
your kids are on this line here.

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:55.355 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: And the
deeper the line,

00:24:55.355 --> 00:25:01.390 align:middle line:84%
the more enthusiasm
you have to enjoy life.

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:04.990 align:middle line:84%
The skinnier the line, a person
tends to be a little bit more

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:05.948 align:middle line:90%
mental or intellectual.

00:25:05.948 --> 00:25:08.032 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, I was
going to ask you about that

00:25:08.032 --> 00:25:11.020 align:middle line:84%
in the fingers, like the
length of the fingers and such.

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:14.278 align:middle line:84%
Don't they determine different
aspects of personality?

00:25:14.278 --> 00:25:15.320 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Yes, they do.

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So let's talk about--

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:18.070 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: Hold
your hand straight.

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:19.900 align:middle line:90%
Put your hands here.

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And now bring the
hands close to you.

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And put the palms
close to your eye.

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:27.760 align:middle line:90%
Turn them around.

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask
you which on your--

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:38.050 align:middle line:84%
on the right hand, which
finger, the index or the--

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:39.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Middle finger?

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:39.590 align:middle line:90%
The ring finger?

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:41.248 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: --ring
finger, is longer?

00:25:41.248 --> 00:25:43.415 align:middle line:84%
There will always be one
finger that's a tad longer.

00:25:43.415 --> 00:25:46.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: My index is slightly
longer than my ring finger.

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:46.690 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: On both hands?

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:47.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: On both hands.

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:48.135 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: OK, cool.

00:25:48.135 --> 00:25:53.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, a person whose
ring finger is longer

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:57.010 align:middle line:84%
means that they
want a life that's

00:25:57.010 --> 00:26:01.310 align:middle line:84%
going to give them pleasure
in terms of art, beauty,

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:03.440 align:middle line:90%
creativity.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:06.500 align:middle line:84%
Self-expression is more
important than financial gain

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:07.720 align:middle line:90%
for them.

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:08.720 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So a lot of--

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: That's why--

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --artists
would have that?

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:10.425 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Yes.

00:26:10.425 --> 00:26:10.780 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:12.020 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Yes.

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And when you have a longer
Jupiter finger, as we say--

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:17.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Index.

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: --in palmistry,
or the index finger,

00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:24.080 align:middle line:84%
then it means that you will want
to have some power, influence,

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.520 align:middle line:84%
and authority in
your life, you see.

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:29.400 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I always say that
musicians have a longer ring

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:30.200 align:middle line:90%
finger--

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, makes sense.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:32.743 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: --and
their lawyers have--

00:26:32.743 --> 00:26:33.543 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:26:33.543 --> 00:26:35.330 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: --the
longer index finger.

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:36.205 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:26:36.205 --> 00:26:39.170 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] And then we won't
do it-- go ahead, yeah.

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:42.720 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: So a longer index
finger doesn't show that, hey,

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:43.520 align:middle line:90%
I want power.

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:44.320 align:middle line:90%
I want power.

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.710 align:middle line:84%
It just shows
that, hey, I'm in--

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:48.920 align:middle line:84%
I want to bring out
my individuality.

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:49.850 align:middle line:90%
I want to bring out--

00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:52.460 align:middle line:84%
I want to be in
positions of being

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:57.200 align:middle line:84%
able to have influence over my
environment or my surroundings.

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.900 align:middle line:90%
Art and creativity is secondary.

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.990 align:middle line:84%
But for the long ring
finger, it's the opposite.

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:05.660 align:middle line:84%
They'll want-- for
instance, if you

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:09.060 align:middle line:84%
look at the hands of like a
David Bowie or an Ozzie Osborne,

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:10.935 align:middle line:84%
you can imagine how long
that ring finger is.

00:27:10.935 --> 00:27:10.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:11.210 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah.

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:12.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: But if you look
at any lawyer or banker today,

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:19.045 align:middle line:84%
especially their--
their index will rival--

00:27:19.045 --> 00:27:19.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh really?

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:20.550 align:middle line:90%
Really prominent?

00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:21.380 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: --this
middle finger.

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:21.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:22.040 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:22.760 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: It's really long.

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:23.300 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:23.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:24.020 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:25.760 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: And you'll see
that in the political world

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:26.660 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:27.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh really?

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:31.340 align:middle line:84%
So always long index
fingers in those worlds

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:33.810 align:middle line:84%
that require a lot of
mentalism competition--

00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:34.610 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Yes.

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:35.000 align:middle line:90%
They can handle--

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.635 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --struggles
for power and so forth.

00:27:36.635 --> 00:27:38.570 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: They know
how to confront life.

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:40.653 align:middle line:84%
For instance,
musicians and artists,

00:27:40.653 --> 00:27:42.320 align:middle line:84%
they don't know how
to confront so much.

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:46.400 align:middle line:84%
But a long Jupiter,
a long index,

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.980 align:middle line:84%
will know how to get
things done in the world.

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:50.152 align:middle line:90%
They won't shy away from it.

00:27:50.152 --> 00:27:51.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:52.610 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: Yeah,
they're confident.

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:54.395 align:middle line:84%
It's another sign
of being confident.

00:27:54.395 --> 00:27:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Mine
are almost equal,

00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:58.250 align:middle line:84%
but just slightly
longer index finger.

00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:01.162 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: 99% of the time,
one finger will be just a tad--

00:28:01.162 --> 00:28:02.120 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: A tad, yeah.

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:03.037 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: --even a--

00:28:03.037 --> 00:28:03.950 align:middle line:90%
and that's important.

00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:05.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, what
about that middle finger,

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.520 align:middle line:90%
which we won't do a gesture?

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:07.540 align:middle line:90%
But let's talk about the--

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:07.930 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: [LAUGHS]

00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:09.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's talk
about the middle finger.

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.770 align:middle line:10%
>> MAHABAL: The middle finger
has everything to do with

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:13.270 align:middle line:10%
the planet of Saturn.

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:17.080 align:middle line:10%
So if you see the
normal, if you will,

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:20.470 align:middle line:10%
length of the Saturn
finger, it shows

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:25.420 align:middle line:10%
a person is into rules,
and morals, and standards,

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:26.860 align:middle line:10%
and ethics.

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:29.980 align:middle line:10%
They don't like
chaos in society.

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:32.170 align:middle line:10%
And you'll find
that people who--

00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:33.790 align:middle line:10%
and I'm not going to be PC here.

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:36.790 align:middle line:10%
People who are in prison, people
who are criminals, people who

00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:39.190 align:middle line:10%
do a lot of
nefarious activities,

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:43.700 align:middle line:10%
they'll have a noticeably
shorter Saturn finger--

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:44.500 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Wow.

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:47.300 align:middle line:10%
>> MAHABAL: --because
rules don't apply to me.

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:48.100 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:49.517 align:middle line:10%
>> MAHABAL: That's
what they feel.

00:28:49.517 --> 00:28:52.480 align:middle line:10%
In other words, someone
who has the standard length

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:56.140 align:middle line:10%
of this finger will
feel, hey, I want to be

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:58.210 align:middle line:10%
an integral part of society.

00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:01.610 align:middle line:84%
I believe in ethics,
morals, that kind of thing.

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:08.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, sometimes you'll see, this
finger is actually as short as--

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:09.990 align:middle line:84%
it's to a brother
and sister here.

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:10.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wow.

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:12.693 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: And when
you see that, again--

00:29:12.693 --> 00:29:13.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Be careful.

00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:14.990 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Yeah.

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:18.920 align:middle line:84%
It's someone who
really has difficulty

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:22.443 align:middle line:90%
with becoming part of society.

00:29:22.443 --> 00:29:23.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:24.193 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: And why?

00:29:24.193 --> 00:29:29.540 align:middle line:84%
Because they're behind
on their ability

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:32.740 align:middle line:84%
to judge themselves by the
idea of ethics, and standards--

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right, right.

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: --and
morals, like that.

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's fasci--
well, all of it's fascinating.

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:38.320 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.460 align:middle line:84%
So then what about
right versus left hand?

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:42.890 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're
reading somebody,

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:45.350 align:middle line:84%
you choose normally
a dominant hand.

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:46.440 align:middle line:90%
Or how do you do it?

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:47.993 align:middle line:84%
You don't read
both hands, do you?

00:29:47.993 --> 00:29:49.535 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: You must
read both hands.

00:29:49.535 --> 00:29:50.335 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:29:50.335 --> 00:29:52.582 align:middle line:90%
So there's not one that is--

00:29:52.582 --> 00:29:53.540 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Our right--

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:55.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --more
powerful than the other?

00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:56.587 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: They're
both powerful.

00:29:56.587 --> 00:30:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Our right hand is ruled by
the left brain and vice versa.

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:02.980 align:middle line:84%
So I look to the
right hand to look

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:08.890 align:middle line:84%
at what a person should be doing
in life, what their career is,

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:14.140 align:middle line:84%
how other people see them, their
influence and impact on society,

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:17.210 align:middle line:84%
how they get their way in
the world, their approach.

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:19.660 align:middle line:90%
So it's like Western astrology.

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:20.860 align:middle line:90%
It's the sun.

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And their left
hand deals with who

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:26.290 align:middle line:90%
we are when we're by ourselves.

00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:27.520 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:32.090 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: The left hand deals
with one's internal aspects.

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:36.680 align:middle line:84%
So yes, we can look at it as
in this is one's emotions.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:38.840 align:middle line:90%
This is one's spirituality.

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:42.070 align:middle line:84%
It's commonly-- I've
heard many times that,

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:44.473 align:middle line:84%
oh, you look at the
left hand of a woman

00:30:44.473 --> 00:30:45.640 align:middle line:90%
and the right hand of a man.

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:46.390 align:middle line:90%
It's not true--

00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:46.720 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.610 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: Because you're
only looking at one brain--

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:48.955 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:48.955 --> 00:30:50.163 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: --if you do that.

00:30:50.163 --> 00:30:51.435 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:30:51.435 --> 00:30:53.560 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: But these are
the two brains basically,

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:54.770 align:middle line:90%
the left and the right brain.

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:55.990 align:middle line:90%
So both must be read.

00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:59.200 align:middle line:84%
But basically, the right
hand is the outer self,

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.310 align:middle line:84%
and the left hand
is the inner self.

00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:06.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, having said that, 15% of
the population are left-handed.

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:07.860 align:middle line:90%
So what does that mean?

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:11.480 align:middle line:84%
It means that because the
left hand has everything

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:14.120 align:middle line:84%
to do with listening
to the subconscious,

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:15.770 align:middle line:84%
it has everything
to do with listening

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:20.000 align:middle line:84%
to one's intuition, the still
small voice within, if you will,

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.420 align:middle line:84%
then left-handers tend to listen
to their intuition immediately.

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:28.040 align:middle line:90%
And they don't question it.

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:33.040 align:middle line:84%
Right-handers also
have an intuition

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:35.740 align:middle line:84%
that can be fairly
strong, but right-handers

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:36.580 align:middle line:90%
tend to question it.

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:37.895 align:middle line:84%
They put it through
the wringer of logic--

00:31:37.895 --> 00:31:38.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Filter the mind.

00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:38.770 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: --and reason--

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:39.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:39.520 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: --you see.

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:40.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:40.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:41.600 align:middle line:90%
Now this is interesting.

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.122 align:middle line:84%
So we were talking--
before we started taping,

00:31:44.122 --> 00:31:46.330 align:middle line:84%
we were talking about the
differences between Western

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:47.810 align:middle line:90%
and Vedic astrology.

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:49.450 align:middle line:84%
So it seems to me
that would almost

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:51.970 align:middle line:84%
mimic what you're talking
about in the right hand

00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:57.190 align:middle line:84%
or the dominant hand that's
ruled by the left brain.

00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:00.610 align:middle line:84%
Would that be more Western
astrology, the external?

00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:02.110 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of what I was--

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:02.282 align:middle line:90%
in conversation.

00:32:02.282 --> 00:32:03.082 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Yeah.

00:32:03.082 --> 00:32:03.882 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:32:03.882 --> 00:32:06.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And Vedic might be
more the left hand and the--

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:06.745 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Absolutely.

00:32:06.745 --> 00:32:07.180 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --inner?

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:08.990 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: I agree
with your theory, yes.

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:09.790 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:10.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:11.920 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: That's
why left-handers,

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:14.950 align:middle line:84%
they listen to their gut
feelings and their instincts.

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And they break the rules
many times, like Beethoven.

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:20.200 align:middle line:90%
He broke the rules.

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:24.160 align:middle line:84%
Someone like Jimi Hendrix, he
was a maverick in what he did.

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Many left-handers listen
to their intuition

00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:29.810 align:middle line:84%
and their instincts, and
they don't question it.

00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:32.575 align:middle line:90%
That's why they're pioneers.

00:32:32.575 --> 00:32:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Right-handers have
that too, but they

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:41.520 align:middle line:84%
go through a lot of internal
cogitation before it.

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:42.320 align:middle line:90%
Should I do it?

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:42.980 align:middle line:90%
Should I not do it?

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:43.490 align:middle line:90%
Should I do it?

00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:44.200 align:middle line:90%
Should I not do it?

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.005 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: Before they actually
decide to become a breakthrough

00:32:48.005 --> 00:32:48.805 align:middle line:90%
artist.

00:32:48.805 --> 00:32:49.605 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:32:49.605 --> 00:32:53.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And speaking of art,
what's interesting about that is

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:54.800 align:middle line:84%
for people who went
to art school--

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:57.730 align:middle line:84%
I did a little bit
of that, but there's

00:32:57.730 --> 00:32:59.800 align:middle line:84%
drawing with the right
side of the brain or the--

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.383 align:middle line:84%
I think it's called drawing the
right side of the brain, where

00:33:02.383 --> 00:33:04.420 align:middle line:84%
you have to use your
non-dominant hand to draw.

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:08.140 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, people found
that they were more talented

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:11.170 align:middle line:90%
in their non-dominant hand.

00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:14.330 align:middle line:84%
The classic was you had to
sketch one hand with the other.

00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:16.010 align:middle line:90%
And with me, I was shocked.

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:17.590 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't believe
how accurate it

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:21.110 align:middle line:84%
was drawing with the hand I
can hardly hold a pencil in.

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:22.580 align:middle line:90%
So what is that telling us?

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:27.520 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: Well, take your
hands and put them together.

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And notice which
thumb is on top.

00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:31.510 align:middle line:90%
Is it the right or the left?

00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:31.960 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Left.

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:32.760 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: OK.

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:33.950 align:middle line:90%
Now reverse that.

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:35.383 align:middle line:90%
Does it feel uncomfortable?

00:33:35.383 --> 00:33:37.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, it
doesn't feel normal.

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: It feels
uncomfortable, does it?

00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:38.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.290 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Now reverse it.

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:39.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, that's good.

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: Feels
comfortable now, right?

00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:41.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:43.950 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: So the
thumb that's on top,

00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:48.690 align:middle line:84%
either the right or the
left, is the dominant hand.

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:50.490 align:middle line:90%
It's the hand of--

00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:55.110 align:middle line:84%
it shows which brain you favor
when you go to make a decision.

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:58.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's interesting
because we were also talking how

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:00.480 align:middle line:84%
people often, if they
know both charts,

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:03.730 align:middle line:84%
align more with the Western or
more with the Vedic astrology

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:04.530 align:middle line:90%
chart.

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:07.830 align:middle line:84%
So if your finger's on
top from the left side,

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:10.860 align:middle line:84%
that might be interesting
because you might relate more

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:12.795 align:middle line:90%
to your Vedic chart, right?

00:34:12.795 --> 00:34:14.170 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: I like
that thinking.

00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:14.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, it's just--

00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:15.030 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm just--

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: Regina,
I like that thinking.

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:16.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --trying to
put pieces together here--

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:17.055 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Yeah, no.

00:34:17.055 --> 00:34:17.400 align:middle line:90%
I completely--

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --because a lot
of people are into astrology.

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:19.949 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: I have
to agree, yeah.

00:34:19.949 --> 00:34:21.101 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:34:21.101 --> 00:34:25.080 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: If you put your--
if your right thumb feels more

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:26.969 align:middle line:84%
comfortable on top
of your left thumb,

00:34:26.969 --> 00:34:30.090 align:middle line:84%
you tend to be a person
who-- immediately,

00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:34.179 align:middle line:84%
whatever happens to you, you're
using your brain of logic,

00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:36.510 align:middle line:84%
reason, analyzation,
and calculation.

00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:38.250 align:middle line:90%
If your left hand goes--

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:41.219 align:middle line:84%
if your left thumb feels more
comfortable above your right

00:34:41.219 --> 00:34:42.810 align:middle line:90%
thumb, it's the opposite.

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:45.400 align:middle line:84%
You tend to go with
your gut feelings.

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:46.780 align:middle line:90%
You tend to take risks.

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:50.139 align:middle line:84%
You tend to listen to
your subconscious more.

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:51.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:51.820 align:middle line:90%
That's accurate.

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:54.400 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: And so, again,
that would be the more Eastern

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:55.360 align:middle line:90%
aspect.

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:58.460 align:middle line:90%
That would be-- and vice versa.

00:34:58.460 --> 00:34:59.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:00.500 align:middle line:90%
That makes total sense.

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:01.300 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Yeah.

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:03.817 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So can you
tell certain people--

00:35:03.817 --> 00:35:04.900 align:middle line:90%
you've written about this.

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:07.630 align:middle line:84%
If someone is possessed, for
example, where it's not really

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:10.060 align:middle line:84%
them showing up, there's
something else influencing them,

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:11.700 align:middle line:84%
can you tell that
in their hands?

00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:12.700 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Immediately.

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What's
that look like?

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:16.870 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: You actually see--

00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:21.610 align:middle line:84%
in the Moon Area, which is
the emotional area, which

00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:23.950 align:middle line:84%
has everything to do
with the subconscious

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:25.630 align:middle line:84%
and the metaphysical
aspects, you

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:32.290 align:middle line:84%
see this area look
cloudy, kind of whitish,

00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:34.670 align:middle line:84%
looks like someone rubbed
a bunch of Comet on it.

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:35.470 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh.

00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: And if you're
talking about actually ghostly

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:38.410 align:middle line:90%
possession or--

00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:39.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:40.120 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: That's
what it looks like.

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:41.080 align:middle line:90%
It's splotchy.

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:42.130 align:middle line:90%
It's whitish.

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:43.880 align:middle line:90%
It's in this area.

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:44.680 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:45.480 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Yes.

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:48.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Conversely,
if someone comes in very

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:50.420 align:middle line:84%
well-advanced already,
they're here for a purpose,

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:53.210 align:middle line:84%
they know it from a young age,
can you see that fairly quickly

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:54.010 align:middle line:90%
in a palm too?

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:54.505 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Absolutely.

00:35:54.505 --> 00:35:55.305 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:35:55.305 --> 00:35:58.690 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: You will be
able to tell because really,

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:03.610 align:middle line:84%
that's what the purpose of
our human form of life is,

00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:06.610 align:middle line:90%
self-realization.

00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:10.480 align:middle line:84%
In my view, the goal of
our human form of life

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:14.830 align:middle line:84%
is advancement of
consciousness, to move forward

00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:20.950 align:middle line:84%
our consciousness with love,
and humility, and tolerance,

00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:23.360 align:middle line:84%
to get away from lust,
and greed, and anger.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: For instance,
as Jesus said once,

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:31.480 align:middle line:84%
live in this world,
but don't be of it.

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.850 align:middle line:84%
The happiest people
I've ever met

00:36:33.850 --> 00:36:39.850 align:middle line:84%
are those who even have a
lot of material success,

00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:42.610 align:middle line:84%
but they're a little
bit detached from it.

00:36:42.610 --> 00:36:48.380 align:middle line:84%
They're aware, hey, this is
not the aspect of my happiness.

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And this is the problem
with Western culture.

00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:52.300 align:middle line:90%
I love Western culture.

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:53.240 align:middle line:90%
I grew up in it.

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:57.850 align:middle line:84%
It's who I am, but I have seen,
going to the Eastern world,

00:36:57.850 --> 00:37:03.280 align:middle line:84%
that people are a lot
more happier because they

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:07.820 align:middle line:84%
don't get caught up in
sensual gratification.

00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:10.810 align:middle line:84%
They know that their happiness
comes from within and devotion

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:13.390 align:middle line:84%
to God rather than, how
much sex can I have?

00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:15.830 align:middle line:84%
How much-- how many
Maseratis can I buy?

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:16.705 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's true.

00:37:16.705 --> 00:37:16.900 align:middle line:90%
I remember--

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:18.520 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: How many palms
in Beverly Hills can I have?

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:19.375 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:19.375 --> 00:37:21.490 align:middle line:84%
I remember arriving in
India, and I was just

00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:24.250 align:middle line:84%
shocked at the, first of
all, the joy of the children,

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:27.040 align:middle line:84%
even in impoverished
regions, just curious.

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And the people, looking
each other in the eye,

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:30.850 align:middle line:84%
looking at you,
curious about you,

00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:33.460 align:middle line:84%
and the kids playing,
and just making

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:34.780 align:middle line:90%
the best of whatever they had.

00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:37.990 align:middle line:84%
It was just a more
expressive joyful life

00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:40.450 align:middle line:84%
that they were living
compared to kids here,

00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:41.800 align:middle line:90%
where-- stranger danger.

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:43.710 align:middle line:90%
Don't look at that person.

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:47.095 align:middle line:84%
Being taught to fear
right out of the chute.

00:37:47.095 --> 00:37:49.030 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: It's a
more social society.

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:49.915 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:37:49.915 --> 00:37:52.280 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: And they're
not fearful of each other.

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:56.320 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in India, you can
actually knock on someone's door

00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.390 align:middle line:84%
and say, I'm hungry, can
you give me some food?

00:37:58.390 --> 00:37:59.260 align:middle line:90%
It's their culture.

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:00.280 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:00.790 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: They're a--

00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:01.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Beautiful.

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:02.830 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL:
--polychronic society.

00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:04.300 align:middle line:90%
We're a monochronic society.

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:08.410 align:middle line:84%
So everything is done
in a societal way.

00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:09.700 align:middle line:90%
And they protect each other.

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:09.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:11.980 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: And you'll see that
very much in their villages--

00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:12.310 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:13.300 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: --and
their provinces.

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I found it beautiful.

00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:16.052 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: Yeah, it's
extremely beautiful.

00:38:16.052 --> 00:38:17.725 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So now
here we have an area--

00:38:17.725 --> 00:38:17.980 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: I mean--

00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:18.850 align:middle line:90%
Can I just say right quick?

00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:19.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.833 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: Sometimes,
you'll just sit down,

00:38:20.833 --> 00:38:22.120 align:middle line:90%
giving a reading to someone.

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:26.560 align:middle line:10%
And in the Western world,
people will look at it,

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:29.680 align:middle line:10%
will look at what you're doing
and be somewhat intrigued, and--

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:31.510 align:middle line:10%
oh, can I have your card?

00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:32.455 align:middle line:90%
If they're interested.

00:38:32.455 --> 00:38:33.330 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: [CHUCKLES]

00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:35.920 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: And they'll walk
away, and people look at it.

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:38.540 align:middle line:90%
What's this guy doing?

00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:42.580 align:middle line:10%
You do that in India, or
Kuala Lumpur, or Malaysia,

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:44.710 align:middle line:10%
and everybody just comes to you.

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:45.510 align:middle line:90%
I want a reading.

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:46.890 align:middle line:90%
They just line up.

00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:48.810 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:51.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You just triggered
a memory in India where my son

00:38:51.450 --> 00:38:53.310 align:middle line:90%
went to get his beard cut.

00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:55.890 align:middle line:84%
We were both there at the
same time and with a group.

00:38:55.890 --> 00:38:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And so they said, well, this
man does straight razor cuts.

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:01.360 align:middle line:90%
So he asked him what he wanted.

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, you
just do what you want.

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:05.180 align:middle line:84%
So he gave him what
was called a Frenchie.

00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And halfway through, after
he was done with that,

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:09.540 align:middle line:90%
people were lining up to watch.

00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:11.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, his friends were
all around and crowding in.

00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, he
lifted my son's arm up

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:15.570 align:middle line:90%
to shave his armpits.

00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And he said, what's
going on here?

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:20.602 align:middle line:90%
There was a crowd around them.

00:39:20.602 --> 00:39:22.560 align:middle line:84%
They were so curious
about what they were going

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:24.450 align:middle line:90%
to make of this man's face.

00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:25.860 align:middle line:90%
It was so sweet.

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:26.682 align:middle line:90%
I loved it.

00:39:26.682 --> 00:39:27.890 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: No, it's amazing.

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:28.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is.

00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:30.350 align:middle line:90%
So-- not afraid of each other.

00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:31.150 align:middle line:90%
That's the thing.

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:34.770 align:middle line:84%
So here's something I want to
get into before we say goodbye,

00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:39.660 align:middle line:84%
and that is, 1959 to '99,
you say palms changed?

00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:43.370 align:middle line:90%


00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:45.080 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Yes.

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:47.075 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What happened?

00:39:47.075 --> 00:39:49.535 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Well, it's a--

00:39:49.535 --> 00:39:51.150 align:middle line:84%
it became a
different generation.

00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:51.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:55.370 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: You see,
from 1959 was, let's say,

00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:57.030 align:middle line:84%
the end of the
silent generation.

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:57.830 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:39:57.830 --> 00:39:59.730 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: They were the
kids of the silent generation,

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:00.530 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:08.280 align:middle line:84%
So that was a generation that,
in their way, changed the world,

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:09.080 align:middle line:90%
you see.

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:12.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And after
'59, what happened--

00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:13.815 align:middle line:84%
how did our hands
essentially change?

00:40:13.815 --> 00:40:16.190 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: Well, we're in
the Age of Aquarius right now.

00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:16.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:20.600 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: And I believe it
started in August of 1999.

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:22.448 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Tell us why.

00:40:22.448 --> 00:40:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: Well, this is
what I see on people's hands.

00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe we're
in the golden age.

00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:28.530 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not trying to
be Pollyanna about it.

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:31.940 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, we know there's
some bumps getting there,

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:32.300 align:middle line:90%
but we are--

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:32.660 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: There are a lot--

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:33.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I agree with you.

00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:33.720 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: --bumps
getting there.

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:34.520 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I agree.

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:37.115 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: But I do
absolutely believe in--

00:40:37.115 --> 00:40:41.040 align:middle line:84%
at around the years
of '29, '30, '31,

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:43.600 align:middle line:84%
we're going to
have a Renaissance.

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:47.170 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, I
think the religions,

00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:49.135 align:middle line:84%
the Judeo-Christian
kind of religions,

00:40:49.135 --> 00:40:51.010 align:middle line:84%
they're going to go the
way of the dinosaurs.

00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:53.650 align:middle line:84%
They'll still be around,
but they won't be as strong.

00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:58.990 align:middle line:84%
What I am seeing is around
'29, '30, '31, is the beginning

00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:01.630 align:middle line:90%
of a Renaissance of this--

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:05.420 align:middle line:84%
what we see-- the new age world,
the mind, body, spirit world.

00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:10.300 align:middle line:84%
This generation is going to
embrace it as they are already.

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:16.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing 14, 15-year-old kids,
men and women, boys and girls.

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:20.030 align:middle line:84%
They're actually embracing--
they're at the Barnes and Noble,

00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:20.830 align:middle line:90%
looking at--

00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:21.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:22.450 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: --the psychic books.

00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:23.380 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, it's wonderful.

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: And so
that's the generation.

00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:27.760 align:middle line:84%
When they become in
their 30s and 35,

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:31.810 align:middle line:84%
they're going to get
into what Gaia is about,

00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:33.910 align:middle line:84%
the metaphysical world,
the spiritual world,

00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:36.991 align:middle line:90%
like going internal.

00:41:36.991 --> 00:41:41.020 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be a completely
different generation.

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's the Renaissance
of a new golden age.

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:50.540 align:middle line:84%
This is actually predicted
in the Vedic view also.

00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:52.760 align:middle line:84%
There's a book called the
"Srimad Bhagavatam," which

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:56.390 align:middle line:84%
explains that we're in
an age called Kali Yuga,

00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:57.900 align:middle line:84%
which is a very,
very difficult age.

00:41:57.900 --> 00:41:58.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:01.910 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: But in this age,
there's also what we call

00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:06.440 align:middle line:84%
a Dhanya Yuga, a spiritual
revolution within this very

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:08.360 align:middle line:90%
difficult, dark age.

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:12.104 align:middle line:84%
And we're in it now,
for those who can--

00:42:12.104 --> 00:42:15.712 align:middle line:84%
who are aware of it
and can perceive it.

00:42:15.712 --> 00:42:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, I think most
people watching this can feel

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:19.160 align:middle line:90%
the truth in that.

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:21.380 align:middle line:90%
I certainly agree with you.

00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:23.270 align:middle line:84%
Everything in me
feels we're going

00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:26.580 align:middle line:84%
to a much more refined
place as a species.

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:28.108 align:middle line:84%
But there are bumps
getting there,

00:42:28.108 --> 00:42:30.650 align:middle line:84%
and we're having to do it with
a certain amount of resistance

00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:33.357 align:middle line:84%
in the, as you say,
in the Kali Yuga.

00:42:33.357 --> 00:42:34.190 align:middle line:90%
But we'll get there.

00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: Well, look at what
happened in the Renaissance

00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:36.373 align:middle line:90%
of 500 years ago.

00:42:36.373 --> 00:42:37.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:42:37.290 --> 00:42:37.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:38.630 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: There
was much resistance.

00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:40.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
much resistance.

00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:42.650 align:middle line:84%
So one quick question
before we say goodbye,

00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:45.320 align:middle line:84%
and that is, how do people
find-- you can-- there's

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:46.700 align:middle line:84%
only so much of
you to go around.

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:49.910 align:middle line:84%
How do people find a
good, qualified palmist?

00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:51.200 align:middle line:90%
How do they connect with one?

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:52.533 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: I love the question.

00:42:52.533 --> 00:42:54.260 align:middle line:90%
Look at what that person--

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:58.595 align:middle line:84%
in any regards, palmistry,
astrology, numerology,

00:42:58.595 --> 00:43:02.060 align:middle line:84%
look at that person and ask
their peers or their brethren,

00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:05.384 align:middle line:90%
what have they accomplished?

00:43:05.384 --> 00:43:07.985 align:middle line:84%
What contributions
have they made?

00:43:07.985 --> 00:43:08.810 align:middle line:90%
Read their books.

00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:09.980 align:middle line:90%
Look at their lectures.

00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:14.205 align:middle line:84%
See what they are bringing
to the table in their world.

00:43:14.205 --> 00:43:15.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So really,
do your research.

00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:16.260 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Do your research.

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:17.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Don't just go off
a Yelp review, by the way.

00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:18.470 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Exactly.

00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:19.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Do your research.

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:19.940 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: [LAUGHS] Yes.

00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:20.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.080 align:middle line:84%
I have one more
to throw at you--

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:21.260 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Exactly.

00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:22.343 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --before we go.

00:43:22.343 --> 00:43:25.340 align:middle line:84%
What's it mean when you've cut
off three fingers on one hand

00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:27.260 align:middle line:90%
at the top?

00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:29.150 align:middle line:84%
I've cut off-- this
is still-- well,

00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:30.500 align:middle line:90%
they didn't sew that one on.

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:33.000 align:middle line:84%
This palm-- this one,
the pad was cut off.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:33.800 align:middle line:90%
They sewed it on.

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:35.220 align:middle line:90%
The whole finger was cut off.

00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:36.650 align:middle line:90%
They reattached it.

00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:38.600 align:middle line:84%
So what's that mean
if you've traumatized

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:40.670 align:middle line:90%
three fingers on one--

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:41.500 align:middle line:90%
your dominant hand?

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:42.300 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:44.150 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: [CHUCKLES] That's--

00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:46.735 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I don't even know
if you can answer that, but--

00:43:46.735 --> 00:43:48.110 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: I will
say to people,

00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:52.518 align:middle line:84%
if you're working a job and you
keep getting cut in the same

00:43:52.518 --> 00:43:54.560 align:middle line:84%
area because it's your
job, don't worry about it.

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, this
is all different stuff.

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:56.680 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Yeah.

00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:00.860 align:middle line:84%
But if you're-- if there's--
if you get cut in a certain

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:04.100 align:middle line:84%
particular area and
it doesn't heal,

00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:06.390 align:middle line:84%
and there's no reason
for it not to heal,

00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:10.980 align:middle line:84%
so then there's a psychological
or an emotional aspect to that

00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:11.780 align:middle line:90%
that's buried--

00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:12.050 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So it's very--

00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:12.755 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: --one's
subconsciousness.

00:44:12.755 --> 00:44:13.050 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --very personal to
each finger, and each wound--

00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:15.770 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Exactly.

00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --and how it
heals, and everything.

00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.780 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Exactly.

00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:18.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I just
think it's funny.

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:20.857 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: What I would tell
you is that it has something

00:44:20.857 --> 00:44:24.530 align:middle line:84%
to do with, please don't
question your instincts.

00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:25.505 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:44:25.505 --> 00:44:27.225 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: That's what I--

00:44:27.225 --> 00:44:30.750 align:middle line:84%
by what you have just explained
to me, I'm going to say,

00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:38.160 align:middle line:84%
it's your consciousness
questioning your gut feelings.

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:39.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:42.030 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: Be confident
of your intuitions.

00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:44.515 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:44.515 --> 00:44:46.840 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: Don't go into--
when you get an intuition,

00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:48.500 align:middle line:90%
don't go into self-doubt mode.

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:49.300 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:50.440 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: Trust it more.

00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:53.217 align:middle line:84%
It's all about trusting
and having faith.

00:44:53.217 --> 00:44:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, I
did learn that one.

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.842 align:middle line:84%
But maybe I had to cut
these three off to get it.

00:44:56.842 --> 00:44:58.690 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS] Anyway.

00:44:58.690 --> 00:45:00.940 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: But psychologically,
that's what it means.

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:01.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:02.040 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:03.620 align:middle line:90%
Well, Vernon, thank you so much.

00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:05.330 align:middle line:90%
This has been so fascinating.

00:45:05.330 --> 00:45:06.830 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: Thank
you for having me.

00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:07.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:07.210 --> 00:45:07.750 align:middle line:90%
This is delightful.

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:08.410 align:middle line:84%
>> MAHABAL: It's
been a pleasure.

00:45:08.410 --> 00:45:10.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So I hope to see
you again down the road.

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:11.550 align:middle line:90%
>> MAHABAL: I would love that.

00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:14.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You can find Vernon's
