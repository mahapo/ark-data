[ Music ]

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.856 align:middle line:84%
Be prepared to go on a journey
beyond any you have known

00:00:21.856 --> 00:00:23.791 align:middle line:90%
with my guess Barbara Hand Clow.

00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:26.293 align:middle line:84%
You're going to learn about your
multi-dimensionality and how

00:00:26.293 --> 00:00:28.762 align:middle line:84%
to access all realms
of yourself,

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:31.465 align:middle line:84%
which takes us far beyond
the joy and challenges

00:00:31.465 --> 00:00:32.833 align:middle line:90%
of our everyday lives.

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:35.402 align:middle line:84%
Barbara has been a
beneficiary of off-world streams

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:37.438 align:middle line:90%
of information her entire life.

00:00:37.438 --> 00:00:39.507 align:middle line:84%
Her informants are
the Pleiadians.

00:00:39.507 --> 00:00:42.476 align:middle line:84%
The basis of this
conversation is her book Alchemy

00:00:42.476 --> 00:00:43.811 align:middle line:90%
of Nine Dimensions.

00:00:43.811 --> 00:00:46.480 align:middle line:84%
This will be a two-part
conversation that will all

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.150 align:middle line:84%
through the way you
view reality forever.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.486 align:middle line:84%
And Barbara, I just first let
me thank you for the decades

00:00:52.486 --> 00:00:58.159 align:middle line:84%
of just incredibly detailed and
scientific work you've done.

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:00.494 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
because as soon as you say,

00:01:00.494 --> 00:01:02.897 align:middle line:84%
Barbara is the recipient of
information from Pleiadians,

00:01:02.897 --> 00:01:05.533 align:middle line:84%
people that are accustomed
to this notion would say,

00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:06.834 align:middle line:90%
"Oh yeah, right, aha."

00:01:06.834 --> 00:01:09.036 align:middle line:84%
But you're probably one of
the most skeptical people

00:01:09.036 --> 00:01:13.741 align:middle line:84%
and scientifically based minds
that I have ever met yet,

00:01:13.741 --> 00:01:16.810 align:middle line:84%
thus probably why you are
the one selected to do this.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.347 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about your
beginning just we want

00:01:20.347 --> 00:01:23.250 align:middle line:84%
and your connection with the
Pleiadians, how this came about.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.753 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you for
inviting me, Regina.

00:01:25.753 --> 00:01:28.355 align:middle line:84%
And my connection with
the Pleiadians goes back

00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:30.724 align:middle line:84%
to when I was a really
small child.

00:01:30.724 --> 00:01:33.661 align:middle line:84%
My teacher was my
Cherokee grandfather,

00:01:33.661 --> 00:01:36.597 align:middle line:84%
half Cherokee grandfather,
half Celtic and half Cherokee,

00:01:36.597 --> 00:01:38.465 align:middle line:90%
and he was record keeper.

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:40.968 align:middle line:84%
And he selected me
to be the person

00:01:40.968 --> 00:01:43.571 align:middle line:84%
who would carry the
records on from him.

00:01:43.571 --> 00:01:45.239 align:middle line:84%
He didn't take one
of his five children.

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:47.241 align:middle line:84%
He took a granddaughter
because he knew

00:01:47.241 --> 00:01:50.211 align:middle line:84%
that the records would be
opening at a time in my life

00:01:50.211 --> 00:01:53.047 align:middle line:84%
when it was possible for
me to deliver the material.

00:01:53.047 --> 00:01:55.783 align:middle line:84%
My parent-- his children
would have all been too old

00:01:55.783 --> 00:01:57.084 align:middle line:90%
at this time.

00:01:57.084 --> 00:02:00.588 align:middle line:84%
So, he was my teacher and he
informed me when I was two

00:02:00.588 --> 00:02:02.590 align:middle line:84%
or three years old that
I had come to this planet

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.826 align:middle line:84%
from the Pleiades and of
course I believed him,

00:02:05.826 --> 00:02:08.262 align:middle line:84%
and it was all fine until I
went off to the first grade.

00:02:08.262 --> 00:02:09.263 align:middle line:90%
[laughter] And when they said--

00:02:09.263 --> 00:02:10.598 align:middle line:84%
One can only guess
where you're from.

00:02:10.598 --> 00:02:11.799 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and then, you know,

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:13.767 align:middle line:84%
you start the first grade
was where are you from.

00:02:13.767 --> 00:02:16.170 align:middle line:84%
[laughter] And let's just
say I started running

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.805 align:middle line:90%
into a lot of difficulty.

00:02:17.805 --> 00:02:21.709 align:middle line:84%
So, I was trained about my
grandfather from aged 3 to 17,

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.578 align:middle line:84%
so that part of my life
was like my secret life.

00:02:24.578 --> 00:02:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And that was my relationship
with my grandfather

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.985 align:middle line:84%
and my grandmother, but in
terms of everyday academics,

00:02:30.985 --> 00:02:35.689 align:middle line:84%
education, I was a good
student, NA student and I wanted

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:37.625 align:middle line:90%
to master my education.

00:02:37.625 --> 00:02:40.361 align:middle line:84%
And so I separated, I
divided my education

00:02:40.361 --> 00:02:45.599 align:middle line:84%
from my medicine training until
I was around 40 years old.

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.202 align:middle line:84%
And then when I got to
be 40, 42 years old,

00:02:48.202 --> 00:02:50.471 align:middle line:84%
I needed to integrate
all the education

00:02:50.471 --> 00:02:51.972 align:middle line:84%
that I had attained
'cause I went on and went

00:02:51.972 --> 00:02:54.775 align:middle line:84%
to graduate school and
everything like that.

00:02:54.775 --> 00:02:58.979 align:middle line:84%
And so, when I began to
integrate the information,

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:02.483 align:middle line:84%
then I went back to my
Cherokee heritage and went back

00:03:02.483 --> 00:03:04.451 align:middle line:90%
and became a medicine teacher.

00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:07.388 align:middle line:90%
And then eventually in 1995--

00:03:07.388 --> 00:03:10.624 align:middle line:84%
1994, the Pleiadians
really broke

00:03:10.624 --> 00:03:12.559 align:middle line:90%
through into my consciousness.

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:14.961 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to-- I want
to relate this to what you--

00:03:14.961 --> 00:03:17.231 align:middle line:84%
how you just kind of
introduced me here which is

00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:19.833 align:middle line:84%
that I'm a very scientific
and very left-brained.

00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:23.370 align:middle line:90%
So when this databank came to me

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.874 align:middle line:84%
from the Pleiades star system
'cause I got identified from LC

00:03:26.874 --> 00:03:30.577 align:middle line:84%
on the central star,
I really resisted it.

00:03:30.577 --> 00:03:31.945 align:middle line:84%
I have a really hard
time with it.

00:03:31.945 --> 00:03:34.882 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't the channel at the
time nor did I have any desire

00:03:34.882 --> 00:03:37.418 align:middle line:84%
to be a channel, I still
don't want to be a channel.

00:03:37.418 --> 00:03:40.054 align:middle line:84%
I want to be a totally
conscious state.

00:03:40.054 --> 00:03:42.856 align:middle line:84%
But I gave myself
over to the databank

00:03:42.856 --> 00:03:47.294 align:middle line:84%
for about nine months
followed 1994, 1995.

00:03:47.294 --> 00:03:49.296 align:middle line:84%
And I brought in
the whole databank

00:03:49.296 --> 00:03:53.100 align:middle line:84%
in 18 sessions just a hologram
which where tape recorded

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.137 align:middle line:84%
and then the information was
put on my computer for me

00:03:57.137 --> 00:03:59.340 align:middle line:84%
so that I could make
a book out of it.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And so, what I did with that
information was first of all,

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.413 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand, I probably
understood about 40 percent

00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:09.850 align:middle line:84%
of what I have received because
it involves nine dimensions.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.419 align:middle line:84%
And I understood the first
four dimensions quite well

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.022 align:middle line:84%
but I did not understand
the upper dimensions.

00:04:15.022 --> 00:04:17.124 align:middle line:90%
And so I made a pact to myself

00:04:17.124 --> 00:04:19.860 align:middle line:84%
that I would not change
a word which I did not.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.996 align:middle line:84%
Even if the scene that sane
to me, I still went ahead

00:04:22.996 --> 00:04:26.166 align:middle line:84%
and made it into a book
called The Pleiadian Agenda.

00:04:26.166 --> 00:04:29.136 align:middle line:84%
So there I was in
1995 with the databank

00:04:29.136 --> 00:04:32.439 align:middle line:84%
and I only understood 40
percent of it and my commitment

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:35.142 align:middle line:84%
in this lifetime, I was
already an author at that point,

00:04:35.142 --> 00:04:37.911 align:middle line:84%
had a couple of books and
print, and my commitment

00:04:37.911 --> 00:04:40.514 align:middle line:90%
in this lifetime has always been

00:04:40.514 --> 00:04:42.516 align:middle line:84%
to teach some material
that came to me.

00:04:42.516 --> 00:04:44.318 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't just going to
put in a book and park it.

00:04:44.318 --> 00:04:46.587 align:middle line:84%
I felt like it was
a responsibility.

00:04:46.587 --> 00:04:49.757 align:middle line:84%
So I went out on the
road to teach material

00:04:49.757 --> 00:04:51.925 align:middle line:84%
and I only understood
40 percent of it.

00:04:51.925 --> 00:04:55.429 align:middle line:84%
And it was real and my husband
Gerry came along with me.

00:04:55.429 --> 00:04:56.797 align:middle line:90%
Not in the very beginning.

00:04:56.797 --> 00:04:59.400 align:middle line:84%
I had a year of teaching
it on my own.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.568 align:middle line:84%
But I also was teaching
it on my own.

00:05:01.568 --> 00:05:03.437 align:middle line:84%
I had a lot of problems
with people going

00:05:03.437 --> 00:05:05.139 align:middle line:84%
out of balance while
I was teaching it,

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:07.508 align:middle line:84%
including finally a
person who fell over

00:05:07.508 --> 00:05:09.276 align:middle line:90%
and almost injured himself.

00:05:09.276 --> 00:05:12.379 align:middle line:84%
So at that point I brought Gerry
in 'cause Gerry is a body worker

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:15.049 align:middle line:84%
and I said, "Okay,
your body and I mind.

00:05:15.049 --> 00:05:17.117 align:middle line:84%
And I want to communicate
this material

00:05:17.117 --> 00:05:18.519 align:middle line:90%
but I need you with me."

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:21.655 align:middle line:84%
So at that point, Gerry and I,
we started teaching together,

00:05:21.655 --> 00:05:24.925 align:middle line:90%
'96 through about 2011.

00:05:24.925 --> 00:05:28.028 align:middle line:84%
And what we were doing was
always balancing people

00:05:28.028 --> 00:05:30.964 align:middle line:84%
physically while I
was working mentally.

00:05:30.964 --> 00:05:34.301 align:middle line:84%
And so, during that period of
time where this book comes from,

00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:37.438 align:middle line:84%
Alchemy of Nine Dimensions
is coming along

00:05:37.438 --> 00:05:41.208 align:middle line:84%
because after ten years of
teaching, a bunch of stuff

00:05:41.208 --> 00:05:44.711 align:middle line:84%
in the Pleiadian Agenda that
sounded completely crazy

00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:50.017 align:middle line:84%
and counteracted conventional
science started being verified

00:05:50.017 --> 00:05:51.351 align:middle line:90%
by scientists.

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:54.721 align:middle line:84%
And so by 2003, almost
every dimension,

00:05:54.721 --> 00:05:57.591 align:middle line:84%
every dimension except
one have been verified

00:05:57.591 --> 00:06:01.261 align:middle line:84%
by hardcore science, and of
course, I was so fascinated

00:06:01.261 --> 00:06:03.831 align:middle line:84%
with seeing these scientists
discovering what I had already

00:06:03.831 --> 00:06:05.065 align:middle line:90%
channeled in.

00:06:05.065 --> 00:06:07.234 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of scientists used
to come to my workshops.

00:06:07.234 --> 00:06:08.669 align:middle line:90%
And I can tell you a few jokes

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:11.104 align:middle line:84%
about that 'cause it got pretty
funny 'cause I'm not a scientist

00:06:11.104 --> 00:06:11.939 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:12.973 align:middle line:90%
Right. And when those came in,

00:06:12.973 --> 00:06:14.675 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand
quantum mechanics

00:06:14.675 --> 00:06:15.909 align:middle line:84%
and string theory
or any of that.

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:16.977 align:middle line:90%
Tell us one of the jokes.

00:06:16.977 --> 00:06:18.011 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Oh, one of the jokes?

00:06:18.011 --> 00:06:19.346 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:06:19.346 --> 00:06:23.150 align:middle line:84%
Oh, okay. In 1996 when I was
teaching a Pleiadian Agenda

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.120 align:middle line:84%
Activation, a marvelous
looking Russian scientist came

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.791 align:middle line:84%
to the workshop and he
had a burly large beard

00:06:30.791 --> 00:06:34.261 align:middle line:84%
and he had wild hair and
he came up to the table

00:06:34.261 --> 00:06:39.199 align:middle line:84%
where I was signing books and
he said-- he said-- he just--

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:42.803 align:middle line:84%
well, he just looked at me with
his intense eyes and he said,

00:06:42.803 --> 00:06:46.640 align:middle line:90%
"Everything is consciousness."

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.442 align:middle line:84%
And I thought he was
trying to pick me up.

00:06:48.442 --> 00:06:51.011 align:middle line:84%
[laughter] I mean, I
didn't even understand.

00:06:51.011 --> 00:06:54.014 align:middle line:84%
I mean I was teaching the
codes to consciousness

00:06:54.014 --> 00:06:55.482 align:middle line:84%
from the scientific
point of view.

00:06:55.482 --> 00:06:58.418 align:middle line:84%
Right. This guy gets a hold
of the book and realizes

00:06:58.418 --> 00:07:01.321 align:middle line:84%
that I understand the
consciousness he thinks,

00:07:01.321 --> 00:07:02.456 align:middle line:90%
but of course I don't.

00:07:02.456 --> 00:07:04.558 align:middle line:84%
Right. And I thought he
was trying to pick me up

00:07:04.558 --> 00:07:05.926 align:middle line:90%
and that's how it was.

00:07:05.926 --> 00:07:09.263 align:middle line:84%
It was completely insane the
first couple of years to this.

00:07:09.263 --> 00:07:12.099 align:middle line:84%
Well, and even if you only
understood 40 percent,

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:14.635 align:middle line:84%
that's probably 2,000
percent more

00:07:14.635 --> 00:07:17.237 align:middle line:84%
than anybody you were speaking
to understood at that time.

00:07:17.237 --> 00:07:18.505 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. And so the integration,

00:07:18.505 --> 00:07:20.240 align:middle line:84%
you were saying it was
holographic-- Yeah.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.642 align:middle line:90%
-- when you first received it.

00:07:21.642 --> 00:07:25.445 align:middle line:84%
But then did it start streaming
in in literal words and phrases

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:27.481 align:middle line:84%
and you said you didn't
want to alter a thing.

00:07:27.481 --> 00:07:28.549 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I didn't alter a word.

00:07:28.549 --> 00:07:30.150 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. So ultimately,
it did come in words

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.253 align:middle line:84%
because I was wondering how in
the world would you even be able

00:07:33.253 --> 00:07:35.122 align:middle line:84%
to put language around
what you were seeing

00:07:35.122 --> 00:07:36.256 align:middle line:90%
in those upper dimensions.

00:07:36.256 --> 00:07:37.958 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Well, the way I did it was

00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.494 align:middle line:84%
that what was coming
in was a hologram.

00:07:40.494 --> 00:07:42.462 align:middle line:84%
And as I've described
in the beginning

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:44.798 align:middle line:84%
of the Pleiadian
Agenda and Alchemy also,

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:48.235 align:middle line:84%
I could see the hologram and
I could see where extended--

00:07:48.235 --> 00:07:50.137 align:middle line:90%
areas it extended into.

00:07:50.137 --> 00:07:52.306 align:middle line:90%
But the nine dimensional aspects

00:07:52.306 --> 00:07:55.342 align:middle line:84%
of it are the way the
material came out through

00:07:55.342 --> 00:07:58.712 align:middle line:84%
in nine-dimensional
lens from a hologram.

00:07:58.712 --> 00:08:01.582 align:middle line:84%
Okay, and then I only understood
the first four dimensions

00:08:01.582 --> 00:08:03.383 align:middle line:90%
and not the upper five.

00:08:03.383 --> 00:08:05.252 align:middle line:84%
But the way we brought
that information

00:08:05.252 --> 00:08:08.322 align:middle line:84%
in is we had a channeled
group and the people who were

00:08:08.322 --> 00:08:11.959 align:middle line:84%
in the group were scientists
who were able to pick my brain.

00:08:11.959 --> 00:08:13.327 align:middle line:90%
So I did-- Interesting, yeah.

00:08:13.327 --> 00:08:15.996 align:middle line:84%
They could pick my brain and
pull it out from the Pleiadians

00:08:15.996 --> 00:08:17.931 align:middle line:84%
but of course I didn't
understand it at all.

00:08:17.931 --> 00:08:22.269 align:middle line:84%
Right. But by 2003, 2004, I
finally mastered the material.

00:08:22.269 --> 00:08:24.838 align:middle line:84%
And it was actually
fascinating the way that worked

00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:28.075 align:middle line:84%
out because people would come
to my classes and I could tell

00:08:28.075 --> 00:08:31.011 align:middle line:84%
that they understood my
databank but I didn't.

00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:33.347 align:middle line:84%
And so I just simply
would say to people,

00:08:33.347 --> 00:08:34.681 align:middle line:90%
"Okay, you understand this.

00:08:34.681 --> 00:08:35.983 align:middle line:90%
Explain it to us."

00:08:35.983 --> 00:08:38.585 align:middle line:84%
And so, we were getting
students to tell us,

00:08:38.585 --> 00:08:41.088 align:middle line:84%
businesses were telling
us, suffice were coming

00:08:41.088 --> 00:08:44.358 align:middle line:84%
to my classes because
they understood the upper

00:08:44.358 --> 00:08:45.659 align:middle line:90%
five dimensions.

00:08:45.659 --> 00:08:47.628 align:middle line:90%
I understood the lower four.

00:08:47.628 --> 00:08:49.329 align:middle line:84%
They would come to
my classes in order

00:08:49.329 --> 00:08:50.964 align:middle line:90%
to learn about the lower four.

00:08:50.964 --> 00:08:53.266 align:middle line:84%
And so then I would say,
"Fine, we have a bargain here.

00:08:53.266 --> 00:08:56.503 align:middle line:84%
I'll teach you about the lower
four but I want you to teach us

00:08:56.503 --> 00:08:57.704 align:middle line:90%
about the higher five."

00:08:57.704 --> 00:09:01.174 align:middle line:84%
So gradually, I've pulled
in the data that way.

00:09:01.174 --> 00:09:04.878 align:middle line:84%
And the information when you
were first being contacted

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:06.947 align:middle line:84%
as I was understanding
in your book,

00:09:06.947 --> 00:09:09.983 align:middle line:84%
you started having sensations
such as what is known

00:09:09.983 --> 00:09:13.520 align:middle line:84%
as tinnitus and also you
started seeing geometrical forms

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:14.921 align:middle line:84%
which we'll get into
a little bit later

00:09:14.921 --> 00:09:17.924 align:middle line:84%
in our second conversation and
their overlay and relationship

00:09:17.924 --> 00:09:19.593 align:middle line:84%
to your writing and
graph circles

00:09:19.593 --> 00:09:20.727 align:middle line:90%
which I found fascinating.

00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:21.962 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, just fascinating.

00:09:21.962 --> 00:09:23.397 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk a little
about that first connection

00:09:23.397 --> 00:09:26.466 align:middle line:84%
with the tinnitus and
the symbols and such.

00:09:26.466 --> 00:09:29.670 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. When the databank
was coming in,

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:33.340 align:middle line:84%
a friend of mine had an aneurism
and I had to be at the hospital

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.442 align:middle line:84%
with her like three
or four days a week

00:09:35.442 --> 00:09:37.844 align:middle line:84%
and the hospital
was two hours away.

00:09:37.844 --> 00:09:41.181 align:middle line:84%
So as this databank is coming
in, I'm dealing with a friend

00:09:41.181 --> 00:09:43.250 align:middle line:84%
that has an aneurism
in the hospital

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:45.652 align:middle line:84%
and it was almost
impossible also being a mother

00:09:45.652 --> 00:09:47.554 align:middle line:84%
of four children and
working for Bear & Company.

00:09:47.554 --> 00:09:50.390 align:middle line:84%
It was pretty difficult to
find any time to bring it in.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:54.061 align:middle line:84%
So whenever too much time
went by like more five

00:09:54.061 --> 00:09:57.464 align:middle line:84%
or six days went by, they
would start ringing my ears

00:09:57.464 --> 00:10:00.233 align:middle line:84%
to the point where I absolutely
cannot hear anything except the

00:10:00.233 --> 00:10:02.469 align:middle line:84%
ear ringing and I think you've
probably experienced it.

00:10:02.469 --> 00:10:03.170 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely tinnitus.

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:04.271 align:middle line:90%
For 12 years, yes.

00:10:04.271 --> 00:10:06.840 align:middle line:84%
So yeah. The only way
that I could get rid

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.409 align:middle line:84%
of the ear ringing was to call
the channeling class together.

00:10:09.409 --> 00:10:11.278 align:middle line:84%
So then I called them all
up and say, "Come on over.

00:10:11.278 --> 00:10:13.013 align:middle line:84%
We need to bring in
another databank."

00:10:13.013 --> 00:10:15.615 align:middle line:84%
And then we bring in the
databank and then I'd be free

00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:17.984 align:middle line:84%
for four or five days and
it would start up again.

00:10:17.984 --> 00:10:21.221 align:middle line:84%
And that went on for, you
know, like six or seven months.

00:10:21.221 --> 00:10:24.758 align:middle line:84%
And also, an interesting
thing about that databank is

00:10:24.758 --> 00:10:27.027 align:middle line:84%
that I was pulling in
that databank exactly

00:10:27.027 --> 00:10:29.796 align:middle line:84%
when Edward Witten was
writing the calculations

00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:31.398 align:middle line:90%
for superstring theory.

00:10:31.398 --> 00:10:35.001 align:middle line:84%
Yes. And so this has turned
up to be a very important clue

00:10:35.001 --> 00:10:36.103 align:middle line:90%
to what's going on here.

00:10:36.103 --> 00:10:37.671 align:middle line:84%
But I think that's more
for the second half.

00:10:37.671 --> 00:10:38.538 align:middle line:90%
Yes, definitely.

00:10:38.538 --> 00:10:39.339 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Yeah, right.

00:10:39.339 --> 00:10:40.741 align:middle line:90%
Well, so let's talk about--

00:10:40.741 --> 00:10:43.677 align:middle line:84%
excuse me, let's talk about the
Pleiadians just a little bit.

00:10:43.677 --> 00:10:48.648 align:middle line:84%
A number of people that are
watching us probably a good

00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:52.552 align:middle line:84%
percentage hurdle the Pleiadians
have read about the Pleiadians

00:10:52.552 --> 00:10:54.855 align:middle line:84%
from various sources
and have variant--

00:10:54.855 --> 00:10:57.624 align:middle line:84%
varying opinions on them,
whether you're looking

00:10:57.624 --> 00:11:00.694 align:middle line:84%
at Steven Greer and his
association having to do

00:11:00.694 --> 00:11:03.530 align:middle line:84%
with this closure and
bringing technologies

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:06.433 align:middle line:84%
from authentic cultures here
too, Dolores Cannon's work

00:11:06.433 --> 00:11:09.569 align:middle line:84%
for example, where she
takes people through a state

00:11:09.569 --> 00:11:12.439 align:middle line:84%
of hypnosis, they start
connecting with ancient,

00:11:12.439 --> 00:11:14.741 align:middle line:84%
ancient information, roots
and authentic cultures

00:11:14.741 --> 00:11:18.178 align:middle line:84%
and the Pleiadians have kind of
an interesting and rich history

00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:19.880 align:middle line:90%
when you combine all of this,

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.449 align:middle line:84%
each person giving
they're part of it.

00:11:22.449 --> 00:11:25.719 align:middle line:84%
So can you give us a more
complex view of who they are,

00:11:25.719 --> 00:11:27.254 align:middle line:84%
what they represent,
what they've been

00:11:27.254 --> 00:11:30.423 align:middle line:84%
and why they're here now
helping you Barbara Marciniak

00:11:30.423 --> 00:11:32.959 align:middle line:90%
and probably others I'm sure.

00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:36.263 align:middle line:84%
Well, in my work, the
Pleiadians are the keepers

00:11:36.263 --> 00:11:37.764 align:middle line:90%
of the fifth dimension.

00:11:37.764 --> 00:11:39.499 align:middle line:90%
And each dimension has a keeper

00:11:39.499 --> 00:11:41.468 align:middle line:84%
which means that's
the consciousness,

00:11:41.468 --> 00:11:43.370 align:middle line:84%
the whole set dimension
and form.

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:45.539 align:middle line:84%
And for example, we are
in the third dimension

00:11:45.539 --> 00:11:47.841 align:middle line:84%
and we're the keepers
of this dimension,

00:11:47.841 --> 00:11:50.277 align:middle line:84%
the third dimension
linear space and time

00:11:50.277 --> 00:11:51.578 align:middle line:84%
and we're not doing
a very good job

00:11:51.578 --> 00:11:52.779 align:middle line:84%
but we can talk about
that later.

00:11:52.779 --> 00:11:55.415 align:middle line:84%
We will. But the Pleiadians
just like any keeper

00:11:55.415 --> 00:11:57.717 align:middle line:84%
of any dimension have
had their struggles

00:11:57.717 --> 00:12:00.921 align:middle line:84%
with keeping the dimension,
and this is a dimension

00:12:00.921 --> 00:12:02.789 align:middle line:90%
which is related to Earth.

00:12:02.789 --> 00:12:05.225 align:middle line:84%
They may keep dimensions
and other star systems

00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:06.560 align:middle line:90%
and other planetary systems.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.595 align:middle line:84%
I don't really know that
they are the keepers

00:12:08.595 --> 00:12:10.630 align:middle line:84%
of the fifth dimension
on our planet

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:13.800 align:middle line:84%
and the fifth dimension
is the heart chakra

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.402 align:middle line:90%
and the opening of the heart.

00:12:15.402 --> 00:12:19.272 align:middle line:84%
So they are known to be
protectors of children

00:12:19.272 --> 00:12:23.243 align:middle line:84%
and lovers of people, lovers
of life, lovers of sex,

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:26.346 align:middle line:84%
there are a lot-- the
Pleiadians are a lot of fun.

00:12:26.346 --> 00:12:30.050 align:middle line:84%
Then historically or
anthropologically,

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:32.919 align:middle line:84%
it would appear to me from
everything that I've been able

00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:37.724 align:middle line:84%
to research that the Pleiadians
have almost been involved--

00:12:37.724 --> 00:12:42.429 align:middle line:84%
almost like inhabiting Earth
for the last 100,000 years.

00:12:42.429 --> 00:12:45.866 align:middle line:84%
Now the last 100,000 years
represents the late phase

00:12:45.866 --> 00:12:48.068 align:middle line:84%
of Neanderthal and
then Cro-Magnon man

00:12:48.068 --> 00:12:50.537 align:middle line:84%
and it represents
a period of time

00:12:50.537 --> 00:12:52.973 align:middle line:84%
that Carl Calleman calls
the Regional Underworld

00:12:52.973 --> 00:12:54.474 align:middle line:84%
and we can talk about
that later on.

00:12:54.474 --> 00:12:57.344 align:middle line:84%
But there's these series
of time accelerations

00:12:57.344 --> 00:12:58.945 align:middle line:90%
that we're experiencing.

00:12:58.945 --> 00:13:01.514 align:middle line:90%
And the 100,000-year period

00:13:01.514 --> 00:13:03.617 align:middle line:84%
of our time acceleration
is best thought off

00:13:03.617 --> 00:13:07.654 align:middle line:84%
as the Paleolithic mind,
and this particular part

00:13:07.654 --> 00:13:11.391 align:middle line:84%
of our experience is a
time when we were symbiotic

00:13:11.391 --> 00:13:14.060 align:middle line:84%
with the energy of the
planet and we were symbiotic

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:17.797 align:middle line:84%
with the sacred sites, symbiotic
with all the power places

00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:19.599 align:middle line:84%
and it would appear
to me from everything

00:13:19.599 --> 00:13:21.134 align:middle line:90%
that I've been able to discover.

00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:23.436 align:middle line:90%
Now this is not just my idea.

00:13:23.436 --> 00:13:27.340 align:middle line:84%
This comes from anthropologists,
this comes from scientists,

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:30.176 align:middle line:84%
and it would appear that the
Pleiadians have had a tremendous

00:13:30.176 --> 00:13:34.247 align:middle line:84%
impact on this planet for
the last 100,000 years.

00:13:34.247 --> 00:13:38.084 align:middle line:84%
And so, they are a part of our
Paleolithic minds or a part

00:13:38.084 --> 00:13:41.321 align:middle line:84%
of a much more ancient part
of us, and most importantly,

00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:44.724 align:middle line:84%
they are the part of us
that symbiotic with nature.

00:13:44.724 --> 00:13:47.861 align:middle line:84%
And now that we're going
through a major transformation,

00:13:47.861 --> 00:13:49.963 align:middle line:84%
we've gone through a
couple more times cycles now

00:13:49.963 --> 00:13:52.465 align:middle line:84%
and each one has been
more accelerated,

00:13:52.465 --> 00:13:54.968 align:middle line:90%
especially 2011-2012.

00:13:54.968 --> 00:13:58.338 align:middle line:84%
And now, we are moving
back into the integration

00:13:58.338 --> 00:14:00.740 align:middle line:84%
with the symbiotic
Earth consciousness

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:03.710 align:middle line:84%
because the planet simply
can't survive without that.

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:06.112 align:middle line:84%
So the Pleiadians are
very involved in an--

00:14:06.112 --> 00:14:08.114 align:middle line:84%
they are very ecologically
conscious.

00:14:08.114 --> 00:14:11.117 align:middle line:84%
They are very, very conscious
of the protection of children,

00:14:11.117 --> 00:14:14.254 align:middle line:84%
because ultimately, our whole
species is defendant upon our--

00:14:14.254 --> 00:14:16.456 align:middle line:84%
the health of our-- and
happiness for children.

00:14:16.456 --> 00:14:17.791 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:14:17.791 --> 00:14:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And you say they come and go
and they've been coming in.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.363 align:middle line:84%
And you also are one of the
people along with Jose Arguelles

00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:26.499 align:middle line:84%
and others who were very
prominent in the research

00:14:26.499 --> 00:14:30.270 align:middle line:84%
of the whole Mayan calendar and
the cycles coming to an end.

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:33.039 align:middle line:84%
And you said that the Pleiadians
had a great deal of influence

00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:36.676 align:middle line:84%
in that and the Mayans
themselves may be of that.

00:14:36.676 --> 00:14:38.144 align:middle line:84%
Can you speak about
that a little bit?

00:14:38.144 --> 00:14:41.247 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Many indigenous
cultures on the planet

00:14:41.247 --> 00:14:43.316 align:middle line:84%
if you can get them to
talk to you-- Right.

00:14:43.316 --> 00:14:45.018 align:middle line:84%
-- will admit that
they're Pleiadians.

00:14:45.018 --> 00:14:48.722 align:middle line:84%
So for example, I've gone around
the planet, I'm part Cherokee,

00:14:48.722 --> 00:14:51.424 align:middle line:84%
and so the understanding
in my lineage is

00:14:51.424 --> 00:14:54.127 align:middle line:84%
that the Cherokee people
are very-- And it's--

00:14:54.127 --> 00:14:56.363 align:middle line:84%
what do you mean
from the Pleiades?

00:14:56.363 --> 00:15:00.967 align:middle line:84%
You could say, Regina,
you could say

00:15:00.967 --> 00:15:05.305 align:middle line:84%
that right now I'm a Pleiadian
not because a Pleiadian came

00:15:05.305 --> 00:15:08.341 align:middle line:84%
from the Pleiades but
because I have the capacity

00:15:08.341 --> 00:15:09.442 align:middle line:90%
to be a Pleiadian.

00:15:09.442 --> 00:15:10.577 align:middle line:90%
Can you see what I mean?

00:15:10.577 --> 00:15:13.079 align:middle line:90%
And so anyone with an open heart

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:15.515 align:middle line:84%
and open consciousness
is a Pleiadian

00:15:15.515 --> 00:15:16.916 align:middle line:90%
from that point of view.

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:20.387 align:middle line:84%
It's just that it's been
a long record and databank

00:15:20.387 --> 00:15:22.355 align:middle line:84%
that has many, many
manifestations.

00:15:22.355 --> 00:15:25.792 align:middle line:84%
And so, when I was out teaching,
I was teaching pretty much all

00:15:25.792 --> 00:15:27.594 align:middle line:84%
over the planet for
about 20 years

00:15:27.594 --> 00:15:29.229 align:middle line:84%
because a tour groups
sent me all

00:15:29.229 --> 00:15:30.663 align:middle line:90%
over the place which is great.

00:15:30.663 --> 00:15:32.932 align:middle line:84%
And so I would just go
meet people and say,

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:34.567 align:middle line:84%
"Okay are you a Pleiadian
or what?"

00:15:34.567 --> 00:15:39.205 align:middle line:84%
And many people especially
in Indonesia, the Balinese,

00:15:39.205 --> 00:15:41.374 align:middle line:84%
the people from Tana
Toraja, they're very open

00:15:41.374 --> 00:15:42.709 align:middle line:90%
about being Pleiadian.

00:15:42.709 --> 00:15:46.479 align:middle line:84%
Cherokees are, the Mayan
people are very open about it

00:15:46.479 --> 00:15:49.616 align:middle line:84%
and I have a strong relationship
with many Mayan teachers.

00:15:49.616 --> 00:15:53.253 align:middle line:84%
It's a real great bond
between Cherokee-Maya.

00:15:53.253 --> 00:15:55.455 align:middle line:90%
And so we see it in my case,

00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:58.625 align:middle line:84%
go back to my grandfather,
I'm a record keeper.

00:15:58.625 --> 00:16:01.694 align:middle line:84%
Record keepers are
people who hold the codes

00:16:01.694 --> 00:16:05.932 align:middle line:84%
of the planetary geology,
anthropology, evolution,

00:16:05.932 --> 00:16:09.869 align:middle line:84%
the development of species,
and we take responsibility

00:16:09.869 --> 00:16:15.341 align:middle line:84%
for holding record banks that
will be-- put it this way,

00:16:15.341 --> 00:16:17.911 align:middle line:84%
if they're lost, we
will be in great danger.

00:16:17.911 --> 00:16:20.447 align:middle line:84%
And so my grandfather just
literally put me in charge

00:16:20.447 --> 00:16:23.149 align:middle line:84%
of this whole databank,
not the one that came

00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:24.851 align:middle line:84%
in with the Pleiadian,
the agenda though.

00:16:24.851 --> 00:16:27.487 align:middle line:90%
Right. I wasn't expecting that.

00:16:27.487 --> 00:16:30.156 align:middle line:84%
Right. Another one and I think
you know him is Humboldt's

00:16:30.156 --> 00:16:31.291 align:middle line:90%
[phonetic] men who is just--

00:16:31.291 --> 00:16:32.559 align:middle line:84%
Oh, Humboldt's men in
out-- that's my brother.

00:16:32.559 --> 00:16:34.694 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. I assumed he
probably was--

00:16:34.694 --> 00:16:35.962 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, one time I
refer to Humboldt

00:16:35.962 --> 00:16:37.397 align:middle line:90%
as a teacher and he said, "No."

00:16:37.397 --> 00:16:39.432 align:middle line:84%
I said, "You're my teacher"
and he said, "No, no, no,

00:16:39.432 --> 00:16:41.067 align:middle line:84%
you're my sister and
I'm your brother."

00:16:41.067 --> 00:16:42.702 align:middle line:84%
Humboldt and I are
very, very close.

00:16:42.702 --> 00:16:45.839 align:middle line:84%
Yes. And our lineages
are very, very close.

00:16:45.839 --> 00:16:47.207 align:middle line:90%
Yes. Yeah.

00:16:47.207 --> 00:16:48.575 align:middle line:84%
Ehen I was reading, I was kind
of reading between the lines

00:16:48.575 --> 00:16:51.377 align:middle line:84%
that you probably were and at
the pleasure of meeting him

00:16:51.377 --> 00:16:53.813 align:middle line:84%
and these goals that he
carries with him everywhere.

00:16:53.813 --> 00:16:57.684 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and we've done major work
together to down at Mayan sites.

00:16:57.684 --> 00:17:00.787 align:middle line:84%
Yes. In addition she would
like work at sacred sites is

00:17:00.787 --> 00:17:04.323 align:middle line:84%
such a fascinating topic because
of so many people who have done

00:17:04.323 --> 00:17:07.060 align:middle line:84%
that work and what will
happen is you will be called

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:09.629 align:middle line:84%
to a particular sacred site
and you'll do ceremonies,

00:17:09.629 --> 00:17:11.831 align:middle line:84%
you do work, there then
you may never return again.

00:17:11.831 --> 00:17:14.934 align:middle line:84%
So I've gone all over the place
and done the ceremonial work.

00:17:14.934 --> 00:17:16.101 align:middle line:90%
I may or may not return.

00:17:16.101 --> 00:17:18.104 align:middle line:84%
I have-- I only go
when I'm called.

00:17:18.104 --> 00:17:20.039 align:middle line:84%
Well, and it sounds
like he is the same

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:22.876 align:middle line:84%
and when I met him I think
it must have been 2011,

00:17:22.876 --> 00:17:26.379 align:middle line:84%
critical year, and he was
traveling with some other people

00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:29.449 align:middle line:84%
of his tradition and then host
in the United States traveling

00:17:29.449 --> 00:17:32.418 align:middle line:84%
through the United States with
the skulls, if you may recall,

00:17:32.418 --> 00:17:35.588 align:middle line:84%
that pilgrimage, can you
talk about why that was

00:17:35.588 --> 00:17:37.123 align:middle line:90%
and link it in to 2011?

00:17:37.123 --> 00:17:39.559 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Because this is really a
crucial part of yours going too.

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:41.828 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Actually, I didn't
participate in that.

00:17:41.828 --> 00:17:43.897 align:middle line:84%
Right. And I've gone
into a straight of--

00:17:43.897 --> 00:17:47.667 align:middle line:84%
actually, I'm a keeper of
a clan called Stone Clan.

00:17:47.667 --> 00:17:50.036 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually a keeper
of my own clan.

00:17:50.036 --> 00:17:53.673 align:middle line:84%
And I've gone into deep
meditation now for a couple

00:17:53.673 --> 00:17:55.875 align:middle line:84%
of years working only
with the Stone Clan.

00:17:55.875 --> 00:17:58.645 align:middle line:84%
So when they came in-- of
course I tuned in and object

00:17:58.645 --> 00:18:00.046 align:middle line:84%
into what they were
doing and all that.

00:18:00.046 --> 00:18:01.247 align:middle line:84%
And the course, what
they're doing

00:18:01.247 --> 00:18:03.016 align:middle line:84%
when they're bringing
crystal skulls

00:18:03.016 --> 00:18:06.085 align:middle line:84%
to various sacred sites is
they're bringing wisdom cults

00:18:06.085 --> 00:18:07.954 align:middle line:84%
because they can bring
one of the skulls

00:18:07.954 --> 00:18:10.356 align:middle line:84%
to a particular location
and they can open

00:18:10.356 --> 00:18:13.693 align:middle line:84%
up all the wisdom codes of
that particular location

00:18:13.693 --> 00:18:15.094 align:middle line:90%
and that's what they were doing.

00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:17.397 align:middle line:84%
And what were you doing at the
same time with the Stone Clan?

00:18:17.397 --> 00:18:20.333 align:middle line:84%
Meditating with the Stone Clan,
meditating with the actual codes

00:18:20.333 --> 00:18:22.735 align:middle line:90%
of the planet which is the issue

00:18:22.735 --> 00:18:24.771 align:middle line:84%
of nine dimensions
to consciousness.

00:18:24.771 --> 00:18:26.839 align:middle line:84%
Right. And 2011 was
a pivotal year

00:18:26.839 --> 00:18:28.241 align:middle line:90%
because that was the actual end

00:18:28.241 --> 00:18:31.778 align:middle line:84%
of the Mayan calendar
as some calculate.

00:18:31.778 --> 00:18:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And I like-- the way I like
to put that because I work

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:35.882 align:middle line:84%
with [inaudible] and one
of these people who works

00:18:35.882 --> 00:18:38.284 align:middle line:84%
with December 21st
2012 especially

00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:40.720 align:middle line:84%
since my first grandchild,
granddaughter,

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:46.159 align:middle line:84%
Luciana Orsini Clow was born
at dawn December 21st, 2012.

00:18:46.159 --> 00:18:47.927 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'm sure it was just
a coincidence Barbara.

00:18:47.927 --> 00:18:48.695 align:middle line:84%
[laughter] Amazing,
my only grandchild.

00:18:48.695 --> 00:18:49.829 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that wonderful?

00:18:49.829 --> 00:18:51.531 align:middle line:84%
How amazing what is she
going to turn out to be?

00:18:51.531 --> 00:18:53.700 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I don't know what she's
going to turn out to be.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.902 align:middle line:84%
So the way I look, I looked
at the date difference

00:18:55.902 --> 00:18:57.303 align:middle line:84%
which I think is important
'cause I think a lot

00:18:57.303 --> 00:18:58.705 align:middle line:90%
of people are confused to why.

00:18:58.705 --> 00:19:01.975 align:middle line:84%
And then of course, that gets
us into what's going on at 2013.

00:19:01.975 --> 00:19:06.813 align:middle line:84%
But 2011 was the completion
of time acceleration

00:19:06.813 --> 00:19:09.882 align:middle line:84%
and the dynamic that
Carl Calleman discovered,

00:19:09.882 --> 00:19:13.820 align:middle line:84%
one of our great, brilliant
discoverers on the planet,

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.623 align:middle line:84%
is he discovered nine
underworlds of consciousness,

00:19:16.623 --> 00:19:20.393 align:middle line:84%
we're going all lower back
to 16.4 billion years ago.

00:19:20.393 --> 00:19:21.494 align:middle line:90%
You have a wonderful chart

00:19:21.494 --> 00:19:22.862 align:middle line:84%
in your books showing--
demonstrating this.

00:19:22.862 --> 00:19:24.364 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, yeah, that stuff
is all delineating.

00:19:24.364 --> 00:19:26.833 align:middle line:84%
So when we get to this
fifth cycle, the regional,

00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:29.869 align:middle line:84%
the 100,000 years cycle,
that's just the fifth one.

00:19:29.869 --> 00:19:33.039 align:middle line:84%
Then the sixth one comes
along and it's the development

00:19:33.039 --> 00:19:37.677 align:middle line:84%
of 5000, 125 years cycle,
the cycle of civilization

00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:39.512 align:middle line:90%
and priest-king consciousness.

00:19:39.512 --> 00:19:40.847 align:middle line:90%
And anybody who is tuning

00:19:40.847 --> 00:19:44.250 align:middle line:84%
in to us right now can
feel how much faster

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:48.254 align:middle line:84%
that 5000 year cycle is then
the 100,000 years cycle.

00:19:48.254 --> 00:19:53.993 align:middle line:84%
Then the next cycle is 256
years, 1755 A.D. to 2011

00:19:53.993 --> 00:19:55.862 align:middle line:84%
which is the development
of industry.

00:19:55.862 --> 00:19:57.797 align:middle line:84%
Anybody can feel
how the development

00:19:57.797 --> 00:20:00.767 align:middle line:84%
of the industry is a
much faster acceleration

00:20:00.767 --> 00:20:02.802 align:middle line:84%
than the development
of civilization

00:20:02.802 --> 00:20:04.103 align:middle line:90%
and priest-king culture.

00:20:04.103 --> 00:20:05.738 align:middle line:84%
Then we have the
Galactic Underworld,

00:20:05.738 --> 00:20:08.841 align:middle line:84%
the eighth underworld
starting in 1999.

00:20:08.841 --> 00:20:12.478 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure everybody resonates
with the Galactic Underworld

00:20:12.478 --> 00:20:15.848 align:middle line:84%
because in 1999, things started
going so fast for people.

00:20:15.848 --> 00:20:17.850 align:middle line:84%
It just was spinning
out of control.

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:19.886 align:middle line:84%
And then the final
time acceleration

00:20:19.886 --> 00:20:25.024 align:middle line:84%
and they all culminated in 2011
is less than one year in 2011.

00:20:25.024 --> 00:20:26.793 align:middle line:84%
260 year and 280
days, which one?

00:20:26.793 --> 00:20:28.361 align:middle line:90%
260 days. 260 days.

00:20:28.361 --> 00:20:30.830 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Just one final time
acceleration, so what it's

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:32.765 align:middle line:84%
like is it's like a
spiral or [inaudible],

00:20:32.765 --> 00:20:36.469 align:middle line:84%
spiral where you find and
get to that final end point.

00:20:36.469 --> 00:20:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And so then when we go to 2012,
we went into an enormous wobble.

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.875 align:middle line:84%
As soon as that completed
its self

00:20:42.875 --> 00:20:44.744 align:middle line:90%
of course we went into a wobble.

00:20:44.744 --> 00:20:48.781 align:middle line:84%
And I found 2012 to be an
extremely fascinating year

00:20:48.781 --> 00:20:52.485 align:middle line:84%
where we're in this
amazing wobble and yet some

00:20:52.485 --> 00:20:54.520 align:middle line:84%
of the final codes
that we were looking

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.022 align:middle line:90%
for were finally discovered.

00:20:56.022 --> 00:20:59.359 align:middle line:84%
The most important one being
the Higgs boson particle was

00:20:59.359 --> 00:21:03.429 align:middle line:84%
verified right at the
very end like December 17.

00:21:03.429 --> 00:21:06.299 align:middle line:84%
That was verified
mathematically by a group

00:21:06.299 --> 00:21:09.836 align:middle line:84%
of Japanese mathematicians
and also it was verified

00:21:09.836 --> 00:21:11.738 align:middle line:90%
in the particle accelerator.

00:21:11.738 --> 00:21:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And so the verification
came in right at the end

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:18.177 align:middle line:84%
of the Mayan calendar, telling
us that we're on the threshold

00:21:18.177 --> 00:21:20.880 align:middle line:90%
of a whole new era of science

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.715 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness
on this planet.

00:21:22.715 --> 00:21:25.151 align:middle line:84%
And even though it seems
to be very dry right now,

00:21:25.151 --> 00:21:27.286 align:middle line:84%
I mean I know that most
people feel that way,

00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:30.656 align:middle line:84%
there's something else going
on that we can barely see.

00:21:30.656 --> 00:21:32.625 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely, but we can feel it.

00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:35.128 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to be
really the subject of the--

00:21:35.128 --> 00:21:40.166 align:middle line:84%
at the second conversation is
the ability to feel the need

00:21:40.166 --> 00:21:42.335 align:middle line:84%
to be able to feel and
we'll go on from there

00:21:42.335 --> 00:21:44.804 align:middle line:84%
because that's how we perceiving
in the higher dimension.

00:21:44.804 --> 00:21:48.708 align:middle line:84%
So I mean we literally could
have a 6-hour conversation

00:21:48.708 --> 00:21:49.909 align:middle line:90%
on this.

00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:51.844 align:middle line:84%
And so, what I'd like to
do, I have more questions

00:21:51.844 --> 00:21:54.280 align:middle line:84%
about the Pleiadians and
all but we need to get

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.082 align:middle line:84%
through the first--
the fourth dimensions

00:21:56.082 --> 00:21:57.984 align:middle line:90%
in the next bit of time.

00:21:57.984 --> 00:22:00.353 align:middle line:84%
Sure. So let's start
with the first dimension.

00:22:00.353 --> 00:22:02.989 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the iron
core crystal of the earth

00:22:02.989 --> 00:22:05.792 align:middle line:84%
and talk about with that is
in how we're experiencing

00:22:05.792 --> 00:22:07.126 align:middle line:90%
and interacting with it.

00:22:07.126 --> 00:22:10.196 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to prophesy by
saying that the question is

00:22:10.196 --> 00:22:13.332 align:middle line:84%
where do this material
come from in alchemy.

00:22:13.332 --> 00:22:18.204 align:middle line:84%
Yes. So from 1995,
1996 through 2003,

00:22:18.204 --> 00:22:21.374 align:middle line:84%
I risk taking constant
notes on collecting data

00:22:21.374 --> 00:22:24.911 align:middle line:84%
on this scientific discoveries
that in other words sciences

00:22:24.911 --> 00:22:28.281 align:middle line:84%
as piece by piece were
verifying, the stuff that was

00:22:28.281 --> 00:22:29.882 align:middle line:90%
in the Pleiadian Agenda.

00:22:29.882 --> 00:22:33.486 align:middle line:84%
So one say, all came in
except one, one was missing.

00:22:33.486 --> 00:22:35.688 align:middle line:84%
Then I wrote the Alchemy
of Nine Dimensions

00:22:35.688 --> 00:22:39.358 align:middle line:84%
as a scientific verification
of these dimensions.

00:22:39.358 --> 00:22:41.727 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
material now as we get

00:22:41.727 --> 00:22:45.865 align:middle line:84%
in to these nine dimensions that
actually has a scientific basis

00:22:45.865 --> 00:22:47.467 align:middle line:84%
which makes it really
interesting.

00:22:47.467 --> 00:22:50.937 align:middle line:84%
And so right after the
Pleiadian Agenda came in,

00:22:50.937 --> 00:22:53.840 align:middle line:84%
scientists announce that
they were verifying.

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:57.777 align:middle line:84%
It turns out a few early
studies were done in the 1930s

00:22:57.777 --> 00:23:01.747 align:middle line:84%
where a few scientist that you--
I wouldn't have ever heard of,

00:23:01.747 --> 00:23:04.717 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about the
possibility that the center core

00:23:04.717 --> 00:23:06.819 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth was an
iron core crystal,

00:23:06.819 --> 00:23:08.287 align:middle line:90%
but nobody knew about that.

00:23:08.287 --> 00:23:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And so in Pleiadian Agenda,
the Pleiadians came in

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:14.594 align:middle line:84%
and said the center of your
planet is a gigantic iron core

00:23:14.594 --> 00:23:17.129 align:middle line:84%
crystal that's like
bigger than the moon.

00:23:17.129 --> 00:23:20.066 align:middle line:90%
It's one huge crystal.

00:23:20.066 --> 00:23:23.469 align:middle line:84%
And then two weeks ago, and that
means two weeks ago from this,

00:23:23.469 --> 00:23:25.538 align:middle line:90%
you know, early May 2013.

00:23:25.538 --> 00:23:26.906 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, in early May
right now, yeah.

00:23:26.906 --> 00:23:29.242 align:middle line:84%
Two weeks ago, scientists
have discovered

00:23:29.242 --> 00:23:33.913 align:middle line:84%
that that crystal is
as hot as the sun.

00:23:33.913 --> 00:23:37.617 align:middle line:84%
Wow! Yeah, and nobody has
any idea what that means

00:23:37.617 --> 00:23:40.353 align:middle line:84%
if you know what I mean, as
this data is just coming in.

00:23:40.353 --> 00:23:42.822 align:middle line:84%
But the Pleiadians did not talk
about the temperature of it.

00:23:42.822 --> 00:23:43.856 align:middle line:90%
They talked about it

00:23:43.856 --> 00:23:46.826 align:middle line:84%
as a gigantic iron,
hexagonal crystal.

00:23:46.826 --> 00:23:51.697 align:middle line:84%
It was verified in 1996 right
after the book came out because

00:23:51.697 --> 00:23:55.635 align:middle line:84%
of an earthquake, that
8.6 earthquake in Bolivia.

00:23:55.635 --> 00:23:58.704 align:middle line:84%
And the scientist had put
detectors on both sides

00:23:58.704 --> 00:24:02.308 align:middle line:84%
of the planet so that when
the earthquake energy went

00:24:02.308 --> 00:24:05.011 align:middle line:84%
through the center of the
planet, they will finally able

00:24:05.011 --> 00:24:09.048 align:middle line:84%
to analyze the chemical
in crystal and structure

00:24:09.048 --> 00:24:10.216 align:middle line:90%
at the center of the Earth.

00:24:10.216 --> 00:24:12.285 align:middle line:84%
So there it was right
after the book came out.

00:24:12.285 --> 00:24:15.721 align:middle line:84%
And when I wrote the book,
that was notch at the time.

00:24:15.721 --> 00:24:17.957 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Yes. You know, and
so every time that happen,

00:24:17.957 --> 00:24:20.993 align:middle line:84%
I got more trust for
what was going on.

00:24:20.993 --> 00:24:23.296 align:middle line:84%
I was teaching it more
powerfully all the time 'cause I

00:24:23.296 --> 00:24:24.664 align:middle line:90%
trusted it.

00:24:24.664 --> 00:24:28.401 align:middle line:84%
So, the Pleiadian said, the
iron core crystal is the first

00:24:28.401 --> 00:24:32.238 align:middle line:84%
dimension for anybody who
incarnates on the planet earth.

00:24:32.238 --> 00:24:34.073 align:middle line:90%
The minute we incarnate here

00:24:34.073 --> 00:24:37.143 align:middle line:84%
which in my case even though
I'm very strongly connected

00:24:37.143 --> 00:24:40.246 align:middle line:84%
with the Pleiades, I
live on the planet.

00:24:40.246 --> 00:24:42.214 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is
my first dimension

00:24:42.214 --> 00:24:44.817 align:middle line:84%
to consciousness is there
in the core crystal.

00:24:44.817 --> 00:24:46.586 align:middle line:84%
And so in our workshops,
we were--

00:24:46.586 --> 00:24:48.220 align:middle line:84%
I knew all about
tuning into the Earth

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:50.656 align:middle line:84%
and having a Native American
background, that was easy.

00:24:50.656 --> 00:24:53.726 align:middle line:84%
So in our workshops, we
started our connection

00:24:53.726 --> 00:24:55.661 align:middle line:90%
of the vertical access.

00:24:55.661 --> 00:24:59.732 align:middle line:84%
The vertical access is nine
dimensions of consciousness

00:24:59.732 --> 00:25:02.401 align:middle line:84%
that go from the center
of the earth to the center

00:25:02.401 --> 00:25:04.236 align:middle line:90%
of the Milky Way Ggalaxy.

00:25:04.236 --> 00:25:06.939 align:middle line:84%
So, the question is how
are we hooked in to that?

00:25:06.939 --> 00:25:10.476 align:middle line:84%
While we, as humans, if we
want to be completely grounded

00:25:10.476 --> 00:25:14.380 align:middle line:84%
and completely in touch with
the intelligence of Earth

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:16.716 align:middle line:84%
and the intelligence of
Earth is interesting thing.

00:25:16.716 --> 00:25:19.819 align:middle line:84%
It even involves knowing
where we should be

00:25:19.819 --> 00:25:22.688 align:middle line:84%
at any given moment,
understanding the intelligence

00:25:22.688 --> 00:25:24.991 align:middle line:84%
of Earth means we can
understand weather changes.

00:25:24.991 --> 00:25:26.359 align:middle line:84%
Such as animals,
they understand us.

00:25:26.359 --> 00:25:28.494 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole lot of real
practical reasons for wanting

00:25:28.494 --> 00:25:30.563 align:middle line:84%
to understand the
intelligence of earth.

00:25:30.563 --> 00:25:34.834 align:middle line:84%
And then in my system, Pleiadian
system, what's really unusual is

00:25:34.834 --> 00:25:38.471 align:middle line:84%
that the Akashic records
are in the first dimension.

00:25:38.471 --> 00:25:42.341 align:middle line:84%
So they teach that all of
the records of all life

00:25:42.341 --> 00:25:44.910 align:middle line:84%
and evolution on
the planet Earth are

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:46.278 align:middle line:90%
in the first dimension.

00:25:46.278 --> 00:25:49.515 align:middle line:84%
So when you go down into the
first dimension and tuned in,

00:25:49.515 --> 00:25:50.750 align:middle line:90%
you're actually tuning in.

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:52.985 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if you
want to be on mission

00:25:52.985 --> 00:25:54.954 align:middle line:90%
and understand all, you go

00:25:54.954 --> 00:25:56.856 align:middle line:84%
in to the iron core
crystal to get the data.

00:25:56.856 --> 00:25:58.391 align:middle line:84%
So most people would have
thought the Akashic records

00:25:58.391 --> 00:25:59.892 align:middle line:90%
would be in an outer dimension.

00:25:59.892 --> 00:26:01.627 align:middle line:84%
Yes. And actually they
are in some ways--

00:26:01.627 --> 00:26:04.163 align:middle line:84%
they're actually in every
dimension to tell you the truth.

00:26:04.163 --> 00:26:06.832 align:middle line:84%
The more I explain to that,
the more I realize that.

00:26:06.832 --> 00:26:11.137 align:middle line:84%
But they're located in
that first dimensional core

00:26:11.137 --> 00:26:14.006 align:middle line:84%
and it's really-- so I,
you know, of course me--

00:26:14.006 --> 00:26:16.242 align:middle line:84%
the only thing about being
able to bring in the state

00:26:16.242 --> 00:26:18.678 align:middle line:84%
of Anunnaki [phonetic] I was in
a position unconscious enough

00:26:18.678 --> 00:26:22.381 align:middle line:84%
when I channel to be
able to say, "But why?"

00:26:22.381 --> 00:26:23.582 align:middle line:90%
Right, right.

00:26:23.582 --> 00:26:24.917 align:middle line:84%
You know what I mean,
that's outrageous but why.

00:26:24.917 --> 00:26:27.853 align:middle line:84%
Sure. And so I asked that
question and the Pleiadian said,

00:26:27.853 --> 00:26:30.389 align:middle line:84%
"Think of it as like
a set of tinker toys."

00:26:30.389 --> 00:26:32.324 align:middle line:84%
Remember those-- the
toys we used to have

00:26:32.324 --> 00:26:34.660 align:middle line:84%
with those central
wooden things with hold.

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:35.494 align:middle line:90%
Okay, yes.

00:26:35.494 --> 00:26:36.595 align:middle line:90%
And then they would have sticks

00:26:36.595 --> 00:26:38.197 align:middle line:84%
and we could conduct
them all up.

00:26:38.197 --> 00:26:39.565 align:middle line:84%
Well, what they said
was they said,

00:26:39.565 --> 00:26:43.469 align:middle line:84%
every star in every planet
has a first dimension and it's

00:26:43.469 --> 00:26:46.005 align:middle line:84%
at the center of that
star or of that planet

00:26:46.005 --> 00:26:47.807 align:middle line:90%
or of the galaxy even.

00:26:47.807 --> 00:26:49.642 align:middle line:84%
And so the reason that
the information is

00:26:49.642 --> 00:26:53.379 align:middle line:84%
in the first dimension is the
first dimension is spinning

00:26:53.379 --> 00:26:57.149 align:middle line:84%
information in relationship
to the universe itself.

00:26:57.149 --> 00:27:01.087 align:middle line:84%
So that first dimensional core,
iron core crystal is a record,

00:27:01.087 --> 00:27:03.789 align:middle line:90%
a databank that is

00:27:03.789 --> 00:27:05.658 align:middle line:84%
so interesting, that's
the databank.

00:27:05.658 --> 00:27:08.094 align:middle line:84%
That's where the other
stars and other planets

00:27:08.094 --> 00:27:10.696 align:middle line:84%
and other systems get
their information about us.

00:27:10.696 --> 00:27:11.497 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:27:11.497 --> 00:27:12.631 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I know.

00:27:12.631 --> 00:27:14.433 align:middle line:84%
There was one time and
I don't know if this--

00:27:14.433 --> 00:27:15.801 align:middle line:90%
it directly feeds into it.

00:27:15.801 --> 00:27:18.137 align:middle line:84%
I had a dream, it's very
quick, but in the dream,

00:27:18.137 --> 00:27:20.039 align:middle line:90%
I was out in-- I was in a grid.

00:27:20.039 --> 00:27:22.608 align:middle line:84%
And at the grid, at the
intersecting points of the lines

00:27:22.608 --> 00:27:24.410 align:middle line:84%
and the grid, I was
shown that that's

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:26.912 align:middle line:84%
where all the information
was stored and it was all

00:27:26.912 --> 00:27:29.582 align:middle line:84%
at the vector points
of this grid.

00:27:29.582 --> 00:27:32.685 align:middle line:84%
So, would you say that I
was actually just cruising

00:27:32.685 --> 00:27:34.787 align:middle line:84%
around in the first dimensional
field then at that time?

00:27:34.787 --> 00:27:36.889 align:middle line:84%
Or you could have been tuning
in to the first dimension

00:27:36.889 --> 00:27:38.491 align:middle line:90%
of another star or galaxy.

00:27:38.491 --> 00:27:39.125 align:middle line:90%
Oh, the other system.

00:27:39.125 --> 00:27:40.092 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, okay.

00:27:40.092 --> 00:27:41.427 align:middle line:84%
And so the very interesting
could

00:27:41.427 --> 00:27:45.064 align:middle line:84%
because when Humboldt has taught
me some good tricks and us

00:27:45.064 --> 00:27:48.434 align:middle line:84%
in this cases, the whole
class, and he would teach us

00:27:48.434 --> 00:27:52.505 align:middle line:84%
to beyond the earth, tune
in to the center of the sun

00:27:52.505 --> 00:27:54.974 align:middle line:84%
and then once you get into
the center of the sun,

00:27:54.974 --> 00:27:57.943 align:middle line:84%
then you can go into the
center of the galaxy.

00:27:57.943 --> 00:28:00.513 align:middle line:84%
So, Humboldt taught me this
really great-- Interesting.

00:28:00.513 --> 00:28:02.815 align:middle line:84%
-- trick about how to get
into the center of the sun,

00:28:02.815 --> 00:28:04.416 align:middle line:84%
how to get into the
center of the galaxy.

00:28:04.416 --> 00:28:05.951 align:middle line:84%
So you could have
been almost anywhere,

00:28:05.951 --> 00:28:07.486 align:middle line:84%
but those vector
points are the key.

00:28:07.486 --> 00:28:08.721 align:middle line:90%
Okay, they are the key.

00:28:08.721 --> 00:28:11.357 align:middle line:84%
And those are a very big
deal in terms of how we deal

00:28:11.357 --> 00:28:12.391 align:middle line:90%
with consciousness, yeah.

00:28:12.391 --> 00:28:13.726 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:28:13.726 --> 00:28:15.895 align:middle line:84%
Okay, now, there is another
element to this whole thing

00:28:15.895 --> 00:28:18.898 align:middle line:90%
about iron as you say, iron,

00:28:18.898 --> 00:28:23.669 align:middle line:84%
that our blood is
essentially based in iron.

00:28:23.669 --> 00:28:27.306 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. We're an iron blood-based
species and let's talk

00:28:27.306 --> 00:28:30.409 align:middle line:84%
about how our blood in our
bodies resonate and why this--

00:28:30.409 --> 00:28:32.611 align:middle line:84%
women kind of see why
it is, but-- Yeah.

00:28:32.611 --> 00:28:34.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all you'd have
to say that when you tune

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:38.584 align:middle line:84%
in to the center of the
earth, you're also resonating

00:28:38.584 --> 00:28:40.386 align:middle line:84%
with the iron crystals
in your blood.

00:28:40.386 --> 00:28:41.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes. You have to say that.

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And then there're some really
amazing healers especially

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:47.660 align:middle line:84%
in Guatemala who were
blood quickeners.

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:49.161 align:middle line:90%
One of these is Alejan--

00:28:49.161 --> 00:28:52.498 align:middle line:84%
Don Alejandro Oxlaj that
some also already know about.

00:28:52.498 --> 00:28:55.167 align:middle line:84%
He's the head of all
of the mind elders

00:28:55.167 --> 00:28:59.171 align:middle line:84%
and Don Alejandro is a blood
quickening shaman and he can

00:28:59.171 --> 00:29:02.074 align:middle line:84%
like run his legs
over a person's thighs

00:29:02.074 --> 00:29:04.109 align:middle line:84%
and then activating
iron crystals

00:29:04.109 --> 00:29:06.879 align:middle line:84%
because the iron crystals have
again all of the information

00:29:06.879 --> 00:29:08.247 align:middle line:90%
at the first dimension.

00:29:08.247 --> 00:29:10.850 align:middle line:84%
So, if you want to diagnose
somebody or know what's going

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:13.152 align:middle line:84%
on with him and you would
shift them, you can work

00:29:13.152 --> 00:29:14.320 align:middle line:90%
with the crystals in the blood.

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:15.955 align:middle line:84%
That's interesting 'cause
your husband, Gerry,

00:29:15.955 --> 00:29:17.756 align:middle line:84%
we were talking last
night at dinner

00:29:17.756 --> 00:29:21.527 align:middle line:84%
that he gathers his information
from the physical matrix.

00:29:21.527 --> 00:29:23.362 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Because he's an
astounding body worker.

00:29:23.362 --> 00:29:25.431 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. And so, this
makes perfect sense.

00:29:25.431 --> 00:29:27.066 align:middle line:90%
The information is contained,

00:29:27.066 --> 00:29:28.834 align:middle line:84%
not only that within
the actual blood.

00:29:28.834 --> 00:29:29.969 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, yeah.

00:29:29.969 --> 00:29:30.769 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:29:30.769 --> 00:29:32.571 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Okay, so what about--

00:29:32.571 --> 00:29:34.974 align:middle line:84%
another thing that kind of
intrigued me was the notion

00:29:34.974 --> 00:29:37.743 align:middle line:84%
of our beta brain function which
is when we're sitting here,

00:29:37.743 --> 00:29:39.645 align:middle line:84%
we're alert, we may be in
a slightly altered state,

00:29:39.645 --> 00:29:42.281 align:middle line:84%
but by and large, we're in a
beta state of consciousness

00:29:42.281 --> 00:29:45.484 align:middle line:84%
and that also resonates with
the core 40 hertz frequency

00:29:45.484 --> 00:29:46.418 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

00:29:46.418 --> 00:29:47.519 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk about that?

00:29:47.519 --> 00:29:50.055 align:middle line:84%
This is a source of deep
confusion for people

00:29:50.055 --> 00:29:53.225 align:middle line:84%
because people feel like--
as you-- now the dimensions,

00:29:53.225 --> 00:29:56.095 align:middle line:84%
the way they work iron core
crystal is the first dimension.

00:29:56.095 --> 00:29:59.665 align:middle line:84%
Second dimension is from the
edge of the iron core crystal

00:29:59.665 --> 00:30:01.533 align:middle line:84%
to the crust of the
Earth and then we're

00:30:01.533 --> 00:30:04.470 align:middle line:84%
in the third dimension, on
the surface of the Earth.

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:06.972 align:middle line:84%
And so when you tune
in to that, the iron--

00:30:06.972 --> 00:30:08.107 align:middle line:90%
this is of great mystery.

00:30:08.107 --> 00:30:10.476 align:middle line:84%
The iron core crystal
is very dense.

00:30:10.476 --> 00:30:13.579 align:middle line:84%
The second dimension,
this telluric realm,

00:30:13.579 --> 00:30:16.248 align:middle line:90%
is very dense also, not as dense

00:30:16.248 --> 00:30:18.050 align:middle line:84%
as the core crystal
but very dense.

00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:20.452 align:middle line:84%
And then as we get to the
surface, it's less dense.

00:30:20.452 --> 00:30:22.788 align:middle line:84%
So you would think that
the hertz frequencies

00:30:22.788 --> 00:30:24.356 align:middle line:84%
that what you're
referring to here,

00:30:24.356 --> 00:30:29.628 align:middle line:84%
beta is around 40-60 hertz
vibration, and you would think

00:30:29.628 --> 00:30:32.598 align:middle line:84%
that it would be the
reverse of the way it is.

00:30:32.598 --> 00:30:35.134 align:middle line:84%
But the scientific
reality of this is

00:30:35.134 --> 00:30:39.672 align:middle line:84%
that the iron core crystal
vibrates at 40-60 hertz.

00:30:39.672 --> 00:30:42.007 align:middle line:84%
And then when you get in
to the second dimension,

00:30:42.007 --> 00:30:45.744 align:middle line:84%
it starts to vibrate and it
goes from 40 down to about 7

00:30:45.744 --> 00:30:47.146 align:middle line:90%
and a half at the surface.

00:30:47.146 --> 00:30:50.282 align:middle line:84%
So it's going down which many
people find this very calendar

00:30:50.282 --> 00:30:51.517 align:middle line:84%
intuitive, it's very
interesting.

00:30:51.517 --> 00:30:54.219 align:middle line:84%
And then when you get to
the surface, we're vibrating

00:30:54.219 --> 00:30:56.522 align:middle line:84%
at around 8.69 hertz,
something like that.

00:30:56.522 --> 00:30:59.491 align:middle line:84%
And then as you go further under
the space, it finally goes way,

00:30:59.491 --> 00:31:01.627 align:middle line:90%
way down to less than 1 hertz.

00:31:01.627 --> 00:31:04.330 align:middle line:84%
So that seems to be
calendar intuitive in a way.

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:07.299 align:middle line:84%
Okay. And so what that
saying to us is when we're

00:31:07.299 --> 00:31:09.835 align:middle line:90%
in beta frequency in our brains,

00:31:09.835 --> 00:31:13.138 align:middle line:84%
very active mental
activation-- Functional.

00:31:13.138 --> 00:31:15.507 align:middle line:84%
-- that we're vibrating with
the center of the Earth.

00:31:15.507 --> 00:31:17.643 align:middle line:84%
It's a very, very
interesting situation.

00:31:17.643 --> 00:31:20.612 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I played with
a lot and taught at a lot

00:31:20.612 --> 00:31:22.982 align:middle line:90%
and as a source of intelligence.

00:31:22.982 --> 00:31:24.350 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:25.985 align:middle line:84%
But there's an awful lot of
people walking around who think

00:31:25.985 --> 00:31:28.754 align:middle line:84%
that the less-- the
higher the frequency,

00:31:28.754 --> 00:31:30.723 align:middle line:90%
the more intelligent you are.

00:31:30.723 --> 00:31:32.458 align:middle line:84%
You know, this is what
I love about your work.

00:31:32.458 --> 00:31:33.258 align:middle line:90%
This is an issue.

00:31:33.258 --> 00:31:34.326 align:middle line:90%
It's really clarifying that

00:31:34.326 --> 00:31:35.661 align:middle line:84%
and saying do not be
discriminatory just

00:31:35.661 --> 00:31:36.929 align:middle line:90%
because something is

00:31:36.929 --> 00:31:38.530 align:middle line:84%
in the ninth dimensional
field does not make it greater

00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:40.032 align:middle line:90%
than what's in the first.

00:31:40.032 --> 00:31:42.501 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. And at that point,
the Pleiadians came

00:31:42.501 --> 00:31:43.902 align:middle line:84%
out with a really
good joke about it

00:31:43.902 --> 00:31:46.505 align:middle line:84%
because I was brought up, of
course, to be very grounded

00:31:46.505 --> 00:31:48.340 align:middle line:90%
with a native background.

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:50.609 align:middle line:84%
And I have to tell you
from a native perspective,

00:31:50.609 --> 00:31:53.712 align:middle line:84%
we often will see people are
very ungrounded especially

00:31:53.712 --> 00:31:55.714 align:middle line:84%
in the new age because
they're not connected

00:31:55.714 --> 00:31:57.249 align:middle line:90%
to the Earth enough.

00:31:57.249 --> 00:32:00.219 align:middle line:84%
So at one point, Satya,
the Pleiadian goddess

00:32:00.219 --> 00:32:03.522 align:middle line:84%
in Pleiadian Agenda slapped me
around a little bit, you know.

00:32:03.522 --> 00:32:05.991 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "I wish you
guys will just quit looking

00:32:05.991 --> 00:32:08.127 align:middle line:84%
out the window and staring
at the stars all the time

00:32:08.127 --> 00:32:09.595 align:middle line:90%
and just jump in the sack."

00:32:09.595 --> 00:32:11.497 align:middle line:90%
And that's very Pleiadian.

00:32:11.497 --> 00:32:13.599 align:middle line:84%
[laughter] You know, just get
down to your real business here.

00:32:13.599 --> 00:32:14.333 align:middle line:90%
Get down to your real roots.

00:32:14.333 --> 00:32:15.667 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing here?

00:32:15.667 --> 00:32:17.269 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you came here to be
born, you came here to birth,

00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:18.604 align:middle line:90%
you came here to live.

00:32:18.604 --> 00:32:22.708 align:middle line:84%
But I do think that this
issue of our brains vibrating

00:32:22.708 --> 00:32:24.943 align:middle line:84%
at the same frequency as the
central core of the earth,

00:32:24.943 --> 00:32:26.211 align:middle line:90%
it's just utterly fascinating.

00:32:26.211 --> 00:32:27.046 align:middle line:90%
It is fascinating.

00:32:27.046 --> 00:32:27.980 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:29.314 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. That to me
really stood out.

00:32:29.314 --> 00:32:30.449 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I know.

00:32:30.449 --> 00:32:32.317 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have to book on
through these dimensions

00:32:32.317 --> 00:32:33.552 align:middle line:84%
because we're going
to spend some time

00:32:33.552 --> 00:32:34.620 align:middle line:90%
on the fourth dimension.

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:35.821 align:middle line:84%
Now we go into the
second which has to do

00:32:35.821 --> 00:32:38.390 align:middle line:84%
with the elemental realm
and the intelligence

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:41.193 align:middle line:90%
of virus, bacteria, minerals.

00:32:41.193 --> 00:32:43.262 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. The intelligence set.

00:32:43.262 --> 00:32:44.663 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:32:44.663 --> 00:32:48.067 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. The second dimension is
an incredibly critical dimension

00:32:48.067 --> 00:32:50.602 align:middle line:84%
and one of the most important
dimensions possibly right

00:32:50.602 --> 00:32:53.739 align:middle line:84%
at this moment in time
because it is filled

00:32:53.739 --> 00:32:57.743 align:middle line:84%
with the life forms, mineral
and crystalline essences

00:32:57.743 --> 00:32:59.912 align:middle line:90%
that are denser than we are.

00:32:59.912 --> 00:33:04.216 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out that that
dimension is the source

00:33:04.216 --> 00:33:07.252 align:middle line:84%
of the manifestation of
life in the third dimension.

00:33:07.252 --> 00:33:09.655 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a really
interesting issue

00:33:09.655 --> 00:33:12.724 align:middle line:84%
because when the book came in,
the Pleiadians were adamant.

00:33:12.724 --> 00:33:16.795 align:middle line:84%
Get it right, the second
dimension came before you,

00:33:16.795 --> 00:33:21.333 align:middle line:84%
creation happens in that
realm and then you manifest

00:33:21.333 --> 00:33:23.569 align:middle line:84%
in linear space and
time in the surface.

00:33:23.569 --> 00:33:26.205 align:middle line:84%
And again, I stuck
to my agreement.

00:33:26.205 --> 00:33:29.908 align:middle line:84%
I printed it exactly as
it was and then in 1998,

00:33:29.908 --> 00:33:31.877 align:middle line:84%
discovered a new book
that it just come

00:33:31.877 --> 00:33:35.581 align:middle line:84%
out called The Deep Hot
Biosphere by Thomas Gold.

00:33:35.581 --> 00:33:39.051 align:middle line:84%
And Thomas Gold was Fred
Hoyle's main colleague.

00:33:39.051 --> 00:33:41.854 align:middle line:84%
The two of them unfortunately
just died a few years ago.

00:33:41.854 --> 00:33:46.225 align:middle line:84%
And Thomas Gold is a person
who went deep into ocean vents

00:33:46.225 --> 00:33:48.694 align:middle line:84%
where there's a lot of
hot gas and all that

00:33:48.694 --> 00:33:51.463 align:middle line:84%
and he would go deep
into volcanoes

00:33:51.463 --> 00:33:55.267 align:middle line:84%
and he was studying the second
dimension in relationship

00:33:55.267 --> 00:33:56.535 align:middle line:90%
to the third dimension.

00:33:56.535 --> 00:34:00.372 align:middle line:84%
And in the Deep Hot Biosphere,
he published his theory

00:34:00.372 --> 00:34:03.175 align:middle line:84%
that the creation in the
third dimension comes

00:34:03.175 --> 00:34:04.543 align:middle line:90%
from the second dimension.

00:34:04.543 --> 00:34:06.778 align:middle line:84%
And I just flipped out because
the whole thing didn't make

00:34:06.778 --> 00:34:09.847 align:middle line:84%
sense to me until I was
able to get an explanation

00:34:09.847 --> 00:34:11.450 align:middle line:90%
for that from a scientist.

00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:13.785 align:middle line:84%
Now, the reason that
is so important is

00:34:13.785 --> 00:34:16.388 align:middle line:84%
that as you sit here
right now with me,

00:34:16.388 --> 00:34:18.157 align:middle line:84%
it's sometimes is
interesting to think

00:34:18.157 --> 00:34:20.758 align:middle line:84%
of the dimensions
inside your body as well

00:34:20.758 --> 00:34:23.295 align:middle line:90%
as inside the telluric realm.

00:34:23.295 --> 00:34:26.664 align:middle line:84%
And I get pretty far by
thinking of the second dimension

00:34:26.664 --> 00:34:30.635 align:middle line:84%
as being the anterior of my body
and then the surface essence

00:34:30.635 --> 00:34:32.838 align:middle line:84%
of me being more like my
third dimensional person--

00:34:32.838 --> 00:34:33.939 align:middle line:84%
Kind of reflecting
the Earth itself.

00:34:33.939 --> 00:34:36.074 align:middle line:84%
-- walking around in
linear space and time.

00:34:36.074 --> 00:34:39.044 align:middle line:84%
The reason that it has
been so productive is

00:34:39.044 --> 00:34:42.548 align:middle line:84%
that you can heal yourself of
anything and I mean cancer,

00:34:42.548 --> 00:34:44.283 align:middle line:90%
heart disease, you name it.

00:34:44.283 --> 00:34:46.751 align:middle line:84%
You can heal yourself
if you know how to tune

00:34:46.751 --> 00:34:48.353 align:middle line:90%
in to the second dimension.

00:34:48.353 --> 00:34:51.089 align:middle line:84%
And so we're right in
the middle of a lot

00:34:51.089 --> 00:34:53.425 align:middle line:84%
of healers being
trained and a lot

00:34:53.425 --> 00:34:57.095 align:middle line:84%
of teachers teaching people
how to slow the frequencies

00:34:57.095 --> 00:35:00.465 align:middle line:84%
down into that second
dimensional field.

00:35:00.465 --> 00:35:01.700 align:middle line:90%
You know, and of course,

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:03.101 align:middle line:84%
as you know the frequencies
are going faster.

00:35:03.101 --> 00:35:06.939 align:middle line:84%
This is a completely calendar
intuitive thing of it, you know.

00:35:06.939 --> 00:35:08.006 align:middle line:90%
It's just so interesting.

00:35:08.006 --> 00:35:09.775 align:middle line:84%
I still haven't really
resolved it fully.

00:35:09.775 --> 00:35:11.176 align:middle line:84%
There are parts of
this book by the way

00:35:11.176 --> 00:35:13.645 align:middle line:84%
that I still don't understand
after all these years

00:35:13.645 --> 00:35:15.113 align:middle line:84%
of teaching and lecturing
about it.

00:35:15.113 --> 00:35:16.181 align:middle line:90%
It's very complex.

00:35:16.181 --> 00:35:17.916 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. I'm just telling
and doing this all

00:35:17.916 --> 00:35:19.484 align:middle line:90%
over again and holding it.

00:35:19.484 --> 00:35:23.121 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that if I
go on the healing table

00:35:23.121 --> 00:35:26.191 align:middle line:84%
and the Pleiadians really like
to show the dimensions in terms

00:35:26.191 --> 00:35:28.026 align:middle line:90%
of linear space and time,

00:35:28.026 --> 00:35:31.330 align:middle line:84%
this dimension being a person
lying on a healing table.

00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:34.099 align:middle line:84%
And the reason they do
that is because most

00:35:34.099 --> 00:35:37.803 align:middle line:84%
of us have experienced all nine
dimensions during session work

00:35:37.803 --> 00:35:41.173 align:middle line:84%
because it's so difficult to
get in touch with these levels.

00:35:41.173 --> 00:35:43.842 align:middle line:84%
And so they like to show a
person on a healing table

00:35:43.842 --> 00:35:46.011 align:middle line:84%
and the sense of it
is a triangle below

00:35:46.011 --> 00:35:49.748 align:middle line:84%
that person's body and
that's the second dimension.

00:35:49.748 --> 00:35:51.250 align:middle line:90%
And so the sense of it is

00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:54.119 align:middle line:84%
that the second dimension
is always manifesting us

00:35:54.119 --> 00:35:58.257 align:middle line:84%
in this dimension and that
is what we call homeostasis.

00:35:58.257 --> 00:36:00.926 align:middle line:84%
So when you're talking about
you can heal anything from the

00:36:00.926 --> 00:36:03.896 align:middle line:84%
by slowing down into that
realm, you would be talking

00:36:03.896 --> 00:36:05.831 align:middle line:84%
and interfacing with
the intelligence then--

00:36:05.831 --> 00:36:07.032 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that's right.

00:36:07.032 --> 00:36:08.634 align:middle line:84%
The virus, the bacteria,
the crystal and structure

00:36:08.634 --> 00:36:09.701 align:middle line:90%
and nature of the body.

00:36:09.701 --> 00:36:11.069 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:36:11.069 --> 00:36:12.804 align:middle line:84%
And the reason we get too far
out of whack and we're going

00:36:12.804 --> 00:36:15.674 align:middle line:84%
to even do the fourth dimension
during this-- part of this.

00:36:15.674 --> 00:36:18.744 align:middle line:84%
But what happens to the fourth
dimension because it's emotional

00:36:18.744 --> 00:36:21.747 align:middle line:84%
and it's the collective
mind in the whole field

00:36:21.747 --> 00:36:23.415 align:middle line:90%
of the collective reality,

00:36:23.415 --> 00:36:25.350 align:middle line:84%
it tends to pull us
out of our bodies.

00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:27.319 align:middle line:90%
So if you watch people closely,

00:36:27.319 --> 00:36:29.955 align:middle line:84%
a lot of their consciousness
is actually

00:36:29.955 --> 00:36:31.657 align:middle line:84%
in the fourth dimensional,
they're worrying

00:36:31.657 --> 00:36:32.858 align:middle line:84%
about the latest
thing on the news

00:36:32.858 --> 00:36:34.259 align:middle line:90%
or the latest war, whatever.

00:36:34.259 --> 00:36:37.796 align:middle line:84%
Right. And so, if you're in the
third dimension, linear space

00:36:37.796 --> 00:36:39.231 align:middle line:84%
and time which is
where you're supposed

00:36:39.231 --> 00:36:42.367 align:middle line:84%
to be consciously
located, you have access

00:36:42.367 --> 00:36:45.904 align:middle line:84%
to that second dimension
in the field just as much

00:36:45.904 --> 00:36:48.006 align:middle line:84%
as you can access
the fourth dimension.

00:36:48.006 --> 00:36:50.976 align:middle line:90%
And I know that people who are

00:36:50.976 --> 00:36:54.513 align:middle line:84%
with us today are very
comfortable with the idea

00:36:54.513 --> 00:36:57.182 align:middle line:84%
of what it feels like to be in
the collective mind, I mean,

00:36:57.182 --> 00:37:00.886 align:middle line:84%
what did it feel like two
weeks ago during the Boston

00:37:00.886 --> 00:37:02.487 align:middle line:90%
Marathon bombing.

00:37:02.487 --> 00:37:04.523 align:middle line:84%
Right. You know,
everybody knows what it's

00:37:04.523 --> 00:37:07.192 align:middle line:84%
like to just get sucked
right out of your daily life

00:37:07.192 --> 00:37:10.162 align:middle line:84%
which is totally like in
to the fourth dimension.

00:37:10.162 --> 00:37:12.798 align:middle line:84%
Well, the same thing is true
with the second dimension.

00:37:12.798 --> 00:37:16.702 align:middle line:84%
So, this is a major
important part of Alchemy

00:37:16.702 --> 00:37:21.473 align:middle line:84%
of Nine Dimensions is that
Christianity conspired

00:37:21.473 --> 00:37:27.145 align:middle line:84%
around 300-400 AD to cut people
off in the second dimension.

00:37:27.145 --> 00:37:28.914 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's spoke if we
do have time to go back

00:37:28.914 --> 00:37:30.015 align:middle line:90%
to that moment, for some moment.

00:37:30.015 --> 00:37:31.149 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yes please.

00:37:31.149 --> 00:37:34.553 align:middle line:84%
If we go back to 0 AD,
100, 200 AD or whatever,

00:37:34.553 --> 00:37:37.556 align:middle line:84%
we have a planet filled
with cultures who were

00:37:37.556 --> 00:37:38.924 align:middle line:90%
in touch with the Earth.

00:37:38.924 --> 00:37:41.593 align:middle line:84%
They had sacred sites, they
had temples, even the Romans,

00:37:41.593 --> 00:37:44.363 align:middle line:84%
people do a bad rep on the
Romans but they had the temple

00:37:44.363 --> 00:37:47.366 align:middle line:84%
of Venus, the temple of Jupiter
in Rome, people were really

00:37:47.366 --> 00:37:48.734 align:middle line:84%
in touch-- They yield
with the sun.

00:37:48.734 --> 00:37:50.836 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. They were really in
touch with sacred sites,

00:37:50.836 --> 00:37:53.171 align:middle line:84%
really in touch with
solar consciousness-- Yes.

00:37:53.171 --> 00:37:56.074 align:middle line:84%
And then the church comes
along with the new program,

00:37:56.074 --> 00:37:58.243 align:middle line:84%
the program for the
Age of Pisces

00:37:58.243 --> 00:38:00.679 align:middle line:84%
and what the church wanted
to do is the church wanted

00:38:00.679 --> 00:38:02.481 align:middle line:90%
to take control, and this

00:38:02.481 --> 00:38:05.050 align:middle line:84%
at that time were called
the Roman Catholic Church.

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:07.652 align:middle line:84%
So what they did was
they observed the fact

00:38:07.652 --> 00:38:09.888 align:middle line:84%
that people were
getting their power

00:38:09.888 --> 00:38:12.157 align:middle line:84%
from all these sacred
sites all over the planet,

00:38:12.157 --> 00:38:14.526 align:middle line:84%
some of them going back
thousands of years.

00:38:14.526 --> 00:38:16.895 align:middle line:84%
So the church spread
all over first--

00:38:16.895 --> 00:38:19.998 align:middle line:84%
over Europe and then other
parts of the world eventually,

00:38:19.998 --> 00:38:23.668 align:middle line:84%
and they built churches right
on these hot sacred sites

00:38:23.668 --> 00:38:25.871 align:middle line:84%
and then these churches
are very--

00:38:25.871 --> 00:38:28.039 align:middle line:84%
usually very tall with
the spire reaching

00:38:28.039 --> 00:38:29.608 align:middle line:90%
into the sky and all that.

00:38:29.608 --> 00:38:32.477 align:middle line:84%
And what they did was
they started a program,

00:38:32.477 --> 00:38:36.281 align:middle line:84%
a literal program of
demonizing the second dimension.

00:38:36.281 --> 00:38:40.419 align:middle line:84%
And the purpose of that was to
cut people off from their one

00:38:40.419 --> 00:38:43.989 align:middle line:84%
on one rapport with
the second dimension.

00:38:43.989 --> 00:38:46.091 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're in touch
with the second dimension,

00:38:46.091 --> 00:38:48.827 align:middle line:84%
you don't need the doctor,
you don't need the priest,

00:38:48.827 --> 00:38:50.295 align:middle line:84%
you don't need any
of that stuff.

00:38:50.295 --> 00:38:53.899 align:middle line:84%
You can just thrive as a
biological being on this planet.

00:38:53.899 --> 00:38:55.534 align:middle line:90%
And there's no way that any--

00:38:55.534 --> 00:38:57.803 align:middle line:84%
that what do they
control us through.

00:38:57.803 --> 00:38:59.938 align:middle line:84%
They control us through
medicine, you know,

00:38:59.938 --> 00:39:01.840 align:middle line:84%
all the different peer
programs that are going.

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:03.108 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting though.

00:39:03.108 --> 00:39:06.611 align:middle line:84%
They built on the sacred
spots and then they demonized,

00:39:06.611 --> 00:39:08.413 align:middle line:84%
as you said, the
second dimension

00:39:08.413 --> 00:39:11.083 align:middle line:84%
and that's also then
had the power-- Yeah.

00:39:11.083 --> 00:39:14.252 align:middle line:84%
-- because of the spot to
really integrate the messages

00:39:14.252 --> 00:39:15.454 align:middle line:84%
that they were feeding
into people.

00:39:15.454 --> 00:39:16.922 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is very off-stood

00:39:16.922 --> 00:39:19.424 align:middle line:84%
of you 'cause I might have
missed this piece of it.

00:39:19.424 --> 00:39:21.793 align:middle line:84%
Okay. They cut all the
people in the village off

00:39:21.793 --> 00:39:25.730 align:middle line:84%
from the power spot because
they cut it and then they turned

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:31.803 align:middle line:84%
around and created the mass
to be held at a regular--

00:39:31.803 --> 00:39:36.141 align:middle line:84%
on a regular schedule in
Rome and at all the churches,

00:39:36.141 --> 00:39:38.310 align:middle line:84%
specific rules, the
mass had to occur

00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:40.345 align:middle line:84%
so many times a week
and blah blah blah.

00:39:40.345 --> 00:39:44.182 align:middle line:84%
And what they did was they
called the blood energy.

00:39:44.182 --> 00:39:47.586 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Taking the sacred and
by the way, I'm really--

00:39:47.586 --> 00:39:50.288 align:middle line:84%
to me Christ is a
very sacred teacher

00:39:50.288 --> 00:39:52.824 align:middle line:90%
as many other teachers are also.

00:39:52.824 --> 00:39:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And when I worked with the sense
of Christ, I work with the sense

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:59.264 align:middle line:84%
of crystalline light, well,
they took the old sacrificial

00:39:59.264 --> 00:40:01.266 align:middle line:84%
because this planet
has had a long history

00:40:01.266 --> 00:40:05.070 align:middle line:84%
of sacrificial rituals and
they took the energy of Christ

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:08.807 align:middle line:84%
and turned it into a
global sacrificial ritual.

00:40:08.807 --> 00:40:10.609 align:middle line:90%
Well, as for Holy Communion.

00:40:10.609 --> 00:40:12.377 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, controlled by the Vatican.

00:40:12.377 --> 00:40:15.480 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. So they've had an
intense control program

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:18.783 align:middle line:84%
and we could talk about that in
the fourth dimension, but yeah.

00:40:18.783 --> 00:40:19.918 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, we will do that.

00:40:19.918 --> 00:40:21.586 align:middle line:84%
This is more a fourth
dimensional issue.

00:40:21.586 --> 00:40:23.155 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
the blood itself.

00:40:23.155 --> 00:40:24.656 align:middle line:90%
In your book you're saying is

00:40:24.656 --> 00:40:26.691 align:middle line:84%
in otherwise I do
to be sharing blood.

00:40:26.691 --> 00:40:27.459 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's right.

00:40:27.459 --> 00:40:28.627 align:middle line:90%
And let's talk about that

00:40:28.627 --> 00:40:30.228 align:middle line:84%
because many people
watching would say, "Hey,

00:40:30.228 --> 00:40:32.564 align:middle line:84%
I always go to the blood
bank and do my share."

00:40:32.564 --> 00:40:33.932 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Talk about the
other side of that.

00:40:33.932 --> 00:40:36.902 align:middle line:84%
This is a really tough point
issue 'cause I again followed

00:40:36.902 --> 00:40:39.170 align:middle line:84%
what the Pleiadian said
and they were very leery

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:42.874 align:middle line:84%
of organ transplants, they're
very leery of blood transplants

00:40:42.874 --> 00:40:45.210 align:middle line:84%
because of the way we're
actually constituted.

00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:47.179 align:middle line:84%
And that's a fairly
complex topic.

00:40:47.179 --> 00:40:49.948 align:middle line:84%
But the Jeho-- not the
Jehovah's Witnesses, sorry.

00:40:49.948 --> 00:40:51.683 align:middle line:84%
The more-- [Inaudible
Remark] I'm trying to think

00:40:51.683 --> 00:40:53.718 align:middle line:84%
which religion was
it, who is it?

00:40:53.718 --> 00:40:55.620 align:middle line:84%
I guess it must have been
the Jehovah's witnesses

00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:56.988 align:middle line:84%
who won't allow blood
transplants?

00:40:56.988 --> 00:40:58.223 align:middle line:90%
Yes. Okay.

00:40:58.223 --> 00:41:01.126 align:middle line:84%
So about six months ago,
we learned that as a result

00:41:01.126 --> 00:41:04.429 align:middle line:84%
of Jehovah's Witnesses refusing
to take blood transplant,

00:41:04.429 --> 00:41:06.932 align:middle line:84%
they had to figure out
another way to do surgery

00:41:06.932 --> 00:41:08.600 align:middle line:90%
and not transplant blood

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:10.468 align:middle line:84%
and they've discovered
that at this point.

00:41:10.468 --> 00:41:13.738 align:middle line:84%
They figured it out with a
group of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:41:13.738 --> 00:41:15.206 align:middle line:84%
And so they don't
need to do that.

00:41:15.206 --> 00:41:18.476 align:middle line:84%
So it's just-- it's a
very, very complex issue.

00:41:18.476 --> 00:41:20.645 align:middle line:84%
And these are hard
topics to discuss

00:41:20.645 --> 00:41:22.547 align:middle line:84%
because of course people
have their health issues

00:41:22.547 --> 00:41:23.748 align:middle line:90%
and their experiences.

00:41:23.748 --> 00:41:25.917 align:middle line:84%
Many people listening have
been probably saying--

00:41:25.917 --> 00:41:27.552 align:middle line:84%
Saved by a blood
transfusion, exactly.

00:41:27.552 --> 00:41:29.387 align:middle line:84%
They think that maybe they
were, maybe they weren't.

00:41:29.387 --> 00:41:31.489 align:middle line:84%
But certainly there's plenty
of people who think so.

00:41:31.489 --> 00:41:32.691 align:middle line:90%
Right. You know.

00:41:32.691 --> 00:41:34.125 align:middle line:90%
So, they need to read the book.

00:41:34.125 --> 00:41:37.162 align:middle line:84%
Okay. We'll just say we can't
go into that part right now

00:41:37.162 --> 00:41:39.531 align:middle line:84%
because we have to get on to
the third and fourth dimension.

00:41:39.531 --> 00:41:40.765 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, sure, sure.

00:41:40.765 --> 00:41:41.900 align:middle line:84%
But I just want to bring
that up that that is a point

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:43.034 align:middle line:90%
that you make in the book.

00:41:43.034 --> 00:41:45.403 align:middle line:84%
Okay. Let's go into
the third dimension.

00:41:45.403 --> 00:41:47.505 align:middle line:84%
We kind of understand
that physical line,

00:41:47.505 --> 00:41:49.307 align:middle line:84%
physical intersect here
but like stop here.

00:41:49.307 --> 00:41:50.175 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you're right.

00:41:50.175 --> 00:41:51.509 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and so the
third dimension,

00:41:51.509 --> 00:41:53.278 align:middle line:84%
even in our workshops, we
don't have to spend much time.

00:41:53.278 --> 00:41:56.281 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. And because--
but there is an issue

00:41:56.281 --> 00:41:58.450 align:middle line:84%
with how we handle
the third dimension.

00:41:58.450 --> 00:42:01.886 align:middle line:84%
And from an indigenous point
of view, native traditions all

00:42:01.886 --> 00:42:05.657 align:middle line:84%
over the world, it's very,
very important when we're

00:42:05.657 --> 00:42:08.426 align:middle line:84%
in the third dimension to be
conscious of the directions,

00:42:08.426 --> 00:42:10.061 align:middle line:84%
to be conscious of
the rising sun

00:42:10.061 --> 00:42:12.831 align:middle line:84%
and the setting sun
in north and south.

00:42:12.831 --> 00:42:15.600 align:middle line:84%
There are many, many
profound teachings

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:17.969 align:middle line:84%
and of course I presented
some of them in the book.

00:42:17.969 --> 00:42:21.439 align:middle line:84%
And so it's extremely
important to be very conscious

00:42:21.439 --> 00:42:24.376 align:middle line:84%
of where you are
in space and time.

00:42:24.376 --> 00:42:26.778 align:middle line:84%
You also need to be aware
of what time or day it is

00:42:26.778 --> 00:42:29.147 align:middle line:84%
because like how are you going
to get to the dentist and,

00:42:29.147 --> 00:42:31.349 align:middle line:84%
you know, in other words, like
there has been a big bad rep

00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:34.286 align:middle line:84%
on clock time, you know, using
your watch in order to get

00:42:34.286 --> 00:42:35.353 align:middle line:90%
to the dentist on time,

00:42:35.353 --> 00:42:37.522 align:middle line:84%
but these are things
that we have to do.

00:42:37.522 --> 00:42:40.425 align:middle line:84%
Oh, totally chaotic, I mean
nothing could function.

00:42:40.425 --> 00:42:42.527 align:middle line:90%
We are in a time-based reality.

00:42:42.527 --> 00:42:43.928 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:42:43.928 --> 00:42:46.965 align:middle line:84%
And then what's going on at the
current moment is consciousness

00:42:46.965 --> 00:42:49.634 align:middle line:84%
is really profoundly
effective right now

00:42:49.634 --> 00:42:51.036 align:middle line:90%
by the fourth dimension.

00:42:51.036 --> 00:42:55.006 align:middle line:84%
So we'll just leave that third
dimension for just a moment.

00:42:55.006 --> 00:42:57.742 align:middle line:84%
Yes. But I will say something
to make this transition

00:42:57.742 --> 00:42:59.744 align:middle line:84%
that I think will
resonate with people.

00:42:59.744 --> 00:43:04.315 align:middle line:84%
We are moving in to a period
now where we're starting

00:43:04.315 --> 00:43:07.485 align:middle line:84%
to be more conscious at the
fourth dimensional level.

00:43:07.485 --> 00:43:11.289 align:middle line:84%
Now, I mentioned a little
while ago that a lot

00:43:11.289 --> 00:43:13.391 align:middle line:84%
of people get pulled in
to the fourth dimension,

00:43:13.391 --> 00:43:14.693 align:middle line:90%
they are out of their bodies

00:43:14.693 --> 00:43:17.362 align:middle line:84%
and all they're really doing
is just watching CNN news.

00:43:17.362 --> 00:43:19.431 align:middle line:84%
We all know what
that one's like.

00:43:19.431 --> 00:43:21.966 align:middle line:84%
But another whole thing
is going on right now

00:43:21.966 --> 00:43:24.402 align:middle line:84%
where people are starting to
be conscious of what's going

00:43:24.402 --> 00:43:25.837 align:middle line:90%
on in the fourth dimension.

00:43:25.837 --> 00:43:30.175 align:middle line:84%
They are realizing that the
news is completely controlled.

00:43:30.175 --> 00:43:31.976 align:middle line:84%
Yes. And they're
starting to realize--

00:43:31.976 --> 00:43:35.346 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk to many, many
people now who just say, "Okay,

00:43:35.346 --> 00:43:38.016 align:middle line:84%
I check out the program
to see what the program is

00:43:38.016 --> 00:43:39.517 align:middle line:84%
that they're ditching
out in a given day."

00:43:39.517 --> 00:43:43.555 align:middle line:84%
And then I look at the whole
thing from a larger perspective

00:43:43.555 --> 00:43:46.224 align:middle line:84%
in order to understand
what's really going on here.

00:43:46.224 --> 00:43:48.960 align:middle line:84%
Right. So, as people
become more conscious

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:50.562 align:middle line:84%
in the fourth dimension
which is--

00:43:50.562 --> 00:43:52.931 align:middle line:84%
by the way, this is what we're
all experiencing right now.

00:43:52.931 --> 00:43:57.469 align:middle line:84%
We are really starting to
live in a quantum field

00:43:57.469 --> 00:44:01.373 align:middle line:84%
and it's really tricky,
because quantum fields function

00:44:01.373 --> 00:44:04.275 align:middle line:84%
by synchronicity, by
probabilities, they function

00:44:04.275 --> 00:44:08.113 align:middle line:84%
by entirely different laws
than the third dimension.

00:44:08.113 --> 00:44:10.815 align:middle line:84%
The third dimension is
linear space and time.

00:44:10.815 --> 00:44:13.351 align:middle line:84%
Not only in physics, how
long does it take an object

00:44:13.351 --> 00:44:14.986 align:middle line:90%
to move from here to there.

00:44:14.986 --> 00:44:19.157 align:middle line:84%
So, Regina, as we move
into this fourth dimension,

00:44:19.157 --> 00:44:21.192 align:middle line:84%
because what we're
doing was moving into it

00:44:21.192 --> 00:44:23.027 align:middle line:90%
and passing through it now.

00:44:23.027 --> 00:44:25.663 align:middle line:84%
And as we're in the
middle of this process,

00:44:25.663 --> 00:44:29.167 align:middle line:84%
it's more important than
ever to be grounded in 3D.

00:44:29.167 --> 00:44:31.402 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Some people may be
finding that they have to write

00:44:31.402 --> 00:44:33.738 align:middle line:84%
down their dentist appointment
on five different pieces

00:44:33.738 --> 00:44:35.540 align:middle line:84%
of paper in the house just
to make sure they get there.

00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:36.674 align:middle line:84%
Memory is being impacted
right now.

00:44:36.674 --> 00:44:39.244 align:middle line:84%
Yes it is because as we
move into the quantum,

00:44:39.244 --> 00:44:41.813 align:middle line:84%
the quantum fields are
much, much more complicated.

00:44:41.813 --> 00:44:43.982 align:middle line:84%
They operate according
to different laws.

00:44:43.982 --> 00:44:47.552 align:middle line:84%
It's actually one-- the quantum
fields are actually wonderful.

00:44:47.552 --> 00:44:49.554 align:middle line:84%
But people don't--
it's like people

00:44:49.554 --> 00:44:50.822 align:middle line:84%
who don't know how
to swim, you know.

00:44:50.822 --> 00:44:53.258 align:middle line:84%
Well, people feel like
they're having some kind

00:44:53.258 --> 00:44:55.360 align:middle line:90%
of physical brain degeneration.

00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:57.395 align:middle line:84%
Even young people are
not remembering dates

00:44:57.395 --> 00:44:58.663 align:middle line:90%
and names and so forth.

00:44:58.663 --> 00:45:00.031 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:45:00.031 --> 00:45:03.067 align:middle line:84%
So this is not-- it's not age
specific, it's not dementia,

00:45:03.067 --> 00:45:04.669 align:middle line:90%
not that dementia doesn't exist,

00:45:04.669 --> 00:45:06.538 align:middle line:84%
but I'm saying what
you're referring

00:45:06.538 --> 00:45:08.540 align:middle line:84%
to were we just having
this sudden--

00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:10.742 align:middle line:84%
like there's a block of
something that's just seems

00:45:10.742 --> 00:45:13.144 align:middle line:84%
to have gone missing and
then it zooms back in,

00:45:13.144 --> 00:45:15.780 align:middle line:84%
that's more what you're
talking about I assume.

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:17.115 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:45:17.115 --> 00:45:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And that we're functioning
more into the fourth dimension.

00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:19.651 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:45:19.651 --> 00:45:20.718 align:middle line:84%
And so-- Not so as the
time space limited.

00:45:20.718 --> 00:45:21.986 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:45:21.986 --> 00:45:24.088 align:middle line:84%
Well, as we're-- and as we're
moving into this, like--

00:45:24.088 --> 00:45:25.390 align:middle line:90%
that's a good example.

00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:27.992 align:middle line:84%
You just mentioned something
about the issue of memory.

00:45:27.992 --> 00:45:29.194 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Okay.

00:45:29.194 --> 00:45:30.995 align:middle line:84%
Now meanwhile, the medical
establishment had gotten

00:45:30.995 --> 00:45:32.697 align:middle line:84%
everybody prepared to
think that they're going

00:45:32.697 --> 00:45:34.065 align:middle line:84%
to have Alzheimer's and they're
going to-- Oh, I know, it just--

00:45:34.065 --> 00:45:35.400 align:middle line:90%
Whatever, you know what I mean.

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:37.902 align:middle line:84%
Yes. And so this is a very--
that is an excellent example

00:45:37.902 --> 00:45:41.506 align:middle line:84%
to me of why we have to
master the third dimension.

00:45:41.506 --> 00:45:44.509 align:middle line:84%
We really have to-- so as
we move in to the fourth,

00:45:44.509 --> 00:45:47.245 align:middle line:84%
the mastery of the
third dimension is part

00:45:47.245 --> 00:45:48.413 align:middle line:90%
of that, you know, yeah.

00:45:48.413 --> 00:45:50.448 align:middle line:90%
Okay, well let's-- Yes, okay.

00:45:50.448 --> 00:45:52.917 align:middle line:84%
And we'll suffice that to
say it's all in the book.

00:45:52.917 --> 00:45:55.186 align:middle line:84%
Now let's go into the fourth
because this is really--

00:45:55.186 --> 00:45:58.456 align:middle line:84%
you say that this is where--
first of all, this is the world

00:45:58.456 --> 00:46:00.391 align:middle line:84%
of myths and archetypes
as you put it in the book.

00:46:00.391 --> 00:46:01.659 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:46:01.659 --> 00:46:04.462 align:middle line:84%
But this is also an area
where we are being controlled

00:46:04.462 --> 00:46:07.031 align:middle line:84%
and manipulated in ways
that are really unfathomable

00:46:07.031 --> 00:46:08.233 align:middle line:90%
to the average person.

00:46:08.233 --> 00:46:09.467 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:46:09.467 --> 00:46:10.969 align:middle line:84%
We have about 10 minutes
left in the show right now.

00:46:10.969 --> 00:46:13.738 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about--
just go for it-- Okay.

00:46:13.738 --> 00:46:14.973 align:middle line:90%
What we're dealing with here.

00:46:14.973 --> 00:46:16.174 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:46:16.174 --> 00:46:18.676 align:middle line:84%
So, another whole databank
I work with was an issue

00:46:18.676 --> 00:46:22.113 align:middle line:84%
of a cataclysm that occurred
12,000 years ago and this is

00:46:22.113 --> 00:46:23.781 align:middle line:90%
In Awakening the Planetary Mind

00:46:23.781 --> 00:46:25.917 align:middle line:84%
and the people get
that and read it.

00:46:25.917 --> 00:46:30.421 align:middle line:84%
But what happened around
11,500, 12,000 years ago is

00:46:30.421 --> 00:46:33.424 align:middle line:84%
that we experienced the
cataclysm on this planet

00:46:33.424 --> 00:46:36.060 align:middle line:84%
which threw as in to a
very, very high degree

00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:37.896 align:middle line:90%
of fear and confusion.

00:46:37.896 --> 00:46:42.066 align:middle line:84%
Like any cataclysm or any rescue
scene, when that occurred,

00:46:42.066 --> 00:46:44.602 align:middle line:84%
some people were in a better
position than other people.

00:46:44.602 --> 00:46:46.704 align:middle line:84%
Some people had been on
boats when it happened,

00:46:46.704 --> 00:46:49.007 align:middle line:84%
some people were on
the tops of mountains,

00:46:49.007 --> 00:46:53.077 align:middle line:84%
and so the first thing that
happened on our planet in 8,000,

00:46:53.077 --> 00:46:58.182 align:middle line:84%
9,000 BC was anybody wasn't in a
kind of decent condition at all,

00:46:58.182 --> 00:47:01.052 align:middle line:84%
started taking control of
the people on the planet.

00:47:01.052 --> 00:47:03.288 align:middle line:84%
And this is a perfectly
understandable thing.

00:47:03.288 --> 00:47:05.790 align:middle line:84%
Right. A lot of them were
Atlanteans, the reason we have

00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:08.927 align:middle line:84%
so many legends about the
Atlanteans is the Atlanteans

00:47:08.927 --> 00:47:11.996 align:middle line:84%
were a sea varying culture
during the global American

00:47:11.996 --> 00:47:14.766 align:middle line:84%
civilization and many,
many more of them survived.

00:47:14.766 --> 00:47:17.902 align:middle line:84%
We think of the Atlanteans
as having been more powerful

00:47:17.902 --> 00:47:20.872 align:middle line:84%
than everybody else back
before the cataclysm.

00:47:20.872 --> 00:47:22.840 align:middle line:84%
They probably weren't
as far as I can tell.

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:24.742 align:middle line:84%
Many other cultures
were very powerful also.

00:47:24.742 --> 00:47:26.110 align:middle line:90%
Yes. All right.

00:47:26.110 --> 00:47:31.182 align:middle line:84%
So once this dynamic got in of
some people being in control

00:47:31.182 --> 00:47:33.384 align:middle line:84%
and other people being
controlled, and of course,

00:47:33.384 --> 00:47:36.220 align:middle line:84%
people give away they power
and they go through a lot

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:40.391 align:middle line:84%
of the psychological
complexes that we see

00:47:40.391 --> 00:47:41.960 align:middle line:90%
at the current moment.

00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:43.962 align:middle line:84%
But then what happened
behind all

00:47:43.962 --> 00:47:47.665 align:middle line:84%
of this is meanwhile we got the
Mayan calendar time acceleration

00:47:47.665 --> 00:47:48.933 align:middle line:90%
going on.

00:47:48.933 --> 00:47:52.537 align:middle line:84%
And even regarding the
cataclysm was right on schedule,

00:47:52.537 --> 00:47:54.472 align:middle line:90%
regarding the time acceleration

00:47:54.472 --> 00:47:56.641 align:middle line:84%
which is too complex
for us right now.

00:47:56.641 --> 00:48:03.014 align:middle line:84%
So we come up to the sixth time
acceleration which is 3115 BC

00:48:03.014 --> 00:48:06.718 align:middle line:84%
up through 2011,
2012, 5000 years.

00:48:06.718 --> 00:48:10.021 align:middle line:84%
And this is a period of
priest and king culture.

00:48:10.021 --> 00:48:13.558 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened 5000
years ago was in order

00:48:13.558 --> 00:48:16.194 align:middle line:84%
to create civilization,
the thing that was

00:48:16.194 --> 00:48:18.496 align:middle line:84%
on the agenda according
to the Mayan calendar

00:48:18.496 --> 00:48:22.500 align:middle line:84%
at this point was a development
of complex civilizations.

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:24.535 align:middle line:84%
And so the people
who were in control,

00:48:24.535 --> 00:48:27.372 align:middle line:84%
let's call them the global
elite, of course once you get

00:48:27.372 --> 00:48:29.340 align:middle line:84%
in control, who's going
to give away the control.

00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:31.376 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing about
the global elite

00:48:31.376 --> 00:48:33.845 align:middle line:90%
that is difficult to understand.

00:48:33.845 --> 00:48:36.280 align:middle line:84%
It isn't even about in
being them bad or good,

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:37.982 align:middle line:84%
it's like it's obvious
what they're doing

00:48:37.982 --> 00:48:40.184 align:middle line:84%
and it's obvious why
they're doing it,

00:48:40.184 --> 00:48:41.486 align:middle line:90%
if you know what I mean.

00:48:41.486 --> 00:48:44.655 align:middle line:84%
And there's only one way
out of that and that's

00:48:44.655 --> 00:48:47.125 align:middle line:84%
for each individual
on the planet

00:48:47.125 --> 00:48:49.727 align:middle line:84%
to understand how the
fourth dimension works.

00:48:49.727 --> 00:48:52.030 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that and let's
talk about the whole notion

00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:55.833 align:middle line:84%
of you call it a 4D low
astral hue where a lot

00:48:55.833 --> 00:49:00.538 align:middle line:84%
of people maybe intersecting
with angels, demons,

00:49:00.538 --> 00:49:01.839 align:middle line:90%
with any number of things.

00:49:01.839 --> 00:49:04.008 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Can you talk about
that, that interface

00:49:04.008 --> 00:49:05.143 align:middle line:90%
that we're now having?

00:49:05.143 --> 00:49:07.211 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. The fourth dimension has--

00:49:07.211 --> 00:49:10.415 align:middle line:84%
as far as I've been able
to tell do far, 30 levels

00:49:10.415 --> 00:49:12.617 align:middle line:84%
but I'm sure there is
probably a lot more levels.

00:49:12.617 --> 00:49:14.786 align:middle line:84%
And so in the lower levels
of the fourth dimension,

00:49:14.786 --> 00:49:19.223 align:middle line:84%
you get that low astral hue
where possessions can occur

00:49:19.223 --> 00:49:22.293 align:middle line:84%
and dark energies can grab
people's consciousness.

00:49:22.293 --> 00:49:25.029 align:middle line:84%
And that if you start to
move through the levels

00:49:25.029 --> 00:49:27.031 align:middle line:84%
of the fourth dimension,
you start to move

00:49:27.031 --> 00:49:31.035 align:middle line:84%
into finer frequencies and
finer levels of consciousness.

00:49:31.035 --> 00:49:36.207 align:middle line:84%
But because the Pleiadians show
the fourth dimension as a canopy

00:49:36.207 --> 00:49:39.077 align:middle line:84%
over the person in 3D
and they show the person

00:49:39.077 --> 00:49:41.846 align:middle line:84%
on a healing table and
they show this canopy.

00:49:41.846 --> 00:49:45.083 align:middle line:84%
So because we're under the
canopy unless we're very,

00:49:45.083 --> 00:49:47.719 align:middle line:90%
very smart, we tend to get stuck

00:49:47.719 --> 00:49:49.887 align:middle line:84%
with these lower
levels of energy.

00:49:49.887 --> 00:49:53.091 align:middle line:84%
So, most people listening
to us today know what it's

00:49:53.091 --> 00:49:55.927 align:middle line:84%
like to be stuck in the
lower frequency range.

00:49:55.927 --> 00:49:58.763 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you get stuck in
it and it takes a while to get

00:49:58.763 --> 00:50:01.632 align:middle line:84%
out of it but there's issues of
alcohol and drugs and all kinds

00:50:01.632 --> 00:50:05.770 align:middle line:84%
of things that can create
possession levels for people.

00:50:05.770 --> 00:50:10.141 align:middle line:84%
And as you move in to the higher
levels of the fourth dimension,

00:50:10.141 --> 00:50:12.577 align:middle line:84%
what you're moving
into is the game.

00:50:12.577 --> 00:50:15.880 align:middle line:84%
So you start to understand
what the Roman Catholic Church

00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:17.181 align:middle line:90%
is doing.

00:50:17.181 --> 00:50:18.950 align:middle line:84%
You start to see what the
American political system is

00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:21.853 align:middle line:84%
doing and you start
to observe the game.

00:50:21.853 --> 00:50:24.822 align:middle line:84%
And that's when people get
in to really high levels

00:50:24.822 --> 00:50:28.059 align:middle line:84%
of the fourth dimension where
they figure out the game.

00:50:28.059 --> 00:50:29.961 align:middle line:84%
And so, we have been
living in the middle

00:50:29.961 --> 00:50:31.863 align:middle line:90%
of an absolutely amazing period

00:50:31.863 --> 00:50:33.698 align:middle line:84%
in history is it's
totally incredible

00:50:33.698 --> 00:50:36.467 align:middle line:84%
that we're alive
right now because all

00:50:36.467 --> 00:50:39.770 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient archeological
sites are being--

00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:41.806 align:middle line:84%
have been dug off
and there'll be more.

00:50:41.806 --> 00:50:44.075 align:middle line:84%
But, you know-- Oh, they're just
scratching the surface out then.

00:50:44.075 --> 00:50:45.877 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. The ancient
information is coming

00:50:45.877 --> 00:50:48.713 align:middle line:84%
for the ancient information
in the library,

00:50:48.713 --> 00:50:50.281 align:middle line:90%
like the Alexandrian library.

00:50:50.281 --> 00:50:52.517 align:middle line:84%
Now we have the NASDAQ
information.

00:50:52.517 --> 00:50:54.152 align:middle line:90%
So we're living in a period

00:50:54.152 --> 00:50:57.955 align:middle line:84%
when where everybody watching
the show is in a position

00:50:57.955 --> 00:50:59.624 align:middle line:90%
to figure out the game.

00:50:59.624 --> 00:51:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are seeing
helpers along the way too.

00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:05.062 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah. Like you say, angels,

00:51:05.062 --> 00:51:08.566 align:middle line:84%
visions of the Virgin
Mary, even ETs.

00:51:08.566 --> 00:51:10.668 align:middle line:84%
So, tell us what we're
actually interfacing

00:51:10.668 --> 00:51:12.470 align:middle line:84%
with when we're seeing
these things.

00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:15.339 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's always an
interesting question.

00:51:15.339 --> 00:51:17.241 align:middle line:84%
And one of the people that
I think is really good

00:51:17.241 --> 00:51:20.044 align:middle line:84%
on this one is the psychiatrist
John Mack at Harvard

00:51:20.044 --> 00:51:21.913 align:middle line:90%
who died a few years ago.

00:51:21.913 --> 00:51:23.114 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I love John Mack, yeah.

00:51:23.114 --> 00:51:24.916 align:middle line:84%
And John Mack did a
really great job of showing

00:51:24.916 --> 00:51:27.652 align:middle line:84%
that there's all these
levels of interfacing

00:51:27.652 --> 00:51:29.020 align:middle line:90%
with higher dimensions.

00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:32.156 align:middle line:84%
So now what you're verging into,
Regina, you're just verging,

00:51:32.156 --> 00:51:33.858 align:middle line:84%
started to move in to
the fifth dimension

00:51:33.858 --> 00:51:37.161 align:middle line:84%
because the fourth dimension
is like this canopy over us

00:51:37.161 --> 00:51:39.297 align:middle line:84%
and then all the
higher dimensions come

00:51:39.297 --> 00:51:40.798 align:middle line:90%
in to that dimension.

00:51:40.798 --> 00:51:44.702 align:middle line:84%
So whenever a being,
non-physical being,

00:51:44.702 --> 00:51:47.638 align:middle line:84%
in a higher dimension
penetrates the higher levels

00:51:47.638 --> 00:51:50.374 align:middle line:84%
of the fourth dimension,
we pick it up according

00:51:50.374 --> 00:51:53.211 align:middle line:84%
to our consciousness like
one person might pick

00:51:53.211 --> 00:51:57.582 align:middle line:84%
up the Virgin Mary say or
Jesus or a high angelic force,

00:51:57.582 --> 00:52:00.284 align:middle line:84%
another person might pick
up an extraterrestrial.

00:52:00.284 --> 00:52:02.987 align:middle line:84%
And I know this is a very
challenging issue for people

00:52:02.987 --> 00:52:06.457 align:middle line:84%
because I know a lot of people
feel like they've been abducted

00:52:06.457 --> 00:52:10.194 align:middle line:84%
and they feel like they've gone
through experiences like that.

00:52:10.194 --> 00:52:13.264 align:middle line:84%
And I actually think they
have because what you think

00:52:13.264 --> 00:52:15.766 align:middle line:90%
about is what happens to you.

00:52:15.766 --> 00:52:19.470 align:middle line:84%
But what the Pleiadians
point out about that issue is

00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:22.974 align:middle line:84%
that none of the
extraterrestrials invasions

00:52:22.974 --> 00:52:25.576 align:middle line:84%
and abductions that we hear
about in medical procedures

00:52:25.576 --> 00:52:28.846 align:middle line:84%
and all that, the
Pleiadians are adamant.

00:52:28.846 --> 00:52:31.015 align:middle line:84%
They've never seen
them do anything worse

00:52:31.015 --> 00:52:33.918 align:middle line:84%
than what our doctors are doing
to us and we're paying the bill.

00:52:33.918 --> 00:52:35.086 align:middle line:84%
Well, no, that's a
whole separate debate.

00:52:35.086 --> 00:52:36.721 align:middle line:84%
We're paying the bill
if you know what I mean.

00:52:36.721 --> 00:52:39.056 align:middle line:84%
So, but the Pleiadians are
pointing out, Pleiadians point

00:52:39.056 --> 00:52:41.892 align:middle line:90%
out what you are thinking about

00:52:41.892 --> 00:52:45.429 align:middle line:84%
and how you see things
will affect what you get.

00:52:45.429 --> 00:52:46.130 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:52:46.130 --> 00:52:47.131 align:middle line:90%
What you get, you know.

00:52:47.131 --> 00:52:48.332 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have just
a couple minutes.

00:52:48.332 --> 00:52:50.334 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're really
looking through the 4D here.

00:52:50.334 --> 00:52:52.169 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. One thing you say is

00:52:52.169 --> 00:52:54.772 align:middle line:84%
that the global lead have
been using this 4D tools

00:52:54.772 --> 00:52:57.708 align:middle line:84%
such as Yahweh and the
devil and this concept

00:52:57.708 --> 00:52:59.010 align:middle line:90%
to control the masses.

00:52:59.010 --> 00:53:01.045 align:middle line:84%
But this is the part
that I find interesting.

00:53:01.045 --> 00:53:03.447 align:middle line:84%
They say-- I put quote
here, "It's better

00:53:03.447 --> 00:53:08.219 align:middle line:84%
to just allow the 4D forces to
flow through our consciousness

00:53:08.219 --> 00:53:10.087 align:middle line:84%
to avoid being caught
in duality."

00:53:10.087 --> 00:53:12.423 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a nice minute
and a half wrap on that?

00:53:12.423 --> 00:53:13.557 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, okay.

00:53:13.557 --> 00:53:16.127 align:middle line:84%
Well, okay, so as I've
said, when those kinds

00:53:16.127 --> 00:53:18.996 align:middle line:84%
of energies are coming in
through the fourth dimension,

00:53:18.996 --> 00:53:20.698 align:middle line:84%
the fourth dimension
gets activated

00:53:20.698 --> 00:53:23.601 align:middle line:84%
and we encounter Yahweh or
we encountered whatever,

00:53:23.601 --> 00:53:27.038 align:middle line:84%
the impulse is actually coming
from a higher dimension.

00:53:27.038 --> 00:53:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the
most important things

00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:34.445 align:middle line:84%
about the Pleiadian Agenda
and in Alchemy is to realize

00:53:34.445 --> 00:53:37.581 align:middle line:84%
that what happens in that fourth
dimensional field is actually an

00:53:37.581 --> 00:53:39.617 align:middle line:90%
impulse from a higher dimension.

00:53:39.617 --> 00:53:42.386 align:middle line:84%
So when that energy
of Yahweh comes

00:53:42.386 --> 00:53:46.657 align:middle line:84%
in to the fourth dimension,
then Judeo Christianity uses it

00:53:46.657 --> 00:53:49.360 align:middle line:84%
in order to control
everybody and create wars.

00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:51.862 align:middle line:84%
And you can fall into
that trap if you want to.

00:53:51.862 --> 00:53:53.964 align:middle line:84%
But if you start realizing
that what you're picking

00:53:53.964 --> 00:53:58.336 align:middle line:84%
up on is actually a higher
frequency because the point is

00:53:58.336 --> 00:54:01.772 align:middle line:84%
that divine consciousness
and the light

00:54:01.772 --> 00:54:05.276 align:middle line:84%
and the god energy is actually
in the eighth dimension

00:54:05.276 --> 00:54:06.610 align:middle line:90%
and not in the fourth.

00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:07.712 align:middle line:90%
So anything you're picking

00:54:07.712 --> 00:54:10.147 align:middle line:84%
up in the fourth
dimension is actually coming

00:54:10.147 --> 00:54:11.716 align:middle line:90%
from a higher dimension.

00:54:11.716 --> 00:54:13.918 align:middle line:84%
And so this is about
becoming an adept.

00:54:13.918 --> 00:54:17.421 align:middle line:84%
And adept is a person who
can read those frequencies

00:54:17.421 --> 00:54:19.056 align:middle line:90%
to see what they actually are.

00:54:19.056 --> 00:54:20.024 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:54:20.024 --> 00:54:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And so, essentially,
don't buy it.

00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:25.029 align:middle line:84%
Don't get hung up in
those strands of thought.

00:54:25.029 --> 00:54:25.830 align:middle line:90%
You never.

00:54:25.830 --> 00:54:27.031 align:middle line:90%
Don't buy in to the concepts

00:54:27.031 --> 00:54:28.699 align:middle line:84%
because you're getting
caught in the game.

00:54:28.699 --> 00:54:29.934 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and how could--
So don't engage.

00:54:29.934 --> 00:54:31.669 align:middle line:84%
That means don't engage
in most of the media.

00:54:31.669 --> 00:54:34.805 align:middle line:84%
Sure. And how God be a
good-looking white male?

00:54:34.805 --> 00:54:35.806 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:54:35.806 --> 00:54:36.974 align:middle line:84%
[laughter] I mean,
come on, you know.

00:54:36.974 --> 00:54:38.642 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's some little
girl's dream.

00:54:38.642 --> 00:54:40.578 align:middle line:84%
No, but in some church
does that, so.

00:54:40.578 --> 00:54:42.446 align:middle line:90%
Exactly. Okay Barbara.

00:54:42.446 --> 00:54:43.814 align:middle line:84%
We're going to pick
it up in a little bit

00:54:43.814 --> 00:54:45.883 align:middle line:84%
with dimensions five
through nine.

00:54:45.883 --> 00:54:48.285 align:middle line:90%
This is absolutely fascinating.

00:54:48.285 --> 00:54:51.322 align:middle line:84%
As we just said, we're going
to pick up our conversation

00:54:51.322 --> 00:54:54.125 align:middle line:84%
by covering the fifth through
ninth dimensions unless you

00:54:54.125 --> 00:54:56.193 align:middle line:84%
think that these higher
dimensions are too far away

00:54:56.193 --> 00:54:58.796 align:middle line:84%
or too vast to contemplate,
let me assure you

00:54:58.796 --> 00:55:00.798 align:middle line:84%
that they're right
there into penetrating

00:55:00.798 --> 00:55:02.400 align:middle line:90%
and waiting to be utilized.

00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:06.036 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
