>> DAVE ASPREY: When I was in
my 20s and I met someone who was

00:00:11.693 --> 00:00:13.900 align:middle line:84%
85, he had more
energy than I did.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.103 align:middle line:90%
Like, wait, that's possible.

00:00:15.103 --> 00:00:16.520 align:middle line:84%
The reason I look
different now is

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.410 align:middle line:84%
I actually do the deep
research, and then I test it--

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:19.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.883 align:middle line:90%
>> ASPREY: And I write about it.

00:00:20.883 --> 00:00:24.870 align:middle line:84%
You want to know how to have
the energy to work hard to push.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.810 align:middle line:84%
But what we've
taught ourselves is

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.670 align:middle line:90%
that we should always do that.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.113 align:middle line:90%
I made $6 million when I was 26.

00:00:31.113 --> 00:00:32.280 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, it's crazy.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.520 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: Lost
it when was I 28.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.320 align:middle line:90%
Oops.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.320 align:middle line:84%
Your body wants to get
a signal like this.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.720 align:middle line:84%
I was walking along really
slowly and then a tiger came.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.690 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: Your cells need fat
and animal protein to do this.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And I know that's not
politically correct.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.240 align:middle line:90%
That's just what science says.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's not because
you lack willpower.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.750 align:middle line:90%
It's not a moral failing.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.543 align:middle line:84%
It's just because
something you're eating

00:00:52.543 --> 00:00:54.710 align:middle line:84%
is punching you in the
brain, and you don't know it,

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.030 align:middle line:90%
and you think it's healthy.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm reasonably fit for a guy
who used to weigh 300 pounds.

do you think I do every week?

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.670 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Dave Asprey is a
man dedicated to efficiency.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.680 align:middle line:10%
Once a big shot in
the programming world,

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.630 align:middle line:10%
today he's taking
those skills to hack

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.050 align:middle line:10%
the understanding of the human
body to an incredible degree.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.050 align:middle line:84%
Some of his tenants are primal,
such as you should feel better

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.880 align:middle line:90%
after eating a meal, not worse.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Everything is about
energy production,

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.900 align:middle line:84%
so we can operate at
our highest levels.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.220 align:middle line:84%
Dave, it's so good
to see you again.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.470 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: It's been almost
10 years since we last got

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.580 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.880 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I know.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.140 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't even recognize--
you look fabulous.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.710 align:middle line:90%
>> ASPREY: Thank you.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I wouldn't
recognize you.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.200 align:middle line:90%
Before you had long hair.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.180 align:middle line:84%
You were just getting
going on "Bulletproof"

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.650 align:middle line:90%
and you had your little blender.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And you had your
MCT oil and coffee,

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.120 align:middle line:84%
and we were drinking it in
the studio that's long gone.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And so, gosh, what a journey
over the last 10 years.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.670 align:middle line:84%
You've learned a
tremendous amount.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:49.470 align:middle line:90%
>> ASPREY: I have.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.760 align:middle line:90%
I've been blessed.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.490 align:middle line:10%
Even when I was in my 20s
and I weighed 300 pounds,

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.940 align:middle line:10%
and my brain wasn't working and
chronic fatigue and all that,

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.880 align:middle line:10%
I started learning
anti-aging and longevity

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.560 align:middle line:10%
from people in their
80s, and ended up

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.350 align:middle line:10%
running a nonprofit group
near Stanford University.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.780 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of what is today,
the field of biohacking,

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.360 align:middle line:84%
I very consciously added
the longevity components

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.620 align:middle line:90%
from my elders.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And when I was in my 20s, and
I met someone who was 85--

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.630 align:middle line:90%
his name was Mike--

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.227 align:middle line:90%
he had more energy than I did.

00:02:18.227 --> 00:02:19.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, wait, that's possible.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.690 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: And so I got my
energy back when I was young,

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.668 align:middle line:84%
and I learned you can have
more energy your whole life.

00:02:25.668 --> 00:02:28.210 align:middle line:10%
And then I ended up writing a
big "New York Times" bestseller

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.515 align:middle line:10%
on longevity,
called "Superhuman."

00:02:29.515 --> 00:02:29.920 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.503 align:middle line:10%
>> ASPREY: So the reason I look
different now is I actually do

00:02:32.503 --> 00:02:35.440 align:middle line:10%
the deep research, and then I
test it, and I write about it,

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.790 align:middle line:10%
so that people can learn.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.368 align:middle line:84%
And my goal is there's always
a free way to do these things.

00:02:41.368 --> 00:02:43.660 align:middle line:84%
We know something matters
that we didn't know mattered.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.010 align:middle line:90%
So how do you do it at no cost?

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.427 align:middle line:84%
How do you do it
for pretty cheap?

00:02:46.427 --> 00:02:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And then what do the
crazy billionaires do?

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And yes, it's
expensive, but they're

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.150 align:middle line:84%
proving it, which makes
it more affordable for all

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.950 align:middle line:90%
of us over time.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Just like cell phones
used to be real expensive.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.900 align:middle line:90%
Now they're cheap.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That
always makes sense.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it goes to the
people who can afford it.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.500 align:middle line:90%
It's very exotic.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.370 align:middle line:90%
Boom, boom, boom.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.620 align:middle line:84%
Pretty soon they're able
to produce it in more mass

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.490 align:middle line:90%
quantities at a fair price.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.430 align:middle line:90%
So this-- thank you--

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.890 align:middle line:84%
thank you, billionaires,
for hiring you so that we

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.100 align:middle line:90%
have the advantage of it.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.892 align:middle line:84%
We were talking off
camera and found out we

00:03:11.892 --> 00:03:13.600 align:middle line:84%
both have something
really interesting.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.580 align:middle line:84%
We both have adrenal
insufficiencies

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.840 align:middle line:90%
and have to supplement.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.970 align:middle line:84%
But it took us to
the conversation

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.500 align:middle line:84%
we're going to get into in a
little bit about histamines.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.300 align:middle line:90%
>> ASPREY: Right.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: There
are so many things--

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.865 align:middle line:90%
OK, so let's just start.

00:03:25.865 --> 00:03:27.490 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
things we have to get

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.550 align:middle line:84%
to because we just don't know
what we're doing to our bodies.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.130 align:middle line:84%
No one-- you've taken
the time to understand.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.930 align:middle line:90%
>> ASPREY: Yeah.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.942 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I know a fair amount.

00:03:36.942 --> 00:03:38.650 align:middle line:84%
The things you've just
told me off camera

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.390 align:middle line:84%
this morning are going
to change my life.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm so excited.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.400 align:middle line:90%
OK, new book.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.490 align:middle line:90%
"Smarter, Not Harder."

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And what you're saying is
that the human body, just

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.060 align:middle line:84%
like every other
animal, is designed

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.660 align:middle line:84%
to be lazy and efficient
and spring into action when

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.690 align:middle line:84%
necessary, but to be
able to fully rest.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.560 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about the theory.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.500 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: Well, the word lazy
is a major trigger for most

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.300 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.870 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.030 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: How many times does
a coach or a teacher or parent

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.500 align:middle line:84%
said, don't be
lazy, you're lazy.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.890 align:middle line:84%
And we assume that if
you're lazy or even if you

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.990 align:middle line:84%
feel the desire to
not do something,

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.310 align:middle line:90%
it's because of a moral failing.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.880 align:middle line:90%
And we can drop that shame.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.970 align:middle line:84%
The reality is that
all life on Earth

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.750 align:middle line:84%
evolves to use as little
energy as possible.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:22.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.970 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: So your body wants
to be lazy and your mind wants

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:26.770 align:middle line:90%
to do stuff.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And that mismatch is
natural, and it's OK.

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
wrong with it.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.470 align:middle line:84%
But what you want to do is
say instead of working hard,

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.920 align:middle line:84%
which is something-- you've
worked hard, I work hard--

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.140 align:middle line:84%
but believing that
working hard gets

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.480 align:middle line:90%
results, that's a toxic belief.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.470 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.845 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: How many people do
you know who've worked hard

00:04:46.845 --> 00:04:48.123 align:middle line:90%
and they don't get results?

00:04:48.123 --> 00:04:49.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They
don't get results.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.642 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, then
they go over into--

00:04:51.642 --> 00:04:54.100 align:middle line:84%
and the reason I brought up
the adrenal thing to begin with

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.760 align:middle line:84%
is so many people are
now into what's casually

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.855 align:middle line:90%
called adrenal burnout.

00:04:58.855 --> 00:04:59.410 align:middle line:90%
>> ASPREY: Mhm.

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.743 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But you would say
it's even deeper than that.

00:05:01.743 --> 00:05:03.640 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: It is
deeper than that.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.920 align:middle line:84%
Imagine we have two
people, and one of them

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.928 align:middle line:84%
believes that working hard is
a moral-- it's the thing to do.

00:05:09.928 --> 00:05:11.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's an imperative--

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.920 align:middle line:90%
>> ASPREY: Yeah.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --if you're going
to be a productive human being

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.410 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.370 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: And you have
another one who says,

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.420 align:middle line:84%
I understand that if
I can save energy,

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.160 align:middle line:84%
that means I can spend
the energy somewhere else.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.000 align:middle line:84%
So this person can work
hard, but they're also lazy.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And this person just
believes in working hard.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.420 align:middle line:84%
So person A gets a shovel and
decides to dig a swimming pool.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.830 align:middle line:84%
Person B gets a tractor
and digs a swimming pool.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.060 align:middle line:90%
Now, which person worked hard?

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.060 align:middle line:90%
The guy with the shovel.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.893 align:middle line:84%
And six weeks later,
he's almost got a pool.

00:05:40.893 --> 00:05:43.110 align:middle line:84%
The other guy is already
floating and having

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.090 align:middle line:84%
some coffee or whatever you want
to drink when you're floating.

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:45.923 align:middle line:90%
That's what I drink.

00:05:45.923 --> 00:05:48.510 align:middle line:84%
So which one was
morally superior?

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:49.650 align:middle line:90%
Neither one.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.850 align:middle line:84%
One of them had the
tools available.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.470 align:middle line:84%
So in all the time he saved,
he could apply his energy

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.140 align:middle line:84%
to parenting, to
learning a new skill,

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.380 align:middle line:84%
to meditating, to taking care of
himself, to serving the world.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.180 align:middle line:84%
So you have a moral imperative
to take care of your body,

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.483 align:middle line:84%
to take care of your energy
production and to not waste it.

00:06:09.483 --> 00:06:11.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And to rest
when it's time to rest.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.700 align:middle line:90%
>> ASPREY: Yeah.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.658 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And, well,
see, this is a thing now,

00:06:13.658 --> 00:06:16.830 align:middle line:84%
and you're a part of it, is
a lot of people think, God,

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.600 align:middle line:90%
I just need to slow down.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.400 align:middle line:84%
I need to close my
eyes for a few minutes.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:20.740 align:middle line:90%
>> ASPREY: Right.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:21.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, no, I can't.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.310 align:middle line:84%
I better have another
cup of coffee.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: You know, I'm
not opposed to coffee.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:25.230 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.890 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, I know.

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.180 align:middle line:90%
"Bulletproof," it's all over.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: Yeah, and a new
coffee coming is called danger

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.960 align:middle line:84%
coffee, which has a
bunch of minerals in it.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk
about minerals, too,

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:32.820 align:middle line:90%
and how important those are.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:33.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, danger coffee.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:33.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.670 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: Because-- it's called
danger because who knows what

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:36.470 align:middle line:90%
you might do?

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:37.620 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But let's talk
about this philosophically,

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.700 align:middle line:84%
whether at that moment,
if you have 20 minutes,

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.480 align:middle line:84%
should you close your eyes,
and just let the world go,

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.230 align:middle line:84%
and take some deep
breaths, rest a little,

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.880 align:middle line:84%
maybe even have a cat nap, or
should you have another cup

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:50.680 align:middle line:90%
of coffee?

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.087 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: Well, the
answer is it depends.

00:06:53.087 --> 00:06:54.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, what
does it depend on?

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.737 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: It depends
on your biology.

00:06:56.737 --> 00:06:57.820 align:middle line:90%
It depends on who you are.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And it depends on what
you're working on.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.040 align:middle line:84%
So if you're working on
doom-scrolling on Instagram,

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.510 align:middle line:84%
close your eyes
and take a break.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.490 align:middle line:84%
But if you're working
on a project that's

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:10.570 align:middle line:84%
going to feed 100,000 people or
something on a tight deadline

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:11.445 align:middle line:90%
that really matters--

00:07:11.445 --> 00:07:12.778 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So do it efficiently.

00:07:12.778 --> 00:07:15.340 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: Yeah, and you also--
you want to know how to have

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.720 align:middle line:84%
the energy to work
hard, to push.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.660 align:middle line:84%
But what we've
taught ourselves is

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.710 align:middle line:90%
that we should always do that.

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And when you always do that,
you do what I did in my 20s.

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:25.922 align:middle line:84%
I had a fantastic career
in Silicon Valley.

00:07:25.922 --> 00:07:28.033 align:middle line:90%
I made $6 million when I was 26.

00:07:28.033 --> 00:07:29.200 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, it's crazy.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.040 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: Lost
it when I was 28.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.180 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:32.740 align:middle line:90%
Oops.

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And what I found back then is
I was working all the time.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And it was just like, I'll sleep
when I'm dead was the mindset.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:40.180 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: Why would you burn
the candle at both ends when

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.143 align:middle line:84%
you could also light
it in the middle?

00:07:43.143 --> 00:07:46.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's just pouring
carbs and sugars into your body

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.060 align:middle line:84%
trying to keep your brain
alive for the next thing.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.980 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: And it turns out our
bodies are not designed that

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:52.780 align:middle line:90%
way.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.800 align:middle line:84%
Everything in nature
evolves for the idea

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.927 align:middle line:84%
that you need to work
hard and you need to rest.

00:07:59.927 --> 00:08:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
professional athletes

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:05.140 align:middle line:84%
do, the ones who are now
professionals in their 40s.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.800 align:middle line:84%
Like Nick Foles has written
some stuff in some of my books.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.210 align:middle line:90%
Super Bowl MVP.

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:13.660 align:middle line:84%
But he trains like crazy,
but then he rests like crazy.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.180 align:middle line:84%
And what most of us do
is we get into this mode

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.388 align:middle line:90%
where we work all day.

00:08:17.388 --> 00:08:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And then we come home
and there's no break.

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And then it's time to go into
parenting mode and relationship

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:23.210 align:middle line:90%
mode.

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:25.280 align:middle line:90%
And there's never a break.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.910 align:middle line:84%
What I found in
"Smarter, Not Harder"

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.890 align:middle line:90%
is a new principle in biology.

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:32.919 align:middle line:84%
And it says that
it's not how much

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:35.169 align:middle line:84%
work you do that
causes you to improve,

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:38.799 align:middle line:84%
it's how quickly you
turn on full volume

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:41.320 align:middle line:84%
and then how quickly
you return to rest.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.581 align:middle line:90%
And doing this--

00:08:42.581 --> 00:08:43.539 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to shock you.

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:45.260 align:middle line:84%
I didn't tell you
this before the show.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.735 align:middle line:84%
I'm reasonably fit for a guy
who used to weigh 300 pounds.

00:08:47.735 --> 00:08:48.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You're very fit.

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:49.940 align:middle line:90%
Total transformation.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.070 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: How much exercise
do you think I do every week?

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:53.850 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, I know
a little bit about you.

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:55.610 align:middle line:84%
So I know that you're
super efficient.

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:58.710 align:middle line:84%
It's more animal-like--
what would you call it?

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:00.060 align:middle line:90%
Interval training type of thing.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.160 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: It's not
even interval training.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.077 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What is it?

00:09:02.077 --> 00:09:03.800 align:middle line:84%
So give us how many
minutes a week--

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.823 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: I work out
20 minutes a week.

00:09:05.823 --> 00:09:08.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So everyone's going
to want to know about that.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.320 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: And I'm
just going to--

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:09.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Look at that.

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: --do the
caffeine tattoo thing here.

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:11.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.320 align:middle line:90%
Caffeine molecule.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.120 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.410 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: This is how I
look as a guy who was really,

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:18.660 align:middle line:90%
really unwell until I was 30.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.500 align:middle line:84%
I used to work out 90 minutes
a day, six days a week,

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:22.670 align:middle line:90%
without fail.

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:26.245 align:middle line:84%
And I still had a 46-inch waist
after 18 months of doing that.

00:09:26.245 --> 00:09:27.620 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote "Smarter,
Not Harder,"

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:31.100 align:middle line:84%
because with artificial
intelligence, with the things

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.200 align:middle line:84%
we now understand about
our biology, the ability

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:38.180 align:middle line:84%
to monitor and measure,
you can save so much time

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:40.810 align:middle line:84%
that now you can have
a meditation practice,

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:42.560 align:middle line:84%
you can spend quality
time with your kids.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And people actually have
a hard time believing it.

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.820 align:middle line:84%
So I started a company
called Upgrade Labs,

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.170 align:middle line:90%
the first biohacking center.

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:52.020 align:middle line:84%
We're opening 17 locations
as a franchise right now.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.290 align:middle line:90%
So we're bringing this out.

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And that is the stuff the
crazy billionaires do.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:55.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What's
it called again?

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:56.910 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: It's
called Upgrade Labs.

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:57.960 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Upgrade Labs, OK.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.210 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: And you go in
there and we measure thousands

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:00.810 align:middle line:90%
of data points.

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:01.685 align:middle line:90%
You stand on a thing.

00:10:01.685 --> 00:10:04.350 align:middle line:84%
We use electricity to measure
and get a clinical grade thing.

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:07.840 align:middle line:84%
Oh, so here's who you are
and how you are today.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.000 align:middle line:90%
And then what's your goal?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And what I found out, after
working with thousands

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.305 align:middle line:84%
of people over the last
eight years at Upgrade Labs,

00:10:14.305 --> 00:10:15.930 align:middle line:84%
is that some people,
they actually want

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:16.890 align:middle line:90%
their brain to work.

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And some people, they
want to lose the fat.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.160 align:middle line:84%
Some people want
their energy back.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.980 align:middle line:84%
Some people want to
live forever, like me.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And some people just want to
manage their stress better.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.740 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the people
who say, I want to be stronger.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:27.630 align:middle line:90%
I want endurance.

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:29.195 align:middle line:90%
Those are different goals.

00:10:29.195 --> 00:10:31.320 align:middle line:84%
So we help people figure
out, what's your top goal?

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.487 align:middle line:90%
What's your number two goal?

00:10:32.487 --> 00:10:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And the whole "Smarter,
Not Harder" book

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:36.090 align:middle line:84%
is about let's figure out
what matters most to you,

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:37.548 align:middle line:84%
and let's figure
out where you are.

00:10:37.548 --> 00:10:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And then let's
figure out what you

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:42.252 align:middle line:84%
can do that takes the least
time to get you there.

00:10:42.252 --> 00:10:43.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It sounds
to me, though,

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:47.850 align:middle line:84%
regardless of what you're there
for, the same systems are going

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:50.080 align:middle line:84%
to work and affect all of
those aspects of your life,

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:50.880 align:middle line:90%
more or less.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:51.930 align:middle line:90%
>> ASPREY: More or less.

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:52.200 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.040 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: So what we
do is we figure out, OK,

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.207 align:middle line:90%
what are your top two goals?

00:10:55.207 --> 00:10:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And then we pick the right
technologies that are

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.270 align:middle line:84%
at Upgrade Labs-- and I write
how to do this stuff at home

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:01.070 align:middle line:90%
in the book--

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:04.410 align:middle line:84%
and then how do you know
how much of each one

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:05.820 align:middle line:90%
to do to get there fastest.

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And here's an example, if you
were to do what I used to do

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:10.920 align:middle line:84%
and you say, well, I
want to lose weight,

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.590 align:middle line:84%
I heard that cardio makes you
lose weight-- it doesn't--

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.870 align:middle line:84%
but you might say I'm going to
do an hour of spin class five

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:17.670 align:middle line:90%
days a week.

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:19.470 align:middle line:84%
That's a pretty
aggressive regimen.

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:23.100 align:middle line:84%
If you do that for
two months straight,

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.890 align:middle line:90%
you will improve by 2%.

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:26.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: 2%?

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:27.940 align:middle line:90%
>> ASPREY: That's all you get.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:28.800 align:middle line:90%
And you sweated.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.840 align:middle line:84%
You had to do all that laundry,
take all those showers.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.280 align:middle line:84%
Someone was yelling
at the spin class.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.750 align:middle line:84%
You're pedaling because
the people behind you

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:35.130 align:middle line:84%
are going to make fun of
you if you stop pedaling.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:36.720 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, yeah,
no, I find it frenetic.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.387 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: If you do what I talk
about in "Smarter, Not Harder,"

00:11:39.387 --> 00:11:41.100 align:middle line:84%
in 15 minutes a week,
without sweating,

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.277 align:middle line:90%
you'll improve by 12%.

00:11:42.277 --> 00:11:43.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Just give
us a little hint,

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:46.110 align:middle line:84%
because right now I think every
single person watching this is

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:47.568 align:middle line:84%
going to buy
"Smarter, Not Harder."

00:11:47.568 --> 00:11:49.915 align:middle line:84%
So give us a little hint
about the type of exercise

00:11:49.915 --> 00:11:50.790 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about.

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: This is an artificial
intelligence-driven thing

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:55.470 align:middle line:90%
called REHIT.

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:58.493 align:middle line:84%
And you can do it-- it's
best on the kind of bike,

00:11:58.493 --> 00:11:59.910 align:middle line:84%
but I teach people
in the book how

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:01.890 align:middle line:90%
to do something close at home.

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's based on that
principle that you

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:07.170 align:middle line:84%
have to exhaust your
system as fast as possible

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:09.973 align:middle line:84%
and then return to baseline
as fast as possible.

00:12:09.973 --> 00:12:12.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So I mean, interval
training kind of does that,

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:12.600 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: Interval training
doesn't do it very well.

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Doesn't do it well.

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.300 align:middle line:84%
So tell us what's wrong with
that, because a lot of people

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:20.100 align:middle line:90%
are propounding that.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.780 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: I used to, 10 years
ago, that was what I was into.

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:23.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I know.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.538 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: Because interval
training is better than chronic

00:12:25.538 --> 00:12:27.920 align:middle line:90%
cardio, going for long run.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.640 align:middle line:84%
Your body wants to get
a signal like this.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.130 align:middle line:84%
I was walking along
really slowly.

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:34.540 align:middle line:90%
And then a tiger came.

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:35.600 align:middle line:90%
And then you run.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And when you're at
Upgrade Labs, we

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:40.870 align:middle line:84%
have the bike turn all the
way up for just 20 seconds.

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:42.982 align:middle line:84%
And this is-- say you're
doing this in a park.

00:12:42.982 --> 00:12:44.440 align:middle line:84%
Walking slower than
is comfortable.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And then you run like crazy
until like you're going to die.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And it should be 20-30
seconds of full output.

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:51.520 align:middle line:84%
You have to get
away from the tiger.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And then you lay
down on your back

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.500 align:middle line:90%
and do slow, deep box breaths.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.390 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is to show
your body two things.

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:01.180 align:middle line:90%
Number one, there are predators.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.920 align:middle line:84%
Number two, you got
away and you're safe.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:03.310 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:05.643 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: If you do that,
and you have enough minerals,

00:13:05.643 --> 00:13:09.130 align:middle line:84%
enough fat soluble vitamins, and
enough of the other nutrients,

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:12.880 align:middle line:84%
like proteins and good fats and
some carbs, the body says, oh,

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:16.520 align:middle line:84%
there was a stressor, I'm
safe, and I have nutrients.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.010 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm going to adapt.

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:19.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to change.

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:20.710 align:middle line:84%
But if you do
interval training--

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:21.903 align:middle line:90%
I ran away from the tiger.

00:13:21.903 --> 00:13:23.320 align:middle line:84%
I didn't get a
chance to get safe.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.350 align:middle line:90%
Then I ran away from the tiger.

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:24.580 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:25.870 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: And you send your
body a signal you're being

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:26.590 align:middle line:90%
hunted.

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:28.465 align:middle line:84%
And when your body thinks
you're being hunted

00:13:28.465 --> 00:13:32.030 align:middle line:84%
and you're not getting away,
even when you relax at the end,

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:32.840 align:middle line:90%
the body says--

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's still
going to maintain the fats

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.830 align:middle line:84%
and everything it needs
to survive long-term.

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:38.150 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: It's not
going to put on muscle.

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:40.745 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to change your
metabolism because it thinks

00:13:40.745 --> 00:13:41.870 align:middle line:90%
you might get hunted again.

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:42.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: It's a signal
of full-out and then safety

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:45.810 align:middle line:90%
and nutrition.

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:47.690 align:middle line:84%
So if you're nourished,
and you're safe,

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:50.900 align:middle line:84%
right after a super intense,
super short workout--

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:54.530 align:middle line:84%
but think about it, you can do
cardio in the amount of time

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:56.138 align:middle line:90%
it takes to brush your teeth--

00:13:56.138 --> 00:13:58.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about three
five-minute sessions per week--

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:01.160 align:middle line:84%
and get six times better results
than spending five hours.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:01.730 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: This is crazy.

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:03.260 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, you
have nice biceps.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:04.497 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:14:04.497 --> 00:14:06.830 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: Well, there's also
something called the cheat

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:07.280 align:middle line:90%
machine.

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And in "Smarter, Not Harder,"
I talk about five technologies

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:12.657 align:middle line:84%
that put muscle on faster
than what we've always done.

00:14:12.657 --> 00:14:13.490 align:middle line:90%
So think about this.

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:15.410 align:middle line:84%
The two kinds of
exercise in human history

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:18.830 align:middle line:84%
are pick up rocks and
run away from tigers.

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:19.880 align:middle line:90%
Cardio and weights.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.500 align:middle line:84%
So today, our
biggest innovation is

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.110 align:middle line:84%
we concentrate the rocks into
iron bars and we pick those up.

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:24.680 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:25.880 align:middle line:90%
>> ASPREY: Better than nothing.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.840 align:middle line:84%
But you tend to get
injured when you do that.

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:31.340 align:middle line:84%
So what I like to do is the
Upgrade Labs cheat machine.

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And here, you're fighting
against an artificial

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:34.820 align:middle line:90%
intelligence robot.

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And your body is
very well adapted.

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:38.780 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to pick
something up like a dumbbell

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:41.025 align:middle line:84%
or something, you're
fighting against gravity

00:14:41.025 --> 00:14:42.900 align:middle line:84%
and the body is going
to protect your joints.

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.983 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you're fighting
against something else,

00:14:44.983 --> 00:14:47.070 align:middle line:84%
like a resistance band
or against the artificial

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:49.080 align:middle line:84%
intelligence machine,
the body says, oh, I

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.250 align:middle line:90%
have to adapt differently.

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:52.560 align:middle line:84%
You can put muscle on
three to five times faster.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:55.690 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Resistance without
weight is better in terms

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:56.490 align:middle line:90%
of injury--

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:57.900 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: Resistance
without gravity.

00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:59.025 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Without gravity.

00:14:59.025 --> 00:15:00.820 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: So you're
resisting something.

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.293 align:middle line:84%
But the problem with gravity
is that if you throw a bowling

00:15:03.293 --> 00:15:04.960 align:middle line:84%
ball up in the air
and try and catch it,

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:05.940 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be really heavy.

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:06.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:08.627 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: So when you're
using these other systems,

00:15:08.627 --> 00:15:10.890 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't drop the way
the bowling ball would.

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.710 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: And then there's
a couple other technologies I

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:14.710 align:middle line:90%
write about in the book.

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:16.140 align:middle line:90%
One of them is very affordable.

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's useful for
people who can't pick up

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:21.420 align:middle line:84%
heavy things because of
joint injuries or just aging.

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:24.588 align:middle line:84%
In this one, you take
like blood pressure cuffs.

00:15:24.588 --> 00:15:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And there's companies
who sell these.

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And I write about
different brands and all.

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And you put them on your arms
and you put them on your legs.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:31.050 align:middle line:90%
And it--

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, I've
heard about this.

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:33.810 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: Yeah, it's called
blood flow restriction.

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying,
that sounds weird.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:36.480 align:middle line:90%
It is weird.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.772 align:middle line:84%
But here's the thing, with
a small amount of pressure--

00:15:38.772 --> 00:15:40.272 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to
cut off all blood,

00:15:40.272 --> 00:15:42.010 align:middle line:84%
just a little bit of
the blood-- then you

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:44.110 align:middle line:84%
can pick up the
2-pound pink dumbbell

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:46.330 align:middle line:84%
and your body adapts
as if you're picking up

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:47.320 align:middle line:90%
the 20-pound dumbbell.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:47.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wow.

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.200 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: So you put on muscle
and it actually raises growth

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:50.650 align:middle line:90%
hormone.

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And it improves
your brain function.

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:55.330 align:middle line:84%
It changes the signaling of
lactic acid and nitric oxide.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:57.518 align:middle line:84%
So if you were
aging, and you say,

00:15:57.518 --> 00:15:59.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to pick
up heavy things,

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:01.610 align:middle line:84%
you could pick up a pair of
blood flow restriction bands.

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And then you could do
something very lightweight

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:07.150 align:middle line:84%
and magically
muscles just turn on.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:08.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: All right,
well, let's see,

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.010 align:middle line:84%
we've got only about
100 other topics here.

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:11.810 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:13.480 align:middle line:90%
Let's get to sleep.

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:16.660 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: Sleep is something
that I have a love/hate

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:17.680 align:middle line:90%
relationship with.

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.440 align:middle line:84%
When I started the
biohacking movement,

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.200 align:middle line:84%
I was vice president at a
publicly traded computer

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.810 align:middle line:84%
security company, because I am
a computer hacker by training.

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And I was starting
a global movement

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:30.130 align:middle line:84%
around taking control
of our own biology.

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:33.200 align:middle line:84%
So I only slept four and a half
hours a night for 18 months

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.000 align:middle line:90%
straight.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.530 align:middle line:90%
Not good for you.

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:37.840 align:middle line:84%
But I actually lost weight
and performed better

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:40.540 align:middle line:84%
and started a company
that's done half a billion

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:42.580 align:middle line:84%
in lifetime revenue
and has created

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:44.620 align:middle line:84%
multiple billion-dollar
industry categories.

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:46.493 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't think
anyone should do that.

00:16:46.493 --> 00:16:47.410 align:middle line:90%
It's not good for you.

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:50.050 align:middle line:84%
But what I have found, from
helping millions of people

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:53.290 align:middle line:84%
lose weight, is that when
people start biohacking,

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:57.460 align:middle line:84%
they almost always need
about an hour less sleep.

00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:00.080 align:middle line:90%
They're waking up fully rested.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.110 align:middle line:84%
I've been tracking my
sleep almost every night

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:04.150 align:middle line:90%
for 16 years now.

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And I sleep an average of six
hours and 32 minutes per night.

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And people say, but
that's not enough.

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:13.270 align:middle line:84%
I heard you need eight or
even nine hours of sleep.

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:15.099 align:middle line:84%
There are three
studies now looking

00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:17.530 align:middle line:84%
at more than a million
people each over time

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:19.270 align:middle line:90%
and the data is very clear.

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:21.310 align:middle line:84%
People who sleep
eight hours a night

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:23.685 align:middle line:84%
die more often than people
who sleep six and a half hours

00:17:23.685 --> 00:17:24.485 align:middle line:90%
a night.

00:17:24.485 --> 00:17:26.450 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
longest-lived people live.

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:27.533 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Die more often.

00:17:27.533 --> 00:17:28.420 align:middle line:90%
You mean younger.

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:31.690 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: They just have
a higher overall mortality.

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:33.830 align:middle line:84%
The reason for this is not
that getting less sleep

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:34.630 align:middle line:90%
is good for you.

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:35.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: Healthy people
making energy properly need less

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:38.870 align:middle line:90%
sleep.

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:42.070 align:middle line:84%
So you change the
quality of your biology

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:44.753 align:middle line:84%
and you just naturally
wake up and you feel great.

00:17:44.753 --> 00:17:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And since I've been
monitoring my sleep,

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:49.540 align:middle line:84%
first with a headband-- not
Victoria's Secret approved,

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:50.890 align:middle line:90%
we'll put it that way.

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:53.110 align:middle line:84%
Now you can do it with
a ring or a wristband.

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And you can measure, did I do
a good job sleeping last night?

00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And how many times have
you slept nine hours

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:01.670 align:middle line:84%
and woken up kind
of feeling hungover?

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:03.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had chronic
fatigue syndrome.

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.030 align:middle line:90%
I know exactly what that's like.

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:06.350 align:middle line:90%
And you have brain fog.

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:08.600 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even drink last
night, but I feel like I did.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.232 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's low quality sleep.

00:18:10.232 --> 00:18:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And there's things you're
doing before you go to bed,

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.900 align:middle line:84%
there's things you're doing
while you're in bed that

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:16.460 align:middle line:90%
lower the quality of sleep.

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:17.850 align:middle line:90%
Here's an example.

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:20.218 align:middle line:84%
This is one of those very
low-cost biohacks that's

00:18:20.218 --> 00:18:21.260 align:middle line:90%
in "Smarter, Not Harder."

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.420 align:middle line:84%
There's a study in Japan,
where they measured

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:25.400 align:middle line:84%
the effect of the amount
of light that leaks

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.200 align:middle line:84%
around normal curtains
in most cities.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.100 align:middle line:84%
Just streetlights
and things like that.

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:34.980 align:middle line:84%
It raises depression by 69% in
a study of 800 men in Japan.

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And probably more for
women because they

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:38.802 align:middle line:84%
tend to be more sensitive
to circadian rhythms.

00:18:38.802 --> 00:18:40.260 align:middle line:84%
But the study didn't
include women.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:41.950 align:middle line:84%
So you should get some
blackout curtains.

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:42.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
blackout curtains.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:43.740 align:middle line:90%
That's easy enough.

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:44.440 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: What
that means, though,

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:45.840 align:middle line:90%
is no light comes around them.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.400 align:middle line:90%
So Velcro on the edges.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And then if there's blue, or
yellow, or white, or green,

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:52.630 align:middle line:84%
any LEDs in your room, a
little bit of tape over them.

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:55.600 align:middle line:84%
So you actually
sleep in a dark room.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:56.400 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, it changes everything
about your sleep architecture.

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.860 align:middle line:84%
Turning off the LED
lights, getting dimmers

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:03.180 align:middle line:90%
or those little candles--

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:05.190 align:middle line:84%
LED candles at night--
dimming the lights

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:08.710 align:middle line:84%
before bed, after the sun goes
down, it'll change your life.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:10.920 align:middle line:84%
Another big thing
for sleep quality

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.990 align:middle line:90%
is having dinner earlier.

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:16.710 align:middle line:84%
I do my very best to eat dinner
before or when the sun goes

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:18.870 align:middle line:90%
down and to stop eating then.

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:20.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I agree, totally.

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:22.850 align:middle line:84%
So don't overload
your body with food

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:24.600 align:middle line:84%
and have it do a lot
of work before you're

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:25.650 align:middle line:90%
getting ready to go to bed.

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:27.480 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: Yeah, go to
bed without a lot of food

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:28.280 align:middle line:90%
in your stomach.

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:29.910 align:middle line:90%
You'll feel much better.

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:32.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So we're going to get
to an area that's going to be

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:35.140 align:middle line:84%
a bit controversial,
especially for this audience.

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:35.470 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:36.270 align:middle line:90%
>> ASPREY: OK.

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You were a vegan?

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:39.220 align:middle line:90%
>> ASPREY: I was a devout vegan.

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I was
a devout vegetarian.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:43.180 align:middle line:84%
So I did have eggs
and cottage cheese.

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:43.480 align:middle line:90%
>> ASPREY: Thank goodness.

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Things like that.

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:49.240 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless,
after almost 20 years,

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.448 align:middle line:90%
I had severe problems starting.

00:19:51.448 --> 00:19:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And not only that--
this is horrible,

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:55.780 align:middle line:84%
but I was driving down the
freeway and there was this

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:58.030 align:middle line:84%
Sizzler ad between
Sedona and Cottonwood,

00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:59.600 align:middle line:84%
and I started
salivating back here--

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:00.400 align:middle line:90%
>> ASPREY: Oh, wow.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --looking
at that ad of steaks.

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, no,
what's going on?

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:07.863 align:middle line:84%
So you pick the
story up from here.

00:20:07.863 --> 00:20:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: Well, I have
tried just about every diet.

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I came out with
the "Bulletproof Diet," which

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:16.420 align:middle line:84%
has helped millions of people
lose weight over the years.

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:18.640 align:middle line:90%
And I tried Atkins.

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:19.510 align:middle line:90%
I tried Keto.

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:20.980 align:middle line:90%
I tried the Zone diet.

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:22.880 align:middle line:90%
I tried vegetarian.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And then I said, well, I'm
going to become a vegan and then

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:26.470 align:middle line:90%
a raw vegan.

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:28.120 align:middle line:90%
And this was in the early 2000s.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:31.150 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- there wasn't
as big of a push for it

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:32.230 align:middle line:90%
from big food companies.

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:33.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:35.500 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: And what I found
was at first I felt amazing.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know that the
reason you feel amazing

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:40.880 align:middle line:84%
when you go vegan is that the
body goes into stress mode

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.805 align:middle line:84%
and it turns up your
thyroid hormone.

00:20:42.805 --> 00:20:43.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: So when you have
more thyroid, you feel good.

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:46.603 align:middle line:90%
It lasts for about six weeks.

00:20:46.603 --> 00:20:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And after that, your
body can't do it anymore.

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.830 align:middle line:84%
It gave you the thyroid
so you could go hunting

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:52.000 align:middle line:90%
to find some meat.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.960 align:middle line:84%
But when I was a vegan,
I had all the things

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:55.960 align:middle line:90%
that happened to vegans.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.847 align:middle line:84%
80% of people who go vegan stop
because it ruins their health.

00:20:58.847 --> 00:21:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And it can take years, like
it did for me, to come back.

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:05.020 align:middle line:84%
So what happened was I
said, well, I felt so good.

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:07.250 align:middle line:84%
I already am convinced
that the vegan diet is it.

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And then I started getting
really bad joint pain and pain

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:12.820 align:middle line:90%
in my muscles and my back.

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And then I start
getting brain fog.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.833 align:middle line:84%
And then I said,
huh, that's weird.

00:21:17.833 --> 00:21:19.250 align:middle line:84%
So you double down
on being vegan.

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:21.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And then your
personality changed a little

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:22.730 align:middle line:84%
bit, a little
grumpier, a little--

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:23.570 align:middle line:90%
what happened?

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: Yeah, you become
unable to manage your emotions.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:29.420 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening
biochemically

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:32.240 align:middle line:84%
is that your brain is
struggling to make energy.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.970 align:middle line:84%
When your cells can make
full power-- and your cells

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:37.750 align:middle line:84%
need fat and animal
protein to do this.

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And I know that's not
politically correct.

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.300 align:middle line:90%
That's just what science says.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And I did not believe
any of these things.

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.110 align:middle line:84%
I had to discover them
through my own suffering.

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And when you don't
make enough energy,

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:51.680 align:middle line:84%
the brain says, huh, what's
the part of my thinking

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.660 align:middle line:84%
that's unnecessary for
me to survive because I

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:55.200 align:middle line:90%
don't have enough power?

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.870 align:middle line:90%
It's emotional regulation.

00:21:56.870 --> 00:22:01.190 align:middle line:84%
And so things start to feel
like they're triggering to you.

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:02.270 align:middle line:90%
Or that's Everest.

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:04.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have to
climb this mountain.

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:06.950 align:middle line:84%
When you're at full power,
it's just a foothill.

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:10.640 align:middle line:84%
So this is why there are those
stereotypes about vegans--

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:14.390 align:middle line:84%
and I say this lovingly
as a former vegan--

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:16.460 align:middle line:90%
about emotional regulation.

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:18.350 align:middle line:90%
It's because it's real.

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:19.700 align:middle line:90%
And yes, you do get the glow.

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:21.410 align:middle line:90%
The glow is I have to eat.

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:22.565 align:middle line:90%
And the glow goes away.

00:22:22.565 --> 00:22:23.690 align:middle line:90%
And then you get thin hair.

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:25.940 align:middle line:90%
And for me, I got--

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:28.670 align:middle line:84%
actually, I shattered two
teeth just eating normal foods

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:32.060 align:middle line:84%
because vegan diets
deplete minerals.

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And this is why in
"Smarter, Not Harder,"

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:36.080 align:middle line:84%
there's a whole chapter about
how to get minerals back

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:38.680 align:middle line:84%
in your body, because all
these plant-based foods steal

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:39.680 align:middle line:90%
minerals from your body.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, we're going to
get into everything they do.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.070 align:middle line:84%
Some of the chemicals
in them and so forth.

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:43.670 align:middle line:90%
>> ASPREY: It's crazy.

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:44.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is crazy.

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:48.290 align:middle line:84%
So you-- then what happened
after you were vegan,

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:49.910 align:middle line:90%
what was the next transition?

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:54.200 align:middle line:10%
>> ASPREY: Well, I decided that
I was going to go to remote

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:58.160 align:middle line:10%
parts of Tibet to learn
meditation from the masters.

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.740 align:middle line:84%
So I have an active personal
development practice.

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:03.380 align:middle line:84%
I have a neuroscience mystery
school called 40 Years of Zen,

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:05.340 align:middle line:84%
where we measure brain waves
to put you in advanced state.

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:06.380 align:middle line:90%
So I'm into this stuff.

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:08.060 align:middle line:90%
It's part of biohacking.

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:09.950 align:middle line:90%
And I went there to learn.

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:13.117 align:middle line:84%
And I realized I can't be a
vegan or a raw vegan here.

00:23:13.117 --> 00:23:15.200 align:middle line:84%
What am I going to eat,
like raw yak or something?

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.250 align:middle line:90%
There's no food.

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:17.700 align:middle line:90%
There's basically no food there.

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:21.480 align:middle line:84%
So I stopped being a vegan,
and I started feeling better.

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:24.500 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I had a bowl
of yak butter tea, which

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.638 align:middle line:84%
is by definition not
vegan, on the side

00:23:26.638 --> 00:23:29.180 align:middle line:84%
of Mount Kailash, which is the
holiest mountain in the world.

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:30.830 align:middle line:90%
And it turned my brain back on.

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:33.060 align:middle line:84%
I haven't felt like this
in a couple of years.

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:35.563 align:middle line:84%
And that was the genesis
for me of coming back

00:23:35.563 --> 00:23:36.980 align:middle line:84%
to Silicon Valley
and figuring out

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:38.810 align:middle line:90%
how to make Bulletproof coffee.

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And when I started doing
that, my brain turned back on.

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And since that time, I
have been with hundreds

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:48.950 align:middle line:84%
of people who had their first
grassfed steak, sometimes

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:51.530 align:middle line:84%
in years, sometimes with
tears in their eyes,

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:53.210 align:middle line:90%
but they're tears of relief.

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:57.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I have to tell you
that's what happened with me.

00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:59.090 align:middle line:84%
I had gotten to the point
where my body was just

00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:00.230 align:middle line:90%
starting to shut down.

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:01.030 align:middle line:90%
>> ASPREY: Yeah.

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:04.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so I
went to a doctor--

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.330 align:middle line:84%
well-known doctor
who was British,

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:08.165 align:middle line:84%
but people didn't know
he was also a mystic.

00:24:08.165 --> 00:24:10.310 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: [LAUGHS] A
lot of the best ones are.

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:12.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so he was
hearing whatever his guides

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:14.210 align:middle line:84%
and my guides were
talking about.

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:15.752 align:middle line:84%
And I'd had a
meditation that morning

00:24:15.752 --> 00:24:19.760 align:middle line:84%
and I saw I had to eat
steak and have red wine.

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, but
I don't do that.

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:25.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm a committed
vegetarian and animals

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.420 align:middle line:90%
have every right to live.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, dyed in
the wool to my bones.

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Regina,
what I'm hearing

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:35.120 align:middle line:90%
is those two exact things.

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.470 align:middle line:90%
So he reflected them back to me.

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:39.510 align:middle line:90%
So I was crying.

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:43.730 align:middle line:84%
I had a little medium rare
filet someone prepared lovingly

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:45.060 align:middle line:90%
knowing the situation.

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And I had salty
tears on it because I

00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:48.890 align:middle line:84%
felt like I was so
deeply betraying

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:51.200 align:middle line:90%
myself and my beliefs.

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.990 align:middle line:84%
And immediately I
started feeling better.

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:57.950 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: It's funny, you'll
see tears before the meat,

00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:01.192 align:middle line:84%
and those can be tears of,
like, I'm giving up my identity.

00:25:01.192 --> 00:25:02.900 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, that's
what I was doing.

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:04.040 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: And after
you eat the meat,

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.990 align:middle line:84%
they're tears of
relief and gratitude.

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: And what I learned
on the side of Mount Kailash--

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:11.960 align:middle line:84%
actually right before I
got to Mount Kailash--

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:16.210 align:middle line:84%
I was at a Tibetan monastery,
and Tibetan Buddhists

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:17.837 align:middle line:90%
love arguing and debating.

00:25:17.837 --> 00:25:18.670 align:middle line:90%
It's part of their--

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:20.712 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, yeah, the
stomping and everything.

00:25:20.712 --> 00:25:22.240 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: Yeah,
it's fascinating.

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:25.855 align:middle line:84%
So I had spent 10 days
meditating at a monastery.

00:25:25.855 --> 00:25:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And then I went to a
new one and I said, hey,

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:31.120 align:middle line:84%
you talk about no
killing, but you have

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.220 align:middle line:90%
a yak skin on your prayer pole.

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:34.060 align:middle line:90%
You're a hypocrite.

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And he looks at me and
he's deep belly laugh.

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And he says, Dave, one
death feeds everyone.

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And that led me
to start thinking

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:45.680 align:middle line:90%
about deaths per calorie.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:49.370 align:middle line:84%
I run and build a regenerative
farm on Vancouver Island.

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:54.920 align:middle line:84%
32 acres with pigs, and
sheep, and chickens, and cows,

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:58.110 align:middle line:84%
and vegetables,
of course, trees.

00:25:58.110 --> 00:26:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And what you find is that if
you eat grassfed beef that's

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:03.320 align:middle line:84%
ethically treated and
ethically slaughtered,

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.050 align:middle line:84%
you will kill less than
one animal per year

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:08.950 align:middle line:90%
on a pound of meat a day.

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:12.670 align:middle line:84%
If you eat any one of those
vegan processed burgers,

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:14.920 align:middle line:84%
you are killing
thousands of creatures

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.120 align:middle line:90%
that have a right to live.

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:20.470 align:middle line:84%
We're talking turtles, bunnies,
salamanders, mice, shrews,

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:23.590 align:middle line:84%
and all the ugly ones, like roly
polies, and worms, and stuff

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:26.030 align:middle line:84%
that no one seems to like, but
they're necessary for life.

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:31.150 align:middle line:84%
So we have these monocrops
of corn and soy and wheat.

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:32.580 align:middle line:90%
They're sterilizing the land.

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And if they don't sterilize the
land, when the tractor comes

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.480 align:middle line:84%
through, there's always a
bunch of birds coming through

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.000 align:middle line:84%
to pick up all the creatures
that were chopped up

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.920 align:middle line:84%
by the tractors, not to
mention the ones that

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.280 align:middle line:90%
are poisoned by this.

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.430 align:middle line:84%
So if you can look
at a bowl of granola

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:48.060 align:middle line:84%
or a Bowl of cereal
that's plant-based

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:49.810 align:middle line:84%
and you think you're
not killing anything,

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:51.760 align:middle line:84%
I am killing less
animals than you.

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:53.710 align:middle line:84%
Because the entire
number of animals

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:56.470 align:middle line:84%
that killed for me to eat
this grassfed beautiful animal

00:26:56.470 --> 00:27:00.020 align:middle line:84%
that I nourished
myself, well, it

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:02.640 align:middle line:84%
was one, unless the cow
maybe stepped on a frog.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:03.440 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.670 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else died.

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:06.950 align:middle line:90%
And not only that, humans--

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:09.890 align:middle line:84%
and this gets more esoteric,
but I've done shamanic training.

00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:11.420 align:middle line:90%
I do a lot of spiritual work.

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.520 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
species of animals

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:17.480 align:middle line:84%
where we entered a spiritual
contract between our species.

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:21.590 align:middle line:84%
And for instance, dogs, they
protect us, we protect them

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:22.490 align:middle line:90%
and we nourish them.

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:23.365 align:middle line:90%
And that's our thing.

00:27:23.365 --> 00:27:24.890 align:middle line:84%
That's why you
shouldn't eat them.

00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:26.720 align:middle line:90%
Well, and horses, too.

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:27.890 align:middle line:90%
They work for us.

00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:28.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:29.345 align:middle line:90%
>> ASPREY: We protect them.

00:27:29.345 --> 00:27:31.250 align:middle line:90%
And then you look at cows.

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:33.830 align:middle line:84%
Cows, we nourish them
and they nourish us.

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:35.490 align:middle line:90%
Sheep, same thing.

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:38.300 align:middle line:84%
So on my farm, when
it's time for the sheep

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:40.700 align:middle line:84%
to go to slaughter, we
raise them very consciously.

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:43.550 align:middle line:84%
They will walk to the
part of the property

00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:45.750 align:middle line:84%
because they know
that it's time.

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:46.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Really?

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:47.350 align:middle line:90%
>> ASPREY: Yeah.

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:48.670 align:middle line:90%
And it's a sacred--

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:51.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, my guides told
me this many years ago, too,

00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:54.800 align:middle line:84%
that there are agreements
that we're not aware of.

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.840 align:middle line:84%
But it has to be
done consciously.

00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:01.340 align:middle line:84%
Buying something from
a big box store that

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:04.220 align:middle line:84%
isn't raised ethically and
goes through a horrendous

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:07.400 align:middle line:84%
slaughtering process, there's
no excuse for that either.

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: It also changes the
energetics of what you eat.

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:11.540 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:13.940 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: And what we found
was when we have these ethically

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:14.810 align:middle line:90%
raised--

00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:17.000 align:middle line:84%
sheep was the primary
thing we do on our farm--

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.070 align:middle line:84%
they walk around and they eat
whatever plants they want.

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:22.340 align:middle line:84%
So they're actually
choosing their supplements.

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:24.800 align:middle line:84%
One leaf of walnut--
walnut is toxic for sheep,

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:27.680 align:middle line:84%
but one or two leaves
is antiparasitic.

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.940 align:middle line:84%
They'll eat some raspberry,
but not too much.

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And people who don't
even like lamb,

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:35.210 align:middle line:84%
they'll go to the natural
store that carries our products

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:37.100 align:middle line:84%
and they'll buy
one packet of lamb.

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.517 align:middle line:84%
And they come back the next
day and they'll buy everything

00:28:39.517 --> 00:28:42.980 align:middle line:84%
in the store, because they feel
so different when they eat it.

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:47.210 align:middle line:84%
So to say that we're going to
remove animals from agriculture

00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:49.100 align:middle line:90%
so we can be vegan--

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:50.570 align:middle line:84%
these animals have
a right to live,

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:53.180 align:middle line:84%
and more importantly, those
animals build our soil.

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:56.000 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere on my farm
where these animals are,

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.550 align:middle line:84%
the plants are thriving
and the soil is thick.

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And where the animals don't go,
the grass isn't very healthy.

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:06.150 align:middle line:84%
So we need to rethink this
idea that a plant-based diet is

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:06.950 align:middle line:90%
good for life.

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:10.640 align:middle line:84%
No, part of what
makes Earth Earth

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.200 align:middle line:90%
is having ruminant animals.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And treating them with
respect and care-- the way

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:16.910 align:middle line:84%
you do that is you
buy from small farmers

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:18.500 align:middle line:84%
because they care
for their animals.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And you can do it at
the farmers' market.

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:20.240 align:middle line:90%
It's simple.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:20.440 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.240 align:middle line:90%
That's what we do.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.970 align:middle line:90%
I mean, in my town--

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:23.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm from a tiny town.

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:26.540 align:middle line:84%
You go to the hardware
store where the family

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:28.380 align:middle line:90%
has slaughtered one animal.

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:32.990 align:middle line:84%
They have a little case and you
can get their grassfed beef.

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And they'll just take one
down every now and then.

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And our little town
is well fed that way.

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:40.160 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: And then you thank
the animal when you eat It.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.330 align:middle line:90%
You have gratitude.

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And what happens then
is you live longer

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:47.070 align:middle line:84%
and you get the
minerals from it.

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:49.500 align:middle line:84%
So for people who are trying
to recover their health,

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:53.520 align:middle line:84%
if you do what I did and you try
to become a vegan, like I said,

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.960 align:middle line:90%
80% of people fail.

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.280 align:middle line:90%
And there's something else--

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:58.680 align:middle line:84%
and we'll move on to
another topic after that--

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:02.490 align:middle line:84%
a large part of the current
movement around the vegan diet

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:06.300 align:middle line:84%
is propaganda from the
animal rights movement.

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:09.240 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed the daughter
of the founder of PETA,

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.070 align:middle line:90%
Monica Hershaft, on my podcast.

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And she was a devout
vegan until she almost

00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:14.940 align:middle line:90%
died and had to sneak meat.

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And now she's an advocate
for eating grassfed ethically

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:18.600 align:middle line:90%
treated animals.

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:19.400 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:22.170 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: And she talks about
it on the show that this was

00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:24.630 align:middle line:84%
an emotional response to
seeing a slaughterhouse.

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And when they realized people
weren't going to give up

00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:29.520 align:middle line:90%
highly nutritious food--

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:32.322 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: --they started
making up a health story that

00:30:32.322 --> 00:30:35.400 align:middle line:84%
isn't real because they couldn't
make people sign up for this

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.970 align:middle line:90%
kind of cult-like behavior.

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:39.030 align:middle line:90%
So I say this very lovingly.

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:40.282 align:middle line:90%
I care about animal rights.

00:30:40.282 --> 00:30:41.490 align:middle line:90%
I care about the environment.

00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:43.365 align:middle line:84%
We need grassfed animals
to build soil, which

00:30:43.365 --> 00:30:44.730 align:middle line:90%
is our largest carbon sink.

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And I kill less animals
than any vegan I know.

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And I eat a pound or two of
grassfed ethically raised meat.

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:53.110 align:middle line:90%
And it works.

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:55.148 align:middle line:84%
And my quality of
life is so good.

00:30:55.148 --> 00:30:56.190 align:middle line:90%
And I feel good about it.

00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:56.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, I hear it.

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:58.170 align:middle line:84%
I've been through
that journey myself.

00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:00.570 align:middle line:90%
And I understand completely.

00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:03.600 align:middle line:84%
So now let's talk about what's
happening in the protein

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.030 align:middle line:84%
supplement industry, where
you can go to a store

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:08.520 align:middle line:84%
and they'll have shelves and
shelves of basically what

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:11.205 align:middle line:84%
look like Snicker bars that
are called protein bars.

00:31:11.205 --> 00:31:14.650 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] Everyone's
thinking, oh, I love it.

00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:16.110 align:middle line:90%
I get to have a protein bar.

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:18.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing something
good from my body.

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: Well, the big
food industry, a while ago,

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:28.350 align:middle line:84%
they worked with a guy from
UCLA who said calories are all

00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:29.250 align:middle line:90%
the same.

00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:30.960 align:middle line:90%
And he's still well known--

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:34.770 align:middle line:84%
Dean Ornish-- for promoting
this, essentially, vegan diet

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:36.780 align:middle line:90%
or very close to a vegan diet.

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:40.270 align:middle line:84%
And the belief there is since
all calories are the same,

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:45.240 align:middle line:84%
you can just cancel out a
Snickers bar with a Diet Coke.

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.220 align:middle line:84%
So saying that all
calories are the same

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:50.580 align:middle line:84%
is permission to sell canola
oil and corn syrup as if they're

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:51.930 align:middle line:90%
the same thing as a hamburger.

00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:52.770 align:middle line:90%
They're just not.

00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:53.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:55.755 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: Well, now in the
protein supplements business,

00:31:55.755 --> 00:31:57.460 align:middle line:90%
oh, you need to have protein.

00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:58.608 align:middle line:90%
Well, gluten is a protein.

00:31:58.608 --> 00:32:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And there is a
company out there that

00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:03.630 align:middle line:84%
makes Keto cookies
that are just gluten.

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:04.720 align:middle line:90%
This is not good for you.

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:07.830 align:middle line:84%
So different proteins do
different things to your body.

00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And in "Smarter, Not Harder,"
I go through the science

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.490 align:middle line:90%
in just one of the chapters.

00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And the amino acid availability
score for animal proteins--

00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:18.300 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter if it's
dairy or meat-- there's

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.467 align:middle line:84%
a slight difference between
eggs and dairy and meat,

00:32:20.467 --> 00:32:22.900 align:middle line:84%
but they're all substantially
better than plant proteins.

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:24.400 align:middle line:84%
So you have these
people are saying,

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:26.862 align:middle line:84%
well, this bar said it
has 11 grams of protein,

00:32:26.862 --> 00:32:28.320 align:middle line:84%
but it's plant-based
protein, which

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:31.620 align:middle line:84%
means it acts like 3
grams of animal protein.

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:32.585 align:middle line:90%
And there's--

00:32:32.585 --> 00:32:35.085 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And a lot of times
like pea protein and so forth.

00:32:35.085 --> 00:32:37.140 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: Yeah, I am
not a fan of pea protein.

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And
that's in everything.

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.500 align:middle line:84%
That's in most-- if you go
get a smoothie somewhere,

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:41.657 align:middle line:90%
it's usually pea protein.

00:32:41.657 --> 00:32:43.740 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: Yeah, and
sometimes brown rice protein,

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:45.240 align:middle line:90%
which is high in arsenic.

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.670 align:middle line:84%
These are not what
we evolved to eat.

00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:50.040 align:middle line:84%
They're highly processed
industrial foods.

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:52.050 align:middle line:90%
They're bad for the planet.

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:53.550 align:middle line:90%
And they're bad for people.

00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:54.690 align:middle line:90%
But they're low cost.

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And by giving them
a halo of health,

00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:00.870 align:middle line:84%
it's just like we used to be
able to sell in the big food

00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:04.358 align:middle line:84%
industry these diet
sodas and things just

00:33:04.358 --> 00:33:05.400 align:middle line:90%
on this idea of calories.

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.390 align:middle line:84%
Now they're switching to
protein and saying, well,

00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:08.100 align:middle line:90%
you got to have more protein.

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:09.600 align:middle line:90%
Let's put junk protein in there.

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.090 align:middle line:84%
The most precious proteins
come from animals.

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And you can do this as
a vegetarian just fine.

00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:17.460 align:middle line:84%
You can do it with eggs and
cheese or cottage cheese

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:18.660 align:middle line:90%
and whey protein and things.

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:23.580 align:middle line:84%
It's better to include red meat,
especially grassfed red meat.

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:25.920 align:middle line:84%
And doing that
usually makes people

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:27.850 align:middle line:90%
feel better very quickly.

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:28.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>> ASPREY: Yeah.

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:30.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, so
what about collagen,

00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:32.550 align:middle line:84%
because I know you were
using collagen protein.

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:33.350 align:middle line:90%
>> ASPREY: Yeah.

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:36.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Collagen and whey,
are those relatively OK,

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:40.230 align:middle line:84%
or is there some demarcation to
what's a good collagen protein

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:41.672 align:middle line:90%
versus a bad collagen protein?

00:33:41.672 --> 00:33:43.380 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: So when I
started Bulletproof,

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:46.080 align:middle line:84%
collagen was an
unknown supplement.

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And I made it into a
multibillion dollar industry

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.400 align:middle line:90%
category.

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And I did this by just
talking about the science

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:54.420 align:middle line:84%
of collagen. I've
been on the "Dr. Oz

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:56.170 align:middle line:84%
Show" and all kinds
of places just saying,

00:33:56.170 --> 00:33:57.160 align:middle line:90%
look, collagen matters.

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.890 align:middle line:84%
The reason collagen
matters is that it's

00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:00.330 align:middle line:84%
the connective
tissue in animals,

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:01.690 align:middle line:90%
and we don't normally eat it.

00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:05.260 align:middle line:84%
So by putting flavorless
collagen in your danger coffee,

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:08.050 align:middle line:84%
or in your smoothie, or
however you like to eat it,

00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:11.139 align:middle line:84%
you end up getting another
maybe 20 grams of protein a day

00:34:11.139 --> 00:34:12.250 align:middle line:90%
from animals.

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:14.590 align:middle line:84%
It's not the only animal
protein to eat because it's not

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:15.770 align:middle line:90%
a complete protein.

00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:17.949 align:middle line:84%
But if you eat grassfed
hamburger meat, which

00:34:17.949 --> 00:34:20.770 align:middle line:84%
is very affordable, and you
have some extra collagen,

00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:22.520 align:middle line:90%
then you've upped your protein.

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.347 align:middle line:90%
So I'm a big fan of collagen.

00:34:24.347 --> 00:34:26.139 align:middle line:84%
You can also, if you're
not allergic to it,

00:34:26.139 --> 00:34:29.050 align:middle line:84%
you can do egg white
protein, or just whole eggs

00:34:29.050 --> 00:34:30.460 align:middle line:90%
are cheaper and better for you.

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:31.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That whey--

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:33.370 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: Whey protein, as
long as you're not allergic,

00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:34.703 align:middle line:90%
whey can be really good for you.

00:34:34.703 --> 00:34:36.820 align:middle line:84%
You want grassfed
whey obviously.

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And when you do these things,
magically something can happen.

00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:43.840 align:middle line:84%
A friend of mine who was
on low protein and just

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:45.460 align:middle line:84%
didn't really know
it, I convinced

00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:47.770 align:middle line:84%
her to add whey
protein twice a day

00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:52.030 align:middle line:84%
and to get the number of
grams of animal protein

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:54.489 align:middle line:84%
up to 1 gram per
pound of body weight.

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And a week later, she
texted me and she said,

00:34:57.790 --> 00:35:02.840 align:middle line:84%
my entire life, since I was 18,
I've had an eating disorder.

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.660 align:middle line:90%
I would binge.

00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:06.830 align:middle line:84%
And I've just learned
to live with it.

00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:09.187 align:middle line:84%
This constant gnawing
hunger all the time

00:35:09.187 --> 00:35:10.520 align:middle line:90%
and it's just a part of my life.

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.853 align:middle line:84%
I know because I was the same
way when I was 300 pounds.

00:35:12.853 --> 00:35:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And she said, a
week after I started

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:17.880 align:middle line:84%
adding enough animal
protein into my diet,

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:19.000 align:middle line:90%
I lost the hunger.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.667 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what
to do, because I'm

00:35:20.667 --> 00:35:23.270 align:middle line:84%
not hungry all the time, and
I've never lived this way.

00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:26.150 align:middle line:84%
This is in one week just from
having enough animal protein.

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wow.

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:27.985 align:middle line:84%
Now I've got a little
challenge for you

00:35:27.985 --> 00:35:30.860 align:middle line:84%
before we get into leftovers,
vegetables and histamines,

00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:33.260 align:middle line:84%
because I'm afraid of
leftovers because it can

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:34.460 align:middle line:90%
cause a real problem for me.

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:35.910 align:middle line:90%
I can end up in a bad place.

00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:38.200 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't know why, but
you're going to explain why.

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:39.000 align:middle line:90%
>> ASPREY: Yes.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.258 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So I have a friend--

00:35:41.258 --> 00:35:42.800 align:middle line:84%
and I mean I really
have friends, not

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:46.400 align:middle line:84%
me-- who eats nothing
but basically chicken.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:49.400 align:middle line:84%
She eats chicken,
vegetables, and rice.

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:51.500 align:middle line:84%
But she has to get up in
the middle of the night

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:55.130 align:middle line:84%
to eat more because she has
gnawing, gut-wrenching pain

00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:57.370 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the
night she's so hungry.

00:35:57.370 --> 00:35:58.285 align:middle line:90%
>> ASPREY: Oh.

00:35:58.285 --> 00:35:59.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What's
going on there?

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:01.868 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: She probably
doesn't have enough good fat.

00:36:01.868 --> 00:36:05.090 align:middle line:84%
Or this happens to a lot of
people, especially women,

00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:06.980 align:middle line:90%
they just don't eat enough.

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:08.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: She eats a lot.

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.850 align:middle line:84%
She eats more chicken than
any human I've ever met.

00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:12.592 align:middle line:84%
Only-- mostly only
chicken, though.

00:36:12.592 --> 00:36:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: The other thing she
has going on is that chicken

00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:17.540 align:middle line:84%
fat, which is apparently
the only fat she's getting,

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:19.880 align:middle line:90%
it is high in omega-6 oils.

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:23.960 align:middle line:84%
Omega-6 fats are the same thing
in soy, soybeans and canola.

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:25.710 align:middle line:84%
This is why chicken
fat isn't good for you

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:28.127 align:middle line:84%
but beef fat is good for you,
because beef fat is made out

00:36:28.127 --> 00:36:29.650 align:middle line:90%
of very different things.

00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:32.650 align:middle line:84%
So what happens over time
in an all omega-6 diet,

00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:35.070 align:middle line:84%
which is what most people in
America get if you eat at any

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:38.460 align:middle line:84%
restaurant-- salad dressing,
and fried stuff, and sauces--

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:40.650 align:middle line:84%
is that your cell membranes
become compromised

00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:42.810 align:middle line:84%
and your energy
production goes down.

00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:45.850 align:middle line:84%
A primary cause of Type 2
diabetes is omega-6 oils.

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:46.650 align:middle line:90%
It's not--

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:46.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:48.690 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: It's not
just too much sugar.

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:50.640 align:middle line:84%
People who are metabolically
healthy can eat sugar

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:51.420 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't hurt them.

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:53.730 align:middle line:84%
I can have a large dose of
sugar and I'm just fine.

00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:57.488 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't do that 10 years ago
when I ate more omega-6 oils.

00:36:57.488 --> 00:36:59.280 align:middle line:84%
So an all-chicken diet
is deficient in fat.

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:01.835 align:middle line:84%
If she added grassfed
butter to her food,

00:37:01.835 --> 00:37:03.210 align:middle line:84%
she'd probably
feel a lot better.

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:04.627 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK,
thank you for that.

00:37:04.627 --> 00:37:07.505 align:middle line:84%
Now let's get to leftovers,
histamines and vegetables.

00:37:07.505 --> 00:37:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to tell us which

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:10.240 align:middle line:90%
vegetables don't hate humans.

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:11.040 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.220 align:middle line:90%
>> ASPREY: All right.

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:13.020 align:middle line:90%
Well, there's--

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:13.690 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's
start with leftovers.

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: Yeah, let's
start with leftovers.

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And I've written about
this for more than 10 years

00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:19.230 align:middle line:90%
and shared information about it.

00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:21.780 align:middle line:84%
When you have a
protein-containing food--

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:25.560 align:middle line:84%
this can be soybeans, this
can be fish especially,

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:27.900 align:middle line:84%
pork especially, but
even chicken or beef--

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:29.820 align:middle line:84%
when you put it in
the fridge overnight,

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:33.030 align:middle line:84%
a small amount of
microbial action happens.

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:36.610 align:middle line:84%
Leftovers get not as
good as days go on.

00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:40.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, when protein breaks
down, microbes make histamine.

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:42.440 align:middle line:84%
Histamine is a
cause of allergies.

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:45.340 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people today,
especially post-COVID--

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:48.110 align:middle line:84%
if you had COVID, you can be
more sensitive to histamines.

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:49.827 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
aspects of long COVID.

00:37:49.827 --> 00:37:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, very interesting
to note for many people.

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:53.200 align:middle line:90%
They're taking notes right now.

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:54.000 align:middle line:90%
>> ASPREY: Yeah.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.980 align:middle line:84%
So then you eat the leftovers
and you get really tired

00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:58.540 align:middle line:90%
or you really want dessert.

00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:00.982 align:middle line:84%
It's because the histamine
is a neurotransmitter as well

00:38:00.982 --> 00:38:02.440 align:middle line:84%
as something that
causes allergies.

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:05.710 align:middle line:84%
So you may feel heartburn that
isn't relieved by antacids.

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:08.860 align:middle line:84%
It's because it's actually
a histamine response.

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:09.850 align:middle line:90%
You may get flushing.

00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:11.500 align:middle line:84%
You may have a drop
in blood pressure.

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:12.940 align:middle line:90%
You may have joint pain.

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:14.210 align:middle line:90%
And I have this.

00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:16.990 align:middle line:84%
So if I eat foods that are high
in histamine, my eyes water,

00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:18.670 align:middle line:90%
I start sneezing and coughing.

00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And then I get tired
and then I want dessert.

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:23.320 align:middle line:84%
So I generally
don't eat leftovers.

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:25.720 align:middle line:84%
But if it starts to happen,
I take a little tiny bit

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:26.772 align:middle line:90%
of Benadryl.

00:38:26.772 --> 00:38:27.730 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:28.990 align:middle line:84%
We were talking
about this off camera

00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:30.340 align:middle line:84%
and you said you can
do the same thing

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:32.480 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to have a
glass of wine, for example.

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:34.390 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: A lot of people
do not tolerate wine

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:35.710 align:middle line:84%
because it's a high
histamine alcohol.

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:36.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: You're better off
to not drink or to switch

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.590 align:middle line:84%
to a distilled spirit that
doesn't have that problem.

00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:42.080 align:middle line:90%
But everyone likes wine.

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:44.715 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going to
have wine, even one glass,

00:38:44.715 --> 00:38:46.340 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to
take a whole Benadryl

00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:47.465 align:middle line:90%
because you'll go to sleep.

00:38:47.465 --> 00:38:50.450 align:middle line:84%
So you basically just nibble
off just an 1/8 of a Benadryl

00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:51.320 align:middle line:90%
or a quarter of one.

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:53.000 align:middle line:84%
Not enough to be
tired, but enough

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.040 align:middle line:84%
that when you drink the wine,
you don't get the burning,

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:56.540 align:middle line:84%
and you don't get
the tiredness, you

00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:58.850 align:middle line:84%
don't get the swelling of
the eyes or the runny nose

00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:00.320 align:middle line:90%
that you might expect from wine.

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, so we've
talked about leftovers and how

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:06.950 align:middle line:84%
they're producing histamines,
primarily proteins.

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:08.210 align:middle line:90%
You talked about wine.

00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:10.610 align:middle line:84%
What other foods-- because
I find that's true even

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:12.153 align:middle line:90%
with soups and vegetables.

00:39:12.153 --> 00:39:13.820 align:middle line:84%
If they've been in
the refrigerator more

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:15.740 align:middle line:84%
than a day or so, I
won't go near them.

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:17.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm just afraid of them.

00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:19.580 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: It turns out
that meat that's been cooked

00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:21.620 align:middle line:84%
for a long time, like
in a stew or a soup,

00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:22.743 align:middle line:90%
also will form histamine.

00:39:22.743 --> 00:39:24.660 align:middle line:84%
So some bone broth can
be really good for you.

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:27.080 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of bone broth
is full of histamine

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:29.270 align:middle line:84%
because of the
heat-based breakdown

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:30.870 align:middle line:90%
of the amino acids in the meat.

00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:32.960 align:middle line:84%
So if you take a
sip of bone broth

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:35.385 align:middle line:84%
and it just doesn't
feel right, then

00:39:35.385 --> 00:39:36.510 align:middle line:90%
don't drink the rest of it.

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:37.820 align:middle line:84%
It's not like all bone
broth is good for you.

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you can tell
because you'll get a bit

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:40.595 align:middle line:90%
of a burning in your-- yeah.

00:39:40.595 --> 00:39:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: Yeah, same
with fermented veggies.

00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:44.570 align:middle line:84%
So people say, oh, they're
really good for you.

00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:45.560 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:48.330 align:middle line:84%
But most of the time they're
not fermented properly.

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:51.590 align:middle line:84%
So if you eat a kimchi or
something, and you take a bite

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:54.410 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't quite feel right,
and your body doesn't crave it,

00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:58.220 align:middle line:84%
it's probably not something that
you actually want to be having.

00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:00.140 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very careful
with fermented veggies.

00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And if you take a little bit and
it causes that gnawing hunger,

00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:04.653 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't compatible with you.

00:40:04.653 --> 00:40:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that
your friend can eat it

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:08.600 align:middle line:84%
and they don't have as
much histamine response,

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:09.560 align:middle line:90%
we're all different.

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:09.890 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:12.320 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: And that's why
everything I do in biohacking,

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:13.560 align:middle line:90%
if this happens, try this.

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:14.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:15.720 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: I just want
you to get results,

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:16.700 align:middle line:90%
so you have your energy back.

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:18.362 align:middle line:84%
And histamine takes
so many people out

00:40:18.362 --> 00:40:19.320 align:middle line:90%
and they don't know it.

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And they go, I just take
a nap after my meal.

00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:22.770 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to do that.

00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:25.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's talk about
foods that do create histamines

00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:26.303 align:middle line:90%
in general.

00:40:26.303 --> 00:40:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: The foods that create
the most histamine are anything

00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:29.770 align:middle line:90%
with protein.

00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:31.940 align:middle line:84%
The worst two foods you
can eat with histamine

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:35.570 align:middle line:90%
are soy sauce and fish sauce.

00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And leftover fish is the worst,
followed by leftover pork,

00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:41.240 align:middle line:84%
followed by leftover
chicken or beef.

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:43.818 align:middle line:84%
So for me, I'll eat one-day-old
beef that I cooked myself.

00:40:43.818 --> 00:40:45.860 align:middle line:84%
But if it's more than a
day, I just won't eat it.

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:48.470 align:middle line:84%
It's not worth the
tiredness that it gives me.

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:50.120 align:middle line:84%
And some people
are less sensitive.

00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:51.537 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean
it's good for you.

00:40:51.537 --> 00:40:54.050 align:middle line:84%
It just means your body
robustly makes antihistamines.

00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:57.420 align:middle line:84%
But how much of that do you
want to rely on over time?

00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:59.430 align:middle line:84%
So there's a variability
amongst people.

00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you're
talking about Asian food.

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:03.290 align:middle line:90%
Soy sauce everywhere.

00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:04.090 align:middle line:90%
>> ASPREY: Yeah.

00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:05.423 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK, very interesting.

00:41:05.423 --> 00:41:07.340 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: When I eat
sushi, which I love,

00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:10.040 align:middle line:84%
white rice is a good source
of carbohydrate, fish,

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:12.240 align:middle line:84%
at least wild caught
fish, is good for you.

00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:14.570 align:middle line:84%
So what I do then is what
about a third of Japan does,

00:41:14.570 --> 00:41:16.490 align:middle line:84%
is you put a
sprinkling of sea salt

00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:17.673 align:middle line:90%
on it instead of soy sauce.

00:41:17.673 --> 00:41:18.590 align:middle line:90%
It solves the problem.

00:41:18.590 --> 00:41:19.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:21.170 align:middle line:84%
OK, thank you for
that little hack.

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:25.250 align:middle line:84%
Now let's get to phytic
acid and oxalic acid

00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:29.602 align:middle line:84%
and which vegetables
tend to not like humans--

00:41:29.602 --> 00:41:30.560 align:middle line:90%
>> ASPREY: Oh, my gosh.

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:32.977 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --tend to want to
protect themselves from being

00:41:32.977 --> 00:41:35.280 align:middle line:90%
attacked and eaten by humans.

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:39.500 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: So all animals and
all life on the planet runs

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.660 align:middle line:90%
this basic set of principles.

00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing we
all do is if something

00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:48.200 align:middle line:84%
is scary or a threat, you
run away from, you hide it,

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:49.800 align:middle line:90%
or you kill it.

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:53.180 align:middle line:84%
So you and I can run
away or stop a whatever--

00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:55.160 align:middle line:84%
a tiger from eating
us or something.

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:57.480 align:middle line:84%
But plants can't run away
because they have roots.

00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:00.560 align:middle line:90%
So they can only hide or kill.

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:02.810 align:middle line:84%
So if they hide, it's
something like a walnut.

00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:04.700 align:middle line:84%
You have to break
through that walnut shell

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:07.020 align:middle line:84%
and they have spines
and things like that.

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:10.250 align:middle line:84%
But what most plants
do is they evolve

00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:13.220 align:middle line:84%
toxic compounds that
stop their biggest

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:14.360 align:middle line:90%
predators from eating them.

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:15.738 align:middle line:90%
You can eat some of it.

00:42:15.738 --> 00:42:17.780 align:middle line:84%
But if you eat too much
of it, then you get weak,

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:20.072 align:middle line:84%
you can't reproduce, and then
you die so they can grow.

00:42:20.072 --> 00:42:22.200 align:middle line:84%
So we have this
beautiful balance.

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And phytic acid is present in
most grains and nuts and seeds.

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And when you eat it, especially
in oatmeal, when you eat that,

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:35.700 align:middle line:84%
it binds to the minerals
like zinc and magnesium

00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:37.840 align:middle line:84%
that are in your body and
calcium that you need,

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:40.470 align:middle line:84%
and it prevents you
from absorbing them.

00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:45.277 align:middle line:84%
And when farmers like
me feed natural foods

00:42:45.277 --> 00:42:47.110 align:middle line:84%
like grass to cows, we
don't worry about it.

00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:48.820 align:middle line:84%
But when industrial
farmers do it,

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:51.155 align:middle line:84%
they know that cows,
which can digest

00:42:51.155 --> 00:42:52.530 align:middle line:84%
a certain amount
of phytic acid--

00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:54.780 align:middle line:84%
there's so much in
this corn and soy

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:56.850 align:middle line:84%
that they have to give
the cows special enzymes,

00:42:56.850 --> 00:42:59.920 align:middle line:84%
otherwise the cows break their
bones and can't reproduce.

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:02.067 align:middle line:84%
Then they feed us
oatmeal and we can't even

00:43:02.067 --> 00:43:03.150 align:middle line:90%
protect ourselves from it.

00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:05.442 align:middle line:84%
And then we wonder why we
have osteoporosis and mineral

00:43:05.442 --> 00:43:06.415 align:middle line:90%
deficiencies.

00:43:06.415 --> 00:43:08.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Interesting
because that's a very,

00:43:08.290 --> 00:43:11.550 align:middle line:84%
very popular healthy way to
start the day for millions

00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:14.850 align:middle line:84%
and millions of people in
this country, and in Britain.

00:43:14.850 --> 00:43:18.480 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: Oatmeal raises blood
sugar as much as Coca-Cola.

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:19.770 align:middle line:90%
So does oat milk.

00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:22.810 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to have
food cravings all day,

00:43:22.810 --> 00:43:23.740 align:middle line:90%
start with oatmeal.

00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:26.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, gosh, we only
have a couple of minutes left.

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:28.540 align:middle line:90%
Let me just really quickly--

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:30.340 align:middle line:90%
you do vitamin--

00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:32.040 align:middle line:84%
I think you call
it DAKE, D-A-K-E.

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:32.740 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: Yeah,
let's talk about that.

00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:35.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's talk about
that and minerals really quickly

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:36.730 align:middle line:90%
before we sign off.

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: One of the primary
problems in humans today is

00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:42.820 align:middle line:84%
that we do not have
enough minerals.

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:44.320 align:middle line:90%
You can meditate.

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:45.730 align:middle line:90%
You can exercise.

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:48.970 align:middle line:84%
If your body says, oh, I got
a signal to get stronger,

00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:51.670 align:middle line:84%
all I needed was some zinc
and copper and molybdenum

00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:54.100 align:middle line:84%
and some other things--
vanadium, whatever it is--

00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:57.032 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't have it,
the body won't change.

00:43:57.032 --> 00:43:59.240 align:middle line:84%
Since your food is sucking
minerals out of your body,

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:01.900 align:middle line:84%
and the food we eat doesn't have
very many minerals because we

00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:03.400 align:middle line:84%
depleted our soils,
because we don't

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:04.840 align:middle line:84%
have animals
pooping on the soil,

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:06.350 align:middle line:90%
we've kind of broken the system.

00:44:06.350 --> 00:44:08.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's your job
to do two things.

00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:11.590 align:middle line:84%
Number one, you need
broad spectrum minerals.

00:44:11.590 --> 00:44:13.002 align:middle line:90%
This is in danger coffee.

00:44:13.002 --> 00:44:15.460 align:middle line:84%
When you drink the coffee, you
get broad spectrum minerals.

00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:17.230 align:middle line:90%
And you need vitamin DAKE.

00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:21.340 align:middle line:84%
You can go to vitamindake.com,
which has the info about it.

00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And vitamin DAKE is a specific
combination of vitamin D, A, K,

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:30.070 align:middle line:84%
and E. And the reason you need
these fat soluble vitamins

00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:32.800 align:middle line:84%
is that they direct the
minerals to tell them

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:34.430 align:middle line:90%
where to go inside the cells.

00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:37.005 align:middle line:84%
And if you go to vitamin DAKE
and you get the vitamin DAKE,

00:44:37.005 --> 00:44:38.380 align:middle line:84%
it's meant to be
very affordable.

00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:40.900 align:middle line:84%
It's about $20 a month
for normal doses.

00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:43.660 align:middle line:84%
You do that plus
minerals 101, which

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:44.830 align:middle line:90%
is broad spectrum minerals.

00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And then magically you
can have stronger bones.

00:44:47.650 --> 00:44:49.600 align:middle line:84%
You have a better
functioning metabolism.

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a huge fan of nootropics
and longevity supplements.

00:44:53.050 --> 00:44:54.580 align:middle line:90%
I take 150 supplements a day.

00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:56.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to live
to 180 or more.

00:44:56.980 --> 00:45:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And the least sexy,
least interesting

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:03.520 align:middle line:84%
are vitamin DAKE and minerals,
but they're foundational.

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Don't spend money on
expensive supplements

00:45:05.350 --> 00:45:07.060 align:middle line:90%
until you get those two covered.

00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost boring
to talk about them.

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:13.480 align:middle line:84%
But since the plants that
are now fetishized as healthy

00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:15.700 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that suck
minerals from you,

00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:18.250 align:middle line:84%
you will not be at full
power as a human being

00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:20.860 align:middle line:84%
until you get your minerals
and your fat soluble vitamins.

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, you don't get
those vitamins from plants.

00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:24.310 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:24.310 --> 00:45:26.470 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's walking
around with brain fog

00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:30.340 align:middle line:84%
and being mean to each
other on the roads.

00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:32.710 align:middle line:84%
So what is the best
thing we can do--

00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:35.865 align:middle line:84%
just if there's one single
thing we can do for our brain,

00:45:35.865 --> 00:45:37.990 align:middle line:84%
what's the best thing we
can do, besides everything

00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:40.690 align:middle line:84%
you've already talked about,
to eliminate brain fog and kind

00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:41.810 align:middle line:90%
of clear up and get--

00:45:41.810 --> 00:45:42.610 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:45:42.610 --> 00:45:44.020 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: We
talked about sleep.

00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:45.160 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: And we
talked about minerals.

00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:45.400 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:46.300 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: Those
are of primary--

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:46.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Huge.

00:45:46.570 --> 00:45:47.570 align:middle line:90%
>> ASPREY: --importance.

00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:51.490 align:middle line:84%
The next thing you can do is you
can find out which of the foods

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:54.520 align:middle line:84%
you're eating are incompatible
with your biology.

00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:57.188 align:middle line:84%
Most brain fog is
caused by eating stuff.

00:45:57.188 --> 00:45:58.480 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's the histamine foods.

00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:01.120 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's the oxalate
foods, like spinach and kale.

00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:03.490 align:middle line:84%
Even red raspberries and
almonds are high in oxalates.

00:46:03.490 --> 00:46:04.870 align:middle line:90%
Those can cause brain fog.

00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:07.210 align:middle line:84%
So it's not because
you lack willpower.

00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:08.680 align:middle line:90%
It's not a moral failing.

00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:10.473 align:middle line:84%
It's just because
something you're eating

00:46:10.473 --> 00:46:12.640 align:middle line:84%
is punching you in the
brain, and you don't know it,

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:14.060 align:middle line:90%
and you think it's healthy.

00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:15.940 align:middle line:84%
So what works for
a lot of people

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:18.017 align:middle line:84%
is the induction phase
of the Bulletproof diet.

00:46:18.017 --> 00:46:19.600 align:middle line:84%
Or if you want to
make it real simple,

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:25.570 align:middle line:84%
eat grassfed meat and sea salt
and herbs for just two weeks.

00:46:25.570 --> 00:46:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And maybe some white rice if you
really, really want some carbs

00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:29.150 align:middle line:90%
in that as well.

00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the two weeks,
you'll say, what just happened,

00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:31.730 align:middle line:90%
my pants got bigger.

00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:32.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:35.080 align:middle line:10%
>> ASPREY: Well, it's because
now something you're eating is

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:36.310 align:middle line:10%
bad, then you add the foods in.

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:38.140 align:middle line:10%
And then you have that green
smoothie you think is healthy,

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:39.910 align:middle line:10%
and you wake up the next
day and your face is puffy

00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:40.785 align:middle line:10%
and your joints hurt.

00:46:40.785 --> 00:46:42.520 align:middle line:84%
Oh, maybe it was the
spinach and kale.

00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:43.060 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Well, that's true.

00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:44.990 align:middle line:84%
You start with the
elimination of everything.

00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:47.605 align:middle line:84%
And then build back in because
our bodies will tell us.

00:46:47.605 --> 00:46:48.730 align:middle line:90%
Our bodies are intelligent.

00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:50.350 align:middle line:90%
We know when we don't feel well.

00:46:50.350 --> 00:46:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And like you say, everyone
has their kryptonite.

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And whatever your kryptonite
may be may not be mine.

00:46:56.350 --> 00:46:58.030 align:middle line:10%
But we have to
discover it or we're

00:46:58.030 --> 00:47:00.857 align:middle line:10%
going to continue living
a lackluster existence.

00:47:00.857 --> 00:47:02.440 align:middle line:10%
>> ASPREY: There are
similar patterns,

00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:05.080 align:middle line:10%
but the one thing you don't want
to do is go on a green smoothie

00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:05.880 align:middle line:10%
cleanse.

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:08.050 align:middle line:84%
The amount of anti-nutrients
and toxins in those

00:47:08.050 --> 00:47:11.038 align:middle line:84%
is so high that 10 days
of spinach and kale

00:47:11.038 --> 00:47:12.580 align:middle line:84%
can be enough to
form a kidney stone.

00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:13.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:14.627 align:middle line:90%
I knew Stanley Boroughs.

00:47:14.627 --> 00:47:15.460 align:middle line:90%
>> ASPREY: Oh, yeah.

00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:16.150 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:18.733 align:middle line:84%
And I had a chance to spend some
time with him before he died.

00:47:18.733 --> 00:47:19.840 align:middle line:90%
Lemonade diet.

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:22.100 align:middle line:84%
Again, putting people
into this blissful

00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:24.200 align:middle line:84%
state for a few days,
or a week or two,

00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:25.820 align:middle line:84%
and then you're
starving to death.

00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:28.250 align:middle line:84%
But that was-- I think
it turned a lot of people

00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:30.020 align:middle line:84%
on to the notion of
what happens when

00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:31.430 align:middle line:90%
you eliminate all the toxins.

00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And now you're saying just
go for some grassfed organic

00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:37.235 align:middle line:84%
meats, if you do
eat meat, and then

00:47:37.235 --> 00:47:39.110 align:middle line:84%
let your body tell you
what you can and can't

00:47:39.110 --> 00:47:40.190 align:middle line:90%
go for after that.

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:40.580 align:middle line:90%
>> ASPREY: Beautiful.

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:41.180 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Pretty much?

00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:41.980 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Dave, we have-- well, we could
talk for hours, and prebiotics,

00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:45.710 align:middle line:90%
probiotics.

00:47:45.710 --> 00:47:46.775 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes, yes.

00:47:46.775 --> 00:47:47.060 align:middle line:90%
>> ASPREY: Yes.

00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:48.018 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: But quality.

00:47:48.018 --> 00:47:48.900 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:50.630 align:middle line:84%
I've totally loved
talking with you,

00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:52.430 align:middle line:84%
and I loved our
pre-conversation.

00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:53.450 align:middle line:90%
And it's all wonderful.

00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And you're doing great
things for humanity.

00:47:55.350 --> 00:47:56.262 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:47:56.262 --> 00:47:57.470 align:middle line:90%
>> ASPREY: You're so welcome.

00:47:57.470 --> 00:48:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And remember, the Gaia course
and "Smarter, Not Harder."

00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:01.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:02.840 align:middle line:84%
>> ASPREY: So I'm teaching
people biohacking.

00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:03.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm teaching all this stuff.

00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:05.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I've seen
a couple of the shows.

00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And there's so much
information there.

00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:09.050 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:48:09.050 --> 00:48:09.990 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:12.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad you're here
with us at Gaia.

00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:14.810 align:middle line:84%
You can see Dave's new
series on Gaia titled,

00:48:14.810 --> 00:48:16.400 align:middle line:90%
"Biohacking with Dave Asprey."

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:19.283 align:middle line:84%
We just gave you a little nugget
of what lies ahead for you.

00:48:19.283 --> 00:48:21.200 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:22.770 align:middle line:10%
