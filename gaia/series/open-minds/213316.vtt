>>REGINA MEREDITH:
The world we perceive

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.910 align:middle line:10%
is but a fraction of the
reality surrounding us.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.580 align:middle line:10%
But there are some
people who can

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.460 align:middle line:10%
tap into various of the
normally unseen worlds

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.420 align:middle line:10%
and bring its wisdom back to us.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.720 align:middle line:84%
One such person is
Tanis Helliwell,

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.240 align:middle line:84%
who's been tapping into
the world of elementals

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.880 align:middle line:90%
for more than three decades.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.170 align:middle line:84%
She developed a relationship
with a leprechaun

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.570 align:middle line:84%
in particular who was the
spokesperson for his realm.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.850 align:middle line:90%
His name is Lloyd.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And from what I hear,
he's with us right now.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.047 align:middle line:90%
He just chose to show up, right?

00:00:44.047 --> 00:00:45.130 align:middle line:90%
>>TANIS HELLIWELL: He did.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.560 align:middle line:84%
And what the
audience doesn't know

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.350 align:middle line:84%
is that we had to do
this introduction three

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.507 align:middle line:84%
times because he kept
mucking with you.

00:00:52.507 --> 00:00:53.590 align:middle line:90%

Tanis, I'm so happy
to see you here.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.385 align:middle line:84%
We've only met virtually via
Zoom over the last few years

00:01:02.385 --> 00:01:03.760 align:middle line:84%
and we've developed
a friendship.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And I just love your work, and
people find it so intriguing,

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.070 align:middle line:84%

kind of playful.

>>REGINA: So let's
start at the beginning.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.612 align:middle line:84%
Let's start with
what became the book,

00:01:17.612 --> 00:01:19.820 align:middle line:84%
which is the foundational
piece called a "Summer with

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:20.800 align:middle line:90%

Tell us where you were in
your life, where you went,

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.640 align:middle line:84%
and how this
relationship developed

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.080 align:middle line:84%
before he brought his whole
family and everybody else in.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: I went
on retreat to Ireland

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.597 align:middle line:90%

00:01:31.597 --> 00:01:32.397 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:01:32.397 --> 00:01:34.737 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: Well, you
can imagine how that went.

>>REGINA: [CHUCKLES]

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.810 align:middle line:10%
>>HELLIWELL: And so I rented
a cottage site on scene,

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.950 align:middle line:10%
and it ended up being
haunted by the leprechauns,

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.670 align:middle line:10%
the whole family, in fact.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.110 align:middle line:10%
And the next day, I
went down to the village

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.030 align:middle line:10%
and they said you're
a holidaymaker.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.540 align:middle line:10%
And I said, well, actually,
I've rented the Douglas Cottage.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And they said, the
Douglas Cottage?

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.980 align:middle line:84%
Oh, did you not
know it's haunted?

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.090 align:middle line:90%
Oh, by what?

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.890 align:middle line:90%
I said.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.580 align:middle line:90%
Oh, by the little people.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.710 align:middle line:90%

happened to me and--

00:02:09.892 --> 00:02:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But wait a
minute, didn't Lloyd

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.670 align:middle line:84%
show himself to you,
and then afterward, you

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.310 align:middle line:84%
found out when you went into
town that it was haunted?

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.342 align:middle line:90%
He'd already shown up?

00:02:17.342 --> 00:02:18.175 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: He had.

00:02:18.175 --> 00:02:18.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: He'd shown
up with the whole family.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.962 align:middle line:84%
And I was just-- tried
to postpone belief--

00:02:24.962 --> 00:02:25.762 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:02:25.762 --> 00:02:27.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: --and
hope this was not--

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This wasn't part of
your enlightenment package.

>>HELLIWELL: This was
not part of the package.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And so then when the
locals even admitted

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.010 align:middle line:90%
that this was the case--

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, no,

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.380 align:middle line:90%
Oh, too bad.

now I'm going to want you
to write a book in 10 years.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.910 align:middle line:84%

to in 10 years what you told me?

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.535 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,

>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.960 align:middle line:84%
So let's start with his
explanation to you of who

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.692 align:middle line:84%
the elementals are, because
you have another book that

00:03:11.692 --> 00:03:13.400 align:middle line:84%
we're going to talk
about-- another time,

we'll do a whole show on it--
and it's called "So You Think

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:16.700 align:middle line:90%
You're human."

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's about our hybrid
nature as human beings.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Yes.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.720 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about this
particular kingdom of beings,

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.880 align:middle line:84%
the elementals, and what
their role is on Planet Earth

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.360 align:middle line:84%
and how they work with
humanity and would

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.095 align:middle line:84%
work with humanity if we even
acknowledged that they're here.

00:03:35.095 --> 00:03:36.200 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Uh-huh.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, elementals create
all form on the Earth.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.580 align:middle line:84%
So they built the
mountains and the rivers

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.320 align:middle line:90%
and the air, the plants.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.960 align:middle line:84%
Everything is built
by elementals.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And we know of them as
leprechauns or elves or gnomes,

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.310 align:middle line:90%
but--

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Goblins.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Goblins.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.930 align:middle line:84%
But people all over the
world talk about them.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.970 align:middle line:84%
In the Maori tradition, they're
called the children of the mist.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.320 align:middle line:84%
In Germany, they're
called kobolds.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.170 align:middle line:90%
So everybody knows about them.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And humans used to see
them, give milk to them,

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:19.040 align:middle line:84%
honey to them in
the morning, you

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.390 align:middle line:84%
know, give gifts to
ask them for favors

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.770 align:middle line:84%
and to be generous
with their crops.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: But
we've learned not

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.470 align:middle line:84%
to see, all except for young
children still see and they

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.710 align:middle line:90%
have these imaginary friends.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So is it Lloyd's
idea to come to you

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.400 align:middle line:84%
and help bring back the
awareness to humanity

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.230 align:middle line:84%
that their realm exists because
we're just completely ignoring

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.030 align:middle line:90%
them?

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.480 align:middle line:90%
And not only ignoring them.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're literally
ruining their land.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Even my father, when I told
him when he was still alive

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.070 align:middle line:84%
about meeting you and
talking about fairy mounds

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.920 align:middle line:84%
and such in Ireland, he said,
oh, yeah, we went to dinner one

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.560 align:middle line:84%
night and the locals told
us what happened to a guy

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.590 align:middle line:84%
in a tractor who ran over
one of their fairy mounds.

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.610 align:middle line:84%
Bad ending to the
story, by the way.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.060 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
where they live,

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.130 align:middle line:84%
what they're doing--
we're doing to their land,

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.940 align:middle line:84%
and why it's important we
reestablish relationship.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: Lloyd belongs to

He goes all over the world
with these other elementals

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.790 align:middle line:84%
and is looking for elementals
that want to partner with humans

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.940 align:middle line:84%
again, to be
co-creators, to make

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.450 align:middle line:90%
a beautiful and healthy Earth.

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:36.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: And so that is what
his and the group's intention.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:41.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: And we
used to, as you said,

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.780 align:middle line:84%
be in alignment with elementals,
but we have lost this.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:48.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:54.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: And elementals
are desperate to raise

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.180 align:middle line:90%
the consciousness again.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Hey, we're here and we're
supposed to be working together.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.057 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:06:02.057 --> 00:06:04.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are things we're
to be learning from them,

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:07.780 align:middle line:84%
but there are also certain
attributes of humanity

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.548 align:middle line:84%
that they're
aspiring to as well.

00:06:09.548 --> 00:06:11.090 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
that a little bit?

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.890 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Yes.

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.560 align:middle line:84%
We are beings of love and
they're beings of joy.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And they're completely
uncensored and spontaneous.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And when they look at you,
they see the potential

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.690 align:middle line:90%
of who you can become.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.990 align:middle line:84%
So they can do
that with an acorn

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.250 align:middle line:84%
and make it into
a beautiful tree.

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.390 align:middle line:84%
They can see it
with a human being.

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And they don't have
a sense of, oh, this

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:37.852 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't be nice to do
this to this person.

They just say, ooh, the
fast road would be this,

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.193 align:middle line:90%
and they go for it.

00:06:45.193 --> 00:06:47.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Their ethics
are a little different.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.000 align:middle line:90%
And they are like shiny things.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.800 align:middle line:90%
And they're amoral.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.150 align:middle line:90%
And they--

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.050 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Yeah.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --like you say,
take the expedient road

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.550 align:middle line:84%

a little bit of gold

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.055 align:middle line:84%

whatever, right?

00:06:57.055 --> 00:06:58.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: It's true.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:58.980 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And so what they're learning
from us is we have free will

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:06.530 align:middle line:84%
and we're beings of
love, or at least,

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:10.230 align:middle line:84%
that's what we're trying
to be, are beings of love.

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And so they are learning how
to soften their approach,

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.180 align:middle line:84%
be more loving,
and they especially

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.080 align:middle line:90%
want to learn free will.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.720 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because they're run
more by their inherited

from what I understand.

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:27.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Yeah.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I remember
at one point in the book,

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.930 align:middle line:84%
I think it was Lloyd
and his goblin friend,

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.590 align:middle line:84%
had gone into a watering
hole, into a bar

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:38.810 align:middle line:84%
and were taking
advantage of a human.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And some of the coins
would go missing

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.980 align:middle line:84%
when he put his money down
on the table, you know?

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:46.200 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] And some of the
coins would go missing.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And they were having a good
laugh at the human's expense.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.050 align:middle line:84%
But also, they were drinking a
little off the top of his beer.

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:54.530 align:middle line:84%
So can you talk about--
we can't quite imagine it

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:55.920 align:middle line:90%
because we can't see them.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.980 align:middle line:84%
So if anyone's going
to a bar in Ireland,

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:01.530 align:middle line:84%
they can begin imagining who
they have as unseen company.

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:04.645 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: Well,
elementals love Guinness.

>>HELLIWELL: Yes.

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And they don't see anything
wrong with going to a bar

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.300 align:middle line:84%
and having a swig
of the Guinness

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.960 align:middle line:90%

Nothing wrong with that at all.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.432 align:middle line:90%
And they make their own.

00:08:17.432 --> 00:08:18.890 align:middle line:84%
They don't make
their own Guinness,

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:20.677 align:middle line:90%
but they make their own poitín--

00:08:20.677 --> 00:08:22.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I remember that.

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:25.150 align:middle line:84%

like shiny things?

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:39.710 align:middle line:84%

something of our own potential

Can you talk about
that a little bit?

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.360 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Yeah.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.900 align:middle line:84%
They're interested in
helping Gaia, helping

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.300 align:middle line:84%
the Earth in her evolution as
well as a conscious planet.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:58.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: So as they're also
working with spiritual laws,

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.750 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual laws are
the same as natural laws.

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:01.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:03.630 align:middle line:84%

They've lost their footing with
the spiritual and natural laws.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.190 align:middle line:84%
It's because we're not
grounded any longer.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:17.730 align:middle line:90%
We move around.

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:21.020 align:middle line:84%
You know, some of us are
on planes all the time.

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:24.240 align:middle line:84%
Or how often have we moved
from where we were even born?

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.040 align:middle line:90%

We need to get grounded again.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And so if people want
to work with elementals,

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:46.010 align:middle line:84%
they have to look at,
are they grounded?

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:48.650 align:middle line:84%
Are they in their
garden working?

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:50.940 align:middle line:90%
Are they hugging trees?

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:53.670 align:middle line:90%
Are they walking on the Earth?

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:55.270 align:middle line:90%
Are they doing forest bathing?

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:56.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:10:02.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: These are all ways
that humans can become followers

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:06.530 align:middle line:84%
of the natural path and
that elementals would like

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:08.840 align:middle line:90%
them to do things like that

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Among all
these elementals,

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.210 align:middle line:90%
where do fairies come in?

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:14.267 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: Well, when
people think of fairies--

00:10:14.267 --> 00:10:16.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because most people,
they write books about fairies,

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:18.450 align:middle line:84%
and you see little
tinker bells and such.

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:18.770 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:19.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Yeah.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --what's that about?

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:24.263 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: Well, the little
Tinker Bells are more like--

00:10:24.263 --> 00:10:25.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like a sprite or--

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: Yeah, they're
more like a sprite,

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:30.410 align:middle line:90%
or they're not quite as--

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:33.780 align:middle line:84%
sorry, fairies, but they're
not quite as developed--

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:38.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: --as the elves or
the leprechauns or the trolls

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:40.498 align:middle line:90%
or the goblins--

00:10:40.498 --> 00:10:41.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or the dragons.

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: --or the dragons.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.183 align:middle line:90%
So you usually think--

00:10:44.183 --> 00:10:45.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A little
more ephemeral.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:45.890 align:middle line:90%
Just--

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:46.848 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Much more.

00:10:46.848 --> 00:10:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And you think of flower
fairies, for example.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:50.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: So that you'd
have a flower fairy that

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.800 align:middle line:90%
might be one for a dandelion.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And then there'd be another
breed of flower fairy

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.810 align:middle line:90%
that would be doing a bluebell.

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:01.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
it's more ephemeral.

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:02.580 align:middle line:90%
It's lighter.

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:03.660 align:middle line:90%
It's like Tinker Bell.

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:04.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: It is.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:07.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not the same level
of maybe conscious development

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.143 align:middle line:90%
that the other elementals have?

00:11:09.143 --> 00:11:11.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: Yeah, and
where would Tinker Bell

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.170 align:middle line:90%
be without Peter Pan?

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:13.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.660 align:middle line:84%
So I just had to ask that
because some people will

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:18.340 align:middle line:84%
be saying, well where
are fairies in the mix?

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:19.140 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:19.990 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: We like them.

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, we do.

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:21.490 align:middle line:90%
They're beautiful.

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And so coming back to what
we were talking about,

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:26.040 align:middle line:84%
this disconnection with
the land, the elementals

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.860 align:middle line:84%
are also aware that
humanity is about to go

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:32.252 align:middle line:84%
through a really great leap
in consciousness, right?

00:11:32.252 --> 00:11:33.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Yes, definitely.

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:35.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they would
like to be of assistance

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:38.400 align:middle line:84%
because our leap will have
something to do with their leap

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:38.920 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.180 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk about this?

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:41.340 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Yes.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:45.820 align:middle line:84%
People often ask me, well,
where are elementals?

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:47.710 align:middle line:84%
If they're Earth
beings, where are they?

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And they are in a
little higher frequency

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:52.660 align:middle line:84%
than our third
dimensional reality.

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:54.720 align:middle line:90%
So they're in an astral world.

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes there
are bleed-throughs so

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:00.300 align:middle line:84%
that we see them out of
the corner of our eye

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:05.910 align:middle line:84%
or we hear them, but we don't
see the concrete image as often.

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:07.800 align:middle line:90%
But we are now moving--

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.960 align:middle line:84%
human beings, I'm
talking about now.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:13.410 align:middle line:84%
Along with the Earth, we're
moving to a higher frequency.

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we should start
becoming more aware of them?

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.400 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Absolutely.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:18.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: And becoming
more aware of angels,

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:24.720 align:middle line:84%
becoming more aware of all
the different astral worlds

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:25.920 align:middle line:90%
that there are.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And so this is an incredible
time in our world.

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's wonderful that
all the people that are alive,

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:40.500 align:middle line:84%
we're all pioneers, kind of
bridging the old world where it

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.200 align:middle line:84%
was solid, three
dimensional, and moving

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.810 align:middle line:90%
into this astral world.

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So then
going back to Lloyd

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:51.510 align:middle line:84%
and going back to the
leprechauns in particular,

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:53.400 align:middle line:84%
my understanding is
that they had a-- they

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.630 align:middle line:90%
have a much longer lifespan.

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:56.550 align:middle line:90%
They marry.

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:57.840 align:middle line:90%
They have families.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.130 align:middle line:90%
They travel.

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And they go teach
in other places too.

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:05.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they are dispensers
of wisdom in their own right.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.770 align:middle line:84%
What did he tell you a little
bit about their structure

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:09.310 align:middle line:90%
as a clan and people?

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And then I want to have that
taken forward into free will.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:15.115 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: Well,
they live in clans.

00:13:15.115 --> 00:13:15.915 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:13:15.915 --> 00:13:17.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: So the
gnomes associate

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:20.370 align:middle line:84%
with the gnomes, the leprechauns
with the leprechauns,

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:21.880 align:middle line:90%
and the elves with the elves.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And each clan has its
own particular gift.

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:32.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, Lloyd's group is made up
with beings from all clans.

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.270 align:middle line:90%
And this is an unusual thing.

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:35.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:36.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Very unusual.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they're
trying to teach, I mean--

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:38.260 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: They are.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:38.975 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
they're ambassadors.

00:13:38.975 --> 00:13:39.400 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Yeah.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And they know that
humans are like this.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:41.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: I mean, we
have people marrying people

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:48.295 align:middle line:84%
from all over the world,
intermarriage, interracial

00:13:48.295 --> 00:13:49.095 align:middle line:90%
marriages.

00:13:49.095 --> 00:13:49.895 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:13:49.895 --> 00:13:52.650 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: And so they
are doing what we're doing

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:56.080 align:middle line:84%
and they're wanting to learn
how to work together as well.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.640 align:middle line:90%
So that's what they're doing.

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And this is all part
of this free will

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:04.050 align:middle line:84%
that they are
experimenting with this.

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:06.810 align:middle line:84%
Having never done it,
they're experimenting.

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And they don't look so much at,
are we a success at this, as,

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:14.880 align:middle line:90%
are we having fun?

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah
[CHUCKLES] Right, OK.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Yeah.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:19.640 align:middle line:90%
So they're trying out new forms.

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:20.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: And
with humans, when

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:24.300 align:middle line:84%
they're trying out a
new form, something

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.895 align:middle line:84%
they've never done before,
they're always thinking,

00:14:26.895 --> 00:14:28.900 align:middle line:84%
oh, God, I wasn't
very good at that.

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.080 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I should have stuck
with the old thing.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.680 align:middle line:90%
I was really good there.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.160 align:middle line:90%
And they're very self-critical.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, elementals
aren't like that.

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:37.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:39.238 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: They just
think, oh, wow, we

00:14:39.238 --> 00:14:41.350 align:middle line:84%
learned this and this
and that was fun.

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:43.570 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, well, keep on trying.

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:46.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So do they have
any sense, as humans do,

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:49.540 align:middle line:84%
of living kind of in a realm
between light and dark?

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:50.920 align:middle line:90%
Does that exist for them?

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.115 align:middle line:90%
Do these polarities exist?

00:14:52.115 --> 00:14:54.060 align:middle line:84%
Or Is it pretty much
the now and what

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:58.480 align:middle line:84%
they're experiencing in the
now and their own people?

00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: It is the now.

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:00.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: They
live in the present.

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And this is another thing
They have to teach us,

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:09.730 align:middle line:84%
how to live eternally
in the present.

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And when the present
becomes boring--

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:13.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:17.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: --they can change
it just like that because they

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.220 align:middle line:90%
do travel in space and time.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.218 align:middle line:84%
They just think
it and they do it.

00:15:21.218 --> 00:15:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
we're going, Regina.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:25.877 align:middle line:84%
And they've done
this many times.

00:15:25.877 --> 00:15:28.210 align:middle line:84%
When he, for example, brought
his family in to meet you,

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:29.690 align:middle line:90%
his wife and his kids, right?

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:30.130 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Yeah.

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:31.547 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They
just all showed up.

00:15:31.547 --> 00:15:33.350 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Yes, that's true.

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:34.540 align:middle line:90%
And he comes even--

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.080 align:middle line:84%
I live in Canada
now, and he comes--

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He comes
to see you there?

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: He sure does,
for his Earl Gray tea

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.010 align:middle line:90%
and his blackberry pancakes.

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:44.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, apparently, he
followed you here to Boulder.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:45.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: He did.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:45.760 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:46.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is he still here?

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:47.647 align:middle line:90%
Is he still behind me?

00:15:47.647 --> 00:15:50.717 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: Well, I did
ask him if he could be good.

00:15:50.717 --> 00:15:51.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, thank you.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: Yeah, because
things were running amok

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:56.615 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning and we
had to stabilize a bit.

00:15:56.615 --> 00:15:57.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, yes--

00:15:57.490 --> 00:15:59.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: But
our conversation

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:01.153 align:middle line:84%
is just going in all
sorts of directions.

00:16:01.153 --> 00:16:02.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it is, yeah.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:02.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Isn't it?

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:03.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:04.262 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: That is him.

00:16:04.262 --> 00:16:05.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is Lloyd.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.720 align:middle line:84%
OK, so in that--
along that line,

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.330 align:middle line:84%
after people read your book,
"A Summer With a Leprechaun,"

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:13.490 align:middle line:84%
then you started taking people
on tours to their territory,

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:14.290 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:15.090 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Yes.

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:17.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And another
book came out of that one.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:18.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: That
was "Pilgrimage With

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:19.260 align:middle line:90%
the Leprechauns."

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:20.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And it was kind of like
my tongue being tied.

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:25.800 align:middle line:84%
Everything was going wrong
from the beginning of the trip.

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.540 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was
hysterical reading it.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:28.680 align:middle line:84%
You didn't think
it was too funny.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Some of the people on the trip
didn't think it was too funny.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:32.660 align:middle line:84%
But apparently,
Lloyd thought it made

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.716 align:middle line:84%
it more interesting
for everyone, right?

00:16:34.716 --> 00:16:38.697 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: The working title
of that book had been hijacked--

00:16:38.697 --> 00:16:39.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [CHUCKLES]

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:40.905 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: --by
the leprechauns

00:16:40.905 --> 00:16:43.700 align:middle line:84%
because that's how
it felt. I mean,

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.500 align:middle line:84%
it started right at
the very beginning

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.340 align:middle line:84%
when we got picked
up at the airport.

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:51.350 align:middle line:84%
We've got this beautiful
new bus, spanking new bus.

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And one of the people comes
up to the driver and she says,

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:58.270 align:middle line:84%
can I get a-- can I get a
key to go to the washroom?

00:16:58.270 --> 00:16:59.275 align:middle line:90%
Can't.

00:16:59.275 --> 00:17:00.930 align:middle line:90%
oh, why can't you?

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:02.367 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's locked.

00:17:02.367 --> 00:17:03.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [CHUCKLES]

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: Well, but
could I have the key?

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:07.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you'd wanted
a key, you should have

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:10.926 align:middle line:90%
asked before you left Canada.

00:17:10.926 --> 00:17:12.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [CHUCKLES]

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:14.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: So here
we were, 30 people,

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:17.030 align:middle line:90%
and no washroom on the bus.

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:19.250 align:middle line:84%
So when we'd come
to a gas station,

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:22.339 align:middle line:84%
there'd be 30 people
lined up or, you know,

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:25.790 align:middle line:84%
on the side of the road, we'd
be headed for the bushes.

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:30.300 align:middle line:84%
And you know, this was just
the whole tour was like that.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:34.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, people stumbling
and falling and just went

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.220 align:middle line:90%
on a walk.

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And Lloyd was
having a good time?

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:39.850 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he was amused or?

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:41.100 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: He had a message.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.558 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
was the message?

00:17:42.558 --> 00:17:44.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: The
message is you are

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:52.130 align:middle line:84%
so stuck on your expectations of
what a trip to meet elementals

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:53.250 align:middle line:90%
is going to be like.

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And you think about these
happy little fairies.

00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And he said, but you've got
to give up your expectations.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.790 align:middle line:84%
You've got to live
in the moment.

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:02.748 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to have
a better sense of humor.

00:18:02.748 --> 00:18:05.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [CHUCKLES]
Well, yeah, so for some,

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:07.210 align:middle line:90%
it came harder than others.

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:08.110 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: It did.

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:08.910 align:middle line:90%
It did.

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:13.080 align:middle line:84%
But by the end of the
tour, most of the people

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:16.960 align:middle line:84%
had swung along to thinking
it had been all right.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:17.760 align:middle line:90%
Most.

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it
was an enjoyable--

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:21.780 align:middle line:90%
it was a fun book to read.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.750 align:middle line:84%
So among the elementals-- and
I just brought this up a little

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:25.650 align:middle line:90%
while ago--

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:28.760 align:middle line:90%
are dragons, right?

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And this is a theme that has
come and gone in your life.

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And right now, at this point
in human consciousness,

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:39.490 align:middle line:84%
when we're trying to transcend
to the next level of awareness

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:41.710 align:middle line:84%
ourselves, it
appears that dragons

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:43.907 align:middle line:84%
are coming back into play
and are important again.

00:18:43.907 --> 00:18:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And you're writing
a new book on this,

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:47.448 align:middle line:84%
but we're going to
hopscotch through some of it

00:18:47.448 --> 00:18:48.350 align:middle line:90%
in your own history.

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:53.602 align:middle line:84%
What I have here is a
dream you had about Babaji.

00:18:53.602 --> 00:18:54.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Oh, yes.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Uh-huh,
so let's go there.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: OK.

00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:01.990 align:middle line:84%
It was about three
decades ago, and I had one

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:04.570 align:middle line:90%
of those lucid waking dreams.

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:08.710 align:middle line:90%
And I found myself in a cave.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And I was thousands
of feet up in the air.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And I looked around, didn't
know how I'd gotten there.

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw these pillars
that I thought were pillars,

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:22.070 align:middle line:90%
and they were dragon's legs.

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:25.820 align:middle line:10%
And there was this
boulder, and it was an egg.

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:31.090 align:middle line:10%
And I realized inside
that this was--

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:33.550 align:middle line:10%
that I'd been in
that cave and that,

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:36.490 align:middle line:10%
somehow, I had this
relationship with dragons.

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And then speed ahead
to one year ago--

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:41.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:45.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: --and this
is where Babaji enters.

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:49.300 align:middle line:84%
I meditate regularly,
have done for a long time.

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:50.920 align:middle line:90%
And Babaji is one--

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Mahavatar Babaji is one of the
people that I meditate with.

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.770 align:middle line:90%
But he's never spoken with me.

00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:58.450 align:middle line:90%
Only taps me on the head.

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And he's about my
height when I see him.

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: Well, in
this particular instance,

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:09.130 align:middle line:84%
he pulls me up into the high
astral, very high astral.

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking
down on the Earth.

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And he turns to the
right and he says,

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:18.990 align:middle line:84%
you've done enough
on elementals.

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:20.620 align:middle line:90%
And I see another planet.

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:22.276 align:middle line:90%
And he says, what about dragons?

00:20:22.276 --> 00:20:23.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: And I shoom
right back into my body.

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:26.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.800 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: But then a week
later, he did the very same.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:30.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: You've done
enough on elementals.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.660 align:middle line:90%
What about dragons?

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:37.370 align:middle line:90%
And I looked.

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:41.110 align:middle line:84%
This time, I wasn't
so shocked, and I

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:44.450 align:middle line:84%
knew that the
dragon sitting there

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:48.357 align:middle line:84%
was the dragon from the cave
that I had been in three--

00:20:48.357 --> 00:20:49.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 30 years--

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: 30 years ago.

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:50.862 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --30 years ago.

00:20:50.862 --> 00:20:51.662 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Yeah.

00:20:51.662 --> 00:20:53.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So did you,
like, with Lloyd,

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:57.650 align:middle line:84%
did you develop a relationship
telepathically with the dragon?

00:20:57.650 --> 00:21:01.422 align:middle line:84%
How did your relationship
with that dragon work?

00:21:01.422 --> 00:21:03.130 align:middle line:84%
Because I know you
had a couple sightings

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:06.640 align:middle line:84%
of different color types of
dragons around the world.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.660 align:middle line:84%
So let's just talk about
your journey with them

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:10.470 align:middle line:90%
and how you relate to them.

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: The
dragon turns out

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:14.490 align:middle line:84%
to be the one that
was in the egg.

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:15.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: And he calls
himself my nest brother.

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And so he talks in the book,
"The Dragon's Tale," about why--

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:28.150 align:middle line:84%
how the dragons have
been here for millennia,

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:30.490 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of thousands
of years, really,

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:35.120 align:middle line:84%
to early times in the birth
of the Earth before Atlantis.

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And if you read
them, you can see

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:40.740 align:middle line:84%
that there are myths about
dragons all over the world.

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:41.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:43.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: And
so he said, we're

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:48.110 align:middle line:84%
interested in catapulting
the consciousness of humanity

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:52.490 align:middle line:84%
and catalyzing our frequency
so that we can rise

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:55.010 align:middle line:84%
in our frequency
because the Earth itself

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:59.030 align:middle line:84%
is going through a birth to
become a conscious planet.

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And we are to accompany
the Earth on this journey.

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:06.330 align:middle line:90%
So his name is Jake.

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:08.430 align:middle line:84%
At least, that's my
short form for him.

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:11.940 align:middle line:84%
His full name is
Jaakelousekindvron.

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:14.680 align:middle line:84%
Only it has some grunts
and groans in it.

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:15.957 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We'll go with Jake.

00:22:15.957 --> 00:22:17.290 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: We'll go with Jake.

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, he is interested
in being a bridge.

00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:25.500 align:middle line:84%
Just like the
leprechaun stories have

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:28.470 align:middle line:84%
been a bridge between
elementals and humans,

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:34.410 align:middle line:84%
he is showing us a bridge
between humans and dragon world.

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:36.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's interesting,
many years ago,

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:39.143 align:middle line:84%
I asked my own group
of beings, many--

00:22:39.143 --> 00:22:40.560 align:middle line:84%
probably two or
three decades ago,

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:42.750 align:middle line:84%
actually, I asked
them about dragons

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:45.960 align:middle line:84%
because they are so
prominent in our lore,

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.830 align:middle line:84%
and people are so
fascinated with them,

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:50.640 align:middle line:84%
although, oftentimes, it
seems more often than not,

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.510 align:middle line:90%
in a frightful sort of way.

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And I said, are these
beings that actually exist?

00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:58.570 align:middle line:84%
He said, no, they
lived upon the land.

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:01.170 align:middle line:84%
In other times when the
frequencies of Earth

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:04.930 align:middle line:84%
were different, they were part
of the beings that lived here.

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:06.410 align:middle line:90%
And they still exist.

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:10.450 align:middle line:84%
But because they live in a
slightly phased off density

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:13.300 align:middle line:84%
from Earth, only some
people can see them.

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:14.590 align:middle line:90%
What you're doing now.

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:16.130 align:middle line:84%
Same thing we talked
about earlier.

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:17.780 align:middle line:90%
So they've always existed there.

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:18.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Yes.

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:20.205 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
were actually-- they

00:23:20.205 --> 00:23:21.800 align:middle line:90%
did exist on the land on Earth.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.940 align:middle line:84%
So what have they told you
about their history with Earth?

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:29.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: Well, that they use
all the elements, earth, air,

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:30.410 align:middle line:90%
fire and water.

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And they said they're even
beings of higher elements

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:34.737 align:middle line:84%
that humans haven't
discovered yet.

00:23:34.737 --> 00:23:35.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:36.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: Yeah,
that is interesting.

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:36.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:39.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: And so they
are able, because of all

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:43.600 align:middle line:84%
those elements, to help
kindle those in human beings.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And they actually work with our
chakra system, the Kundalini

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:49.820 align:middle line:90%
energy to help raise it.

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And what they're most
interested right now

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:58.600 align:middle line:84%
is to create the fire in our
hearts, the fire of love,

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.780 align:middle line:84%
wisdom, and divine
will in our hearts

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:05.980 align:middle line:84%
so that we can become
co-creators with the Earth.

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how did
they end up in lore

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:11.830 align:middle line:84%
as basically breathing
the fires of destruction

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:14.840 align:middle line:84%
and igniting fear in
all of the humans?

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.790 align:middle line:84%
How did that part of
the story come in?

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:19.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: There's
two kinds of dragons.

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:21.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, let's get into it.

00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:23.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: So there's
the Asian dragons.

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And in the Asian world,
in China or Japan,

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:30.310 align:middle line:84%
whatever, dragons have
always been revered.

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:33.520 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the emperor
would choose the dragon

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.940 align:middle line:84%
as the symbol of his
power and wisdom.

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:41.230 align:middle line:84%
But in the West, when
the dragons were last

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:46.150 align:middle line:84%
seen on the Earth, the
Western civilization

00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:50.600 align:middle line:84%
was not as advanced as
the Eastern civilization.

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And so they got more
highly evolved dragons

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:56.095 align:middle line:90%
that were over there.

00:24:56.095 --> 00:24:56.895 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:24:56.895 --> 00:24:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: In the West,
they got more of the--

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:02.720 align:middle line:84%
what the dragon
calls the throwbacks.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And these are ones that,
in the dragon world, when

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:13.960 align:middle line:84%
you have mentally ill,
badly adjusted dragons that

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:19.510 align:middle line:84%
are disabled emotionally,
mentally, spiritually, they

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:23.200 align:middle line:84%
look for planets to
take the throwbacks to

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:29.410 align:middle line:84%
so that they can stabilize, get
themselves emotionally stable.

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And so some of
them came to Earth.

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And when they came to
Earth, because dragons

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:42.370 align:middle line:84%
live in their own world
on minerals and crystals,

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:45.920 align:middle line:84%
they get the energy from
crystals and minerals.

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And so they like
to live in caves.

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:50.140 align:middle line:84%
So the dragons
went to these caves

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:52.420 align:middle line:84%
where there were
minerals and crystals.

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:56.810 align:middle line:84%
But the humans also wanted
the minerals and crystals.

00:25:56.810 --> 00:26:01.893 align:middle line:84%
And so that is how they
saw the dragons as enemies.

00:26:01.893 --> 00:26:02.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Competitive.

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:03.190 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Yeah.

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:05.065 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the dragon
was maybe protecting

00:26:05.065 --> 00:26:08.170 align:middle line:84%
their own place, using
whatever means they

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:09.650 align:middle line:90%
had to keep the humans away.

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:11.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Absolutely.

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, well, that
actually makes sense.

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.460 align:middle line:84%
So now in this story,
I have down here

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:17.990 align:middle line:84%
that you had met
dragon in France.

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Was that the one
you're speaking about?

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:20.175 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Yes.

00:26:20.175 --> 00:26:20.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: He goes
through the entire story,

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.255 align:middle line:90%
and he is my nest brother.

00:26:24.255 --> 00:26:27.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so tell us a
little bit about your meeting

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:30.610 align:middle line:84%
with him initially and the
arrangement you have with him

00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:32.930 align:middle line:90%
now as your nest brother.

00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:36.100 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: As my nest brother.

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:40.420 align:middle line:84%
He's like most people associate
with the look of a dragon,

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:41.810 align:middle line:90%
really, only he's indigo.

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:43.540 align:middle line:90%
He's an indigo color.

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And he has serpentine-looking
eyes like a snake.

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:50.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: Gold
with a black center.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes, he flies.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.530 align:middle line:90%
He has a hinge joint.

00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:56.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: So he can
crouch down as well.

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:03.250 align:middle line:84%
So he's about 15
feet long in his body

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:06.710 align:middle line:90%
and another 15 feet in tail.

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:07.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: And his
personality, he's young.

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:15.380 align:middle line:84%
They said that I
wouldn't be able to deal

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:20.970 align:middle line:84%
with a mature dragon so
early in meeting them.

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And so they had trained him
for, evidently, eons of time,

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:31.100 align:middle line:84%
they had bred and bred and
bred to have somebody who would

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.710 align:middle line:90%
be able to talk to a human.

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And so he is a
relatively young dragon.

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:39.060 align:middle line:90%
He's proud.

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:39.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:41.400 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: He's wise.

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:45.180 align:middle line:84%
They receive, in their
nest, in the cave,

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:49.410 align:middle line:84%
they receive the memories
from all their ancestors.

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:50.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:53.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: And it's in the
crystals of their own caves

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:56.340 align:middle line:90%
that these memories are imbued.

00:27:56.340 --> 00:28:00.170 align:middle line:84%
So when you have a young
dragon who is a hatchling,

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:02.070 align:middle line:90%
he gets all the memories.

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:06.490 align:middle line:84%
So he comes full with
all these memories.

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:07.980 align:middle line:90%
So he has this wisdom.

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:11.670 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
being young, he's flexible

00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:13.920 align:middle line:84%
and he has a good
sense of humor.

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:14.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:15.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: It is good.

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:19.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what is he relaying
to you at this point in time?

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:23.650 align:middle line:84%
What is your job
in this agreement?

00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: Well,
my job is to talk

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:31.560 align:middle line:84%
about the dragon evolution on
the Earth and with humanity,

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:35.190 align:middle line:84%
and also to talk about
where we're going

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:38.160 align:middle line:84%
and what dragons are going
to be doing with the Earth

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.740 align:middle line:90%
and humanity and are doing now.

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:45.360 align:middle line:84%
He talks about the great cosmic
dragon, which are-- they're

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:51.180 align:middle line:84%
highly, highly evolved dragons,
like a Christ figure to us,

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:58.890 align:middle line:84%
and how that being is helping to
crack the shell around the Earth

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:03.330 align:middle line:84%
is now going through all
these volcanoes and hurricanes

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:04.750 align:middle line:90%
and weather disruptions.

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:07.050 align:middle line:84%
But that's all we
see physically.

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:08.670 align:middle line:90%
But there's a shell--

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:09.960 align:middle line:90%
I call it the ring pass knot--

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:10.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:14.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: --which is an
astral in a causal shell that

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:17.270 align:middle line:84%
also exists around the
Earth, and that has always

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:22.550 align:middle line:84%
protected other civilizations,
star civilizations from us

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:23.760 align:middle line:90%
because we are condemning it.

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:24.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: And it
protects us from them

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:30.960 align:middle line:84%
because we're not ready
yet to know about them.

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.660 align:middle line:90%
So that's cracking.

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:35.550 align:middle line:84%
So they are helping
with this cracking.

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:40.790 align:middle line:84%
So the Earth is cracking herself
from inside to birth herself.

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And they are helping
from the outside

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:48.570 align:middle line:84%
with what he calls the
permission of the source of all.

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:50.955 align:middle line:84%
This is what he
calls the creator--

00:29:50.955 --> 00:29:52.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hmm, interesting.

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:53.455 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: --the
source of all.

00:29:53.455 --> 00:29:56.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now all kinds of
ideas are spinning into my head

00:29:56.630 --> 00:30:01.490 align:middle line:84%
because there are-- when we read
about the dynasties and the use

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:05.600 align:middle line:84%
of the word dragon and some of
the dynasties in the east, we--

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.790 align:middle line:84%
it's like the Red Dragon
family or the Green Dragon

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:10.830 align:middle line:90%
family, what does--

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:14.880 align:middle line:84%
was that direct relationship
with a certain-- on a high level

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.950 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, certain type
of dragon in their lineage?

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:19.270 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:21.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: They have
different lineages.

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:21.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: So they
have a ruby lineage.

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:24.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:26.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: They
have an emerald.

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:27.760 align:middle line:90%
They have a sapphire blue.

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: And
they have an indigo.

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:33.900 align:middle line:84%
So they have all these lineages
and they have specialties,

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.280 align:middle line:90%
depending on their lineage.

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:39.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So give us an idea
of a couple of the specialties.

00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:39.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: OK.

00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:42.340 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned earlier
the red dragon.

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:43.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:47.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: So the token
or the symbol for Wales

00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:48.640 align:middle line:90%
is the red dragon.

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And when I went to Iceland, I
was called there by a dragon.

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:55.470 align:middle line:90%
And I went to Iceland.

00:30:55.470 --> 00:31:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking for stories on
dragons, and there was nothing.

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:02.320 align:middle line:90%
Lots of stories--

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you thought,
what am I doing here?

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:04.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: Yeah,
what am I doing here?

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:04.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:07.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: Lots of
stories about little people.

00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:09.410 align:middle line:84%
Everyone thinks they-- you
know about the Icelanders,

00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:16.000 align:middle line:84%
but nothing on dragons, until I
was at a cultural kind of museum

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:16.800 align:middle line:90%
site.

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And I was speaking to the young
man there who was a historian.

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:22.020 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what's this?

00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:23.610 align:middle line:90%
I can't find a thing on dragons.

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:25.970 align:middle line:90%
He pulls out an Icelandic coin.

00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:28.170 align:middle line:90%
And he says, look at the crest.

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:31.650 align:middle line:84%
He said, the dragon is
our Eastern guardian.

00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:32.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ah.

00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:35.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: And so
it's very interesting.

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:38.148 align:middle line:84%
The Icelandic people hardly
ever would talk about it,

00:31:38.148 --> 00:31:39.440 align:middle line:90%
and there it is on their crest.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:40.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:44.122 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: So I met that
guardian, the ruby red dragon.

00:31:44.122 --> 00:31:45.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How did he show up?

00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:46.260 align:middle line:90%
What was the situation?

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:46.945 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: It was a her.

00:31:46.945 --> 00:31:47.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Her?

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:48.233 align:middle line:90%
How did she show up?

00:31:48.233 --> 00:31:53.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: Very, very old,
old, old, large, and frosty.

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:54.688 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:31:54.688 --> 00:31:56.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Her temperament or
personality was so frosty?

00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:58.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: Her
personality was frosty--

00:31:58.940 --> 00:31:59.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:00.920 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: --demanding.

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:04.250 align:middle line:84%
She only came
because she was aware

00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:06.250 align:middle line:90%
that I was writing this book.

00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:10.810 align:middle line:84%
And so she received instruction
from the source of all

00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:12.680 align:middle line:90%
that she had to cooperate.

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:13.480 align:middle line:90%
But she--

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She was
the one you were sent

00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:15.580 align:middle line:90%
to meet with, though, right?

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:16.490 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Yes, she was.

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:17.140 align:middle line:90%
She was the one who--

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:17.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She was
just reluctant?

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:20.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: Yes, she was
reluctant because of that,

00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:22.730 align:middle line:84%
because humans are
like rats to her.

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:23.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Rats?

00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:24.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Mm.

00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:26.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's all
from your perspective.

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:27.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: It is
from your perspective.

00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And if you're thousands and
thousands and thousands of years

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:31.105 align:middle line:84%
old, maybe you
would feel the same.

00:32:31.105 --> 00:32:31.905 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:31.905 --> 00:32:36.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: So it turns out she
is the same ruby red dragon that

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:38.317 align:middle line:84%

red dragon of Wales.

>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:42.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: And she
used to live there,

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:45.290 align:middle line:84%
and then moved to
Iceland because she

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:48.350 align:middle line:84%
wanted to be in the warmth
of the volcanoes and the lava

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:49.740 align:middle line:90%
fields.

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:50.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And--

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:51.957 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: They
love the warmth.

00:32:51.957 --> 00:32:54.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And something
about new land too,

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:57.442 align:middle line:84%
wasn't there something
about Iceland as growing?

00:32:57.442 --> 00:32:59.025 align:middle line:84%
There's still a
freshness and newness?

00:32:59.025 --> 00:32:59.380 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Yes.

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And as
I recall from what

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:03.560 align:middle line:84%
I read, something
about that as well, she

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:05.720 align:middle line:84%
wanted to be part
of the formation

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.372 align:middle line:90%
and development of this land?

00:33:07.372 --> 00:33:08.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: It's true.

00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:10.270 align:middle line:84%
It is the newest
land on the Earth--

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:11.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:13.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: --is being
birthed in Iceland.

00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So she is the
red dragon of Wales?

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:16.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Yeah.

00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:18.375 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which, of course,
you see all over Wales.

00:33:18.375 --> 00:33:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Uh-huh.

00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:21.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when she
spoke with you, when

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:24.202 align:middle line:84%
she communicated
with you, what was it

00:33:24.202 --> 00:33:25.410 align:middle line:90%
she was supposed to tell you?

00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:26.750 align:middle line:90%
Why did you go there?

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: She wanted
to talk about the fact

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:31.838 align:middle line:84%
that she was a red
dragon of Wales.

00:33:31.838 --> 00:33:32.638 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:33:32.638 --> 00:33:34.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: [CHUCKLES]
Because she also is proud.

00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:35.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:37.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: And
that she basically

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:40.910 align:middle line:84%
wanted to be left alone,
but that she wanted

00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:44.870 align:middle line:84%
it to be known that
she was in Iceland

00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:49.020 align:middle line:84%
and she had been on the
Earth for eons of time.

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And I asked her, couldn't you
go back to the dragon world?

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:56.800 align:middle line:84%
Or would that be
difficult for you?

00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I could still go,
but it would be very difficult

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:03.250 align:middle line:84%
because it's at such
a high frequency,

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:07.009 align:middle line:84%
and I have been in this low
frequency of Earth for so long.

00:34:07.009 --> 00:34:09.259 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that would
make her frosty and grumpy.

00:34:09.259 --> 00:34:10.592 align:middle line:90%

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.530 align:middle line:84%

gave you part of it.

But the second part of it was--

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:12.870 align:middle line:84%
he turned and he said, what
about the world of dragons?

00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yes,
I saw the dragon.

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And then I turned to the
left and I saw the world

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:22.857 align:middle line:90%

>>HELLIWELL:

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:28.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So he sent
you on to the merpeople?

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:29.340 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: He hasn't yet.

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:31.950 align:middle line:90%
He has not yet.

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:36.840 align:middle line:84%
But I have this
intuition that this

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:39.690 align:middle line:84%
may be what I need
to do next, is

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:45.660 align:middle line:84%
create another bridge between
the merpeople and humans

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:46.770 align:middle line:90%
because--

00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:48.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It makes sense.

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:51.180 align:middle line:84%
Now you're talking about the
water element and all the wisdom

00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:54.030 align:middle line:84%
that is in our oceans,
permeates our oceans

00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:58.050 align:middle line:84%
as we continue to do whatever
we're doing to our oceans.

00:35:58.050 --> 00:35:59.470 align:middle line:90%
OK, well, that's exciting.

00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:00.910 align:middle line:90%
So that's coming up next.

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:01.260 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Maybe.

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:01.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Maybe.

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:02.730 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that's coming up--

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:03.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: Living
in the present.

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:06.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Living in the present,
which Lloyd has taught you well.

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:10.585 align:middle line:84%
And in between all of this,
I mentioned it very briefly

00:36:10.585 --> 00:36:12.210 align:middle line:84%
earlier, and we'll
just touch on it now

00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:14.240 align:middle line:84%
because I want to do
a whole show on it,

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:16.630 align:middle line:90%
you wrote another book called--

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:18.770 align:middle line:84%
titled "So You
Think You're Human."

00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:19.610 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Yes.

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:20.780 align:middle line:90%
That was the subtitle.

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:22.850 align:middle line:90%
The first word was hybrids.

00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:25.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: "HYBRIDS, So You
Think You're Human," right.

00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:26.128 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: [CHUCKLES]

00:36:26.128 --> 00:36:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
how did you come

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:32.230 align:middle line:84%
to see human beings
as being reflections

00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:35.710 align:middle line:84%
of some of these other worlds,
like hybridized and stamped,

00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:37.540 align:middle line:84%
somehow imbued with
characteristics

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:38.840 align:middle line:90%
from these other worlds?

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Where did you first
start noticing that.

00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:43.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: Well, I am a
psychotherapist by training.

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:43.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:46.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: So I had
a therapy practice,

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:49.110 align:middle line:84%
and we specialized in
spiritual transformation.

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:49.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:52.210 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: And I
started to realize

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:57.430 align:middle line:84%
that some of the people who
came to me were not fully human.

00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And because I'd already
had my experience

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:02.350 align:middle line:84%
with Lloyd and the
elementals, I, at first,

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:05.140 align:middle line:84%
started to see
elemental hybrids.

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And I realized there were
certain common characteristics

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:10.480 align:middle line:90%
that they had.

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't have a card
saying, specializing

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:18.440 align:middle line:84%
in elemental hybrids
or anything like that.

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:21.580 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, having
discovered that,

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:26.310 align:middle line:84%
I became more alert to looking
at other people more deeply.

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:27.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:29.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: And so I was in
Germany teaching a course,

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:32.090 align:middle line:84%
and I was teaching
a course on hybrids.

00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
people there said,

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:37.360 align:middle line:84%
you've got to write a book,
and we have the title for you.

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:39.480 align:middle line:84%
It's called "HYBRID, So
You Think You're Human."

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:40.683 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH CHUCKLING]

00:37:40.683 --> 00:37:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
how that came about?

00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:44.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: That's how
the book got written.

00:37:44.350 --> 00:37:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And so when I started
really investigating,

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:54.700 align:middle line:84%
I found 22 kinds of
hybrids that, I think,

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:58.960 align:middle line:84%
have a probability of
existing on the Earth

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:01.940 align:middle line:90%
and moving into human evolution.

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So did you notice
in this that there were--

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:07.540 align:middle line:84%
did it reflect the elemental
kingdom, for example,

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:09.670 align:middle line:84%
if you're talking about
elemental hybrids,

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:12.430 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the other people
that they spent time with,

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:14.950 align:middle line:84%
or did you notice a lot
more mixing than would

00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:16.910 align:middle line:90%
happen in the elemental world?

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:19.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, might you have
noticed that an elf might

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:22.670 align:middle line:84%
be married to a leprechaun
hybrid in this world?

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:24.320 align:middle line:90%
Was there a lot more mixing?

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:25.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: A lot.

00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And this was one of the reasons
that elementals would have--

00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:36.490 align:middle line:84%
they would have asked for the
overseeing elementals that

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:38.740 align:middle line:84%
oversee their evolution
and the ones that

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:42.730 align:middle line:84%
oversee our evolution, the
human evolution, for permission

00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:46.040 align:middle line:84%
to enter human evolution,
to learn free will.

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:49.190 align:middle line:90%
And then here they can mix.

00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:52.395 align:middle line:84%
I could name names, but that
would get us into trouble.

00:38:52.395 --> 00:38:53.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
don't name names.

00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:54.800 align:middle line:90%
You do in the book.

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:57.490 align:middle line:84%
You name names in the book about
when you see certain people,

00:38:57.490 --> 00:39:00.870 align:middle line:84%
you'll be able to-- you can
tell which of the hybrid groups

00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:01.670 align:middle line:90%
they come from.

00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:02.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Yeah.

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:02.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.625 align:middle line:84%
And so let's just,
for one moment,

00:39:04.625 --> 00:39:06.250 align:middle line:84%
and then we're going
to move on to what

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:09.640 align:middle line:84%
you do the rest of the time
because you teach seriously

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.570 align:middle line:90%
in the world of transformation.

00:39:11.570 --> 00:39:13.190 align:middle line:84%
You've been doing
this for decades.

00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:14.897 align:middle line:90%
You have your own school.

00:39:14.897 --> 00:39:16.480 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about
that at the very end.

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.340 align:middle line:84%
But let's just talk
about elves for a moment

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:20.220 align:middle line:84%
just because they pop
up in so many films.

00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And people are so
intrigued with elves,

00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:26.280 align:middle line:84%
they even have their ears, for
example, surgically changed

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.570 align:middle line:90%
to mimic elf ears and such.

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:31.110 align:middle line:84%
So there's a big
fascination with elves.

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:32.315 align:middle line:90%
This is one of 22.

00:39:32.315 --> 00:39:33.190 align:middle line:90%
Just give us a tease.

00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:34.510 align:middle line:84%
We'll come back and
do a whole show on it.

00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:35.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: OK, a tease.

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:38.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's two
kinds of elves.

00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:41.770 align:middle line:84%
There's the forest elves
and the royal elves.

00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:44.920 align:middle line:84%
The royal elves are
meant to command.

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And there are a
lot of royal elves

00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:48.820 align:middle line:90%
that are in the movie industry.

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:49.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:51.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL:
They're charismatic.

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:53.980 align:middle line:84%
They're usually
tall and slender.

00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:55.627 align:middle line:90%
And you cannot resist them.

00:39:55.627 --> 00:39:57.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can't
take your eyes off them?

00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:59.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: You cannot
take your eyes off them.

00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:01.620 align:middle line:90%
They are so charismatic.

00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And you just want to--
you want them to like you.

00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:07.320 align:middle line:84%
You want to do
something for them.

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:09.850 align:middle line:90%
So those are your royal elves.

00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:11.740 align:middle line:90%
Then there are the forest elves.

00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:14.520 align:middle line:84%
Now they are more the
chameleon, the ones

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:16.430 align:middle line:90%
that fit into the background.

00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:18.900 align:middle line:84%
They may also be in
the movie industry,

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:21.100 align:middle line:90%
but they wouldn't want to be--

00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:24.900 align:middle line:84%
they might go in disguises
a lot in the movie industry

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:27.460 align:middle line:84%
because they wouldn't care
about looking beautiful.

00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:31.290 align:middle line:84%
But they want to try on
various personalities

00:40:31.290 --> 00:40:34.680 align:middle line:84%
because in the
elemental world, you can

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.190 align:middle line:90%
change your clothes like that.

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:36.990 align:middle line:90%
You can--

00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:38.115 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Speed of thought.

00:40:38.115 --> 00:40:39.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Absolutely.

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:41.130 align:middle line:90%
And so they get bored here.

00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And one of the problems
when elementals

00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:48.080 align:middle line:84%
enter into hybrid lives as a
human, they find it very boring.

00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:50.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they turn to a lot
of things that can take them

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:52.610 align:middle line:90%
down a path that's destructive

00:40:52.610 --> 00:40:53.610 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Absolutely.

00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:54.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Addictions?

00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:55.597 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Yeah, they can.

00:40:55.597 --> 00:40:58.277 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Royal elves tend
to have addiction patterns--

00:40:58.277 --> 00:40:59.610 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Elementals purely--

00:40:59.610 --> 00:41:00.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Elementals?

00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:01.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: Yeah,
because they're bored.

00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:02.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're bored.

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:03.030 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Yeah.

00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:04.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think a lot of
people listening to this

00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:05.450 align:middle line:90%
can get that.

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:07.470 align:middle line:84%
So just really
briefly, let's talk

00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:10.650 align:middle line:84%
about your school
of transformation

00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:12.700 align:middle line:84%
and a little bit else of
what you're doing now.

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:14.210 align:middle line:90%
Are you still going on tours?

00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:16.930 align:middle line:84%
We'll keep an eye out for the
other book on the merpeople

00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:18.170 align:middle line:90%
if that does happen.

00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:20.380 align:middle line:90%
So what are you doing right now?

00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:22.730 align:middle line:10%
>>HELLIWELL: I still
teach, go on tours.

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:23.530 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:25.780 align:middle line:10%
>>HELLIWELL: Our institute
is called the International

00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:27.350 align:middle line:10%
Institute for Transformation.

00:41:27.350 --> 00:41:30.910 align:middle line:84%
We are devoted to
spiritual transformation,

00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:34.390 align:middle line:84%
to helping people on their
path to consciousness,

00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:35.900 align:middle line:90%
whatever that is.

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And so we're completely
open to all religions.

00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:40.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:41:40.690 --> 00:41:42.180 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever think
that elementals

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:43.430 align:middle line:90%
were going to be part of that?

00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:43.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Never.

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:44.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [CHUCKLES]

00:41:44.650 --> 00:41:45.470 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Never.

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:47.020 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I really--

00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:50.740 align:middle line:84%
as a psychotherapist and also,
I was a management consultant

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:55.130 align:middle line:84%
working for IBM and banks
for 30 years as well.

00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:57.350 align:middle line:84%
So I've had these
different sides.

00:41:57.350 --> 00:41:59.990 align:middle line:90%
And so I never knew.

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:01.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:03.977 align:middle line:84%
That's what I like about
you, no one would suspect it.

00:42:03.977 --> 00:42:06.310 align:middle line:84%
Tanis, it's been so fun to
finally meet you in the flesh

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:07.110 align:middle line:90%
and have you here.

00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And we'll have you
come back, and we'll

00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:12.130 align:middle line:84%
look at these 22 hybrid types
so people in our audience

00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:15.200 align:middle line:84%
can try to identify what they
or their loved ones might be.

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.093 align:middle line:90%
It's really fun.

00:42:16.093 --> 00:42:18.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HELLIWELL: They're probably
wondering what we are.

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:18.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:20.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe we'll talk
about in that show.

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:20.880 align:middle line:90%
>>HELLIWELL: Maybe.

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:21.922 align:middle line:90%

you so much, Tanis.
