[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:08.904 --> 00:00:11.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ANITA MOORJANI: My parents
are very, very Hindu,

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.395 align:middle line:84%
wanted to set me up with
an arranged marriage.

00:00:13.395 --> 00:00:14.353 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:00:14.353 --> 00:00:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: But they sent me to
a British school for education.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.800 align:middle line:84%
I was also a huge
fan of Cyndi Lauper.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.870 align:middle line:84%
His parents made it
clear I would not

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.840 align:middle line:84%
be allowed to work or be
independent or go back

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.118 align:middle line:90%
to study or earn my own money.

00:00:26.118 --> 00:00:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you
go through with it?

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.820 align:middle line:84%
Conflating your fashion
choices with the salvation

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:31.620 align:middle line:90%
of your soul?

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.662 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes, exactly.

00:00:32.662 --> 00:00:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Bad guru.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.860 align:middle line:90%
Very bad guru.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: I went into a coma.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.840 align:middle line:84%
The doctors told my family
that these were my final hours,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.300 align:middle line:84%
but I started to
become aware that I

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.610 align:middle line:90%
was surrounded by beings.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.140 align:middle line:84%
Three weeks after the NDE, they
could find no trace of cancer

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.650 align:middle line:90%
in my body.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.340 align:middle line:90%
It's not about doing and doing.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.680 align:middle line:84%
It's about undoing,
letting it all go

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.450 align:middle line:90%
and setting yourself free.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.790 align:middle line:90%
We look up to ruthless people.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.910 align:middle line:84%
We see empathy and
sensitivity as a weakness.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.980 align:middle line:84%
What if we decided
it was a strength?

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.567 align:middle line:90%


00:01:08.567 --> 00:01:10.470 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: With us
today is a woman

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.970 align:middle line:10%
who came to the
public's attention

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.880 align:middle line:10%
about a decade ago when
she wrote her book "Dying

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.970 align:middle line:10%
to Be Me" about her near-death
experience from terminal

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.090 align:middle line:10%
cancer and an amazing
spontaneous healing.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm speaking of Anita
Moorjani whose new message

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.250 align:middle line:84%
is as poignant today
as her original book.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.400 align:middle line:84%
This is both a cautionary
tale and a tale

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.870 align:middle line:90%
of total empowerment.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:31.897 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Anita.

00:01:31.897 --> 00:01:33.480 align:middle line:84%
It's so good to meet
you in the flesh.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.640 align:middle line:84%
We've kind of had
near-misses with each other.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: We have.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.370 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm really happy to be here
and speaking to you today.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.190 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes, and likewise.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.160 align:middle line:10%
And I want to start this
interview off with a story

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.570 align:middle line:10%
that, as I was reading this, I
thought, no, this is so wrong.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.600 align:middle line:10%
And we're talking about a
chapter in your new book called

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.610 align:middle line:10%
"Banned from Nirvana".

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.410 align:middle line:10%
The book is "Sensitive
is the New Strong."

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.260 align:middle line:10%
And your parents
took you to a guru

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.650 align:middle line:10%
because you were in the shameful
position of being unmarried

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.630 align:middle line:10%
at the age of 26.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.580 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is from the
East Indian tradition.

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.625 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what
this guru said to you.

00:02:11.625 --> 00:02:14.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: So I want to
backtrack and set it up.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.210 align:middle line:10%
So a couple of things going
on in my life at that time.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.020 align:middle line:10%
My parents are very,
very Indian Hindu,

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.367 align:middle line:10%
wanted to set me up with
an arranged marriage.

00:02:22.367 --> 00:02:23.167 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:23.167 --> 00:02:26.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: But they sent me to
a British school for education.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.145 align:middle line:90%
So I was very westernized.

00:02:28.145 --> 00:02:28.945 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:28.945 --> 00:02:31.463 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: I was also a
huge fan of Cyndi Lauper.

00:02:31.463 --> 00:02:32.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my gosh.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.610 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.510 align:middle line:90%
So I had my hair cut like hers.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.360 align:middle line:84%
I would color my hair with
the neon colors sometimes,

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.080 align:middle line:84%
and I would emulate her,
the clothes and everything.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.780 align:middle line:84%
Because that song, "Girls
Just Want to Have Fun,"

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.510 align:middle line:90%
it just spoke to me back then.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.200 align:middle line:84%
So my parents are trying
to arrange a marriage

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.690 align:middle line:84%
for this daughter that
emulates Cyndi Lauper.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the parents
of the potential intended

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.410 align:middle line:84%
didn't like this whole girls
just want to be fun attitude?

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: No, because in
my culture at that time,

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.845 align:middle line:84%
a woman's worth was measured by
how good she was at housework.

00:03:11.845 --> 00:03:13.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and cooking.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: And
cooking and cleaning.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm terrible at cleaning.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm not good with housework.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And also we were
measured by how valuable

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.350 align:middle line:84%
we are to the men in our
community and in our families.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.440 align:middle line:84%
So we always had to make
ourselves serve men and be

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.310 align:middle line:90%
of service to men.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:40.228 align:middle line:84%
And I was kind of brought up and
trained or geared towards one

00:03:40.228 --> 00:03:42.020 align:middle line:84%
day I'm going to have
an arranged marriage,

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.470 align:middle line:84%
and so I have to
be able to please

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.070 align:middle line:84%
not only a husband but his
parents because you marry

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.000 align:middle line:84%
into the whole family and you
end up living with his parents.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And so what my parents would
see when they would look at me

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.600 align:middle line:84%
is that, oh, any future
potential boy or fiancÃ©

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.900 align:middle line:84%
or husband's parents are
not going to approve of you.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.710 align:middle line:84%
They're not going
to approve of you.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.990 align:middle line:84%
So sure enough, when they took
me to see the Indian guru,

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.300 align:middle line:84%
and in our culture,
again, these gurus

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.520 align:middle line:90%
are what we call the Maharaj.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.760 align:middle line:84%
They check your horoscope
and they tell you

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.529 align:middle line:84%
when you're going
to get married.

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:24.250 align:middle line:84%
So they took me there to
say we're having trouble

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.520 align:middle line:90%
getting our daughter married.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.490 align:middle line:84%
Could you check her
horoscope to see when

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:28.960 align:middle line:90%
is she going to get married?

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And he took one look at me,
and like any potential Hindu

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.560 align:middle line:84%
in-laws, he looked at me
with the same eyes and said,

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.440 align:middle line:84%
oh, my gosh, no wonder
she's not married.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.540 align:middle line:84%
Look at-- yeah, look
at how she's dressed.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.470 align:middle line:90%
Look at her hair.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.990 align:middle line:84%
She's not wearing
Indian clothes.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And they took it as
a sign of disrespect.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And so he actually
started to tell me

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.140 align:middle line:84%
what it was that I needed
to do in order to gain favor

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.870 align:middle line:84%
from my religion, my
culture, from nirvana,

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.520 align:middle line:90%
to be able to go into nirvana.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And he was saying
all these things

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.430 align:middle line:84%
which are out of
character for me to be.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, remember
all my friends,

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.550 align:middle line:84%
my peers were British kids,
so I had this huge exposure

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.920 align:middle line:84%
to this other culture that's
not just my parents' culture.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.020 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to fit
in with my peers.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.980 align:middle line:84%
So when he would say
that you need to do this,

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.050 align:middle line:84%
you need to be more
respectful, subservient,

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.310 align:middle line:84%
you need to cover your
head when you come here,

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.990 align:middle line:84%
and so on and so on, and
I would say, but why?

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.110 align:middle line:84%
I questioned it because none
of my peers needed to do that.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.570 align:middle line:84%
So I said, why do I
need to do those things?

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And he said, if you ever
want to get to nirvana,

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.550 align:middle line:84%
you have to do those
things because god will not

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.140 align:middle line:84%
let you in if your soul is still
dirty, if it's still tarnished.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.590 align:middle line:84%
You have to cleanse yourself
and follow these things.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Conflating
your fashion choices

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.330 align:middle line:90%
with the salvation of your soul?

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:02.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes, exactly.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:03.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Bad guru.

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:04.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very bad guru.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.050 align:middle line:90%


00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.220 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:15.130 align:middle line:84%
So when you walked away from
this sage, how did you feel,

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.945 align:middle line:90%
and what did that do to you?

00:06:16.945 --> 00:06:18.445 align:middle line:84%
And what did that
do to your family?

00:06:18.445 --> 00:06:21.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: Well, it
crushed me completely.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.220 align:middle line:84%
It crushed me because
here I was being told now

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:29.380 align:middle line:84%
from somebody who is an
authority of spirituality

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.680 align:middle line:90%
and the other side.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.140 align:middle line:84%
So it really crushed me,
and it set me on a path

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.300 align:middle line:84%
where I felt, oh,
my gosh, maybe I

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.365 align:middle line:84%
do need to become
more "spiritual."

00:06:41.365 --> 00:06:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And so I started to try
to figure out what does it

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.520 align:middle line:90%
take to be more spiritual?

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.290 align:middle line:84%
Like, do I have
to meditate more?

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:51.670 align:middle line:90%
Do I have to pray more?

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:55.375 align:middle line:90%
Do I have to dress differently?

00:06:55.375 --> 00:07:00.460 align:middle line:84%
But before that, I
had this spirit, this

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:07.410 align:middle line:84%
really like a very joyful, like,
a free bird spirit that got

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:08.210 align:middle line:90%
crushed.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:12.170 align:middle line:84%
It really started to get
crushed because he reinforced

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.050 align:middle line:84%
in my parents that this is
why they're having trouble

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.240 align:middle line:84%
getting me married, and that
I don't respect the culture.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.145 align:middle line:90%
I don't respect the religion.

00:07:20.145 --> 00:07:20.945 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:07:20.945 --> 00:07:22.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ultimately them.

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: And ultimately them.

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.860 align:middle line:90%
So it did.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.900 align:middle line:90%
It crushed my spirit.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so then you became
a pleaser, a people pleaser?

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:32.225 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: I did.

00:07:32.225 --> 00:07:33.767 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You tried
twisting yourself

00:07:33.767 --> 00:07:37.560 align:middle line:84%
into a pretzel to be a good girl
and make everyone else happy.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about that phase
of your life, a perfectionist.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: Yes, so
then I really believed

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.190 align:middle line:84%
that I had to be
more subservient,

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.730 align:middle line:84%
be more of a homemaker, although
that wasn't my preference.

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:51.650 align:middle line:90%
I actually wanted to travel.

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:52.520 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to work.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And I was told, in
terms of working,

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:56.135 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to study more.

00:07:56.135 --> 00:08:00.650 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to go to university.

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:02.450 align:middle line:84%
But I was told that
all of this would

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:05.690 align:middle line:84%
be dependent on your future
husband and his parents.

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:07.920 align:middle line:90%
That they would have to approve.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And so the more you educate
yourself, the less desirable

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.130 align:middle line:84%
you are for an
arranged marriage.

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:16.680 align:middle line:84%
Certainly it was
true at that time.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to literally
pause on a lot of things

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.470 align:middle line:90%
that I wanted to do.

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:25.520 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to earn my own
money, work, travel,

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.500 align:middle line:84%
do all of those things
and be independent.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:33.270 align:middle line:84%
But all of those things were
seen as wrong in my culture

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:37.929 align:middle line:84%
unless your husband and/or
your in-laws approved of it.

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And so finally, in order
to please my parents,

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:45.090 align:middle line:84%
I did say yes to an
arranged marriage.

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:48.750 align:middle line:90%
And when I was engaged--

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:51.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were they unique
because they accepted--

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:52.320 align:middle line:90%
because they accepted you?

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.970 align:middle line:84%
Or had you calmed
everything down

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:57.060 align:middle line:84%
and were you appearing to
me more like a normal girl?

00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:00.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: I was appearing
to be more like a normal girl.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:05.040 align:middle line:84%
However, at that time,
for an arranged marriage,

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.300 align:middle line:84%
you had to be more around
the age of 19, 20, 21.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:15.870 align:middle line:84%
So they made me feel like they
were making a huge adjustment

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:17.523 align:middle line:90%
accepting me at age 26.

00:09:17.523 --> 00:09:18.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Doing you a favor?

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:20.315 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: They were
doing me a favor.

00:09:20.315 --> 00:09:25.200 align:middle line:84%
So because they then accepted
me, I wasn't allowed to say no,

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.700 align:middle line:84%
because then I was seen as being
really picky and ungrateful.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:30.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And what about--

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:33.345 align:middle line:84%
OK, so between you
and them is the man?

00:09:33.345 --> 00:09:34.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about that for a moment.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.340 align:middle line:90%
What was he like?

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:39.360 align:middle line:90%
How did he perceive you?

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: So although he
was nice and he was sweet,

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.115 align:middle line:84%
he wanted me to make
his parents happy.

00:09:45.115 --> 00:09:45.915 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:09:45.915 --> 00:09:48.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: And
his parents wanted

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:54.240 align:middle line:84%
me to learn to cook
and clean, and they

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.840 align:middle line:84%
wanted me to wear more Indian
clothes and to cover my head

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.090 align:middle line:84%
and to go to the
temple twice a week.

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And his parents made
it clear I would not

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:04.913 align:middle line:84%
be allowed to work or be
independent or go back

00:10:04.913 --> 00:10:07.080 align:middle line:84%
to study or earn my own
money, none of those things.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you went
through with the marriage?

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.885 align:middle line:90%
Did you go through with it?

00:10:09.885 --> 00:10:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: No, so three
days before the wedding--

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:14.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, this is gutsy.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: I know.

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:17.010 align:middle line:84%
I just couldn't go
through with it.

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:19.410 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh, my gosh,
this is the rest of my life.

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:20.210 align:middle line:90%
I can't.

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:21.390 align:middle line:90%
I can't do it.

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:23.180 align:middle line:90%
And I ran away.

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:23.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:24.675 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: Yeah,
and if you know--

00:10:24.675 --> 00:10:26.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is a big deal.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: Yes, and if you
know anything about Indian

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.220 align:middle line:90%
weddings--

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, they're days long.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.805 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: Yes, so
everything was booked,

00:10:33.805 --> 00:10:35.555 align:middle line:84%
you know, the venues,
the people had flown

00:10:35.555 --> 00:10:36.680 align:middle line:90%
in from all over the world.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All over the caterers.

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:38.685 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:10:38.685 --> 00:10:39.602 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my gosh.

00:10:39.602 --> 00:10:42.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: All of it; the
musicians, the horses, like,

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:43.020 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is
so gutsy to do that.

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:47.770 align:middle line:84%
I have been to Indian
weddings and the pre-events

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:50.755 align:middle line:84%
and all of it, and
it's so staged.

00:10:50.755 --> 00:10:52.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes, it is.

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:53.800 align:middle line:90%
It's choreographed.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.240 align:middle line:90%
It's staged, all of it.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.370 align:middle line:84%
The videographers,
all of it was booked.

00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:01.225 align:middle line:90%
So this was in 1987.

00:11:01.225 --> 00:11:03.895 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wow, what a
courageous thing to do.

00:11:03.895 --> 00:11:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: Yes, I look back
on it now, and I think it is--

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.170 align:middle line:84%
I am surprised that
I was able to do it

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:15.010 align:middle line:84%
because I used to be so fearful
and such a people pleaser.

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And it seems really courageous,
but at the same time,

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:24.590 align:middle line:84%
I was very fearful of
getting into the marriage

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:25.400 align:middle line:90%
and the whole--

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, understandably.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I mean, it wasn't for you.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:31.260 align:middle line:84%
I just-- I mean, I really
admire your courage.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.800 align:middle line:84%
I would have never been--
like, I was in that situation,

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:34.940 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't do it.

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:36.950 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, god
everybody would be so upset.

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:38.635 align:middle line:90%
I'll figure it out later.

00:11:38.635 --> 00:11:40.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: So what
happened actually,

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:43.370 align:middle line:84%
and I haven't shared
this part publicly,

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:47.870 align:middle line:84%
is that I confided in my mom
three days before the wedding,

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.710 align:middle line:90%
and I just cried and cried.

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:51.150 align:middle line:90%
And I said, mom, I'm miserable.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:51.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm miserable.

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:54.165 align:middle line:84%
And she said, why didn't
you tell me earlier?

00:11:54.165 --> 00:11:55.790 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to go
through with this.

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:57.890 align:middle line:84%
I said, but I
can't back off now.

00:11:57.890 --> 00:11:59.850 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's going to be upset.

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:02.718 align:middle line:84%
And she said, yes, they
are, but I'll back you up.

00:12:02.718 --> 00:12:04.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, that's wonderful.

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:04.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: I know.

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:05.390 align:middle line:90%
Bless her.

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:06.076 align:middle line:90%
And she just passed away.

00:12:06.076 --> 00:12:07.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She just passed
away a few weeks ago.

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:08.816 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: Yeah, she
and I were so close.

00:12:08.816 --> 00:12:10.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What a wonderful mom.

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:14.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: And sure
enough, everybody was upset,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.950 align:middle line:84%
and they took it
out on her as well.

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:17.720 align:middle line:84%
They said, you've
spoiled your daughter.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.480 align:middle line:84%
You should just slap her and
have her show up at the temple.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.070 align:middle line:90%
How can you let her do this?

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:23.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What a story.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:23.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yeah.

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:25.405 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
happened to you then?

00:12:25.405 --> 00:12:28.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously, you and
your mom understood each other

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:28.915 align:middle line:90%
and stayed close.

00:12:28.915 --> 00:12:30.290 align:middle line:84%
But what happened
to your family,

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:31.790 align:middle line:84%
and what happened
to you after this?

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:36.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: So I was ostracized
from the community completely.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:39.860 align:middle line:84%
I was told that no other
Indian man would marry me

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:41.030 align:middle line:90%
after what I'd done.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:46.550 align:middle line:84%
No parents of Indian men would
let their son come near me.

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:49.470 align:middle line:84%
So I was basically, yes,
completely rejected.

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:51.035 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you
were an outcast.

00:12:51.035 --> 00:12:53.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: I was
an outcast, exactly.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.960 align:middle line:84%
So what I did was
I gradually started

00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.320 align:middle line:84%
to become more independent
because of this,

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.880 align:middle line:90%
because I was rejected anyway.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.085 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Nothing to lose.

00:13:03.085 --> 00:13:04.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Nothing to lose.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:06.500 align:middle line:90%
So I started working.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:09.890 align:middle line:84%
So I worked for a
few years, and I

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:13.400 align:middle line:84%
started to meet people from
all different cultures.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And my life was
actually pretty OK.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:17.820 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't bad at all.

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And then interestingly,
I met my husband, Danny,

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:24.230 align:middle line:90%
who happens to be Indian.

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:28.280 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting thing is he
had told his parents that he's

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:29.960 align:middle line:84%
not going to marry
an Indian woman,

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.353 align:middle line:84%
and they had been trying to
arrange a marriage for him.

00:13:32.353 --> 00:13:33.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
both black sheep.

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:36.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: So he was a
complete black sheep as well,

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.870 align:middle line:84%
and so we realized
we really hit it off.

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, that's wonderful.

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:42.500 align:middle line:84%
So then you just had
a private marriage

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.228 align:middle line:90%
on your own and not a big deal?

00:13:44.228 --> 00:13:45.353 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes, we had a--

00:13:45.353 --> 00:13:46.795 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not the kind
of production as before?

00:13:46.795 --> 00:13:48.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: Yes, we had
a much smaller wedding.

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:49.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did your
mother and father come?

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:50.450 align:middle line:90%
Did your mother--

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:52.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: So my
mother was there,

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.960 align:middle line:84%
but my dad had passed away
prior to me getting married.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:55.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.305 align:middle line:84%
But your mom was
there to support you?

00:13:57.305 --> 00:13:57.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes, she was.

00:13:57.890 --> 00:13:59.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
a wonderful story.

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:02.000 align:middle line:90%
So when was that?

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.260 align:middle line:90%
When did you marry Danny?

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: We got married
in 1995, December of '95.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:07.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:12.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: So it was
about seven, eight years

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:15.290 align:middle line:84%
after I ran away from
the arranged marriage.

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:17.827 align:middle line:84%
So I went and worked
for a few years and--

00:14:17.827 --> 00:14:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now let's talk
about your spiritual path

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:20.993 align:middle line:90%
because this is important.

00:14:20.993 --> 00:14:22.160 align:middle line:90%
You were trying everything.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.535 align:middle line:84%
You were trying
really hard to be

00:14:23.535 --> 00:14:25.190 align:middle line:84%
a spiritually wise,
developed woman.

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:27.195 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes, I was.

00:14:27.195 --> 00:14:27.995 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A seeker?

00:14:27.995 --> 00:14:29.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: A seeker.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I took the
spiritual path of,

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:35.930 align:middle line:84%
like, I really
lived my life to--

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:37.730 align:middle line:84%
the guru impacted
me, so I really

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:42.260 align:middle line:84%
lived my life to try and create
the best possible afterlife

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:46.520 align:middle line:84%
because I had this
belief, again,

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:50.120 align:middle line:84%
not only because of that guru
but things that were instilled

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:54.500 align:middle line:84%
in me, that I had this belief
that you have to try and finish

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:56.180 align:middle line:90%
your karmic cycles.

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:59.570 align:middle line:84%
You attain nirvana when you
don't need to come back again,

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:01.400 align:middle line:84%
and that's the
reward that you don't

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.590 align:middle line:84%
need to come back here
again and live another life.

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:06.035 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you have to live
perfection while incarnate?

00:15:06.035 --> 00:15:07.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Exactly.

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:10.760 align:middle line:84%
So I tried to attain that
perfection so that I wouldn't

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.510 align:middle line:90%
need to be incarnate again.

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:19.046 align:middle line:84%
And so in order to
attain that perfection,

00:15:19.046 --> 00:15:23.330 align:middle line:84%
I felt that I needed to meditate
more, cleanse myself more,

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:24.770 align:middle line:90%
be more pure of thought.

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:27.590 align:middle line:84%
But of course, what I
didn't realize at that time

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:30.530 align:middle line:84%
is that when you're trying
to do it, it's contrived.

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:31.795 align:middle line:90%
It's not who you are.

00:15:31.795 --> 00:15:33.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's so much pressure.

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:35.750 align:middle line:84%
Number one, it
was based on fear,

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:37.482 align:middle line:84%
fear of not getting
into nirvana.

00:15:37.482 --> 00:15:38.315 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Exactly.

00:15:38.315 --> 00:15:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So everything
was fear driven, which

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:42.800 align:middle line:90%
is not a good way to blossom.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Exactly.

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, I didn't
realize that I had actually--

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:53.270 align:middle line:84%
I was, over the years, since
this whole thing happened,

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:55.100 align:middle line:84%
even after running
away from the marriage,

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:58.175 align:middle line:84%
even though I had a
job and everything,

00:15:58.175 --> 00:16:03.110 align:middle line:84%
I still really held on to that
guilt and the feelings of being

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:06.320 align:middle line:84%
ostracized from my community
and having people--

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.290 align:middle line:84%
it just feels awful when
you think that there's

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:12.320 align:middle line:84%
so many people that disapprove
of you and your choices

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:15.860 align:middle line:84%
and think a certain way
of you, because inside, I

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:19.910 align:middle line:90%
knew I was not that person.

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:24.472 align:middle line:84%
And so I lived with all of
that eating away inside at me.

00:16:24.472 --> 00:16:26.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're
trying to overcome it

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:30.125 align:middle line:84%
by being good and pious
and everything correct?

00:16:30.125 --> 00:16:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes, exactly.

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:32.570 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:36.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so along the
way, you had your friends,

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:39.500 align:middle line:84%
and you had a couple of
key people close to you

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.385 align:middle line:84%
that had developed
cancer, right?

00:16:41.385 --> 00:16:42.185 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:16:42.185 --> 00:16:44.518 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about
that part of your journey.

00:16:44.518 --> 00:16:48.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: Yes, so my best
friend who I grew up with,

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:51.080 align:middle line:84%
we were the same age,
and we knew each other

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.340 align:middle line:90%
since we were at school.

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:55.400 align:middle line:84%
She developed
cancer, and it seemed

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.610 align:middle line:90%
to just come out of the blue.

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:00.140 align:middle line:90%
And it was an aggressive cancer.

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:04.550 align:middle line:84%
It was literally, right from
when she was diagnosed--

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:07.520 align:middle line:90%
so she's fine one day to me.

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:08.420 align:middle line:90%
That's how it looks.

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:10.875 align:middle line:84%
But she's having trouble
breathing, a little bit

00:17:10.875 --> 00:17:11.750 align:middle line:90%
of trouble breathing.

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:13.910 align:middle line:84%
But other than that,
she looks fine,

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:17.060 align:middle line:84%
and she's going up and down
the stairs, and she's saying,

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:19.220 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'm having trouble
catching my breath.

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:20.314 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Would you
have been in your 30s?

00:17:20.314 --> 00:17:21.606 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: We were in our 30s.

00:17:21.606 --> 00:17:22.579 align:middle line:90%
So we were young.

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:23.839 align:middle line:90%
We were in our 30s.

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:25.640 align:middle line:84%
So she goes to the
doctor, and they

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.790 align:middle line:84%
find that she has this
huge tumor in her chest

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:31.610 align:middle line:84%
that's pressing against
her lungs and her heart.

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And so they told her it was a
very aggressive form of cancer

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:42.290 align:middle line:84%
and that her survival
rate was 0% to 5%,

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:46.190 align:middle line:84%
that there was a 95% chance
that within two years

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:49.730 align:middle line:90%
she would not be around.

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:52.860 align:middle line:84%
When she got that news,
it was devastating.

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:57.090 align:middle line:84%
But for me, I felt it as
if it had happened to me.

00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:58.650 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't believe it.

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:00.920 align:middle line:84%
It was devastating
for me to hear

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:04.050 align:middle line:84%
that here is my best friend
who's like a sister to me

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:07.550 align:middle line:84%
and she's just been
diagnosed with this.

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And I suddenly found
that I couldn't even

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:15.770 align:middle line:84%
live my own life without
constantly thinking about her

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:18.020 align:middle line:84%
and worrying about her and
worrying about what she's

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:19.355 align:middle line:90%
going through and her family.

00:18:19.355 --> 00:18:20.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: More fear.

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:21.395 align:middle line:90%
Loads of fear.

00:18:21.395 --> 00:18:22.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Loads of fear.

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:23.570 align:middle line:90%
Loads of fear.

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And I was-- like,
I couldn't even

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:30.350 align:middle line:84%
go out with my
friends to have fun

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:32.420 align:middle line:84%
because I would
be thinking, what

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.880 align:middle line:84%
right do I have to be out
here laughing and eating

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.110 align:middle line:90%
when she's dying?

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:39.460 align:middle line:84%
I should be there with her and
comforting her and cheering her

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:40.260 align:middle line:90%
up.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And so for the entire
time that she was sick,

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:46.745 align:middle line:90%
I just did not take care.

00:18:46.745 --> 00:18:47.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You were devoted.

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:48.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: I was devoted.

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:49.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To her.

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:51.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: Yes, I didn't
take care of myself.

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.570 align:middle line:90%
I didn't do anything for myself.

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And then I think it was almost
two years, a year and a half

00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:01.760 align:middle line:84%
to almost two years, into that,
into me not doing anything

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:05.480 align:middle line:84%
for myself, and she
was deteriorating.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.070 align:middle line:90%
She just kept deteriorating.

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:08.240 align:middle line:90%
And even though she was--

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you were eating
poorly, sleeping poorly,

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:11.260 align:middle line:90%
all of that?

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:14.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: All of that;
eating poorly, sleeping poorly.

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And then I found a lump
on my neck over here,

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:20.900 align:middle line:84%
and I went to the doctor
to have it checked out.

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:25.250 align:middle line:84%
He did a biopsy, and he told me
that it was lymphatic cancer.

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:28.170 align:middle line:84%
It was at stage two
lymphatic cancer,

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:29.750 align:middle line:90%
which was a shock at first.

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:30.830 align:middle line:90%
It was a shock.

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:35.090 align:middle line:84%
But there was also a feeling
that came into me of,

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:38.340 align:middle line:84%
oh, now I get to
take care of myself.

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:40.160 align:middle line:84%
It was, like, now
I had a reason.

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.250 align:middle line:90%
I had cancer too.

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:46.125 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Interesting how far
one has to go to see that.

00:19:46.125 --> 00:19:46.925 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yeah.

00:19:46.925 --> 00:19:48.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:49.805 align:middle line:90%
And then she did ultimately die?

00:19:49.805 --> 00:19:52.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: She did
ultimately die, yes.

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:55.875 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then you fought
the cancer about four years,

00:19:55.875 --> 00:19:56.675 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:19:56.675 --> 00:19:57.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Four years.

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:57.602 align:middle line:84%
I was fighting it
for four years.

00:19:57.602 --> 00:19:59.705 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then they
told you it's over?

00:19:59.705 --> 00:20:02.165 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: They told me I
had three months to live.

00:20:02.165 --> 00:20:02.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:04.987 align:middle line:84%
And now were you in your
early 40s back then?

00:20:04.987 --> 00:20:06.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: I was in
my very early 40s then?

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:07.653 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Early 40s.

00:20:07.653 --> 00:20:09.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: Yes,
I was in my 40s,

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:13.080 align:middle line:84%
and then they told me I
had three months to live.

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:16.520 align:middle line:84%
And when they told
me that, I actually

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:18.073 align:middle line:84%
started deteriorating
even faster.

00:20:18.073 --> 00:20:19.115 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, well, sure.

00:20:19.115 --> 00:20:20.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yeah, much faster.

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:22.135 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You weren't
fighting anymore.

00:20:22.135 --> 00:20:24.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: I stopped
fighting, and I really

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:25.330 align:middle line:90%
started deteriorating.

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And then I reached a
point where my body

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:30.910 align:middle line:90%
stopped absorbing nutrition.

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And so this was
lymphatic cancer,

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:36.080 align:middle line:84%
so it had spread throughout
my lymphatic system.

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:40.450 align:middle line:84%
So by then, I had tumors
about the size of golf balls

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:44.020 align:middle line:84%
all around, like, from
the base of my skull,

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:45.048 align:middle line:90%
all around my neck.

00:20:45.048 --> 00:20:46.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your immune
system was collapsed.

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: It was collapsed.

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And my body stopped
absorbing nutrition,

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.710 align:middle line:90%
so I weighed about 85 pounds.

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:56.420 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have the strength
to stand up and walk,

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:57.520 align:middle line:90%
so I was in a wheelchair.

00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.350 align:middle line:84%
But I couldn't even
hold my head up.

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:02.390 align:middle line:84%
My head would be
hanging down like that,

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:04.910 align:middle line:84%
and my lungs were
filled with fluid.

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And so I looked like a skeleton,
and I had these open skin

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:12.220 align:middle line:84%
lesions where toxins were
coming out of my skin.

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And if I lay down,
if I lay flat,

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:17.140 align:middle line:90%
I would choke on my own fluid.

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And I was breathing
with the aid of oxygen.

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:22.545 align:middle line:84%
I had a portable
oxygen tank with me.

00:21:22.545 --> 00:21:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you
have enough strength

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.285 align:middle line:90%
to even be fearful anymore?

00:21:26.285 --> 00:21:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: No.

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:34.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was fearful of death,
but yet, I reached a point

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.230 align:middle line:84%
where I stopped
fighting to stay alive

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:38.480 align:middle line:84%
because I had been fighting
and fighting and fighting,

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.140 align:middle line:90%
and then it was like--

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:40.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You
fought for her, then

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.985 align:middle line:90%
you're fighting for yourself.

00:21:40.985 --> 00:21:41.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:42.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:43.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: And then I was done.

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:44.680 align:middle line:90%
I was done.

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:47.468 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so then the
wonderful part happens.

00:21:47.468 --> 00:21:49.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: Yes, and this
is where it gets very--

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:51.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is what
made your story your story.

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.665 align:middle line:84%
So share with us what happened
next because you're gone.

00:21:54.665 --> 00:21:59.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: Yes, so I went into
a coma on February the 2nd.

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:00.620 align:middle line:90%
I had been being treated--

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:02.720 align:middle line:84%
I was being treated at
home, but my husband

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.190 align:middle line:90%
rushed me to the hospital.

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors told him and my
family-- my mother was there.

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:08.810 align:middle line:90%
My brother was there.

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:12.320 align:middle line:84%
The doctors told my family
that these were my final hours

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.930 align:middle line:84%
and that I wasn't going
to come out of the coma.

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And they said that
my organs were now

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:21.290 align:middle line:84%
shutting down one by one, and my
kidneys had already shut down.

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And they were already
running the tests,

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.880 align:middle line:90%
and they were putting--

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.100 align:middle line:84%
I was connected to
all these tubes,

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:30.960 align:middle line:84%
and I was in the
intensive care unit.

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:34.190 align:middle line:84%
But what the people
around me didn't know

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:38.570 align:middle line:84%
was that I had left my body,
and I could see all of this.

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:41.510 align:middle line:84%
I could see it all happening
all around my body,

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:44.570 align:middle line:84%
my physical body, but I
was watching everybody.

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:48.350 align:middle line:84%
And we're not looking
through physical eyes

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:50.490 align:middle line:84%
because we don't
have physical eyes.

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:53.040 align:middle line:90%
It's more like a pure awareness.

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:54.740 align:middle line:90%
So I was aware.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:58.970 align:middle line:84%
It was like I had 360-degree
peripheral vision,

00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:01.790 align:middle line:84%
and I was aware
of everything that

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:06.380 align:middle line:84%
was happening, not
only in that ICU unit,

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:08.240 align:middle line:84%
not only in that
intensive care unit,

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:11.630 align:middle line:84%
but beyond outside the
unit what was happening,

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:15.050 align:middle line:84%
what the nurses were doing,
and what the conversations

00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:18.320 align:middle line:84%
that my husband was having
with the doctors outside.

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.600 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor
said to my husband

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:23.660 align:middle line:84%
that she's not even going to
make it through the night.

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And also, I was
aware that they were

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:28.100 align:middle line:84%
trying to remove
fluid from my lungs

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:30.920 align:middle line:84%
because my body
started to choke,

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:33.920 align:middle line:84%
and so they started to insert
needles through my back

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.510 align:middle line:90%
and remove the fluid.

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:38.160 align:middle line:84%
So I was watching
all this happen,

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:42.300 align:middle line:84%
but then I felt myself
go deeper or higher.

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And I started to become
aware that I was surrounded

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:51.890 align:middle line:84%
by beings, and all I could
feel was this beautiful feeling

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:54.440 align:middle line:90%
of just unconditional love.

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:58.010 align:middle line:84%
Just this incredible
feeling of just being

00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:00.840 align:middle line:90%
bathed in love, pure love.

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:02.565 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
opposite of your guru.

00:24:02.565 --> 00:24:03.365 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:24:03.365 --> 00:24:04.165 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:04.165 --> 00:24:07.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: Yes, the
complete opposite.

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And the part that struck
me was that I didn't have

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:13.250 align:middle line:90%
to do anything or be anything.

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:16.670 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have to work
at being spiritual.

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:20.450 align:middle line:84%
I was loved just
because I existed,

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:23.870 align:middle line:84%
and I understood
that I am spiritual.

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:24.860 align:middle line:90%
We all are.

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:26.510 align:middle line:90%
We all are spirit.

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:28.110 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to work at it.

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:30.950 align:middle line:90%
So I just felt incredible.

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:34.595 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember feeling this
way ever in physical life.

00:24:34.595 --> 00:24:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:36.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, who does, right?

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:36.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:38.223 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that completely.

00:24:38.223 --> 00:24:42.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: Completely and being
fully accepted for who you are.

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:45.030 align:middle line:84%
No matter what, no matter
what you've done wrong,

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:46.730 align:middle line:90%
I was fully accepted.

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:50.795 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So then there comes
a choice point, I would assume?

00:24:50.795 --> 00:24:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: Yes, so I eventually
reached a choice point.

00:24:54.480 --> 00:25:00.290 align:middle line:10%
So I was in the coma for
about 30 to 36 hours.

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:03.710 align:middle line:90%
And so my dad was there.

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:07.250 align:middle line:84%
My best friend was there,
the one who I had lost.

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:09.710 align:middle line:90%
And I reached a point--

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:11.510 align:middle line:84%
and of course, a lot
happened in that time,

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:12.950 align:middle line:84%
but I reached a
point where I was

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:17.450 align:middle line:84%
given a choice as to whether
I wanted to come back or not.

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:20.330 align:middle line:84%
No part of me
wanted to come back.

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:21.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:23.945 align:middle line:84%
I think we can all
relate to that, yes.

00:25:23.945 --> 00:25:24.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:26.143 align:middle line:90%
Yes, and why would I?

00:25:26.143 --> 00:25:27.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
especially if you're

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:30.230 align:middle line:84%
coming back into a
body that's, well,

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:31.955 align:middle line:90%
so devastated with illness.

00:25:31.955 --> 00:25:33.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Exactly.

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:35.150 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:37.940 align:middle line:84%
But in that moment,
when I made the decision

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:40.880 align:middle line:84%
that I don't want
to go back, I felt

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.280 align:middle line:90%
my dad coaxing me to come back.

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:46.700 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't forcing me,
but it was a gentle

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:50.400 align:middle line:84%
that now that you know the
truth of who you really are,

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.050 align:middle line:90%
you should go back.

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And then there was a
message of that you haven't

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:58.290 align:middle line:90%
completed your purpose yet.

00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:01.290 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to go back,
but in actuality, this

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:02.430 align:middle line:90%
is not your time.

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:05.080 align:middle line:84%
There are still some
gifts waiting for you.

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:07.680 align:middle line:90%
And the other thing I realized--

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.930 align:middle line:84%
and the communication
there is not

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:13.080 align:middle line:84%
done with speaking
because you can't speak.

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:16.020 align:middle line:84%
It's more, like, you know
what they want you to know.

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:22.140 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that my husband
and I, Danny's and my purposes

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:25.650 align:middle line:84%
were linked, and if
I didn't go back,

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:28.740 align:middle line:84%
he wouldn't be able to
complete his purpose either.

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you
mind sharing what

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:32.730 align:middle line:84%
his purpose, your linked,
your shared purpose was?

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:36.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: Well, and what's
interesting is, at that time,

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:38.610 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
my purpose was.

00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:41.087 align:middle line:84%
So the purpose wasn't
revealed to me.

00:26:41.087 --> 00:26:41.962 align:middle line:90%
I was actually just--

00:26:41.962 --> 00:26:44.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just that you had to
go on faith that this is true?

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:45.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: That this is true.

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And the instruction
I was given is just

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:52.440 align:middle line:84%
live your life
fearlessly, and what

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:56.700 align:middle line:84%
was meant by that was be
yourself fearlessly because I

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.238 align:middle line:90%
had never been myself.

00:26:58.238 --> 00:26:59.571 align:middle line:90%
I had always been trying to be--

00:26:59.571 --> 00:27:00.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It sounds
like when you

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:02.550 align:middle line:84%
were trying to be Cyndi Lauper,
that was the closest you

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:03.350 align:middle line:90%
were to yourself.

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:06.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: Yes, and that
was wrong in my culture.

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:07.845 align:middle line:90%
Yes, exactly.

00:27:07.845 --> 00:27:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So talk
about the experience

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:13.200 align:middle line:84%
of after the decision
was made to come back.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:17.460 align:middle line:84%
Your dad says, basically, honey,
go live and live your life

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:18.555 align:middle line:90%
fearlessly and be you.

00:27:18.555 --> 00:27:19.515 align:middle line:90%
Now you know the truth.

00:27:19.515 --> 00:27:20.315 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:27:20.315 --> 00:27:23.786 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now you have to
rejoin with the physical world.

00:27:23.786 --> 00:27:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: So the minute I
made the decision to come back,

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:31.740 align:middle line:84%
my physical eyes started
to open on my body.

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:33.960 align:middle line:84%
My physical eyes
started to open,

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.520 align:middle line:84%
and my family were
all around me.

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And so they were elated, and
they said, oh, she's back.

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And Danny was jumping
up and down in joy,

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:48.300 align:middle line:84%
and I started saying
things like, dad's here.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:49.530 align:middle line:90%
Dad's right here.

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:51.450 align:middle line:90%
Dad said it's not my time.

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:53.340 align:middle line:84%
So they were wondering
what's going on.

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:56.670 align:middle line:90%
Like, is she delusional?

00:27:56.670 --> 00:28:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And so they called the doctor,
and the doctor came in.

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And so I recognized
the doctor immediately

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.520 align:middle line:84%
as the one that had tried to
remove fluid from my lungs,

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:09.390 align:middle line:84%
and I said, oh, Hi, Dr. Chan,
or good evening, Dr. Chan.

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And he said, how do
you know my name?

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:14.490 align:middle line:84%
Because he was not
the doctor that

00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:16.380 align:middle line:90%
had ever treated me before.

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:19.870 align:middle line:84%
He was just the emergency
doctor on duty at that time.

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:21.780 align:middle line:84%
So he said, how do
you know my name?

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And I said, aren't
you the one that

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:26.190 align:middle line:84%
removed fluid from my lungs
in the middle of the night?

00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yeah, but
you were in a coma.

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:29.910 align:middle line:90%
You didn't see me.

00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:33.180 align:middle line:84%
So everybody started to
realize something had happened,

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:35.520 align:middle line:90%
but he tried to dismiss it.

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:38.490 align:middle line:84%
And then he said to
my family something

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:42.270 align:middle line:84%
along the lines of don't raise
your hopes because it's not

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:46.890 align:middle line:84%
unusual for a patient to open
their eyes for a little while,

00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:48.660 align:middle line:90%
but she's still critical.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:49.633 align:middle line:90%
She's still critical.

00:28:49.633 --> 00:28:52.050 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I was still
dying but don't read anything.

00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:53.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They had
this moment of grace.

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:54.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:57.330 align:middle line:84%
So he leaves the
room, and then I

00:28:57.330 --> 00:29:00.720 align:middle line:84%
said to Danny that why
was he so surprised

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.920 align:middle line:90%
that I recognized him?

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he was in here,
and then he said to you

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:07.530 align:middle line:84%
that I'm not even going to
make it through the night.

00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And Danny said, you
couldn't have heard that.

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:11.070 align:middle line:90%
He didn't say that here.

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:13.980 align:middle line:84%
He said that to me outside
in the nurses' station.

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's when everyone
started to realize

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:18.570 align:middle line:90%
that something had happened.

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And in four days, the
tumors shrunk by about 60%.

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:26.697 align:middle line:84%
That's when the doctors
also started to realize,

00:29:26.697 --> 00:29:27.780 align:middle line:90%
OK, something's happening.

00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:29.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Some things happened.

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And so your lungs, the
fluid, everything else

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.530 align:middle line:84%
that was going on,
how long did it

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:36.285 align:middle line:90%
take for your body to recover?

00:29:36.285 --> 00:29:40.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: So three
weeks after the NDE,

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:44.980 align:middle line:84%
they could find no trace
of cancer in my body.

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:46.360 align:middle line:90%
And so they were shocked.

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:48.870 align:middle line:84%
They didn't even know what to
write in my medical record.

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, my doctor
made the gesture

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:55.440 align:middle line:84%
of wanting to sort of throw my
medical record in the trash.

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.870 align:middle line:84%
There was a trash bin
right there, and he goes,

00:29:57.870 --> 00:29:59.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
what to write in here.

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:01.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Spontaneous healing?

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:02.655 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yeah, yes.

00:30:02.655 --> 00:30:07.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is what-- your
spirit, your soul, and maybe

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:09.690 align:middle line:84%
a little help from
friends, something

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:12.900 align:middle line:84%
happened to make this
statement so that everybody

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:13.867 align:middle line:90%
could witness it.

00:30:13.867 --> 00:30:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And then you came to the
attention of others after this.

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:16.545 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:30:16.545 --> 00:30:17.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how
long did it take

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.173 align:middle line:84%
for you to kind of get
your life back a bit

00:30:20.173 --> 00:30:21.840 align:middle line:84%
where you gained a
little weight and you

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.400 align:middle line:90%
could start functioning again?

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:26.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: So it
took about two months

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:29.220 align:middle line:84%
for me to actually be able to
start functioning and going

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:31.542 align:middle line:84%
out and walking
properly because I

00:30:31.542 --> 00:30:33.000 align:middle line:84%
had to do a bit of
physical therapy

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:33.792 align:middle line:90%
to get strength in my bones.

00:30:33.792 --> 00:30:34.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You'd been
atrophied, yeah.

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:36.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: Yes,
I'd been atrophied.

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And so it took maybe
about two months,

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:43.380 align:middle line:84%
but to really look
normal and gain weight,

00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:45.270 align:middle line:84%
maybe around three,
four, or five months.

00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:47.650 align:middle line:84%
But people would
see me, people who

00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:50.620 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't seen in months
who knew I was dying,

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:53.260 align:middle line:84%
and I would walk into a
room, and they would gasp.

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:54.400 align:middle line:90%
They would actually gasp.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:58.135 align:middle line:84%
It was like, oh, my
god, you look normal.

00:30:58.135 --> 00:31:01.960 align:middle line:84%
They were shocked because they
didn't know what to expect.

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:04.450 align:middle line:84%
If they knew I was
coming to an event,

00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:06.220 align:middle line:84%
they didn't know what
to expect, how bad

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:09.640 align:middle line:84%
I would look because I looked
terrible leading up to it,

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:10.960 align:middle line:90%
like, really awful.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, skeletal.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.735 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Skeletal, yes.

00:31:13.735 --> 00:31:16.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
understood something

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:21.040 align:middle line:84%
during this, which was
it was the joy itself

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:22.250 align:middle line:90%
that was the healing?

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:23.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:24.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It wasn't the fear.

00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:26.110 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't the beliefs.

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:27.310 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't there anymore.

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:29.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: No, it
was the joy itself.

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:33.760 align:middle line:84%
So the number of times that
I had been told things like--

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.190 align:middle line:84%
there was another
guru that actually

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:38.650 align:middle line:84%
said-- when I had
the cancer and I

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:41.780 align:middle line:84%
tried everything and
nothing seemed to work.

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh, it's
probably your karma.

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:47.200 align:middle line:84%
You'll have to do more
good work, more good karma.

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:51.220 align:middle line:84%
Now there I was already at that
point somebody who had already

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:53.290 align:middle line:84%
been doing all this good
work because I wanted

00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:57.520 align:middle line:84%
to clear my karma, and I was
already this really good person

00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:00.970 align:middle line:84%
and pious and meditated
and thought of myself

00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:02.320 align:middle line:90%
as super spiritual.

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And then to be told you need
to do more good work, more

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:09.230 align:middle line:84%
charity, what it does is
it completely depletes you.

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:10.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: It
removes you of every--

00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:14.157 align:middle line:84%
you become invisible,
totally invisible.

00:32:14.157 --> 00:32:15.865 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There was
no joy at that point.

00:32:15.865 --> 00:32:16.665 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: No joy.

00:32:16.665 --> 00:32:19.990 align:middle line:84%
What I needed was
the opposite message.

00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is why, for me,
my story is so important.

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:27.370 align:middle line:90%
It's not about doing and doing.

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:29.710 align:middle line:84%
It's about undoing,
letting it all go

00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:32.860 align:middle line:84%
and setting yourself free,
setting your spirit free,

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:35.650 align:middle line:84%
because when we get these
messages that I need

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:38.260 align:middle line:84%
to be good, I need to do
good, and it's my karma,

00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:40.150 align:middle line:84%
and I need to do
more good works,

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:42.360 align:middle line:84%
the message you're sending
yourself and your soul--

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
not good enough.

00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:44.548 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: You're
not good enough.

00:32:44.548 --> 00:32:46.385 align:middle line:84%
That your spirit is
essentially flawed.

00:32:46.385 --> 00:32:48.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:51.600 align:middle line:84%
What a simple, direct,
beautiful message.

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.630 align:middle line:90%
But almost everybody seems--

00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:57.690 align:middle line:84%
I think the demands
of society and others

00:32:57.690 --> 00:32:59.880 align:middle line:84%
hold sway over us to
where we do feel we have

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:03.660 align:middle line:90%
to perform and please others.

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:06.708 align:middle line:84%
And actually,
instead of listening

00:33:06.708 --> 00:33:08.250 align:middle line:84%
to what's best for
ourselves, I think

00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:10.350 align:middle line:84%
that's very common for
people watching this.

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:11.535 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: Yes, it
is, and especially--

00:33:11.535 --> 00:33:13.875 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Most people do this
to one extent or another.

00:33:13.875 --> 00:33:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: Yes, and I
find especially people

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:17.130 align:middle line:90%
on a spiritual path.

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:17.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:19.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: And so
I was taught, when

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.760 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to
be very spiritual,

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:24.780 align:middle line:84%
I was taught that you have to
be of service, which is great,

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:28.140 align:middle line:84%
and you have to learn to see
the god in everybody's eyes

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:30.420 align:middle line:84%
and see god in
everybody, which I did.

00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:31.380 align:middle line:90%
I was of service.

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:32.970 align:middle line:90%
I saw god in everybody.

00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:35.433 align:middle line:84%
When I died, I
realized I'd forgotten

00:33:35.433 --> 00:33:36.516 align:middle line:90%
to see god in my own eyes.

00:33:36.516 --> 00:33:37.865 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In yourself, yes.

00:33:37.865 --> 00:33:38.665 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:33:38.665 --> 00:33:41.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
spontaneously healed

00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:44.710 align:middle line:84%
from that ecstasy, that
bliss, and that joy?

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:45.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:46.843 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Your being was healed.

00:33:46.843 --> 00:33:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And also I think
that was probably

00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:51.356 align:middle line:84%
in the design all
along, would you say?

00:33:51.356 --> 00:33:52.314 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: I think so.

00:33:52.314 --> 00:33:54.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That this
happened in your life

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:56.780 align:middle line:84%
so that you could come because
your mission wasn't finished.

00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:57.580 align:middle line:90%
It had only begun.

00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:58.075 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:33:58.075 --> 00:34:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you could
share this story with others

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.690 align:middle line:90%
that that's what it's all about.

00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is not to be
confused with fulfilling 3D

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:08.590 align:middle line:90%
sensual desires and narcissism.

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:11.260 align:middle line:84%
And talk about that for a
moment because the new book

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:13.179 align:middle line:84%
that you've written
really has to do

00:34:13.179 --> 00:34:16.510 align:middle line:84%
with honoring empaths
and honoring sensitivity,

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:18.010 align:middle line:90%
honoring kindness.

00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:22.639 align:middle line:84%
That this is where humanity
has to go to find its strength.

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:24.730 align:middle line:84%
So tell us about that
because we're not

00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:26.170 align:middle line:90%
talking about just narcissism.

00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:27.290 align:middle line:90%
Like, it's all about me.

00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:28.539 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to do
what feels good now.

00:34:28.539 --> 00:34:29.831 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes, it's not that.

00:34:29.831 --> 00:34:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: People conflate
those two ideas oftentimes.

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:37.179 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: And the reason
they conflate these ideas is

00:34:37.179 --> 00:34:42.620 align:middle line:84%
because the messages that
we receive, for example,

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:48.900 align:middle line:84%
when you have spiritual messages
telling you things like the ego

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:51.360 align:middle line:84%
is bad and you have
to squash your ego,

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:54.225 align:middle line:84%
you have to repress your
ego, and we see the ego

00:34:54.225 --> 00:34:55.025 align:middle line:90%
as the enemy--

00:34:55.025 --> 00:34:55.949 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's not.

00:34:55.949 --> 00:34:56.991 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: But it's not.

00:34:56.991 --> 00:34:58.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, it's
just your identity.

00:34:58.600 --> 00:34:59.730 align:middle line:90%
It's who you are.

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:00.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Exactly.

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:01.740 align:middle line:90%
It's who you are.

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:02.085 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:02.085 --> 00:35:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: But I grew
up believing that,

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:06.930 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of traditional,
conventional spiritual teachers

00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:08.855 align:middle line:84%
still teach you that
the ego is your enemy.

00:35:08.855 --> 00:35:10.605 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They don't
know what the ego is.

00:35:10.605 --> 00:35:11.045 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:35:11.045 --> 00:35:13.045 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They haven't
even defined it properly.

00:35:13.045 --> 00:35:13.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Exactly.

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:13.970 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:15.387 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And to
be preaching this

00:35:15.387 --> 00:35:16.920 align:middle line:90%
is a disservice to humanity.

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:18.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: And it's
dangerous actually

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:21.130 align:middle line:84%
because it represses
the wrong people.

00:35:21.130 --> 00:35:23.940 align:middle line:84%
So what I realized
when I looked back

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:25.920 align:middle line:84%
on the trajectory of my
life and I looked back

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:29.100 align:middle line:84%
at all the people and
the spiritual teachings

00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:31.320 align:middle line:84%
and the classes and
everything I went to,

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:38.190 align:middle line:84%
I realized that the people who
go to these spiritual teachers

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:41.070 align:middle line:84%
are already people
who are of service.

00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:42.990 align:middle line:84%
They are already
sensitive people.

00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:45.480 align:middle line:84%
They're already
being of service.

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:49.143 align:middle line:84%
And they are getting the
message that the ego is bad

00:35:49.143 --> 00:35:50.560 align:middle line:84%
and you have to
do this for Karma.

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:53.710 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, it's
repressing them even more.

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:59.400 align:middle line:84%
But if people are
sharing messages like,

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.650 align:middle line:84%
let's say, the ego is
bad and don't be greedy,

00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:04.110 align:middle line:84%
don't be a narcissist
and so on, the people

00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:06.600 align:middle line:84%
who really are
those things are not

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:08.350 align:middle line:84%
going to the classes
or the lectures.

00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:09.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: So the message
is not landing on the ones

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.325 align:middle line:90%
that it's targeted at.

00:36:14.325 --> 00:36:17.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's actually
reinforcing the ones

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:19.410 align:middle line:84%
that you're speaking of,
the ones who are already

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:22.350 align:middle line:84%
tend to go into more
self-service and narcissism.

00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:23.430 align:middle line:90%
It's like that's OK.

00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:23.850 align:middle line:90%
You go.

00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:24.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:26.850 align:middle line:84%
So what ends up
happening is that we've

00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:30.974 align:middle line:84%
created a world where the
ones who are already repressed

00:36:30.974 --> 00:36:32.016 align:middle line:90%
repress themselves more--

00:36:32.016 --> 00:36:33.099 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Even more, yeah.

00:36:33.099 --> 00:36:35.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: But those
are the voices we need.

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:38.340 align:middle line:84%
We need the empaths
and the kind people

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:41.670 align:middle line:84%
and the service-oriented
people to have big egos

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:43.350 align:middle line:90%
because what does the ego do?

00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:46.450 align:middle line:90%
It magnifies who you are.

00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:49.800 align:middle line:84%
So if you are a narcissist,
you don't want a narcissist

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.240 align:middle line:90%
with a big ego.

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:54.480 align:middle line:84%
But if you have an empath,
you do want an empath

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:57.730 align:middle line:84%
to have a healthy
ego so they can share

00:36:57.730 --> 00:36:58.885 align:middle line:90%
their gifts with the world.

00:36:58.885 --> 00:37:01.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you say
that, right now, we're

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:03.545 align:middle line:84%
having more and more people
incarnate who are empaths?

00:37:03.545 --> 00:37:04.345 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:37:04.345 --> 00:37:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because this is
the trajectory that's going

00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:07.995 align:middle line:90%
to heal the world ultimately?

00:37:07.995 --> 00:37:08.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:10.448 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about that and the work

00:37:10.448 --> 00:37:12.820 align:middle line:84%
that you're bringing
forward in your new book,

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:15.310 align:middle line:84%
and then we can talk about
what is the ultimate goal.

00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:19.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it seems to me the
church of nature and friendship

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:23.495 align:middle line:84%
and laughter is really the
church we want to attend.

00:37:23.495 --> 00:37:24.295 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:37:24.295 --> 00:37:27.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And kindness and,
like you've said, friendship.

00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:29.170 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk
about your new book

00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:32.260 align:middle line:84%
and what you're trying
to impart through it.

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:36.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: So
basically what I would

00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:40.540 align:middle line:84%
like people to know is that
we've all forgotten how to be

00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:42.790 align:middle line:90%
kind and how to be empathic.

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:45.970 align:middle line:84%
We've become very
fear-based, and fear

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:47.530 align:middle line:90%
makes us very divisive.

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
fear makes us divisive

00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:52.910 align:middle line:84%
is fear puts us into
a survival mode,

00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:54.610 align:middle line:84%
and when you're
in survival mode,

00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:57.020 align:middle line:84%
it's every person
for themselves.

00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:59.200 align:middle line:84%
And so it makes
us very divisive.

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And most of our mainstream
systems of any kind,

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:07.210 align:middle line:84%
whether it's an education
system, a medical system,

00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:10.810 align:middle line:84%
mainstream media, and
so on, their messages

00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:12.220 align:middle line:90%
are very fear-based.

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:15.500 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think they're doing
it consciously, maybe they are,

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:17.750 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to give them
the benefit of the doubt.

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:22.220 align:middle line:84%
It could be well-meaning
to take action quickly.

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And so in order to get people
to take action quickly,

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:27.280 align:middle line:84%
we send them very
fear-based messages.

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:30.770 align:middle line:84%
That if you don't do this
now, this will happen to you.

00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:31.570 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:34.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think also in the
age of scientific materialism,

00:38:34.450 --> 00:38:37.850 align:middle line:84%
to be a cynic is to
be a wise person.

00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:40.420 align:middle line:84%
So you're already
going to put yourself

00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:41.984 align:middle line:84%
in the mode of
rejecting anything

00:38:41.984 --> 00:38:43.067 align:middle line:90%
that's outside of the box.

00:38:43.067 --> 00:38:44.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: 100%.

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:46.915 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that
I have a problem with--

00:38:46.915 --> 00:38:47.715 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Me too.

00:38:47.715 --> 00:38:49.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: --is that
anybody who actually

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:52.570 align:middle line:84%
sees through the
fear and who actually

00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:56.770 align:middle line:84%
sees what is driving the
problem in the first place,

00:38:56.770 --> 00:38:58.690 align:middle line:84%
it's actually the fear
of all these things

00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:00.800 align:middle line:84%
that's creating the
problem that they

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.050 align:middle line:90%
think they're trying to solve.

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:04.120 align:middle line:84%
But when you see
through the fear,

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:08.050 align:middle line:84%
you're actually labeled as
delusional or woo-woo or any

00:39:08.050 --> 00:39:09.170 align:middle line:90%
of those things.

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that
even I've dealt with.

00:39:12.410 --> 00:39:13.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:15.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yeah.

00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:17.950 align:middle line:84%
But I would rather
think the way I

00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:22.390 align:middle line:84%
do because I get to live
my life from a space of joy

00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:27.130 align:middle line:84%
than to actually fall into
that fear-based living, which

00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:29.220 align:middle line:84%
is what gave me cancer
in the first place.

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:30.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And so, like you say, from
educational systems down,

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:38.470 align:middle line:84%
it is popular in the
scientific materialist way

00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:41.320 align:middle line:84%
to be critical of everything,
to critique and be critical.

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:44.287 align:middle line:84%
And when you see
any headlines-- it

00:39:44.287 --> 00:39:45.620 align:middle line:90%
doesn't matter what publication.

00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:48.260 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter which service
anywhere around the world.

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:50.590 align:middle line:84%
--it's all going to be of a
critical nature bringing up

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:52.840 align:middle line:90%
the worst in humanity.

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And people confuse that with
being a critical thinker,

00:39:58.150 --> 00:40:00.575 align:middle line:84%
and this couldn't
be more opposite.

00:40:00.575 --> 00:40:01.375 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: 100%.

00:40:01.375 --> 00:40:04.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Could you please
expand on that for us?

00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:08.305 align:middle line:84%
To be critical is not
to be critically aware.

00:40:08.305 --> 00:40:12.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: Yes,
so we have taken

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:16.040 align:middle line:84%
being critical to an extreme
where we have become debunkers.

00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:16.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:18.136 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: And that's
what I have a problem--

00:40:18.136 --> 00:40:19.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It doesn't matter
what side you're on of anything.

00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:22.340 align:middle line:84%
We're all debunkers if
you're buying into what's

00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:23.590 align:middle line:90%
being put before us right now.

00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:24.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Exactly.

00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And we have really
become debunkers,

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:32.380 align:middle line:84%
and what we have forgotten--
so people are so determined

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:36.490 align:middle line:84%
to be right that they've
forgotten to be kind.

00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:37.430 align:middle line:90%
And so when--

00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:38.185 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, boy, yes.

00:40:38.185 --> 00:40:38.985 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yeah.

00:40:38.985 --> 00:40:43.180 align:middle line:84%
And so when you have situations
like whatever has been going on

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:47.461 align:middle line:84%
on this planet for
the last few years,

00:40:47.461 --> 00:40:50.980 align:middle line:84%
what people have forgotten
is that it doesn't matter

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:54.220 align:middle line:84%
what side you're on
and which side is right

00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:56.210 align:middle line:90%
or which side is wrong.

00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:59.180 align:middle line:84%
What actually is
causing the problem

00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:02.480 align:middle line:84%
is how we're dividing
ourselves and how

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:03.655 align:middle line:90%
we're hating each other.

00:41:03.655 --> 00:41:04.613 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, boy, yes.

00:41:04.613 --> 00:41:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: That is at the
root of this whole problem,

00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:09.620 align:middle line:90%
not who is right, who is wrong.

00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:11.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
clouding the field.

00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:14.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:17.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
emotional field which

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:18.950 align:middle line:84%
interfaces with Earth's
emotional field,

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:21.990 align:middle line:84%
the mental plane,
which is all connected.

00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:23.600 align:middle line:84%
We're all connected
with one another

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:28.430 align:middle line:84%
into this horrid cloud of
confusion and separation

00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:29.690 align:middle line:90%
and anxiety and fear.

00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:31.160 align:middle line:90%
That's what's ruling right now.

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:31.325 align:middle line:90%
Period.

00:41:31.325 --> 00:41:33.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: That
is what's ruling.

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:36.420 align:middle line:84%
And when we die, we find
out that we're actually

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:37.220 align:middle line:90%
all connected.

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:38.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
we're all connected.

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:40.310 align:middle line:90%
You found that out the hard way.

00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:41.690 align:middle line:90%
Joyful but hard way.

00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:43.940 align:middle line:84%
I was interviewing an
astrologer yesterday,

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:46.490 align:middle line:84%
and we were talking
about this cloudiness

00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:48.800 align:middle line:84%
in the field and
the nature of it,

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:50.450 align:middle line:90%
the fear-based nature of it.

00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And she was saying that as the
larger Pluto movement happens,

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:57.540 align:middle line:90%
it's moving into Aquarius, OK?

00:41:57.540 --> 00:41:59.460 align:middle line:84%
When it moves into
Aquarius, it's

00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:03.000 align:middle line:84%
a very permeable thought
field and can be easily

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.140 align:middle line:90%
swayed and influenced.

00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:06.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's as though we're
ramping up to that,

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:10.240 align:middle line:84%
and technology is taking
us there even faster.

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:14.490 align:middle line:84%
So now the awareness of
that kind of fluidity

00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:17.100 align:middle line:84%
of the mental
field, I think, it's

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:20.220 align:middle line:84%
upon us now to take
responsibility and start

00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:23.250 align:middle line:84%
feeding it good
nutrients, good thoughts,

00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:26.850 align:middle line:84%
good nutrients, feeding
it emotions that are,

00:42:26.850 --> 00:42:28.930 align:middle line:90%
like you say, kind and helpful.

00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:30.690 align:middle line:84%
So talk about that
a little bit and how

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:34.530 align:middle line:84%
you recommend to people through
your work and your book they

00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:36.960 align:middle line:84%
reestablish healthy
self-esteem and can

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:40.440 align:middle line:84%
start creating a cohesive
field of emotion and thought.

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:42.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: I love that, and
I love the way you think.

00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:46.770 align:middle line:84%
So what I actually feel
is that, right now,

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:51.150 align:middle line:84%
because of materialistic
science and the beliefs

00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:54.030 align:middle line:84%
of the world today is
that we are so focused

00:42:54.030 --> 00:43:01.140 align:middle line:84%
on science and technology and
AI that our souls are actually

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:02.970 align:middle line:90%
hungry, very hungry.

00:43:02.970 --> 00:43:05.700 align:middle line:84%
Our consciousness-- let's
say our consciousness is

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:06.870 align:middle line:90%
deprived and hungry.

00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:09.840 align:middle line:84%
We're feeding our brain
but not our heart.

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:13.960 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening is we have
developed all this technology,

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:18.240 align:middle line:90%
but we are immature.

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:20.430 align:middle line:90%
We're consciously unaware.

00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:24.240 align:middle line:84%
So currently, all this
technology that we've developed

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:27.760 align:middle line:84%
is being used for negative
and not for positive.

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:30.570 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we
have more technology

00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:33.280 align:middle line:84%
that could kill the planet
than could feed the planet.

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:34.155 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:43:34.155 --> 00:43:35.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Why is that?

00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And that in itself
tells us a lot

00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:42.420 align:middle line:84%
about where we are in our
conscious awareness evolution.

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:44.560 align:middle line:90%
We have a long way to go.

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:46.860 align:middle line:84%
So what we really
need to start doing,

00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:49.200 align:middle line:84%
and this is what I
try to do, and this

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:52.170 align:middle line:84%
is what I hope my work
contributes in doing

00:43:52.170 --> 00:43:56.040 align:middle line:84%
and everything I put out,
everything that I put out

00:43:56.040 --> 00:44:00.730 align:middle line:84%
in my name, I want it to
raise conscious awareness.

00:44:00.730 --> 00:44:03.960 align:middle line:84%
Not just raise joy that's
important and kindness and

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:06.660 align:middle line:84%
empathy, but all of
those things even

00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:09.100 align:middle line:90%
they raise conscious awareness.

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And when we come from a
place of kindness and joy,

00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:15.210 align:middle line:84%
and when we teach people
that it's possible,

00:44:15.210 --> 00:44:17.479 align:middle line:84%
and when we teach people
that that's actually

00:44:17.479 --> 00:44:19.812 align:middle line:84%
all that matters when you
die, that's all that matters--

00:44:19.812 --> 00:44:20.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
all that matters,

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:22.935 align:middle line:84%
and that's a choice every
moment of every day.

00:44:22.935 --> 00:44:24.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes, yes.

00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And when that can be seen
as the strength, when

00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:31.260 align:middle line:84%
instead of seeing ruthlessness
as a strength-- you see,

00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:34.080 align:middle line:84%
that's the other problem,
is that we look up

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:35.400 align:middle line:90%
to ruthless people.

00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:38.370 align:middle line:84%
We vote them in to
positions of power.

00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:42.630 align:middle line:84%
We need to vote in people who
are kind, who are empathic.

00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:45.390 align:middle line:84%
So when we start to
see those and when

00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:49.260 align:middle line:84%
we start to redefine what
the word strength means,

00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:50.850 align:middle line:90%
and we redefine it--

00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:54.150 align:middle line:84%
because at the moment, we
see empathy and sensitivity

00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:55.230 align:middle line:90%
as a weakness.

00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:57.960 align:middle line:84%
What if we decided
it was a strength?

00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And that people who were
willing to be vulnerable

00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:05.700 align:middle line:84%
and to show their sensitivity
and we saw them as strong?

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:07.170 align:middle line:90%
That would shift.

00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:08.220 align:middle line:90%
It would soon shift.

00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:11.740 align:middle line:84%
Once we bring all that
into the education system

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:14.190 align:middle line:84%
and we bring it into
mainstream media,

00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:17.670 align:middle line:84%
and that would actually
shift our consciousness.

00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:19.950 align:middle line:84%
When our consciousness
shifts, then

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:23.100 align:middle line:84%
what we build in our
technology will shift.

00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:24.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I
think what you're

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:28.110 align:middle line:84%
telling us is a preview of the
new human and the new Earth.

00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:31.110 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that's the
choice we will ultimately

00:45:31.110 --> 00:45:33.390 align:middle line:90%
end up making collectively.

00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:35.640 align:middle line:84%
But right now, it
looks a little dim.

00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:38.280 align:middle line:84%
But I think that is
where we're going.

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:41.340 align:middle line:84%
But it's such a beautiful
message that you share,

00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:44.520 align:middle line:84%
so people can start taking that
responsibility in a lovely way

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:45.690 align:middle line:90%
upon themselves.

00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:47.788 align:middle line:90%
It's not a burden to be kind.

00:45:47.788 --> 00:45:48.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: No, it's not.

00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:51.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not a burden
to be joyful and caring.

00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:52.330 align:middle line:90%
It's not a burden.

00:45:52.330 --> 00:45:53.130 align:middle line:90%
It's fun.

00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:54.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: It is fun.

00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:56.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot of fun
and connection.

00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:00.840 align:middle line:84%
It's bonding with
people and not needing

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:03.480 align:middle line:84%
to be right to that
extent and knowing

00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:05.480 align:middle line:84%
that everyone has their
different ways of seeing

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:06.280 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:07.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: And you see,
another problem right now

00:46:10.830 --> 00:46:12.405 align:middle line:90%
is what I call algorithms.

00:46:12.405 --> 00:46:13.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:17.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: Because the reason
why people think they are

00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:21.300 align:middle line:84%
so right is because when they
believe something and when

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:24.600 align:middle line:84%
you're researching
it on the internet,

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:26.765 align:middle line:84%
every information
that you're then fed--

00:46:26.765 --> 00:46:28.223 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is going
to support that.

00:46:28.223 --> 00:46:29.765 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: Is going
to support that.

00:46:29.765 --> 00:46:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Whereas one powerful
experience like yours,

00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:36.480 align:middle line:84%
one explosion of
true-knowing from the heart

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:39.700 align:middle line:84%
can change the trajectory,
not only of you but of others

00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:43.050 align:middle line:84%
now in a flash, where
those algorithms have

00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:46.230 align:middle line:84%
to be fed and grown
in a dish, Petri dish,

00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:48.600 align:middle line:84%
in a very unconscious
way to start

00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:50.700 align:middle line:84%
leading people to
outcomes that can't

00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:54.000 align:middle line:90%
compete with the human spirit.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And you're a beautiful
soul, and I'm

00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:57.820 align:middle line:84%
so glad I finally had
a chance to meet you.

00:46:57.820 --> 00:46:58.620 align:middle line:90%
Our time is up.

00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:00.412 align:middle line:84%
If there's one more
final thought you have,

00:47:00.412 --> 00:47:01.300 align:middle line:90%
let's squeeze it in.

00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:04.270 align:middle line:10%
>>MOORJANI: Well, I would
just want people to know that

00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:07.510 align:middle line:10%
the most important
thing is to really--

00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:08.980 align:middle line:10%
it's to love yourself.

00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:10.420 align:middle line:10%
It's to really love yourself.

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:12.880 align:middle line:10%
Find your joy.

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:14.200 align:middle line:10%
Follow your passion.

00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:15.430 align:middle line:10%
Do what makes you happy.

00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:17.470 align:middle line:10%
And if all else
fails, eat chocolate.

00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:18.520 align:middle line:90%
That always works.

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:21.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's my backup.

00:47:21.310 --> 00:47:24.100 align:middle line:84%
At the end of each
day, that's what I do.

00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:25.580 align:middle line:90%

00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:27.100 align:middle line:84%

the New Strong."

It's available now,

00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:36.070 align:middle line:10%
through the journey
of moving through fear

00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:38.800 align:middle line:10%
to love and into
magnificence, actually.

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:40.930 align:middle line:10%
