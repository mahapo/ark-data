[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:27.732 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.732 --> 00:00:29.440 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
I'm very happy to have

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.130 align:middle line:10%
with me today
Daniel Sheehan, whom

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.280 align:middle line:10%
I've been waiting to interview
for at least 15 years.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.020 align:middle line:84%
Daniel is a constitutional
and public interest attorney

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.700 align:middle line:84%
who began his quest for justice
on such high-profile cases

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.210 align:middle line:84%
as the Pentagon Papers,
Watergate, Iran-Contra Scandal,

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.160 align:middle line:90%
and Karen Silkwood case.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.590 align:middle line:84%
A strange fork in
his road, however,

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.150 align:middle line:84%
took him on a path
to the Vatican

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.150 align:middle line:84%
to explore the possibility
of extraterrestrial life

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.970 align:middle line:90%
interfacing with planet Earth.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.440 align:middle line:84%
This is the point at which
I became aware of his work

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.913 align:middle line:90%
in Laughlin, Nevada, early 2001.

00:01:00.913 --> 00:01:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And let's just say
this right up front.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.200 align:middle line:90%
Everybody hold on.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.230 align:middle line:84%
You're going to need
to rewind a lot.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.630 align:middle line:84%
There is no other
human I've met like you

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.400 align:middle line:84%
who has had the
breadth of experience

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.730 align:middle line:84%
and somehow had their fingers
in the pies of so many

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.160 align:middle line:90%
different high-profile things.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.870 align:middle line:90%
It's almost unbelievable.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And you seem to have had
access to very deep levels

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.370 align:middle line:84%
of information and knowledge
throughout the whole thing.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.615 align:middle line:84%
Is it just that you're
incredibly connected?

00:01:27.615 --> 00:01:29.740 align:middle line:84%
Or did it start with some
of those early cases that

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:30.660 align:middle line:90%
gave you entree?

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.900 align:middle line:10%
>>DANIEL SHEEHAN:
Well, it actually

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.620 align:middle line:10%
started with my having been
given this full scholarship

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.010 align:middle line:10%
to Harvard College and
into Harvard Law School

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.290 align:middle line:10%
and coming out of there,
founding the Harvard Civil

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.640 align:middle line:10%
Rights Law Review.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And people contacted the
Harvard Civil Rights Law

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.680 align:middle line:84%
Review asking us to help
them on particular cases.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And what I did is I
struck an agreement

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.740 align:middle line:84%
with the number-one
law firm in the country

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.860 align:middle line:84%
on Wall Street, the
major litigation law

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.330 align:middle line:84%
firm in the world
and got them to agree

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.400 align:middle line:84%
to allow me to spend
half of my time

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.919 align:middle line:84%
doing free public interest
cases as a condition

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.650 align:middle line:84%
for my being
willing to go there.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Because I started the case at
the Harvard Civil Rights Law

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.110 align:middle line:84%
Review that established
the right of journalists

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.320 align:middle line:84%
to protect their
confidential news sources.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.040 align:middle line:84%
So the law firm that
represents NBC News

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.940 align:middle line:90%
recruited me to come there.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And then I got them
to agree that I

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.300 align:middle line:84%
could spend half of my
time doing pro bono cases.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And so people began to come
to me from around the country

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.420 align:middle line:84%
to do these cases with
this high-profile back-up.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's how it
really happened.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so it's
not just fairy dust.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.260 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you're super smart.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.840 align:middle line:84%
You were very strategic
in your thinking.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.380 align:middle line:84%
You always followed really your
heart and your moral standards.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, your ethics is a
really big part of this,

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.956 align:middle line:84%
and it put you in
connection with people

00:02:54.956 --> 00:02:57.080 align:middle line:84%
so that you had knowledge
other people didn't know.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't mind my setting
this thing up, when I first

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.820 align:middle line:84%
talked to you-- the
first time I had

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.200 align:middle line:84%
a private conversation with
you, which was early 2001,

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.760 align:middle line:90%
Bush had just been elected.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.520 align:middle line:90%
I was WTF.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.320 align:middle line:90%
We were talking.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.920 align:middle line:90%
I said, how did this happen?

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And you explained to me the
background of what happened

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.200 align:middle line:84%
and that Gore didn't do what he
had agreed to do at the party.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And you said, Regina,
well, you don't

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.300 align:middle line:90%
think these are free elections.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.340 align:middle line:84%
These things are
determined well in advance.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.070 align:middle line:90%
And that was, what?

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.278 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when you said
that, you said, oh, yeah.

00:03:29.278 --> 00:03:31.750 align:middle line:84%
You said, it doesn't matter
that the democratic part didn't

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:32.150 align:middle line:90%
work out.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.990 align:middle line:84%
He didn't choose Kerry
as his running mate.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.000 align:middle line:84%
But it's OK, because Kerry will
be the Democratic candidate

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.160 align:middle line:90%
for the presidency in 2004.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.120 align:middle line:84%
I said, that's 3 and
1/2 years from now.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.340 align:middle line:90%
You said, watch.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.287 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How-- OK.

00:03:46.287 --> 00:03:48.370 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk at the end of
the show about what might

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.210 align:middle line:90%
be coming up this time around.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.040 align:middle line:84%
But the point is, how
were you aware of how

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.144 align:middle line:90%
that system works alone?

00:03:55.144 --> 00:03:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
go back to your story.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well,
very quickly, right

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.970 align:middle line:84%
after we filed the
federal civil lawsuit

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.940 align:middle line:84%
against the off-the-shelf
enterprise of Lieutenant

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.980 align:middle line:84%
Colonel Oliver North
and the former director

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.440 align:middle line:84%
of covert operations for the
CIA under George HW Bush, when

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.660 align:middle line:84%
I came back to Washington, DC,
because the federal judge down

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.780 align:middle line:84%
in Florida, where
we filed the case,

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.390 align:middle line:84%
I discovered was, in
fact, a former member

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.480 align:middle line:84%
of the board of directors of
Meyer Lansky's national bank

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.260 align:middle line:84%
of Miami, which is where
the mafia was bringing

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.350 align:middle line:84%
the skim off the
casinos into that bank

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.080 align:middle line:84%
to fund covert
operations against Cuba.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.930 align:middle line:90%
And so here we were.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.420 align:middle line:84%
We had this judge who entered
a gag order against us,

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.330 align:middle line:84%
totally prohibiting
us from talking

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.050 align:middle line:84%
to anybody about the fact that
the case had been even filed.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And so I came back
home to Washington,

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.830 align:middle line:84%
and I contacted Russ Hemenway,
a close friend of John Kennedy's

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.710 align:middle line:84%
in the Navy and the head of the
Fund for an Effective Congress.

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.957 align:middle line:84%
And he said, look, I'm going
to call Tip O'Neill right away,

00:05:04.957 --> 00:05:06.790 align:middle line:84%
the Speaker of the House
of Representatives,

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.137 align:middle line:84%
and have you go over and
sit down and meet with him.

00:05:09.137 --> 00:05:10.970 align:middle line:84%
So I went over and sat
down and met with Tip

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.580 align:middle line:90%
right that morning.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And Tip said, well,
look, the Democrats

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.130 align:middle line:84%
are in charge of the
House of Representatives.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.490 align:middle line:84%
If what you're saying here
in the Iran-Contra case

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.250 align:middle line:84%
is true, why, then, these
are impeachable offenses.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.400 align:middle line:84%
These are activities
at the highest levels

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.330 align:middle line:84%
of the Reagan-Bush
administration in open defiance

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.680 align:middle line:84%
of the Boland Amendment that was
passed by Congress prohibiting

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.640 align:middle line:84%
them from giving
any military aid,

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.010 align:middle line:84%
direct or indirect,
to these contras

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.590 align:middle line:84%
down in Central America,
who have been determined

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.500 align:middle line:84%
by the International Court
in the Hague of being

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.400 align:middle line:84%
international war
criminals for mining

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.310 align:middle line:84%
the international harbors
down in Nicaragua.

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And so I told Tip
O'Neill about that.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, the Democrats
aren't in control of the Senate

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:56.410 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:57.951 align:middle line:84%
The Republicans are
still in control.

00:05:57.951 --> 00:06:02.520 align:middle line:84%
This is June 1, 1986,
this meeting took place.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.330 align:middle line:84%
So I said, I'm going to send
you over to the Senate side

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.200 align:middle line:84%
to talk with
Claiborne Pell, who's

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.390 align:middle line:84%
the ranking Democrat on the
Senate Foreign Relations

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:11.190 align:middle line:90%
Committee.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:14.560 align:middle line:84%
You get an agreement from
him that if the Democrats win

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.920 align:middle line:84%
the Senate back in November of
'86 here, nine months later,

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.630 align:middle line:84%
he said, that you
get him to agree

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.810 align:middle line:84%
that they'll set up a special
select committee to investigate

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:25.760 align:middle line:90%
your charges.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And then we can bring
impeachment actions

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.302 align:middle line:84%
against HW Bush and Bill
Casey and the others.

00:06:31.302 --> 00:06:33.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: William
Casey, head of the CIA.

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.301 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: The head of the CIA.

00:06:34.301 --> 00:06:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And so he said, but Claiborne
Pell is going to ask you,

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.060 align:middle line:84%
who do you think should head
up that Senate committee?

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.530 align:middle line:90%
You tell him John Kerry.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.020 align:middle line:90%
Because he loves John Kerry.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.060 align:middle line:84%
We kid him that John Kerry
must be his illegitimate son.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.170 align:middle line:84%
He says he thinks John Kerry is
going to be president someday.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, that's funny,
because so does John Kerry.

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.410 align:middle line:90%
And he laughed.

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:56.220 align:middle line:90%
So we did that.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.880 align:middle line:84%
So I went over and met
with Claiborne Pell.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And Claiborne Pell agreed to
set up the select committee

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:03.860 align:middle line:84%
and to have John
Kerry head it up.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.774 align:middle line:84%
And so I ended up bringing all
this information to John Kerry

00:07:07.774 --> 00:07:09.190 align:middle line:84%
and giving him all
the information

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.980 align:middle line:84%
about the Iran-Contra,
smuggling of weapons,

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.620 align:middle line:84%
the cocaine smuggling,
and everything.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And he, when the Democrats
won the Senate back

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:23.274 align:middle line:84%
in November of 1986, he
came on and was appointed

00:07:23.274 --> 00:07:25.690 align:middle line:84%
to be the head of the Senate
Select Committee on Narcotics

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:26.830 align:middle line:90%
and Terrorism.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And so I kept delivering all
of this information to him,

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:34.030 align:middle line:84%
when suddenly Russ
Hemenway calls me

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:36.760 align:middle line:84%
two years into this
event and says,

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.840 align:middle line:84%
I was in a meeting
with John Kerry,

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:44.700 align:middle line:84%
and Don Regan came
into the meeting

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.190 align:middle line:84%
and told him that
the Republican Party

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:50.950 align:middle line:84%
leadership had just contacted
the Democratic Party leadership

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:54.670 align:middle line:84%
and wanted Kerry to drop this
investigation about the drug

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:58.470 align:middle line:84%
smuggling and the terrorism
activities of these people.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And if you will agree to step
back from this investigation,

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.370 align:middle line:84%
you will be made the vice
presidential candidate to run

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:09.089 align:middle line:90%
with Al Gore when Al Gore--

00:08:09.089 --> 00:08:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, you had a
big heads up years prior.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:14.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: When Al Gore runs
for the presidency, right?

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.514 align:middle line:90%
And now this is in 1991.

00:08:16.514 --> 00:08:17.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:18.800 align:middle line:84%
See, I didn't know
this part, how this

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:19.966 align:middle line:90%
happened, how you knew that.

00:08:19.966 --> 00:08:21.750 align:middle line:84%
I've been waiting to
ask you how you knew.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:24.083 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Because they knew
that Bill Clinton was going

00:08:24.083 --> 00:08:26.437 align:middle line:84%
to be the nominee in
1992, and Al Gore was

00:08:26.437 --> 00:08:28.270 align:middle line:84%
going to be his vice
presidential candidate.

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:30.930 align:middle line:84%
Because Bill
Clinton-- we had gone

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:34.110 align:middle line:84%
to meet with Bill
Clinton back in 1990

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:37.730 align:middle line:84%
because we discovered the
smuggling of the weapons

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:39.970 align:middle line:90%
and drugs out of Mena, Arkansas.

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:41.880 align:middle line:90%
And we went to see him.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.690 align:middle line:84%
Our people sat down
with him directly when

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:46.610 align:middle line:90%
he was the governor of Arkansas.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:49.050 align:middle line:84%
Ross Perot set the
whole thing up.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And you remember Ross Perot is
the one that stopped George HW

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:56.470 align:middle line:84%
Bush from getting a second
term by running and taking

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:57.700 align:middle line:90%
19% of the vote.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:01.550 align:middle line:84%
So I was involved with all
of those people back in 1991.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:03.770 align:middle line:84%
So everybody knew
what the scenario

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:06.530 align:middle line:84%
was that was laid out as to
how this thing was going to go,

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:10.310 align:middle line:84%
because they had anticipated
that George HW Bush was going

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:14.970 align:middle line:84%
to be running for another term
so that they ended up waiting

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.690 align:middle line:84%
and then ran Bill
Clinton against him.

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And so I knew all
of those people

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:22.150 align:middle line:84%
and all of the involvement
that was going on.

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:23.640 align:middle line:90%
So I knew way ahead of time.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.310 align:middle line:84%
So when you ask me
how did I know--

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:26.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You just
happen to know.

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: How did I know that
John Kerry-- I said, well,

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:29.160 align:middle line:90%
funny you should ask.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.500 align:middle line:90%
And so I told you.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now, there
was another element

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:33.660 align:middle line:90%
of this that struck me.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.200 align:middle line:84%
I started paying
attention, thinking

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.700 align:middle line:84%
how does the media--
if it's already

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:40.190 align:middle line:84%
been decided, how does the
media play into it and spin it?

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:42.400 align:middle line:90%
And I noticed-- it struck me.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.640 align:middle line:90%
I've never forgotten.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:48.920 align:middle line:84%
Early on I saw an article on
who the frontrunners were.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:52.010 align:middle line:84%
This was quite far out
from the election still.

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And it had lovely graphics,
and it showed Kerry

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.769 align:middle line:84%
up front, chest out,
big jaw, frontrunner.

00:09:57.769 --> 00:09:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, how
do they know this?

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:01.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, no one really
knows much about this guy.

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:01.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Yeah, there
were no polls in yet.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There were
no polls or anything.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And then it showed
at the very back--

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.030 align:middle line:84%
and this is going
to take us back

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:10.090 align:middle line:84%
where we're going-- little tiny
blue mouse, Dennis Kucinich.

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:12.070 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, oh, my God.

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:13.260 align:middle line:90%
This is how you spin it.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And so the people
are being programmed

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.880 align:middle line:90%
but think there's choice in it.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:17.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Oh, yeah.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:18.810 align:middle line:90%
No, that's all true.

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:19.851 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's brilliant.

00:10:19.851 --> 00:10:22.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's dastardly but
brilliant how we're managed.

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:23.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yeah.

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:26.100 align:middle line:84%
What it is is that--
and I discovered this

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:31.380 align:middle line:84%
because my father was the
first Sheehan man in our family

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.610 align:middle line:84%
ever to graduate
from high school.

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up getting
a full-boat scholarship

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:39.220 align:middle line:84%
to Harvard College then to
Harvard Law School and stuff.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:43.140 align:middle line:84%
So I always said, look,
I've got nothing to lose.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:44.880 align:middle line:84%
I've come from absolutely
nowhere to have

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.080 align:middle line:90%
these kind of credentials.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.480 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to stick with
it to do the right things all

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.350 align:middle line:90%
the time.

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
I continue to do.

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:58.002 align:middle line:84%
And so-- but I was being invited
in to this club, you know,

00:10:58.002 --> 00:11:00.210 align:middle line:84%
OK, you're out of Harvard
College, Harvard Law School

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:01.010 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:02.320 align:middle line:90%
You're invited into the club.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.020 align:middle line:84%
You just have to
do certain things.

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And you become a member of
the Annisquam Yacht Club.

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:11.010 align:middle line:84%
You marry one of the daughters
of one of the senior partners.

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And you could see this
unfolding out in front of you,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.720 align:middle line:90%
or I could, anyway.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.384 align:middle line:84%
And so what I did is I just
declined to do it, politely.

00:11:18.384 --> 00:11:19.550 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't fighting with them.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:21.360 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't doing anything.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And so what I did is I could
meet the members of the club.

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:25.660 align:middle line:90%
And they--

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:27.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Without really
having to join it, in a sense.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.131 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Yeah, without
having to join it.

00:11:29.131 --> 00:11:30.770 align:middle line:84%
They just assumed
that I was going

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:33.060 align:middle line:84%
to be willing to
participate in this

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.720 align:middle line:84%
because I should be in awe
of all of these people.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.940 align:middle line:84%
Because here I was, a brand
new member of this club.

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And all I did is I just
declined to do those things.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.674 align:middle line:84%
I declined to go in
meet the daughter

00:11:44.674 --> 00:11:46.340 align:middle line:84%
of the senior partner
when I was invited

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:49.020 align:middle line:90%
to go to her coming out.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:51.204 align:middle line:84%
And I just declined
to do those things.

00:11:51.204 --> 00:11:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't
quite figure out

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.780 align:middle line:84%
why I was declining
to do these things,

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.060 align:middle line:84%
because I seem
smarter than that.

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.410 align:middle line:90%
But I just didn't do that.

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:00.454 align:middle line:84%
And so I got to meet all
these people firsthand.

00:12:00.454 --> 00:12:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
know Tip O'Neill.

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:02.690 align:middle line:90%
I could call Russ Hemenway.

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:04.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, you're
incredibly well-connected,

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:05.940 align:middle line:90%
more than anybody I've ever met.

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Yeah, but it
was just surprising to me,

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:14.126 align:middle line:84%
but I figured this was
perfectly OK, that this

00:12:14.126 --> 00:12:15.500 align:middle line:84%
is the way it was
supposed to be,

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.590 align:middle line:84%
and all I had to do is stay
on the straight and narrow

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:21.880 align:middle line:84%
and do the right things
all the time, which I did,

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.320 align:middle line:84%
never compromised
what I was doing,

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.320 align:middle line:84%
and to maintain
respectfulness toward them

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.989 align:middle line:90%
and not insult them.

00:12:28.989 --> 00:12:30.030 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happened.

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:32.670 align:middle line:84%
So that's how that's how I can
pick up the telephone, call

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Russ Hemenway, who's
the head of, as I said,

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:38.190 align:middle line:84%
the Committee for an
Effective Congress,

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:40.220 align:middle line:84%
who raises-- he used
to laugh about this.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:43.370 align:middle line:84%
He raised all the money for
the congressional candidates

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:46.780 align:middle line:84%
that were liberals, whether they
were Republicans or Democrats.

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:48.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHING] I love it.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.110 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now we have to get to--
I just have to set this up

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:53.090 align:middle line:90%
for our audience watching.

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:55.150 align:middle line:90%
These are really smart people.

00:12:55.150 --> 00:13:00.720 align:middle line:84%
Your experience is so vast, and
the web is so vast and tangled,

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.341 align:middle line:90%
that you need to pay attention.

00:13:02.341 --> 00:13:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, you're going
to have to rewind a bit.

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:09.690 align:middle line:84%
Because when I
listen to you, I'm

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:13.490 align:middle line:84%
awestruck at the strangeness
of the bedfellows

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:16.140 align:middle line:84%
and the confluence of
events and stories,

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.860 align:middle line:84%
where how did that
person historically

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:20.570 align:middle line:90%
have anything to do with that?

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:21.370 align:middle line:90%
And yet they do.

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:23.160 align:middle line:90%
And you know all the parts.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.820 align:middle line:84%
You've been part of the
moving parts of the stories.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:29.240 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just letting
everyone know in advance.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.760 align:middle line:84%
It might seem like we're
going tangential at times

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.350 align:middle line:90%
because we are.

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:34.230 align:middle line:90%
We will be.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Because everything connects
to everything else.

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:38.955 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want to start directing
it toward this topic,

00:13:38.955 --> 00:13:41.330 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to have
another two-hour conversation

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:42.760 align:middle line:90%
later.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:45.970 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back now to disclosure,
which our audience is intrigued

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:47.390 align:middle line:90%
with, the whole thing.

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And I originally met
you through Steven Greer

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.710 align:middle line:84%
and was at disclosure, as
you were, in Washington, DC.

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:54.550 align:middle line:84%
Dennis Kucinich
was part of that,

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:56.950 align:middle line:84%
as he had his ban on
space-based weapons

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:58.890 align:middle line:84%
he was trying to get
through at the time.

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:01.050 align:middle line:90%
So let's back it up a bit.

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:04.980 align:middle line:84%
How did you initially become
invited, as I said in the open,

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.750 align:middle line:90%
into that field, that story?

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:12.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: It started
out in late 1976.

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:18.380 align:middle line:84%
In 1976, remember that Jimmy
Carter was elected president

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:21.130 align:middle line:90%
on November 4 of 1976.

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And one of the first things
he did, as the newly elected

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:28.070 align:middle line:84%
president, he contacted the
head of the Central Intelligence

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:32.510 align:middle line:84%
Agency and asked that person
to come in and provide to him

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:35.240 align:middle line:84%
all the information
that the CIA had

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.000 align:middle line:84%
about extraterrestrial
intelligence and the UFO

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:38.880 align:middle line:90%
phenomenon.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.970 align:middle line:84%
Because as you know,
President Carter,

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:43.999 align:middle line:84%
when he was governor of Georgia,
had seen a UFO, not just

00:14:43.999 --> 00:14:45.540 align:middle line:84%
one these far-away
lights in the sky,

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:48.860 align:middle line:84%
but a UFO, which he was
convinced what it was.

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:50.350 align:middle line:90%
So he called that person in.

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:53.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, that person
was George HW Bush.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:57.490 align:middle line:84%
He had been selected by Jerry
Ford when Jerry Ford came in

00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:59.190 align:middle line:90%
after Nixon resigned.

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And Jerry Ford
selected George HW Bush

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:05.940 align:middle line:84%
to be the head of the
Central Intelligence Agency.

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:08.760 align:middle line:84%
But in that meeting with
President-Elect Carter

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:16.790 align:middle line:84%
in late November of
1976, George HW Bush

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:19.970 align:middle line:84%
said to him, oh, OK,
you're the president-elect.

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:23.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, before I agree to
give you this information

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:26.726 align:middle line:84%
about the extraterrestrial and
UFO information that we have,

00:15:26.726 --> 00:15:30.020 align:middle line:84%
you have to agree to leave me
on as the head of the Central

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:32.550 align:middle line:90%
Intelligence Agency for you.

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:36.700 align:middle line:84%
I want to become like John Edgar
Hoover was for the FBI, stayed

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:39.420 align:middle line:84%
there one administration
after another,

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:41.902 align:middle line:84%
and I will agree never
to run for public office.

00:15:41.902 --> 00:15:44.360 align:middle line:84%
I'll just stay here as the head
of the Central Intelligence

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.230 align:middle line:90%
Agency.

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:49.180 align:middle line:84%
And Jimmy Carter said, no,
I have someone else in mind

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:52.190 align:middle line:84%
that I want to bring on is
the head of the CIA, who

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:54.570 align:middle line:90%
happened to be Teddy Sorensen.

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And so George HW Bush refused
to give him the information.

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And he said, in order for
you to get this information,

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:05.750 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have to
go to the House Science

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:09.790 align:middle line:84%
and Technology Committee, have
them contact the Congressional

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:14.200 align:middle line:84%
Research Service, and have
them request declassification

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.334 align:middle line:90%
for these documents.

00:16:15.334 --> 00:16:17.000 align:middle line:84%
Because the only
people that are allowed

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.740 align:middle line:84%
to see them at the present time
are those with a need to know,

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:23.050 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have
any need to know this.

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, is
it urban legend

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:26.990 align:middle line:84%
that he came out of that
meeting very distressed?

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And I know in the
UFO circles it said

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:32.200 align:middle line:84%
he came out in tears he was
so distressed at the scenario.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: No.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.960 align:middle line:84%
He was upset, according to the
people who talked with him,

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:43.740 align:middle line:84%
and was aware of the fact that
there was a power elite that he

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:46.010 align:middle line:90%
hadn't been aware of.

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:48.110 align:middle line:84%
But he went ahead
and he contacted

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:51.910 align:middle line:84%
the Democratic head of the
House Science and Technology

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:54.780 align:middle line:84%
Committee, got them to contact
the Congressional Research

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:57.680 align:middle line:84%
Service, and they
assigned the task

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.600 align:middle line:84%
to the science and technology
division, the head of which

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.440 align:middle line:90%
was Marshall Smith at the time.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:08.710 align:middle line:84%
So in late November, I'm
sitting having lunch,

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:11.550 align:middle line:84%
actually, with
Rosemary Chalk, who

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:13.420 align:middle line:84%
is the executive
secretary of the National

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:16.829 align:middle line:84%
Academy of Science,
who happened to be

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:20.160 align:middle line:84%
a member of the same
church that I went to

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.819 align:middle line:84%
that Dan Berrigan used
to be the priest for.

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And I represented Dan
Berrigan and Phil Berrigan

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.780 align:middle line:84%
and Liz McAllister
and the others

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:30.070 align:middle line:90%
in lots of cases earlier.

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And so Rosemary Chalk
and I were having lunch.

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And she said, this is
amazing that you've

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.080 align:middle line:84%
done all these cases,
the Pentagon Papers

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:41.260 align:middle line:84%
case, the Watergate burglary
case, the right of a journalist

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.060 align:middle line:84%
to protect their
confidential news sources.

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:45.190 align:middle line:84%
You must have always
wanted to be a lawyer.

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:46.840 align:middle line:90%
You're just a natural lawyer.

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:48.200 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, actually, no.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.974 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to originally
be an astronaut.

00:17:50.974 --> 00:17:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And I was going to go
to the Air Force Academy

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:55.840 align:middle line:90%
and become an astronaut.

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.540 align:middle line:84%
I was the number one candidate
in the state of New York,

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:01.580 align:middle line:84%
but the senator, Jacob Javits,
that I had the meeting with,

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.310 align:middle line:84%
gave the appointment
to the son of one

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:04.590 align:middle line:90%
of his major contributors.

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:07.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But tell us why, I
mean, that's the critical part.

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.040 align:middle line:84%
The key to that is
when he asked you why

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.940 align:middle line:90%
you wanted to be an astronaut.

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:11.780 align:middle line:90%
I love this part.

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:14.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: He said, Dan, why
do you want to be an astronaut?

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:17.160 align:middle line:84%
I said, because I want
to go into outer space.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.760 align:middle line:84%
This is an extraordinary
period in our human family,

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.640 align:middle line:84%
and I want to be able
to go into outer space

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:24.020 align:middle line:84%
to get to actually
meet the other people

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.140 align:middle line:84%
from extraterrestrial
civilizations.

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me and
he said, you actually

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.950 align:middle line:84%
believe that there's
other civilizations,

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:32.670 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial civilizations?

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And I laughed and
I said, well, sure.

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:35.750 align:middle line:90%
So do you.

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:37.041 align:middle line:90%
You're a United States senator.

00:18:37.041 --> 00:18:38.290 align:middle line:90%
You know better than that.

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:39.520 align:middle line:90%
And he was floored.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.119 align:middle line:84%
He just looked at me and
was astonished by this.

00:18:42.119 --> 00:18:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's what caused
him to admit to me--

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:45.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's why he
said the job was already filled.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: That's why he
admitted to me-- he said, I

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.260 align:middle line:84%
wasn't supposed to do this,
and I shouldn't tell you this,

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.650 align:middle line:84%
but I've already given the
appointment to someone else,

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:52.825 align:middle line:90%
the son of this man.

00:18:52.825 --> 00:18:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And so he said, but you go back
to your congressional district,

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:57.170 align:middle line:84%
and you'll get the congressional
appointment instead

00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:58.646 align:middle line:90%
of the senatorial appointment.

00:18:58.646 --> 00:19:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And I went back,
and it turns out

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:04.020 align:middle line:84%
that the Carleton King
gave the appointment--

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Who's Carleton King?

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:06.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Carleton
King was our congressman

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:09.330 align:middle line:84%
from the 41st congressional
district in New York state.

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And he had given his
appointment already

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:18.390 align:middle line:84%
to the son of the Republican
mayor of Glens Falls, New York.

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And so I didn't have
the appointment.

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:22.320 align:middle line:84%
So I decided I needed
to become a lawyer.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:26.260 align:middle line:84%
I said, I need to become
a lawyer because things

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:27.376 align:middle line:90%
are out of tune here.

00:19:27.376 --> 00:19:28.750 align:middle line:84%
Things are not
being done the way

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:30.020 align:middle line:90%
they're supposed to be done.

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:32.040 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
become a lawyer, and I

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.100 align:middle line:84%
will work to help get the
government functioning

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.240 align:middle line:90%
the way it's supposed to.

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll go back to
becoming an astronaut.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.110 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out that
rather than things

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:41.690 align:middle line:84%
being a little
bit out of tune, I

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:43.390 align:middle line:84%
discovered that
they were playing

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:46.740 align:middle line:90%
an entirely different song.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:50.866 align:middle line:84%
than we had been told in high
school civics and in college.

00:19:50.866 --> 00:19:51.990 align:middle line:90%
It's just a different song.

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:53.656 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole
different thing going on

00:19:53.656 --> 00:19:55.120 align:middle line:90%
than we are taught to believe.

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.773 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, which was
going against your ethics

00:19:56.773 --> 00:19:57.500 align:middle line:90%
for the most part.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.583 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: So the bottom
line is it brings me back

00:19:59.583 --> 00:20:00.990 align:middle line:90%
to the talk with Rosemary Chalk.

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And Rosemary Chalk said, well,
that's really interesting.

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.982 align:middle line:84%
One of my best
friends, Marcia Smith,

00:20:06.982 --> 00:20:08.690 align:middle line:84%
is the head of the
science and technology

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:11.190 align:middle line:84%
division of the Congressional
Research Service.

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:12.920 align:middle line:84%
She's just been
tasked with doing

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.970 align:middle line:84%
this investigation of the
extraterrestrial intelligence

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:18.930 align:middle line:90%
and UFOs.

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:21.440 align:middle line:84%
Would you mind if I
have her call you?

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, no,
have her do it.

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:25.060 align:middle line:84%
So she called me,
and we had lunch.

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And she asked me if I,
as the chief counsel

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:29.960 align:middle line:84%
for the Jesuit national
headquarters, which I was

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:33.215 align:middle line:90%
at that time-- this was 1976.

00:20:33.215 --> 00:20:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And she said, would
you contact the Vatican

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:38.920 align:middle line:84%
and see if you can get access
to the classified portions

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:41.030 align:middle line:84%
of the Vatican
library that might

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:43.130 align:middle line:84%
have a stuff about
extraterrestrial intelligence

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:44.160 align:middle line:90%
and UFOs?

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.500 align:middle line:90%
So I said, sure.

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.250 align:middle line:90%
Let me check with my superiors.

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:49.450 align:middle line:84%
I was a candidate
for the Jesuit order

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:51.620 align:middle line:84%
of the Catholic
priesthood at that time.

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:53.690 align:middle line:84%
So I checked with
Father Bill Davis,

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:55.790 align:middle line:84%
and they checked
with Terry Shea,

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:57.870 align:middle line:90%
the head of the conference.

00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And they said, yes,
you can do that.

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.930 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote a letter
to the Jesuit

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:05.610 align:middle line:84%
who's the head of the Vatican
library, and he said no.

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:07.140 align:middle line:90%
And I was kind of surprised.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.765 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote a second
letter back to him.

00:21:08.765 --> 00:21:11.230 align:middle line:84%
I said, I don't think you
quite understand what we are

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:13.980 align:middle line:84%
and what we're trying to
get, and President Carter

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:15.460 align:middle line:90%
wants to have this information.

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:17.180 align:middle line:90%
And he said no again.

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:20.280 align:middle line:84%
So I had to tell Marsha
that that was true.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:24.847 align:middle line:84%
And so then I became a general
counsel for the investigation.

00:21:24.847 --> 00:21:25.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Now, wait.

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.340 align:middle line:90%
How old were you by this time?

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:28.795 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: 1976 I was 31.

00:21:28.795 --> 00:21:30.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I just want
to put that down.

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:30.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: 31 years old.

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're a young man.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And so I became
general counsel for them

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:39.620 align:middle line:84%
and was asked to deliver
a closed-door seminar

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:42.224 align:middle line:84%
to the top 50 scientists
in SETI, which

00:21:42.224 --> 00:21:43.640 align:middle line:84%
is the Search for
Extraterrestrial

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence out of
the jet propulsion

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.570 align:middle line:90%
laboratory in Pasadena.

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And so I said,
well, look, if I'm

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:53.000 align:middle line:84%
going to help prepare this
closed-door session for them

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.580 align:middle line:84%
on the theological
implications of contact

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:58.650 align:middle line:84%
with an extraterrestrial
civilization,

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:02.250 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to get access to
some classified materials.

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:05.890 align:middle line:84%
So would you get me access
to the classified portions

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:07.525 align:middle line:90%
of Project Blue Book?

00:22:07.525 --> 00:22:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And she said,
well, I don't think

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:12.720 align:middle line:84%
they'll ever give us that,
but there's no harm in asking.

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.330 align:middle line:84%
So she told them
who I was and that I

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:16.650 align:middle line:90%
wanted to have access to this.

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold,
I was given access

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:20.700 align:middle line:90%
to the classified portions of--

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which almost
nobody on the planet

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.110 align:middle line:90%
was ever given, right?

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:23.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: No, no.

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:24.935 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was it
redacted at that point?

00:22:24.935 --> 00:22:25.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: No.

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.510 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:26.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my God.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.080 align:middle line:90%
You saw the whole thing.

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.789 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: They gave
me the entire thing.

00:22:28.789 --> 00:22:30.246 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Explain
to audience also,

00:22:30.246 --> 00:22:32.750 align:middle line:84%
before you finish this, what
Project Blue Book was so they

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:33.791 align:middle line:90%
get the importance of it.

00:22:33.791 --> 00:22:36.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Project Blue Book was
the progeny of what originally

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:39.320 align:middle line:90%
started out as Project Grudge.

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And it was a classified study
on the part of the United States

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Air Force of the
phenomenon of UFOs.

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that they lied
right from the very beginning.

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:52.510 align:middle line:84%
We've now seen the
internal documents

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:58.450 align:middle line:84%
that show that they lied, that
Richard Dolan's book, these two

00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:01.580 align:middle line:84%
volumes of "UFOs and the
National Security State,"

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:05.270 align:middle line:84%
now has secured those
classified documents

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:07.280 align:middle line:84%
of the internal
communications where

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.500 align:middle line:84%
they were lying in
telling everybody

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:12.200 align:middle line:84%
that, oh, 95% of
all the cases can

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.640 align:middle line:84%
be solved because they're
swamp gas or Venus

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:15.980 align:middle line:90%
or this other stuff.

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:17.230 align:middle line:90%
Most of those were lies.

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:21.190 align:middle line:84%
But there was another portion
of them, like some 9% of them,

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:23.591 align:middle line:84%
that, in fact, they,
quote, "couldn't explain."

00:23:23.591 --> 00:23:25.340 align:middle line:84%
That was because it
was completely obvious

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:26.860 align:middle line:90%
that these were UFOs.

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And so they assign them
to a classified section.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.170 align:middle line:90%
So I got to see these things.

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And so I looked
through these things,

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:37.310 align:middle line:84%
and I actually obtained enough
information about these things

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:39.240 align:middle line:90%
to convince me that it was true.

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And so I went back to the Jesuit
headquarters and met with them

00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:45.850 align:middle line:84%
and asked them if
they would authorize

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:49.390 align:middle line:84%
me to try to get the
Washington Interreligious Staff

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:52.280 align:middle line:84%
Council, which is the
directors of the Washington,

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:56.240 align:middle line:84%
DC, offices of all 54 of the
major religious denominations

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.230 align:middle line:84%
in the United States, to
agree to set up a special task

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:02.900 align:middle line:84%
force to investigate the
philosophical and theological

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:07.190 align:middle line:84%
implications of contact with an
extraterrestrial civilization,

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:09.690 align:middle line:84%
which they wouldn't
do at the time.

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:10.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Surprise.

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:13.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And so I got to go
deliver the closed-door session

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:16.330 align:middle line:90%
to the SETI people.

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And that was all that
happened for a long-- that

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:23.140 align:middle line:90%
was 1977, '76 and '77.

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And it was later in 1994
that I was contacted

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:30.775 align:middle line:84%
by Dr. John Mack, who was
the head of the department

00:24:30.775 --> 00:24:33.940 align:middle line:84%
of clinical psychiatry at
Harvard Medical School, who

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:37.710 align:middle line:84%
had been asked to do
psychological work-ups

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:41.880 align:middle line:84%
for high-level military
officials that had filed

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.470 align:middle line:90%
reports of contact with UFOs.

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And they were given
a psychiatric test

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:50.594 align:middle line:84%
to confirm that they were OK,
actually hoping that they could

00:24:50.594 --> 00:24:51.885 align:middle line:90%
prove they were nuts, probably.

00:24:51.885 --> 00:24:52.685 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:24:52.685 --> 00:24:55.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: But anyway, and
John Mack, after half a dozen

00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:59.080 align:middle line:84%
of these, began to reach
out to other people

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:01.690 align:middle line:84%
to actually interview them,
who had had these contact

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:02.490 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:04.531 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Had Bud Hopkins
originally come to you?

00:25:04.531 --> 00:25:08.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Bud Hopkins started
delivering people to John.

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And so John was doing these
psychological work-ups on all

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:15.590 align:middle line:84%
these people and became
convinced that, number one,

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:18.350 align:middle line:84%
they were absolutely sincere
and convinced that this

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:19.990 align:middle line:90%
had happened to them.

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:22.429 align:middle line:84%
And he began to suspect
that it was true.

00:25:22.429 --> 00:25:23.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In "Password
to the Cosmos"

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:25.720 align:middle line:84%
he talked about
the common traits

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.320 align:middle line:84%
that each of these
people experienced.

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Oh, not
only that-- John didn't

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:33.300 align:middle line:84%
talk about it in the book-- but
since I became his lawyer, John

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:35.430 align:middle line:84%
told me that what
he would do is he

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:37.680 align:middle line:84%
would never hypnotize
people, so there was never

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.410 align:middle line:84%
any kind of posthypnotic
suggestion or anything to them.

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:43.212 align:middle line:84%
He would do Stanislav Grof's
holotropic breathing, right?

00:25:43.212 --> 00:25:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And they would get
very relaxed, and they

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.360 align:middle line:84%
would start telling him about
what their experience was.

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And he would say, OK, now
you're in this vehicle.

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:53.210 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to turn
to the right and look

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:55.804 align:middle line:84%
at some of the equipment
that's there and the dials

00:25:55.804 --> 00:25:56.970 align:middle line:90%
and thing, whatever you see.

00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:58.227 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what you see.

00:25:58.227 --> 00:25:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
describe something

00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:03.100 align:middle line:84%
that was completely
aside from the narrative

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:04.670 align:middle line:90%
that one would normally tell.

00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:06.280 align:middle line:90%
And that's how John did it.

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.260 align:middle line:84%
John was getting them
to identify things

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:11.870 align:middle line:84%
that no one would have been
able to make up, and he found--

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:12.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he was
getting cross references.

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: He was
getting cross references.

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:14.770 align:middle line:84%
They were the same
kind of things.

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:15.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:15.780 align:middle line:90%
OK, I didn't know that part.

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:17.446 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Oh. that
was how it happened.

00:26:17.446 --> 00:26:19.890 align:middle line:84%
So John contacts me
and asks me if I'll

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:24.760 align:middle line:84%
be his attorney, because he
wrote an article for the "New

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:28.720 align:middle line:84%
England Journal of Medicine"
about this strange phenomenon,

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.520 align:middle line:84%
this psychological
phenomenon of all

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.760 align:middle line:84%
these high-level military
officials and FAA

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:37.030 align:middle line:84%
investigators, Federal Aviation
Administration investigators,

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:39.090 align:middle line:84%
that were saying that
they had verified

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:42.450 align:middle line:90%
that they were these UFOs.

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:44.840 align:middle line:84%
So he wrote the
article, submitted it

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.720 align:middle line:84%
to the "New England
Journal of Medicine,"

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.810 align:middle line:90%
and they refused to publish it.

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:51.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, John was a Pulitzer
Prize winning author--

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:53.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Head of
clinical psychology, yes.

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Head of the Harvard
Clinical Psychiatry Department.

00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:59.770 align:middle line:90%
And so they refused to print it.

00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:01.220 align:middle line:90%
So he said, what's the matter?

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:02.511 align:middle line:90%
Are there not enough footnotes?

00:27:02.511 --> 00:27:03.790 align:middle line:90%
Do you need more details?

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:06.760 align:middle line:84%
So he rewrote the whole
article and sent it to them.

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out
within two days,

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:15.520 align:middle line:84%
the assistant to the CEO and
publisher of the "New England

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:18.610 align:middle line:84%
Journal of Medicine"
came back to his office

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:21.900 align:middle line:84%
with the envelope
unopened and said,

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.430 align:middle line:90%
we're not going to publish this.

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:25.340 align:middle line:84%
No matter what it is that
you're saying in the article,

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:26.700 align:middle line:90%
we're not going to publish it.

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And John got upset, and
he contacted a publisher

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:33.250 align:middle line:84%
and published it as a
book, which was really

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:35.400 align:middle line:84%
called "Abductions,
Human Contact

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:36.790 align:middle line:90%
with Extraterrestrials."

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And immediately the dean of
the Harvard Medical School

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:44.220 align:middle line:84%
came in and said, look, I'd
like to have you come and talk

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:46.800 align:middle line:84%
with some of the members
of the faculty about this.

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:48.560 align:middle line:90%
And John said, this is terrific.

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.190 align:middle line:84%
So he agreed to go
to this meeting.

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:50.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Gee, yikes.

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:50.770 align:middle line:90%
What a trap.

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:52.478 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And when
he arrived, here they

00:27:52.478 --> 00:27:56.780 align:middle line:84%
are, arrayed up on this
dais with the legal counsel

00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:59.330 align:middle line:84%
from Harvard University,
the dean of the school,

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:00.940 align:middle line:84%
and other faculty
members, and they

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:03.480 align:middle line:84%
were into this
inquisition against him.

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And so he kind of
freaked out and ended up

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:08.991 align:middle line:84%
calling me because I
was a Harvard College

00:28:08.991 --> 00:28:11.490 align:middle line:84%
graduate and Harvard Law School
and Harvard Divinity School.

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And so he asked me to
come in to represent him

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:16.350 align:middle line:84%
in front of the Special
Select Faculty Committee.

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And so he and I went to
see Lawrence Rockefeller.

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And Lawrence Rockefeller
agreed to fund anything

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:26.670 align:middle line:84%
that we needed to make a full
presentation to the Harvard

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:30.060 align:middle line:84%
faculty on both the issues of
extraterrestrial intelligence

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:32.230 align:middle line:90%
and the UFO phenomenon.

00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And so when I appeared
with him in front

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:38.380 align:middle line:84%
of the faculty committee, they
started to interrogate me.

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And I said, excuse
me, hold on here.

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.860 align:middle line:84%
I said, can you first
tell me-- this is not

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:47.140 align:middle line:84%
an AAUP, Association of
American University Professors,

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:49.240 align:middle line:90%
authorized faculty committee.

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:50.280 align:middle line:90%
I said, what is this?

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.950 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:53.550 align:middle line:90%
What is this that's happening?

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And so John Relman, who is
chairing the committee, who

00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:02.250 align:middle line:84%
was the publisher of the "New
England Journal of Medicine"--

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:02.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, there you go.

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:03.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Was
charing the committee.

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:04.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:05.735 align:middle line:10%
>>SHEEHAN: And he
said, well, you know,

00:29:05.735 --> 00:29:09.530 align:middle line:10%
after Dr. Mack published this
book, the dean of the Harvard

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:12.400 align:middle line:10%
Medical School started getting
a lot of telephone calls

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.230 align:middle line:10%
and asking him questions that
he wasn't able to answer.

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:18.037 align:middle line:84%
So we thought that he'd come
and meet with the people

00:29:18.037 --> 00:29:19.870 align:middle line:84%
and be able to answer
some of the questions.

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:21.120 align:middle line:90%
I said, oh, really?

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:24.590 align:middle line:84%
I said, can you
tell me who called?

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And there was this
big dead silence.

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:29.005 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Relman had
turned and looked

00:29:29.005 --> 00:29:30.880 align:middle line:84%
at the legal counsel
from Harvard University,

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:34.840 align:middle line:84%
and they went-- And
so he said, I'm sorry,

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:36.770 align:middle line:84%
we're not at liberty
to discuss that.

00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:39.467 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, well, in
the spirit of cooperation,

00:29:39.467 --> 00:29:41.800 align:middle line:84%
if you want us to answer the
questions that he was being

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.240 align:middle line:84%
asked so he can answer
the questions, what were

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.352 align:middle line:90%
the questions they were asking?

00:29:46.352 --> 00:29:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And there was this
big dead silence again

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:49.770 align:middle line:90%
that fell over the room.

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at
the legal counsel,

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:54.660 align:middle line:84%
and she said-- He
said, I'm sorry,

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:56.922 align:middle line:84%
we're not at liberty
to discuss that.

00:29:56.922 --> 00:29:58.380 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK, so let
me ask you this.

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:03.270 align:middle line:84%
I said, is it fair for me
to assume that the fact

00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:06.630 align:middle line:84%
question will come up during
the course of these hearings,

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:09.410 align:middle line:84%
whatever their nature,
about, number one,

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:12.480 align:middle line:84%
whether extraterrestrial
intelligence exists,

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:16.110 align:middle line:84%
and, number two, whether at
least some of the UFO sightings

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:18.680 align:middle line:84%
might actually be vehicles
from an extraterrestrial

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:19.710 align:middle line:90%
civilization?

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:22.080 align:middle line:84%
Will either one or both
of those fact questions

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.860 align:middle line:90%
be at issue in these hearings?

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Relman said, why,
absolutely they will.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.560 align:middle line:84%
He said, and it's
ridiculous for anybody

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:32.297 align:middle line:84%
to think either one of
those two things is true.

00:30:32.297 --> 00:30:33.380 align:middle line:90%
That's what he says to me.

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:34.950 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, thank you.

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:38.740 align:middle line:84%
Then I should, again, in
the spirit of openness,

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:40.940 align:middle line:84%
let you know that John and
I just spent the weekend

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:41.850 align:middle line:90%
with Lawrence Rockefeller.

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:43.840 align:middle line:84%
He's agreed to fund
anything that's necessary.

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:46.780 align:middle line:84%
We can put on a grand
rounds here for you

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:49.500 align:middle line:84%
and present all the people from
the general officers in the Air

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:50.605 align:middle line:90%
Force and the military--

00:30:50.605 --> 00:30:52.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kind of what
turned out to be disclosure.

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:56.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: We'll present
all these people to you

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:58.450 align:middle line:84%
under oath if you'd
like to do that.

00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And the legal counsel
for Harvard University

00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:02.776 align:middle line:84%
leapt to her feet, and
she said, absolutely not.

00:31:02.776 --> 00:31:04.650 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to allow
these hearings to be

00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:06.684 align:middle line:90%
turned into a circus, she said.

00:31:06.684 --> 00:31:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I turned to
John, and I said, OK,

00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:09.690 align:middle line:90%
John I guess we're done here.

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:10.900 align:middle line:90%
So let's get up and leave.

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And he was going, but--
but-- I said, no, we're

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:16.040 align:middle line:84%
leaving until they're ready
to hear the testimony.

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.640 align:middle line:90%
And so we got up and walked out.

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And they ended up
sending a letter to John,

00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:22.602 align:middle line:84%
apologizing profusely
for his failing

00:31:22.602 --> 00:31:24.560 align:middle line:84%
to understand what it
was that they were really

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:27.610 align:middle line:84%
trying to do here and
agreed to leave him alone.

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And of course, John set up
a thing called the Project

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:35.700 align:middle line:84%
on Extraordinary Experienced
Research there at Harvard.

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And I became general
counsel for them.

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:41.580 align:middle line:84%
So that way, I got to meet
dozens and dozens of people

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:42.632 align:middle line:90%
from all walks of life.

00:31:42.632 --> 00:31:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, he was so
highly respect and beloved.

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:45.673 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Oh, yeah.

00:31:45.673 --> 00:31:46.520 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And so I became his
personal lawyer,

00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:52.010 align:middle line:84%
and I became legal counsel
for the PEER project

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:53.940 align:middle line:84%
and got to start meeting
all kinds of people

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:57.030 align:middle line:84%
who had these experiences
in all walks of life,

00:31:57.030 --> 00:32:03.095 align:middle line:84%
police officers,
university professors,

00:32:03.095 --> 00:32:07.940 align:middle line:84%
and that's how I recently got
to talk with Dennis Kucinich.

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Because Dennis Kucinich is
one who was willing to-- well,

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:17.220 align:middle line:84%
actually I brought the
commanding United States Air

00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Force officer, the colonel who
was in charge of a Minuteman

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:24.850 align:middle line:90%
Missile site--

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:25.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Solace?

00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:27.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: No, this
was the colonel.

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:31.430 align:middle line:84%
But the bottom line is I brought
him to meet his congressman

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:34.190 align:middle line:84%
because he was from Ohio, the
10th congressional district

00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:36.930 align:middle line:84%
from Ohio, and it
was Dennis Kucinich.

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And so I brought him
to sit down with Dennis

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:40.750 align:middle line:84%
and tell Dennis
what had happened.

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And Dennis was
saying, look, this

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.380 align:middle line:84%
is one of those issues
up here on the Hill.

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:48.220 align:middle line:84%
There are a number of us that
know that this thing is very

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:51.030 align:middle line:84%
serious, but nobody
will touch this,

00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:53.590 align:middle line:84%
because there is this
taboo against dealing

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:54.700 align:middle line:90%
with this issue.

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And that was how I
first got to meet Dennis

00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:02.280 align:middle line:84%
and later became his campaign
policy director in the campaign

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:05.450 align:middle line:84%
later on in 2004 when he
ran for the presidency.

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:06.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, OK.

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:08.950 align:middle line:84%
All right, drawing
that all full circle.

00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:11.790 align:middle line:84%
OK, now let's talk
about how you ended up

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:13.000 align:middle line:90%
in the Vatican libraries.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.830 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about-- I remember
you showing the drawing

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:19.140 align:middle line:84%
that you sneaked your little
yellow pad into your pants

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:22.800 align:middle line:84%
and came out with a sketch,
a tracing of these symbols.

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:25.300 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about how
the Vatican became involved.

00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:28.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well, what it was
is that I contacted the Vatican

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:30.380 align:middle line:84%
and again asked them
if I could get access

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:33.850 align:middle line:84%
to this, their
classified-- and what

00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:37.240 align:middle line:84%
happened is that that's
what generated the Air

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:40.690 align:middle line:84%
Force authorizing me to go in
to see the classified portions

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:41.620 align:middle line:90%
of Blue Book.

00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:43.980 align:middle line:84%
This was actually in the
files of the Blue Book,

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:45.650 align:middle line:90%
is where I saw this.

00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:48.770 align:middle line:84%
They actually brought the
files to Washington, DC,

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:51.150 align:middle line:84%
and they brought them to
the Jefferson Building,

00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:55.230 align:middle line:84%
which was a brand new building
for the Library of Congress.

00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:58.430 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't anybody
in those offices yet.

00:33:58.430 --> 00:34:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And I went over there
on a Saturday morning,

00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:04.770 align:middle line:84%
had to show them three different
forms of photo ID to get in.

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:07.040 align:middle line:84%
There were these two
suits at the door.

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And so I went in,
and they said, you

00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:10.230 align:middle line:90%
have to walk down this hall.

00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:12.442 align:middle line:84%
And so I walked down
the hall, echoing

00:34:12.442 --> 00:34:14.650 align:middle line:84%
in this hall with nobody in
the whole building, brand

00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:15.570 align:middle line:90%
new building.

00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:18.783 align:middle line:84%
And I get in this elevator,
and I go down to the basement.

00:34:18.783 --> 00:34:21.199 align:middle line:84%
And I get out of the elevator,
and I can see this light on

00:34:21.199 --> 00:34:23.230 align:middle line:90%
down in this office down there.

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:25.730 align:middle line:84%
So I go I go down, and there
are these two other suits there

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:27.440 align:middle line:90%
who recheck my ID.

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And it just occurred to
me when I was coming down

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:33.929 align:middle line:84%
in the elevator, I
opened up my briefcase

00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:36.610 align:middle line:84%
and took out a yellow pad
and put it under my arm.

00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And so when I went down
to the basement floor

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:43.030 align:middle line:84%
and met with these guys, they
took my briefcase and said,

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:45.070 align:middle line:84%
you can't take any notes
or anything on anything

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:46.110 align:middle line:90%
you see in there.

00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:49.179 align:middle line:84%
And so I walked in,
and what there was

00:34:49.179 --> 00:34:55.429 align:middle line:84%
was this room about maybe 18, 20
feet wide, about 10 feet deep.

00:34:55.429 --> 00:34:57.944 align:middle line:84%
And they had these
big folding tables.

00:34:57.944 --> 00:35:00.360 align:middle line:84%
You think it's going to be
something really sophisticated,

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:00.700 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:02.590 align:middle line:84%
They had these folding
tables, and they

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:06.470 align:middle line:84%
had these boxes, these
little shoebox-size things.

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:09.440 align:middle line:84%
They were this kind
of light green, kind

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:12.000 align:middle line:90%
of institutional green boxes.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And they were filled
with microfiche.

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And I took the microfiche
out and brought them

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:23.340 align:middle line:84%
to one of these very
unsophisticated tin

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:25.500 align:middle line:84%
kind of microfiche
crank machines,

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:27.304 align:middle line:84%
and I started looking
through them all.

00:35:27.304 --> 00:35:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm never
going to have time

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:31.000 align:middle line:84%
to read all these documents
of what's in here,

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.720 align:middle line:90%
but I was looking for pictures.

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And so I found this
set of pictures

00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:39.980 align:middle line:84%
that showed an absolutely
uncontestable UFO that

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:40.780 align:middle line:90%
had landed.

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:44.330 align:middle line:84%
It had hit in this field, and
it had plowed this big furrow

00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:47.230 align:middle line:84%
across the field and was
stuck in the side of a bank.

00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And it was all snow there,
so this wasn't Roswell.

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:55.040 align:middle line:84%
Here's this UFO sticking at
like a 45-degree angle up out

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.980 align:middle line:90%
of this big snow bank.

00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And there are US Air Force
people all around it.

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:01.800 align:middle line:90%
They had these big parkas on.

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:04.460 align:middle line:90%
And I recognized what they were.

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:07.770 align:middle line:90%
And they were taking film of it.

00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:09.190 align:middle line:90%
So this dated it somewhat.

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:11.630 align:middle line:84%
It was a film camera
with those two big rolls

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:13.010 align:middle line:90%
on the top of the camera.

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:15.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's in the
'50s or something.

00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:18.224 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm looking
through these pictures,

00:36:18.224 --> 00:36:20.140 align:middle line:84%
these different pictures
of it, and suddenly I

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:24.220 align:middle line:84%
realized that at the bottom
of the dome of this UFO

00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:25.840 align:middle line:90%
I could see these symbols.

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:30.980 align:middle line:84%
So what I did is I took
out the yellow pad,

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:36.530 align:middle line:84%
and I opened it up to the back
cardboard cover on the inside,

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:38.370 align:middle line:84%
and I put it under
the microfiche,

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:42.120 align:middle line:84%
and I shrunk the microfiche
to fit right onto the page,

00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:42.920 align:middle line:90%
and then I traced--

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:44.586 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Traced.
[LAUGHING] I remember.

00:36:44.586 --> 00:36:47.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: I traced the symbols
exactly as to what they were.

00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And I folded it back up, and
I put the microfiche back in.

00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I better get out of
here because I've now got this.

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:56.810 align:middle line:84%
So I put the yellow pad under
my arm, and I go back out,

00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:58.300 align:middle line:90%
and I walk out.

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And these two suits
that were out there

00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:02.710 align:middle line:84%
were kind of surprised
that I'd come out of there.

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm walking away,
and I pick up my briefcase,

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:07.040 align:middle line:90%
and I walk away.

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:10.280 align:middle line:84%
And I get about 15, 20 steps
away from them, and one of them

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.430 align:middle line:90%
says, hold it.

00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:13.040 align:middle line:90%
What have you got there?

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:14.562 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh,
it's my briefcase.

00:37:14.562 --> 00:37:16.020 align:middle line:84%
I just picked my
briefcase back up.

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And he said, no, what's
that under your arm?

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And he walked over to me, and
he snatches the yellow pad away

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:21.720 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:23.923 align:middle line:84%
And he ruffles all the way
through all the pages of it,

00:37:23.923 --> 00:37:25.030 align:middle line:90%
and there was nothing there.

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:26.020 align:middle line:90%
So he hands it back to me.

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it
was on the cardboard.

00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:27.700 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:30.033 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And so I go back
the following Monday morning

00:37:30.033 --> 00:37:32.690 align:middle line:84%
to Jesuit headquarters,
right there in Washington,

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:34.540 align:middle line:84%
and I go into see father
William Davis, who

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:37.410 align:middle line:84%
was my immediate
superior at the Jesuits.

00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And I show him this, and
I tell him what I found.

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And he reaches down,
and he slides out

00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:47.240 align:middle line:84%
the bottom drawer of his
desk, and he takes out

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:48.480 align:middle line:90%
a little manila envelope.

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And he slides out of it an 8
1/2 by 11 black-and-white glossy

00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:56.920 align:middle line:90%
photograph of a UFO.

00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And he hands it to
me, and he said,

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:02.980 align:middle line:84%
my sister sent this to me,
[? Dodi. ?] [? Dodi ?] sent

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:03.780 align:middle line:90%
this to me.

00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:09.720 align:middle line:84%
Her husband, whom I had met,
was an air traffic controller

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.650 align:middle line:90%
in the Seattle airport.

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And his best friend
is a commercial pilot

00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:17.460 align:middle line:84%
who took this photograph right
out of the window of his plane,

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:20.380 align:middle line:84%
and he didn't dare
report it to anybody

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:22.710 align:middle line:90%
because of all this ridicule.

00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:25.490 align:middle line:84%
So he brings it to his best
friend, who is the air traffic

00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:27.490 align:middle line:84%
controller, saying,
there, now I've

00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:28.940 align:middle line:90%
done what I'm supposed to do.

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:31.640 align:middle line:84%
He brings it home and didn't
know what to do with it,

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:33.030 align:middle line:84%
gives it to his
sister [? Dodi ?]

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:35.070 align:middle line:84%
and says, give this
to your brother.

00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:36.440 align:middle line:90%
He's a priest.

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:38.347 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHING] OK.

00:38:38.347 --> 00:38:39.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: So he had
it in his drawer.

00:38:39.930 --> 00:38:41.940 align:middle line:90%
He says, what does that mean?

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:45.250 align:middle line:84%
What does that mean that
people think like that?

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:48.850 align:middle line:84%
Why is this something that they
should tell a priest about?

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And there I was at
Jesuit headquarters

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:53.810 align:middle line:84%
in the process of becoming
a priest, a Jesuit priest,

00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:56.460 align:middle line:84%
and here I'm getting
all this information.

00:38:56.460 --> 00:39:00.125 align:middle line:84%
And yet the Vatican won't
show it to us, won't tell us.

00:39:00.125 --> 00:39:02.250 align:middle line:84%
Even a Jesuit who's the
head of the Vatican library

00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:03.710 align:middle line:90%
won't show this to us.

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:06.690 align:middle line:84%
So I went to the National
Council of Churches

00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:09.730 align:middle line:84%
in [INAUDIBLE] and ask them
to set up a task force,

00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:11.200 align:middle line:90%
and they wouldn't do it.

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:13.100 align:middle line:90%
So that's how I got into this.

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:16.240 align:middle line:84%
So I ended up getting
contacted by Steven Greer.

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And he wants me to be general
counsel for the Disclosure

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:19.850 align:middle line:90%
Project.

00:39:19.850 --> 00:39:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And my job was to vet all the
different potential candidates

00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:23.730 align:middle line:90%
we had.

00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This was late 90s now?

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.532 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: This was 2001.

00:39:26.532 --> 00:39:27.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, it was in 2001.

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Yeah, this was
like beginning of 2001.

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:30.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, kind of real time.

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:30.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:32.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And he
asks me if I would--

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:35.360 align:middle line:84%
because I had gone, by
this time from 1994,

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:37.130 align:middle line:90%
with Dr. John Mack and all that.

00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:40.400 align:middle line:84%
I was invited to go to the
International UFO Congress

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.720 align:middle line:84%
and brief them about how this
thing was going with Dr. John

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:44.520 align:middle line:90%
Mack.

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:47.010 align:middle line:84%
Because everybody was up in
arms over this thing, right?

00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And so I came in
originally in 1995,

00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:53.210 align:middle line:84%
I think, and briefed everybody
at the international UFO

00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:55.580 align:middle line:84%
Congress about what
John Mack was doing

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:58.960 align:middle line:84%
and stuff and my getting to
interview more and more people

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:00.320 align:middle line:90%
about this.

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And so they asked me,
look, it's a little unique

00:40:03.810 --> 00:40:06.430 align:middle line:84%
to have a Harvard Law
School graduate who's

00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:09.330 align:middle line:84%
legal counsel for the
Jesuits to be here talking

00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:10.470 align:middle line:90%
to the UFO community.

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:13.390 align:middle line:84%
Will you tell us what you
think about all of this?

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And so I began to be invited
back for fairly regularly,

00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:18.770 align:middle line:84%
and I was explaining
to them, and it

00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:21.870 align:middle line:84%
was enabling me to think much
more deeply about all of this,

00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:25.090 align:middle line:84%
to take the time to
think about all of this.

00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:29.126 align:middle line:84%
I had already done the JPL
lecture to the study SETI

00:40:29.126 --> 00:40:30.750 align:middle line:84%
people, so I at first
explained to them

00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:32.690 align:middle line:84%
the theological
implications of all this

00:40:32.690 --> 00:40:34.514 align:middle line:84%
and the philosophical
implications.

00:40:34.514 --> 00:40:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
talking to them

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:38.280 align:middle line:84%
about the different
worldviews that people have,

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:42.270 align:middle line:84%
that people actually
experience the UFO phenomenon

00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:45.050 align:middle line:84%
from the perspective
of their worldview

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:47.790 align:middle line:84%
and that that's what they
think about the UFO phenomenon.

00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:50.720 align:middle line:84%
So if you're a military
person, you think about it

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:52.560 align:middle line:90%
as a military threat.

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:55.400 align:middle line:84%
If you're a New Age person,
you think, oh, these

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:56.860 align:middle line:90%
are going to come and save us.

00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:58.850 align:middle line:84%
They're going to solve
all of our problems.

00:40:58.850 --> 00:41:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And so different people
have different experiences

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:02.302 align:middle line:90%
of the phenomenon.

00:41:02.302 --> 00:41:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about disclosure.

00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:05.426 align:middle line:84%
So the day of
disclosure has come.

00:41:05.426 --> 00:41:06.792 align:middle line:90%
You have vetted the people.

00:41:06.792 --> 00:41:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of hope in the air.

00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And as you recall, the
National Press Club

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:13.620 align:middle line:84%
was overflowing with
people and reporters.

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:15.206 align:middle line:84%
Of course, not a
peep made it out

00:41:15.206 --> 00:41:16.950 align:middle line:90%
to the American press at all.

00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And people are still
talking about disclosure,

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:23.119 align:middle line:90%
like, oh, when-- it's all ready.

00:41:23.119 --> 00:41:24.410 align:middle line:90%
It's going to happen next year.

00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:25.260 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's ready.

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:25.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Right
around the corner.

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:26.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, the
white hats are going

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:28.560 align:middle line:90%
to do it for us and all that.

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.920 align:middle line:84%
My question is do
you think that what

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:36.230 align:middle line:84%
happened there actually was as
close to a formal disclosure

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:37.610 align:middle line:90%
as it gets?

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:42.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Actually,
there's two answers to that.

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:50.110 align:middle line:84%
One is that now the Vatican,
as you know, as of 2009

00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:53.400 align:middle line:84%
has issued a formal
statement saying that,

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:57.740 align:middle line:84%
in light of the discovery
of all of these new planets

00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:02.100 align:middle line:84%
as a result of the Hubble
Space Telescope, the Kepler

00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:08.056 align:middle line:84%
planet-hunter space telescope,
and the Planck telescope

00:42:08.056 --> 00:42:10.180 align:middle line:84%
and the new one, the Webb
telescope that's going up

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:12.030 align:middle line:84%
next year, that
we're discovering

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:14.530 align:middle line:84%
more and more of these
planets, and it's clear

00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:16.890 align:middle line:84%
that a huge number of
them are in the Goldilocks

00:42:16.890 --> 00:42:21.240 align:middle line:84%
zone of their star, not
too cold and not too high,

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:23.470 align:middle line:90%
and that they can sustain life.

00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And they issued an
official Vatican statement

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:29.880 align:middle line:84%
in November of 2009,
saying that, we believe

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:34.380 align:middle line:84%
that much sooner than anyone
anticipates that life is going

00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:36.820 align:middle line:84%
to be discovered,
extraterrestrial life is

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:38.010 align:middle line:90%
going to be discovered.

00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And this whole Vatican statement
from the official Vatican press

00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:42.790 align:middle line:90%
room was issued.

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And the host of that
particular meeting

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:48.330 align:middle line:84%
was Father Jose
Gabriel Funes, who

00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:52.490 align:middle line:84%
was the Jesuit priest who was
the head of the observatory,

00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:53.290 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And so I reached out
to him and started

00:42:56.050 --> 00:42:59.100 align:middle line:84%
having these conversations with
him, went to Rome and saw him.

00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:01.180 align:middle line:90%
And he flew here and I saw him.

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And we started having
these discussions,

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:08.130 align:middle line:84%
and he now has agreed
to chair-- he issued

00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:11.820 align:middle line:84%
this call for the beginning
of a very serious discussion

00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:16.430 align:middle line:84%
of the profound philosophical
and theological implications

00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:middle line:84%
of the discovery of life
elsewhere in the universe.

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:22.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I ended up
talking to him face to face,

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:25.100 align:middle line:84%
he and I both acknowledged that
it wasn't just the discovery

00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:29.940 align:middle line:84%
of life, like some minute
bacteria under a sea of ice

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:32.000 align:middle line:84%
in some moons
somewhere, but it's

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.810 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial intelligence
that we're talking about,

00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:35.610 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:38.020 align:middle line:84%
And then he and I both
agreed that it wasn't just

00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:40.110 align:middle line:84%
intelligence we
were looking for.

00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:45.050 align:middle line:84%
What we were looking for
is this other faculty,

00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:48.030 align:middle line:84%
this mystical faculty
that the human species has

00:43:48.030 --> 00:43:51.380 align:middle line:84%
of being able to immediately
experientially encounter

00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:55.370 align:middle line:84%
the unitive phenomenon in the
universe that causes everything

00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:57.850 align:middle line:90%
to be harmonious and unified.

00:43:57.850 --> 00:43:59.310 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're looking for.

00:43:59.310 --> 00:44:00.990 align:middle line:84%
Because the intellect,
intellectus,

00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:03.170 align:middle line:84%
the Latin root of
which is the ability

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:05.590 align:middle line:84%
to discover the
difference between.

00:44:05.590 --> 00:44:09.400 align:middle line:84%
What we're really looking
for is [INAUDIBLE], which

00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:12.210 align:middle line:84%
is the Latin root of
re-linking, of this ability

00:44:12.210 --> 00:44:15.830 align:middle line:84%
of the human species to re-link
with the universe, with nature,

00:44:15.830 --> 00:44:19.460 align:middle line:84%
the entire created universe
of which we are a function.

00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:21.660 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
looking for in this.

00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And he has now been given
the blessing of Pope Francis

00:44:25.890 --> 00:44:29.940 align:middle line:84%
and of Bishop Sorondo, who
is the head of the Pontifical

00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:32.490 align:middle line:84%
Academy of Science,
to take a leave

00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:34.360 align:middle line:90%
as the head of the observatory.

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And he is now coming
to the United States,

00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:39.440 align:middle line:84%
and he is going to be chairing--
we have set up a thing

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:43.166 align:middle line:84%
called the New Paradigm
Institute right next door

00:44:43.166 --> 00:44:44.790 align:middle line:84%
to the graduate
theological [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:47.530 align:middle line:84%
Berkeley, University of
California in Berkeley.

00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And we're involving all
of the theology schools

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:51.880 align:middle line:84%
that are there, the
graduate schools,

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:53.950 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to be
the conveners of bringing

00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:56.900 align:middle line:84%
in all of the world
experts to come in and have

00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:59.320 align:middle line:84%
a series of meetings
and discussions

00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:04.040 align:middle line:84%
about the profound philosophical
and theological implications

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:08.350 align:middle line:84%
of contact with a highly
intelligent, highly

00:45:08.350 --> 00:45:13.150 align:middle line:84%
technologically developed,
but distinctly non-human

00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:15.080 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial species.

00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's the conversation
that is beginning now.

00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:20.991 align:middle line:84%
And I have the great privilege
of being the convener

00:45:20.991 --> 00:45:22.490 align:middle line:84%
and being the one
that's going to be

00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:24.530 align:middle line:84%
vetting who is
going to participate

00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:26.020 align:middle line:90%
in those conversations.

00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:28.830 align:middle line:84%
And Father Funes, with
the blessing of Francis

00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:31.840 align:middle line:84%
and with the blessing of the
Pontifical Academy of Sciences,

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:35.080 align:middle line:84%
is going to be hosting and
chairing and facilitating

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:36.380 align:middle line:90%
those discussions.

00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to reach
out and do those things.

00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:41.035 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to
have another separate hour

00:45:41.035 --> 00:45:43.980 align:middle line:84%
discussion on the whole notion
of the various paradigms,

00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:47.260 align:middle line:84%
how they're existing alongside,
competing with one another,

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:49.320 align:middle line:84%
and where we have
to go as a species

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:52.824 align:middle line:84%
in order to actually have
this effective communication

00:45:52.824 --> 00:45:54.740 align:middle line:84%
with these other species
you're talking about.

00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:57.172 align:middle line:84%
That's a long and
wonderful conversation,

00:45:57.172 --> 00:45:58.630 align:middle line:84%
and so I just want
everyone to know

00:45:58.630 --> 00:46:00.950 align:middle line:84%
we are going to go that
in our next conversation.

00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:03.345 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, so you here
you have at disclosure,

00:46:03.345 --> 00:46:04.720 align:middle line:84%
which was Steven
Greer's attempt,

00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:07.080 align:middle line:84%
just bring the experts in,
let them tell what they saw.

00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:07.880 align:middle line:90%
You're there.

00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:08.770 align:middle line:90%
You've vetted them.

00:46:08.770 --> 00:46:10.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And a dead silence
on the part of the media.

00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:11.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Dead silence.

00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:12.490 align:middle line:90%
And I mean, I was there--

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:13.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And no congressmen
wanted to talk about it.

00:46:13.650 --> 00:46:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No one
wanted-- and these guys,

00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:16.863 align:middle line:84%
I mean some of these
older men in particular

00:46:16.863 --> 00:46:20.240 align:middle line:84%
who had been holding on through
their national security oaths,

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:21.080 align:middle line:90%
were in tears.

00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:23.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was very challenging
for them to tell the story.

00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:26.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And I had agreed
to represent any of them

00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:29.500 align:middle line:84%
if they tried to
revoke their pensions

00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:31.950 align:middle line:84%
or tried to prosecute them
for a violation of security

00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:32.750 align:middle line:90%
clearance.

00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:34.966 align:middle line:84%
I had agreed to represent
them individually.

00:46:34.966 --> 00:46:37.590 align:middle line:84%
So that's how we got a number of
them to come forward and talk.

00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:38.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they
were still scared.

00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:39.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Oh, yeah.

00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:41.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the point is we
did have a public disclosure.

00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:43.410 align:middle line:90%
It went nowhere, OK?

00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:45.740 align:middle line:84%
So now we have this
very deep dialogue

00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:47.380 align:middle line:90%
that you're developing.

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And you and I talked
off camera about this,

00:46:49.370 --> 00:46:51.180 align:middle line:90%
and I saw it for myself.

00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:55.870 align:middle line:84%
I was at a Buddhist retreat
at a monastery recently,

00:46:55.870 --> 00:46:58.600 align:middle line:84%
and I ran into a
scientist from JPL.

00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:00.907 align:middle line:84%
She said, oh, well, I'm
just contracting right now.

00:47:00.907 --> 00:47:01.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm not working full time.

00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:03.080 align:middle line:90%
I said, what are you on?

00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:08.060 align:middle line:84%
She said, well, they've given me
some of the samples from Mars,

00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:10.310 align:middle line:84%
and we're looking to see
if it's possible there's

00:47:10.310 --> 00:47:11.974 align:middle line:90%
any life on Mars.

00:47:11.974 --> 00:47:13.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Microscopic life.

00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:14.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Microscopic
life on Mars.

00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh,
gosh, here we go.

00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And you and I talked
off camera, and if you

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:23.920 align:middle line:84%
will explain to people how
the public disclosure is

00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:25.510 align:middle line:90%
going to likely roll out.

00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:27.540 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to be
another big event.

00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:30.920 align:middle line:84%
The big events have occurred,
and it went nowhere.

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:34.055 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: I believe that
what's happening now--

00:47:34.055 --> 00:47:36.420 align:middle line:84%
and there's two parts
to this answer, I said.

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:39.440 align:middle line:84%
One of them is that now
that these planets are being

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:41.420 align:middle line:84%
discovered, what they're
going to be doing

00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:43.040 align:middle line:84%
is they're going
to say, oh, look,

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:45.940 align:middle line:84%
we've discovered a planet
that has a sea of ice,

00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:49.230 align:middle line:84%
and we've now discerned
microscopic life

00:47:49.230 --> 00:47:51.230 align:middle line:90%
beneath the surface of this ice.

00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And so they're going to
break that to begin with.

00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:53.850 align:middle line:90%
Then they're going to say--

00:47:53.850 --> 00:47:54.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Water.

00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:57.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Water
and microscope life.

00:47:57.090 --> 00:48:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And now we've discovered life
in the seas of another planet.

00:48:03.070 --> 00:48:07.190 align:middle line:84%
We've discovered very
primitive reptiles and stuff

00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:08.170 align:middle line:90%
on another planet.

00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:11.109 align:middle line:84%
We've discovered mammalian
life on some other planet.

00:48:11.109 --> 00:48:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And they're eventually
going to get--

00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:13.910 align:middle line:84%
they're just going
to feather it in one

00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:15.600 align:middle line:84%
step at a time like
this, and they're

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:18.320 align:middle line:84%
going to ultimately say, oh,
we've discovered some extremely

00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:22.180 align:middle line:84%
primitive life form,
like Cro-Magnon life

00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:24.610 align:middle line:84%
forms like that, whether
they're reptilian or mammalian

00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:25.860 align:middle line:90%
or whatever they are.

00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And what they're
going to do is they've

00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:28.470 align:middle line:90%
decided to feather it in.

00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:29.344 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Spoon-feed.

00:48:29.344 --> 00:48:33.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Feather in to the
world public the existence,

00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:36.380 align:middle line:84%
eventually, of a more
sophisticated civilization.

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
keep secret the fact

00:48:38.110 --> 00:48:40.600 align:middle line:84%
that they know that there's
a very highly technologically

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:43.426 align:middle line:84%
developed civilization that's
actually been coming here.

00:48:43.426 --> 00:48:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And they're just going
to blow right by this.

00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:47.640 align:middle line:84%
But second part of
the answer to that

00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:50.950 align:middle line:84%
question about disclosure--
and this Randy Koppang.

00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Randy Koppang, who has been to
every single UFO conference,

00:48:54.730 --> 00:48:57.010 align:middle line:84%
has got copies of every
single speech that's

00:48:57.010 --> 00:49:00.010 align:middle line:84%
ever been given, he said, look,
when you really look at this,

00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:02.290 align:middle line:84%
they're engaged in a
disclosure project.

00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:03.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's already-- yeah.

00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:05.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: They are engaged
in disclosure project.

00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:06.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:49:06.130 --> 00:49:08.213 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: They are
feathering in this information

00:49:08.213 --> 00:49:10.020 align:middle line:84%
to different people,
including journalists,

00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:11.880 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE] and others.

00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:13.240 align:middle line:90%
And they're giving them access.

00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:15.230 align:middle line:84%
There's people from
Area 51 that are

00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:17.670 align:middle line:84%
being allowed to come out
and talk to people in public.

00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:19.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Nick Pope and the
whole English story, yeah.

00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:20.509 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:49:20.509 --> 00:49:22.100 align:middle line:90%
They're allowed to come out.

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:25.026 align:middle line:84%
And he said, and Randy is
writing a book about this

00:49:25.026 --> 00:49:26.150 align:middle line:90%
now, saying, wait a second.

00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:30.020 align:middle line:84%
Don't you realize that there is
a disclosure project going on?

00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:31.825 align:middle line:84%
It's just taking an
entire generation.

00:49:31.825 --> 00:49:32.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's perpetual.

00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:32.620 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:35.078 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: That they're going
to take the entire generation

00:49:35.078 --> 00:49:38.702 align:middle line:84%
from 1947 with the Roswell
encounter all the way through.

00:49:38.702 --> 00:49:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to have an
entire generation that they're

00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:45.000 align:middle line:84%
planning like 100-year rollout
of more and more information

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.570 align:middle line:84%
to the point where
this generation passes

00:49:47.570 --> 00:49:50.100 align:middle line:84%
from the scene, but
the new generation

00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:53.820 align:middle line:84%
is coming in behind us are
completely acclimated to this.

00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:56.410 align:middle line:84%
Because you take the millennial
generation that are basically

00:49:56.410 --> 00:50:05.030 align:middle line:84%
33 down to about 15 right now,
that millennial generation.

00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:08.276 align:middle line:84%
You poll them, and 95%
of them will tell you

00:50:08.276 --> 00:50:09.900 align:middle line:84%
that it's absolutely
clear that there's

00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:11.410 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial intelligence.

00:50:11.410 --> 00:50:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, but it's very
likely that these UFOs and ET

00:50:15.310 --> 00:50:17.380 align:middle line:90%
contacts are happening.

00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And so this second answer
to the question is,

00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:22.670 align:middle line:90%
there's already a rollout.

00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:25.330 align:middle line:90%
This is going on here, OK?

00:50:25.330 --> 00:50:28.020 align:middle line:84%
But they're going to go
this other route of doing it

00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:29.270 align:middle line:90%
kind of formally.

00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:30.920 align:middle line:84%
But this other one
is kind of informal.

00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:33.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For the early adopters
that are willing to listen.

00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:34.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:36.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you
think-- and this

00:50:36.070 --> 00:50:37.910 align:middle line:84%
is the big question
I think everybody

00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:40.650 align:middle line:84%
in this particular area
of study has asked.

00:50:40.650 --> 00:50:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that the incredible
caution has been justified,

00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:50.670 align:middle line:84%
that the public at large really
isn't capable of handling this

00:50:50.670 --> 00:50:52.680 align:middle line:84%
if it were something
to happen very quickly?

00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:53.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: No, no.

00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I don't either.

00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:56.521 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: I think there
are two answers to this.

00:50:56.521 --> 00:50:57.984 align:middle line:90%
It's not because of the public.

00:50:57.984 --> 00:50:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What are
they concerned about?

00:50:59.650 --> 00:51:02.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know there's whole
technology part of the story.

00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:03.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's the first one.

00:51:03.010 --> 00:51:04.866 align:middle line:84%
Remember during the
Cold War, during that

00:51:04.866 --> 00:51:06.240 align:middle line:84%
entire period--
remember the Cold

00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:07.950 align:middle line:90%
War went all the way from 1917.

00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:09.920 align:middle line:90%
It didn't just begin at 1945.

00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:12.240 align:middle line:84%
It began in 1917
with the overthrow

00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:15.100 align:middle line:84%
by the Bolsheviks of the
czar of Russia, Alexander.

00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And ever since
that time, there's

00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:18.460 align:middle line:84%
been this dialectic
going on with

00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:21.920 align:middle line:84%
the nation-state capitalists
and Western civilization

00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:25.250 align:middle line:84%
against the socialists
in Eastern culture.

00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And the bottom line
is that as long

00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:31.530 align:middle line:84%
as the Cold War was going on,
the United States was never

00:51:31.530 --> 00:51:33.770 align:middle line:84%
going to reveal any
of the technology

00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:37.210 align:middle line:84%
that they had encountered
with the Roswell crash, OK?

00:51:37.210 --> 00:51:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And they were going to
try to weaponize it.

00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:41.810 align:middle line:84%
You know the old
saying, the Sufi saying,

00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:44.352 align:middle line:84%
when a pickpocket meets a saint,
all he sees are his pockets.

00:51:44.352 --> 00:51:45.151 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Rights.

00:51:45.151 --> 00:51:45.951 align:middle line:90%
Right. [LAUGHING]

00:51:45.951 --> 00:51:46.751 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: OK?

00:51:46.751 --> 00:51:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And so coming at it
from that perspective,

00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:52.030 align:middle line:84%
that worldview, which is a
dialectical, confrontational

00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:56.780 align:middle line:84%
worldview, they perceive
these extraterrestrial people

00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:58.870 align:middle line:90%
as being a potential threat, OK?

00:51:58.870 --> 00:52:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And so their job--
it's their job assigned

00:52:01.810 --> 00:52:03.950 align:middle line:84%
by both the Republican
and Democratic Party.

00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:05.925 align:middle line:84%
Your job is to
protect the airspace

00:52:05.925 --> 00:52:08.300 align:middle line:84%
and not allow anyone to come
into the airspace that isn't

00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:09.340 align:middle line:90%
monitored and taken care of.

00:52:09.340 --> 00:52:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And here these people
are coming and going,

00:52:11.230 --> 00:52:12.230 align:middle line:90%
and we can't admit that.

00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that could have
been a sell to the public.

00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:14.910 align:middle line:90%
Be afraid.

00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:15.690 align:middle line:90%
Be very afraid.

00:52:15.690 --> 00:52:16.380 align:middle line:90%
We need your money.

00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:17.050 align:middle line:90%
We're developing this stuff.

00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:19.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well, they were still
working on Russia at that time.

00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:21.281 align:middle line:84%
Because what they're
doing is they're

00:52:21.281 --> 00:52:24.280 align:middle line:84%
being able to fund at
that point $300 million

00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:27.020 align:middle line:84%
a year to protect
us against Russia.

00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:29.980 align:middle line:84%
And now they're into
doing anti-terrorism.

00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:33.280 align:middle line:84%
This big one, this
big one that we--

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:35.520 align:middle line:84%
one of our major assignments
that all of us who

00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:40.910 align:middle line:84%
care about this is to
prevent the warrior class,

00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:43.220 align:middle line:84%
the national security
state people,

00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:45.970 align:middle line:84%
from making this
the ultimate other.

00:52:45.970 --> 00:52:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
ultimate other in that

00:52:48.090 --> 00:52:50.254 align:middle line:84%
we have to spend more
than $600 billion a year.

00:52:50.254 --> 00:52:52.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was the
warning of Wernher von Braun.

00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:53.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: That's exactly
right, that they'll

00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:55.600 align:middle line:84%
go right to the thing,
and so you've got

00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:57.120 align:middle line:90%
to stop them from doing that.

00:52:57.120 --> 00:53:00.077 align:middle line:84%
So you have to establish a
friendlier dynamic with regard

00:53:00.077 --> 00:53:01.160 align:middle line:90%
to the extraterrestrials--

00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:01.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is
what you're doing.

00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:03.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: That's our
job, is to do that.

00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:05.290 align:middle line:90%
But-- so that's one thing.

00:53:05.290 --> 00:53:09.020 align:middle line:84%
That one, which is comparatively
predictable, at least for those

00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:12.760 align:middle line:84%
of us who spent 30, 40
years in this area, that's

00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:13.850 align:middle line:90%
one we have to be careful.

00:53:13.850 --> 00:53:17.610 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand,
Marshall Summers-- there's

00:53:17.610 --> 00:53:19.660 align:middle line:84%
a whole set of books
that have been written

00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:23.070 align:middle line:84%
by this fellow named Marshall
Summers, which is called

00:53:23.070 --> 00:53:25.060 align:middle line:90%
"The Allies of Humanity."

00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And what he's talking
about is the fact

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:31.100 align:middle line:84%
that there are, in fact,
extraterrestrial civilizations

00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:34.050 align:middle line:84%
that are very spiritually
evolved and very

00:53:34.050 --> 00:53:37.030 align:middle line:84%
compassionate and supportive
of our human family here,

00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:39.240 align:middle line:84%
very concerned about
what it is we're

00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:41.350 align:middle line:84%
doing to the planet,
the destruction

00:53:41.350 --> 00:53:45.490 align:middle line:84%
of the natural environment, that
this is an extraordinarily--

00:53:45.490 --> 00:53:48.980 align:middle line:84%
not unique planet, but it's
a very rare type of planet

00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:51.687 align:middle line:84%
that gestates life,
that generates life.

00:53:51.687 --> 00:53:53.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The diversity of life.

00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:54.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: The vast
diversity of life.

00:53:54.790 --> 00:53:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's an absolutely
fabulous experience.

00:53:58.610 --> 00:54:02.240 align:middle line:84%
But there's only one in every
like 5,000 to 10,000 planets

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:03.620 align:middle line:90%
that has this capacity.

00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:06.610 align:middle line:84%
So this quest we're
on of these exoplanets

00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:09.820 align:middle line:84%
that we're looking for, there's
probably 50 billion of them

00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:12.580 align:middle line:84%
that they assume are
within the Goldilocks zone.

00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:14.520 align:middle line:84%
But there's very
few of them that

00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:18.210 align:middle line:84%
are of this nature in
that we, as the custodians

00:54:18.210 --> 00:54:21.500 align:middle line:84%
of this particular planet,
this particular species, Homo

00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:25.290 align:middle line:84%
sapien, are not taking
great care of this.

00:54:25.290 --> 00:54:28.960 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we've allowed 1%
to take control and destroy

00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:30.430 align:middle line:90%
the planet.

00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And they're
concerned about this.

00:54:31.850 --> 00:54:34.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And just
to interject this,

00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:36.800 align:middle line:84%
no matter which books
you read on abduction

00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:39.160 align:middle line:84%
and variations of
that, this is the theme

00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:40.400 align:middle line:90%
that comes up over and over.

00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:42.940 align:middle line:84%
When the people go
wherever they go,

00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:44.892 align:middle line:84%
they see the future
scenarios and what's

00:54:44.892 --> 00:54:45.850 align:middle line:90%
happening to the Earth.

00:54:45.850 --> 00:54:47.630 align:middle line:90%
This is a common thread.

00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:50.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: But as Marshall
Summers points out

00:54:50.310 --> 00:54:52.840 align:middle line:84%
in his books, he
says, look, the fact

00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:57.085 align:middle line:84%
that there are these
allies of our human species

00:54:57.085 --> 00:54:59.210 align:middle line:84%
that have been here and
have been trying to warn us

00:54:59.210 --> 00:55:01.020 align:middle line:84%
about this, the
fact of the matter

00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:05.610 align:middle line:84%
is that many of the
extraterrestrial civilizations

00:55:05.610 --> 00:55:09.430 align:middle line:84%
and the lifeforms are
sort of like we are.

00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:14.610 align:middle line:84%
They see the planet as a great
source of resources and the DNA

00:55:14.610 --> 00:55:16.830 align:middle line:84%
materials and stuff
for planting life

00:55:16.830 --> 00:55:18.240 align:middle line:90%
on other planets, et cetera.

00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And these other
extraterrestrial species

00:55:22.410 --> 00:55:25.870 align:middle line:84%
are not necessarily
any better than we are,

00:55:25.870 --> 00:55:27.580 align:middle line:90%
if you really think about it.

00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:31.110 align:middle line:84%
They've got specific
objectives, commercial trade,

00:55:31.110 --> 00:55:33.290 align:middle line:84%
and exploiting
resources, et cetera.

00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And so the fact is, we're
getting this mixed message,

00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:39.670 align:middle line:84%
that there are some beings
that are coming here

00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:42.019 align:middle line:84%
and that are
experimenting with us.

00:55:42.019 --> 00:55:43.560 align:middle line:84%
They're doing
biological experiments,

00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:44.775 align:middle line:90%
like we would in the jungle.

00:55:44.775 --> 00:55:45.941 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's what we do.

00:55:45.941 --> 00:55:48.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Capturing people
and experimenting with them,

00:55:48.310 --> 00:55:49.950 align:middle line:90%
just like we do chimpanzees.

00:55:49.950 --> 00:55:52.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's important for
people to understand

00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:54.830 align:middle line:90%
this is a sophisticated issue.

00:55:54.830 --> 00:55:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And there's a cross-section
of different types of beings

00:55:57.950 --> 00:55:59.370 align:middle line:90%
that we're encountering here.

00:55:59.370 --> 00:56:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And so it's the allies, who
are these spiritually evolved

00:56:02.730 --> 00:56:07.110 align:middle line:84%
beings, that we need to
establish our communications

00:56:07.110 --> 00:56:11.344 align:middle line:84%
with these beings and not fall
into being duped into just

00:56:11.344 --> 00:56:13.510 align:middle line:84%
having someone arrive and
say, here, we can give you

00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:16.690 align:middle line:84%
some super technology because
we've got superluminal travel,

00:56:16.690 --> 00:56:20.380 align:middle line:84%
and all you have to do
is end up establishing

00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:25.040 align:middle line:84%
a unilateral treaty with
us or a trade agreement

00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:27.114 align:middle line:90%
with us, like a TPP.

00:56:27.114 --> 00:56:29.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're talking
about that in the next show.

00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:30.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:32.674 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to
be very careful.

00:56:32.674 --> 00:56:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And what I've been
trying to do is

00:56:34.090 --> 00:56:38.860 align:middle line:84%
to use the special privilege
that I've been given of getting

00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:41.940 align:middle line:84%
access to a Harvard education
and the law school education

00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:44.090 align:middle line:84%
and with the Jesuits and
all the different people

00:56:44.090 --> 00:56:46.360 align:middle line:84%
and meeting
[INAUDIBLE] and getting

00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:48.570 align:middle line:84%
to meet all the spiritual
leaders of our people

00:56:48.570 --> 00:56:51.280 align:middle line:84%
and our planet, is
to try to develop

00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:54.930 align:middle line:84%
a really intelligent,
sophisticated,

00:56:54.930 --> 00:56:59.110 align:middle line:84%
spiritually informed
but rationally developed

00:56:59.110 --> 00:57:01.890 align:middle line:84%
set of policies for
our dealing with

00:57:01.890 --> 00:57:04.070 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial civilizations.

00:57:04.070 --> 00:57:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very
important responsibility

00:57:06.490 --> 00:57:09.690 align:middle line:84%
that our generation has,
because we're at that spot.

00:57:09.690 --> 00:57:13.600 align:middle line:84%
We are privileged to be
in the position of when

00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:14.800 align:middle line:90%
this is happening.

00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:16.508 align:middle line:84%
And so what we have
to develop something,

00:57:16.508 --> 00:57:18.910 align:middle line:84%
because this is going to
affect our human civilization

00:57:18.910 --> 00:57:22.450 align:middle line:90%
for tens of millions of years.

00:57:22.450 --> 00:57:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And so we're at
that exact juncture.

00:57:24.490 --> 00:57:26.770 align:middle line:84%
So if people are
wondering why they happen

00:57:26.770 --> 00:57:29.590 align:middle line:84%
to have been born at
this particular time

00:57:29.590 --> 00:57:33.450 align:middle line:84%
and what is the special mission
that our generation has,

00:57:33.450 --> 00:57:37.900 align:middle line:84%
and this is it, to protect our
planet from an economic system

00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:40.810 align:middle line:84%
that Pope Francis
has warned us about,

00:57:40.810 --> 00:57:43.200 align:middle line:84%
that are exploiting the
resources of our planet,

00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:45.380 align:middle line:84%
are destroying the
natural resources,

00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:49.050 align:middle line:84%
that are threatening the
entire ecosystem that we have.

00:57:49.050 --> 00:57:52.690 align:middle line:84%
Our responsibility
is to undo this,

00:57:52.690 --> 00:57:55.516 align:middle line:84%
to deconstruct these structural
sources of injustice--

00:57:55.516 --> 00:57:56.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Destructive, yes.

00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:58.848 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: As the Jesuit
Order, the Society of Jesus,

00:57:58.848 --> 00:58:01.860 align:middle line:84%
has said in their 30-second
general congregation documents

00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:06.000 align:middle line:84%
in 1975, our responsibility,
equal to the preaching

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.300 align:middle line:84%
of the mass each
day, which we would

00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:11.980 align:middle line:84%
say equal to the meditation
practice that each of us has,

00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:14.980 align:middle line:84%
that we have an
obligation to deconstruct

00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:16.980 align:middle line:84%
the structural
sources of injustice

00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:20.520 align:middle line:84%
in both Western and Eastern
culture on our planet.

00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And we have to develop
an economic system which

00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:25.840 align:middle line:84%
is compassionate and caring
for not only the planet,

00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:27.750 align:middle line:90%
but for the poorest of the poor.

00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And this is what Francis
is calling people out to

00:58:30.830 --> 00:58:35.240 align:middle line:84%
in his Papal Encyclical
in June of 2015.

00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:37.950 align:middle line:84%
He's asking all of
us to come forward.

00:58:37.950 --> 00:58:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time in
his earlier statement,

00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:45.210 align:middle line:84%
called Evangelii Gaudium,
he has issued a call

00:58:45.210 --> 00:58:50.130 align:middle line:84%
for all people who have faith in
the future of our human family

00:58:50.130 --> 00:58:52.470 align:middle line:84%
to come forward
with the good news

00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:54.910 align:middle line:84%
that there is, in
fact, a future for us.

00:58:54.910 --> 00:58:57.870 align:middle line:84%
But we have to take
responsibility for our planet.

00:58:57.870 --> 00:59:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And we have to be careful with
the second call the Vatican has

00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:05.460 align:middle line:84%
issued for developing a really
careful and sophisticated

00:59:05.460 --> 00:59:07.840 align:middle line:84%
process by means
of which we begin

00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:10.512 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with an
extraterrestrial civilization.

00:59:10.512 --> 00:59:11.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A mature diplomacy.

00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:13.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: A mature diplomacy.

00:59:13.290 --> 00:59:16.275 align:middle line:84%
Those are the responsibilities
that we have, both of them.

00:59:16.275 --> 00:59:18.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you have
your work cut out for you.

00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:21.897 align:middle line:84%
And it's really a
truly profound project

00:59:21.897 --> 00:59:23.730 align:middle line:84%
that you're doing at
New Paradigm Institute.

00:59:23.730 --> 00:59:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's going
to be the subject

00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:27.880 align:middle line:84%
of our next
conversation and more.

00:59:27.880 --> 00:59:30.465 align:middle line:84%
So I think you've given everyone
a taste of Danny Sheehan,

00:59:30.465 --> 00:59:33.610 align:middle line:84%
and I can't thank you enough for
your decades of ethical work.

00:59:33.610 --> 00:59:34.900 align:middle line:90%
And you're still going strong.

00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:38.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: People can contact
us at the Romero Institute.

00:59:38.730 --> 00:59:41.630 align:middle line:84%
The New Paradigm Institute
is a wholely integrated

00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:44.070 align:middle line:84%
auxiliary project of
the Romero Institute,

00:59:44.070 --> 00:59:45.190 align:middle line:90%
named after Bishop Oscar.

00:59:45.190 --> 00:59:45.610 align:middle line:90%
Romero.

00:59:45.610 --> 00:59:47.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it romero.org--
romeroinstitute.org.

00:59:47.710 --> 00:59:49.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: It's
romeroinstitute.org.

00:59:49.290 --> 00:59:52.060 align:middle line:10%
And they can contact us,
and they can become members,

00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:54.100 align:middle line:10%
and they can get
newsletters from us.

00:59:54.100 --> 00:59:55.300 align:middle line:90%
And people can participate.

00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:58.752 align:middle line:84%
Because this is-- everybody has
to get on board this operation.

00:59:58.752 --> 01:00:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Because we all have
to participate.

01:00:00.210 --> 01:00:03.510 align:middle line:84%
I want our people to be
participating in this process.

01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:05.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You want all of
the perceptions and stories.

01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:08.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: I want everybody's
perspective on this thing.

01:00:08.330 --> 01:00:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Everybody gets to
participate in this.

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:13.551 align:middle line:10%
Because this is [INAUDIBLE],
which is one of the signs

01:00:13.551 --> 01:00:15.800 align:middle line:10%
that we need to be able to
give to an extraterrestrial

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:18.800 align:middle line:10%
civilization that we
aren't run by a 1% elite.

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:20.679 align:middle line:84%
We're not run by
some governing class.

01:00:20.679 --> 01:00:22.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's
a collective voice.

01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: There's a
whole collective process,

01:00:23.410 --> 01:00:25.110 align:middle line:84%
that our people
are mature enough

01:00:25.110 --> 01:00:28.110 align:middle line:84%
to make our decisions for
ourselves and be responsible.

01:00:28.110 --> 01:00:31.185 align:middle line:84%
So people contact us, and
everybody participate in this.

01:00:31.185 --> 01:00:32.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:33.750 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Can't wait for the
next two hours.

01:00:35.950 --> 01:00:39.760 align:middle line:10%
Again, you can contact Danny
at the romeroinstitute.org

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:40.770 align:middle line:10%
and get on board.

01:00:40.770 --> 01:00:43.833 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank you
for joining us here on Gaia.
