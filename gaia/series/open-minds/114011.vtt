00:00:27.745 --> 00:00:29.370 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
As many of you know,

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.260 align:middle line:10%
the great Dolores Cannon
passed away last year in 2014,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.250 align:middle line:10%
but her work lives on.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.400 align:middle line:84%
By her side for many
years was her daughter,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.920 align:middle line:84%
Julia Cannon, who
assisted Dolores with all

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.600 align:middle line:90%
of her lectures and trainings.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.710 align:middle line:84%
When Dolores suddenly
departed, Julia

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.330 align:middle line:84%
was also left to
finish publishing

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.370 align:middle line:84%
some of Dolores' unpublished
and unfinished works.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.900 align:middle line:84%
She's here with
us today to speak

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.150 align:middle line:84%
about her mother and one of
her last books, "Hidden Sacred

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.957 align:middle line:90%
Knowledge."

00:00:53.957 --> 00:00:56.290 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to-- there'll
be more books beyond that.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.510 align:middle line:84%
We still have
"Convoluted Universe V,"

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.450 align:middle line:84%
and we'll talk about
all that in a bit.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.360 align:middle line:90%
But welcome.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.125 align:middle line:90%
And this is a big deal for you.

00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:04.250 align:middle line:90%
>>JULIA CANNON: Yes, it is.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.477 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're stepping
into your mother's-- well,

00:01:07.477 --> 00:01:08.060 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.200 align:middle line:84%
I started to say,
you're stepping

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.840 align:middle line:90%
into your mother's shoes.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.340 align:middle line:90%
You're not.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.410 align:middle line:90%
You have your own shoes.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:13.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.270 align:middle line:10%
And that is my conundrum, is
I'm stepping in her shoes,

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.500 align:middle line:10%
but I am in my shoes.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.860 align:middle line:10%
And that's kind of
my-- where do I go?

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:23.580 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's talk
about-- I want to talk

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.014 align:middle line:84%
about the circumstances,
because everyone was surprised

00:01:29.014 --> 00:01:29.930 align:middle line:90%
when they heard about.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:30.960 align:middle line:90%
It's like, oh, my God.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.020 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people around the
world were very surprised.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.300 align:middle line:84%
But before we get to that,
I want to ask you one thing.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.440 align:middle line:84%
You and your mom worked
really well together.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.890 align:middle line:84%
I met you two
together years ago.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.630 align:middle line:84%
How do you describe the
skill sets each of you

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.399 align:middle line:90%
bring to the table?

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: We were a great team.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:49.930 align:middle line:90%
You're going to make me cry.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's OK if
you cry a little bit.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.590 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.900 align:middle line:90%
We love your mother.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.495 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: I'm still
dealing with--

00:01:55.495 --> 00:01:56.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
only a few months.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.420 align:middle line:90%
And I'm-- oh, goodness.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.547 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know, I know.

00:02:01.547 --> 00:02:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Because you're
saying, yes, it was a surprise.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.300 align:middle line:90%
It was a surprise to me too.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.590 align:middle line:90%
I really didn't expect it.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.064 align:middle line:84%
She had me convinced she
was going to live forever.

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I thought--
my mom died young.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.430 align:middle line:84%
I thought she was going to
live to be at least 100.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.460 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it happens.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.334 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: I really
thought that was her plan.

00:02:18.334 --> 00:02:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and she
was such a strong woman.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.500 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: She-- I did.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.520 align:middle line:90%
I thought she was-- yes.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.270 align:middle line:90%
That was her plan.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.890 align:middle line:84%
She kept saying, I'm going
to be writing into my 90s,

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.780 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to be--
she had me convinced.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.562 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:02:31.562 --> 00:02:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And she
still had-- she still--

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she was
slowing down a bit.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:35.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.933 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But she still
had a lot of energy.

00:02:36.933 --> 00:02:39.360 align:middle line:84%
You guys had a massive new
project you were starting.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.810 align:middle line:84%
So for the sake of the
viewers that loved her,

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.545 align:middle line:84%
what actually happened
toward the end?

00:02:43.545 --> 00:02:44.211 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Right.

00:02:44.211 --> 00:02:46.760 align:middle line:84%
What actually happened, she
fell, and she hit her head.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.624 align:middle line:84%
And she was on her-- she was
going to the beauty shop.

00:02:49.624 --> 00:02:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your mom had
a thing about her hair.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.670 align:middle line:84%
Let's just talk about
that for a moment.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.760 align:middle line:84%
Your mom would get really edgy
if she didn't have her hair

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.540 align:middle line:90%
exactly the way she wanted it.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.510 align:middle line:90%
I remember that.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Well, and she was
working up till the last.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.990 align:middle line:84%
We had just finished a
class, one of her classes.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And then she was going
to the beauty shop.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.800 align:middle line:84%
So she was-- this is work as
normal, her normal routine.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.400 align:middle line:90%
She was on her own.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.510 align:middle line:90%
So she'd gone in there.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.790 align:middle line:84%
We don't really
know what happened.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.614 align:middle line:90%
We don't know if she slipped.

00:03:16.614 --> 00:03:17.780 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what happened.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.050 align:middle line:90%
She just fell.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.920 align:middle line:84%
Something happened, and
she fell and hit her head.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.330 align:middle line:84%
Now that isn't what
actually did it.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she had some
concussions from that,

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.380 align:middle line:84%
but she actually
healed from those, OK?

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And I was calling on all the
healers around the world.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And she actually
healed from those.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.480 align:middle line:84%
But if was something to
do with the hospital stay.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.030 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it was like,
from-- I think what it was--

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.600 align:middle line:84%
and this is what--
it had to happen

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.440 align:middle line:84%
to convince me that it was her
time and it was her decision.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.790 align:middle line:84%
Because like I said, I was
calling on all the healers.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And everything that-- things
were happening piecemeal,

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.430 align:middle line:90%
one at a time.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.870 align:middle line:84%
And all those were
getting healed

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.260 align:middle line:90%
as I was requesting help.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And then at the last minute,
all of a sudden, just everything

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.700 align:middle line:90%
just shut down.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.624 align:middle line:90%
The whole body went at once.

00:04:08.624 --> 00:04:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I finally
just had to say, OK.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.350 align:middle line:90%
I guess it's time.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.220 align:middle line:90%
I guess you're wanting to go.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think during that other
time, she would sleep a lot.

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.469 align:middle line:84%
And I think she was counseling
and conferring and--

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Going back and
forth between dimensions

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.160 align:middle line:90%
and with other realms and such.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.412 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Right.

00:04:23.412 --> 00:04:25.078 align:middle line:84%
And making-- and I
was-- a lot of people

00:04:25.078 --> 00:04:29.047 align:middle line:84%
were telling me that they were
seeing what she was doing.

00:04:29.047 --> 00:04:30.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, she was
reaching out to them

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.830 align:middle line:90%
and they were tapping into her.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.707 align:middle line:84%
And she's a very powerful being,
and she had quite a reach.

00:04:35.707 --> 00:04:36.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.890 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.540 align:middle line:84%
And that she was
deciding that she

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.509 align:middle line:84%
could do more from the other
side, that it was time.

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:43.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And those
were the messages

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.740 align:middle line:90%
that were coming to you?

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: That were
coming to me, yes.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.730 align:middle line:84%
That there was just much
more that she could do.

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.420 align:middle line:90%
She was just at a pivotal point.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.310 align:middle line:84%
It was like, do I stay and
keep doing what I'm doing?

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.750 align:middle line:84%
It was like-- it was just,
she could do so much more

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:55.760 align:middle line:90%
if she would just go.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
she-- she would not

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.080 align:middle line:84%
be limited energetically
by a body that

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.539 align:middle line:84%
is going through what we all
go through, the aging process.

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:03.413 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Absolutely.

00:05:03.413 --> 00:05:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And we had just gotten
to the point where

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.710 align:middle line:84%
her body was saying, I have
to stop traveling so much.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And we had just done--
like, I had just

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.580 align:middle line:84%
gone on a trip
where we had decided

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.070 align:middle line:90%
that she shouldn't go on it.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And it was the first
one where I had done it,

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.260 align:middle line:90%
and we were doing her by Skype.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.204 align:middle line:90%
And she actually got depressed.

00:05:22.204 --> 00:05:24.370 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, I should
be there with you doing it.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.744 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that's her thing.

00:05:25.744 --> 00:05:28.740 align:middle line:84%
But look at how beautiful
that is, though.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.790 align:middle line:84%
She pushed the little
chick out of the nest

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:32.790 align:middle line:90%
before this happened.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:33.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Right.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.630 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that sounds like
that was pretty critical--

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:36.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: It was.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.151 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --for you to have to
step into that, even though it

00:05:39.151 --> 00:05:42.290 align:middle line:84%
was-- she didn't give you a lot
of training in terms of time

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.144 align:middle line:90%
to adapt to your new role.

00:05:44.144 --> 00:05:46.310 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you'd been
doing it for a year or two.

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:47.730 align:middle line:90%
You just stepped into it.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.021 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Just stepped into it.

00:05:49.021 --> 00:05:49.880 align:middle line:90%
And, you know, OK.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.880 align:middle line:90%
We saw what we could do.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:51.630 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, OK.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:52.310 align:middle line:90%
This works.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.060 align:middle line:84%
We've gotten a
new platform here.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.560 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.900 align:middle line:90%
We can do it.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:57.710 align:middle line:90%
OK, she goes.

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:58.840 align:middle line:90%
It was like, hey, hello?

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now you can--
and now you have to do it.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.860 align:middle line:90%
Now-- OK.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.150 align:middle line:84%
So back to that question at
the beginning, what do you,

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.510 align:middle line:84%
if you were to describe
your skill sets

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.600 align:middle line:84%
and your mom's skill sets
that made you work so

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.190 align:middle line:90%
complementarily together?

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.340 align:middle line:90%


00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: She was a
researcher, investigator.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.340 align:middle line:84%
She was always
asking the questions.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.322 align:middle line:90%
Her skill sets.

00:06:25.322 --> 00:06:26.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, we know that.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.437 align:middle line:84%
She had at such an
amazing curiosity.

00:06:28.437 --> 00:06:29.270 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Curiosity.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.050 align:middle line:90%
Curiosity was her middle name.

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you know, she had
a kind of innocence about her.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Wide eyed innocence.

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wide eyed.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.933 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Wide eyed.

00:06:36.933 --> 00:06:39.310 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like the older
she got, the younger she got.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.820 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I was often accusing
her, I was like, look.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.550 align:middle line:84%
I know you've been on
this planet for 83 years.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:46.780 align:middle line:90%
I know you know these things.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:47.280 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.840 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like she was--
she was becoming more and more

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.480 align:middle line:90%
innocent, the older she got.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:51.990 align:middle line:90%
She just--

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:56.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you know, it's
as though the work she did

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:57.435 align:middle line:90%
required that innocence.

00:06:57.435 --> 00:06:58.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Absolutely.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because if you
come jaded to her job,

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:04.730 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to
ask the same questions.

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:09.220 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to give the
same respect and credibility

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.200 align:middle line:84%
to the people that
you're dealing with.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And thank goodness
she did, because

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.270 align:middle line:84%
over the course of-- how many
thousands of these did she do?

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:17.130 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Oh, my goodness.

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:17.770 align:middle line:90%
It's countless.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Countless thousands
and thousands of regressions.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:23.840 align:middle line:84%
What happened is because
of that kind of wide eye,

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.220 align:middle line:84%
really, well, then
what happened?

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:30.259 align:middle line:84%
She started seeing themes,
big themes emerging over time.

00:07:30.259 --> 00:07:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: And because
of that, that's

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.810 align:middle line:84%
why she would see
the miracles happen.

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:36.170 align:middle line:90%
All the time.

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:38.924 align:middle line:84%
Miracles in her
office, things that--

00:07:38.924 --> 00:07:40.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Give us an
example of a couple

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:41.730 align:middle line:90%
of your favorite miracles.

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:42.813 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Oh, my goodness.

00:07:42.813 --> 00:07:45.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, she was always
seeing cancer eradicate.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:46.490 align:middle line:90%
Constantly.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:47.970 align:middle line:90%
Just disappear.

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:52.490 align:middle line:84%
People who come in crippled
get up, leave their crutches,

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:53.870 align:middle line:90%
walk out.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:58.500 align:middle line:84%
People who can't breathe,
on breathing machines leave.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.190 align:middle line:84%
Never have breathing-- they're
running around the office.

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:05.120 align:middle line:90%
Back problems, doing back flips.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:09.930 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's because
she totally believed.

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:10.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She did.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.250 align:middle line:84%
She made them feel safe
to go through what ends up

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:16.920 align:middle line:84%
being an extremely
cathartic process when

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.102 align:middle line:90%
you go through regressions.

00:08:18.102 --> 00:08:19.270 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:21.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
through that, boom.

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:26.050 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the triggers were
energetically left the body.

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:26.760 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:27.530 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:33.980 align:middle line:84%
So now tell us what
your piece of that was,

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.849 align:middle line:90%
because you were a team.

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:36.890 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: We were a team.

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:40.394 align:middle line:84%
I think what I brought,
I brought structure.

00:08:40.394 --> 00:08:45.410 align:middle line:90%


00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:46.700 align:middle line:90%
I brought humor.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:47.840 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.560 align:middle line:90%


00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.415 align:middle line:90%
I kind of kept her in line.

00:08:50.415 --> 00:08:53.240 align:middle line:90%


00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.490 align:middle line:84%
I Somehow we made a
comedy duo, is all I can--

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:57.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm not really sure.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.392 align:middle line:84%
I kept feeling
like on some days,

00:08:59.392 --> 00:09:00.600 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't sure what I brought.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.730 align:middle line:84%
But somehow, we just
made a comedy duo here.

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And we just
complemented each other.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And in the
midst of all of this,

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:13.240 align:middle line:84%
you were absorbing all and
witnessing all of this.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.430 align:middle line:84%
So you absorbed a tremendous
amount of knowledge,

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.710 align:middle line:84%
and then you started
seeing patterns too.

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:20.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: I started
seeing patterns as well as

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.500 align:middle line:90%
developing my own abilities.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.190 align:middle line:84%
It was just absorbing,
and it was just

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:32.120 align:middle line:84%
a wonderful environment to grow
and be nurtured in, I guess.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:38.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the classes, the
courses and such, those go on.

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:41.000 align:middle line:90%
I mean, with or without Dolores.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.330 align:middle line:84%
Those are what is being offered
so that other people can help

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:48.400 align:middle line:84%
assist others in bringing
their subconscious

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.660 align:middle line:90%
information forward.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:51.960 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: We-- oh, shoot.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:58.200 align:middle line:84%
2002, I believe it was,
she started teaching.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.430 align:middle line:84%
She got guidance to start
teaching her method.

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:04.340 align:middle line:84%
Because she was told long
ago, there's only one of you.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And more people
need these sessions.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.380 align:middle line:84%
You can't do all the people
that need these sessions.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.140 align:middle line:90%
And so you need to teach.

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And so she started
teaching this.

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And we've been teaching
all these years.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And they've been
growing in popularity.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And then about, hm, a
year and a half ago,

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:25.120 align:middle line:84%
we got-- well, longer than
that, we got the guidance

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.230 align:middle line:90%
to start putting them online.

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:27.770 align:middle line:84%
So we started
recording the classes

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:29.350 align:middle line:84%
and we started
creating the platform,

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:32.767 align:middle line:84%
and then about a year and a half
ago, we started them online.

00:10:32.767 --> 00:10:33.350 align:middle line:90%
Anticipating--

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:35.391 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And thank God
you understand structures

00:10:35.391 --> 00:10:37.990 align:middle line:84%
so you can allow this to
actually come to fruition.

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:39.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes, absolutely.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.140 align:middle line:84%
So that's where--
because I do hear them,

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.850 align:middle line:84%
and that was my guidance
was, record these,

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:45.050 align:middle line:90%
get this in place.

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:46.040 align:middle line:90%
Do it now.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.560 align:middle line:84%
They kept going, do it
now, do it now, do it now.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.867 align:middle line:90%
Now I understand the urgency.

00:10:50.867 --> 00:10:51.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: I didn't know
then what was so urgent.

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:54.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But you listened.

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:55.420 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: I did listen.

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:55.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.614 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So amidst
all of this, I mean,

00:10:58.614 --> 00:11:00.030 align:middle line:84%
your mother has
to still be coming

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:01.580 align:middle line:90%
through to you and others.

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:03.288 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: She's coming
through to others.

00:11:03.288 --> 00:11:05.200 align:middle line:90%
I've had a few dreams.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.500 align:middle line:84%
So she's coming through
a little bit to me.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.196 align:middle line:84%
She's definitely coming
through to the practitioners.

00:11:10.196 --> 00:11:11.570 align:middle line:84%
She's coming
through in sessions.

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:12.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's
what I was going to say,

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:13.780 align:middle line:90%
because that's her thing.

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:15.705 align:middle line:84%
Mama's not going to let
go of those sessions.

00:11:15.705 --> 00:11:16.860 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Oh, no, no, no.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.110 align:middle line:90%
And it's so wonderful, though.

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:19.780 align:middle line:90%
She's coming through.

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:23.027 align:middle line:84%
People that never even met
her, never knew her before,

00:11:23.027 --> 00:11:24.860 align:middle line:84%
and she's come-- oh,
it's just so beautiful,

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.279 align:middle line:90%
the stories they're telling.

00:11:26.279 --> 00:11:28.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Give us a story or
two of her coming through.

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:30.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Oh, she's
just coming through.

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And like, maybe they're
having a hard time

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.630 align:middle line:90%
and they don't know what to do.

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:34.260 align:middle line:90%
They're just stuck.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.468 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I don't want to ask here.

00:11:35.468 --> 00:11:36.370 align:middle line:90%
The practitioner.

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:37.160 align:middle line:90%
The practitioner.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And then she's coming in to them
just energetically or whatever,

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:43.730 align:middle line:90%
and she just comes to them--

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:45.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And tells
them what to do.

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:46.688 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: --what
to do, absolutely.

00:11:46.688 --> 00:11:48.820 align:middle line:84%
Or she'll come through
the client sometimes

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.370 align:middle line:90%
and just tells them what to do.

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And they just know it by
her voice, her mannerisms.

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And we can confirm,
yes, that's her.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.050 align:middle line:90%
That's how she acts, you know?

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:57.675 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:57.675 --> 00:12:00.890 align:middle line:84%
Your mom was a very distinct in
her patterns of communication.

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And you know, that makes
sense where she said,

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:04.730 align:middle line:84%
I can do more from
the other side.

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:05.340 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:08.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because if this
regression-- and I mean,

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:12.640 align:middle line:84%
I would say it doesn't hurt
anybody to do regression work,

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.560 align:middle line:84%
whether it's just
going back a couple

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.170 align:middle line:84%
years to a traumatic
event or with your family,

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:21.750 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's to go
back into other lifetimes,

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:23.430 align:middle line:84%
other universes, as
some of what we're

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.800 align:middle line:90%
going to talk about today.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.710 align:middle line:84%
There is something about
the process of regression

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:32.349 align:middle line:84%
that seems to bring up from the
subconscious whatever it is you

00:12:32.349 --> 00:12:33.640 align:middle line:90%
need to look at in that moment.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.310 align:middle line:84%
Not necessarily
what you came for.

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:38.355 align:middle line:84%
This was a big surprise to
your mom all those years back.

00:12:38.355 --> 00:12:41.130 align:middle line:84%
People come in saying,
I need to lose weight.

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.180 align:middle line:90%
And boom, they're in Lemuria.

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:44.080 align:middle line:90%
What is Lemuria?

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.880 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.250 align:middle line:90%
Where is this place?

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:48.160 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:48.826 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Right.

00:12:48.826 --> 00:12:50.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's how it
started in the '60s.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:53.130 align:middle line:84%
That's how it all began
with her and my father.

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:55.271 align:middle line:84%
Those were the
beginning hypnotists.

00:12:55.271 --> 00:12:55.770 align:middle line:90%
It was.

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:59.790 align:middle line:84%
It was beginning with, lose
weight and maybe anxiety.

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:00.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Smoking.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:01.206 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Mm-hm.

00:13:01.206 --> 00:13:02.300 align:middle line:90%
They stopped smoking.

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:03.290 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And then spontaneously
went into a past life.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:10.000 align:middle line:84%
But that she's progressed
what the guidance has been,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.730 align:middle line:84%
it's just with the
subconscious, using

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:14.850 align:middle line:90%
that broader part of ourselves.

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:16.440 align:middle line:84%
She just called it
the subconscious

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.315 align:middle line:84%
because she didn't know
what else to call it,

00:13:18.315 --> 00:13:20.980 align:middle line:84%
but it's really our higher
self, universal consciousness,

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.250 align:middle line:84%
oversoul, whatever it is
we want to call that larger

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:24.990 align:middle line:90%
part of ourselves.

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:29.070 align:middle line:84%
It just guides us to
what we need to know.

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:29.914 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:13:29.914 --> 00:13:31.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had-- I'll
talk about it later

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.260 align:middle line:84%
when we get to that part, but
I had a regression by your mom.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.730 align:middle line:84%
I went in for one thing,
thinking it's modern history.

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up way
back in a huge event

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.350 align:middle line:90%
that was very traumatic.

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is how
it worked for most people.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.030 align:middle line:84%
But then there were
people along the way

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:52.060 align:middle line:84%
that your mom would work with,
because they were so lucid.

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:54.190 align:middle line:90%
When she realized, oh boy.

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:56.540 align:middle line:84%
This person's really
bringing stuff through.

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And she had certain
people like that.

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:01.310 align:middle line:84%
Not just random people that
were giving information.

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Well, or they had--
they went to a certain point.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:09.310 align:middle line:84%
They had-- like, someone that
was a student of Nostradamus,

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:12.280 align:middle line:84%
and that was-- well,
that was an assignment.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I remember that story.

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:15.580 align:middle line:90%
I have all those books.

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:16.090 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:18.345 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: That was a
very specific assignment.

00:14:18.345 --> 00:14:19.970 align:middle line:84%
That was very early
on in her work too.

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:22.136 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And for people
that don't know about that,

00:14:22.136 --> 00:14:24.760 align:middle line:84%
your mom was doing
her normal hypnosis.

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:27.645 align:middle line:84%
And when someone said,
there's a guy here.

00:14:27.645 --> 00:14:32.660 align:middle line:84%
He's dressed from times past
called No-- No-- No-- Notre

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:36.900 align:middle line:84%
Dame and Notre Dam and all
this, trying to figure it out.

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:39.660 align:middle line:84%
And they finally figured
out who this person was.

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And he said, they
have not adequately

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.960 align:middle line:90%
interpreted the quatrains.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.800 align:middle line:84%
I left behind, so
you're doing it.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Yes I have
an assignment for you.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:50.290 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:50.915 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:50.915 --> 00:14:51.560 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was
absolutely fascinating.

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:57.680 align:middle line:84%
Very interesting reading
those quatrains as well.

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.582 align:middle line:84%
Well, speaking of which, have
you read those recently at all?

00:15:00.582 --> 00:15:01.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Not recently.

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, so I'm
not going to question you

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.670 align:middle line:84%
on that, because there
are a couple things

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:07.020 align:middle line:84%
kind of surrounding
this period of time.

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:07.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Right.

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:11.830 align:middle line:84%
The biggest thing about that,
she-- and I will address that.

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:18.160 align:middle line:84%
She kind of-- what it looks
like is it looks like,

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.110 align:middle line:84%
and what I got
etherically in a vision,

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:23.780 align:middle line:84%
is that we went on a
different timeline.

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.940 align:middle line:84%
So we actually did
change the course.

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:28.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You need to
say more about that.

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:29.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: OK.

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:30.800 align:middle line:90%
Because that's what they said.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:31.633 align:middle line:90%
That's what he said.

00:15:31.633 --> 00:15:34.320 align:middle line:84%
If I show you the worst
thing that can happen,

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.910 align:middle line:84%
the worst thing that
man can do, will you

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:38.590 align:middle line:90%
do something to change it?

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:41.340 align:middle line:84%
That was all he was
trying to accomplish.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:45.660 align:middle line:84%
That was why he
wanted her to do this.

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:50.330 align:middle line:84%
And by showing, then
we changed the course.

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:51.289 align:middle line:90%
Mission accomplished.

00:15:51.289 --> 00:15:51.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:54.060 align:middle line:84%
So now when did you
get that confirmation

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:56.655 align:middle line:90%
that the course was changed?

00:15:56.655 --> 00:15:57.196 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Hm.

00:15:57.196 --> 00:15:58.459 align:middle line:90%
About five years ago.

00:15:58.459 --> 00:15:59.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:15:59.666 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Mm-hm.

00:15:59.666 --> 00:16:00.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.940 align:middle line:90%
Now that's fascinating.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:03.970 align:middle line:90%
And you know what's interesting?

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:07.570 align:middle line:84%
The beings that I deal with and
have for 30 years, my guides,

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:12.660 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, had told us once
upon a time, quite a long time

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:16.490 align:middle line:84%
back, I was asking about the
Earth changes and Edgar Cayce's

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:17.650 align:middle line:90%
prophecies.

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:23.040 align:middle line:84%
And they said what Cayce said,
some of this will come to pass.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.420 align:middle line:84%
But some of it will
not come to pass.

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:27.140 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, what changes?

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And they said, as
the consciousness

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.120 align:middle line:84%
of the people on the
planet begins growing,

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.410 align:middle line:84%
it will change what
happens, trying to explain.

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:37.940 align:middle line:84%
You're emotionally
interwoven with the earth,

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:41.080 align:middle line:84%
even though we didn't understand
what that meant 30 years ago.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And they said, as you
change consciousness

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:49.510 align:middle line:84%
and massive numbers of people
do, especially in pockets,

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:51.510 align:middle line:90%
those events will be changed.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:52.454 align:middle line:90%
So-- exactly.

00:16:52.454 --> 00:16:54.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: And I just got
all the confirmation chills

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:55.420 align:middle line:90%
all over my body.

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:56.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.010 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:01.100 align:middle line:90%
So when-- what do you perceive?

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:02.770 align:middle line:84%
What did you perceive
when you heard

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:06.630 align:middle line:84%
that in terms of which events
might-- what kind of events

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:08.170 align:middle line:90%
might be avoided now?

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:09.589 align:middle line:84%
I know you can't
be too specific,

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:10.829 align:middle line:90%
because we don't know for sure.

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:11.495 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Right.

00:17:11.495 --> 00:17:14.569 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's like the major world
wars, the major-- just like,

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:16.140 align:middle line:90%
we'll have the smaller wars.

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.560 align:middle line:90%
It was-- but those major--

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.104 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Those catastrophic,
globally catastrophic events.

00:17:20.104 --> 00:17:20.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Right.

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:22.670 align:middle line:90%
Those were all being avoided.

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:25.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about things
having to do natural cataclysms

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:26.040 align:middle line:90%
and such.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Well,
those-- what I still

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:33.112 align:middle line:84%
see is those are
related to our emotions.

00:17:33.112 --> 00:17:33.820 align:middle line:90%
And as we start--

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like those
other beings said.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:35.600 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.880 align:middle line:84%
As we start realizing
that we are tied to them,

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:42.670 align:middle line:84%
see, then we will
start affecting them.

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:43.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:46.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, and that's the new work
part math and Howard Martin.

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:47.576 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:47.576 --> 00:17:48.950 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: So that
is so exciting.

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:49.489 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:17:49.489 --> 00:17:50.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's very exciting.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:54.780 align:middle line:84%
If we can go into
a state of peace,

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:57.520 align:middle line:84%
you know, all the finer
things, just a little peace

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:02.530 align:middle line:84%
and compassion, that then
resonates with the earth's

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:04.165 align:middle line:90%
own emotional field.

00:18:04.165 --> 00:18:05.816 align:middle line:90%
That very delicate matrix.

00:18:05.816 --> 00:18:06.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Absolutely.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And see, that's all part of
the shift of consciousness.

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:10.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, anyway, I'm glad I
did ask that spontaneously.

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:16.692 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for sharing
that, because I didn't-- I

00:18:16.692 --> 00:18:18.150 align:middle line:84%
haven't seen your
mom in the last--

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:20.860 align:middle line:84%
it's probably been five years,
so I didn't know you'd gotten

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:22.130 align:middle line:90%
that confirmation.

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:22.630 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:23.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:28.295 align:middle line:84%
So now let's talk about
some of what she left you.

00:18:28.295 --> 00:18:32.010 align:middle line:84%
What was happening
when your mom left,

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.360 align:middle line:84%
you had a pile
there to deal with.

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.610 align:middle line:84%
What did she leave you
with, and what did you

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:37.960 align:middle line:90%
start prioritizing?

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:41.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Well, she had
this book, "The Search

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:42.550 align:middle line:90%
for Hidden, Sacred Knowledge."

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:44.520 align:middle line:90%
That book was pretty much done.

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.045 align:middle line:90%
She was almost finished with it.

00:18:46.045 --> 00:18:46.920 align:middle line:90%
And she was like, OK.

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.420 align:middle line:84%
That book-- she was, like,
on the final read-through.

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.330 align:middle line:84%
She was pretty
much done with it.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:53.930 align:middle line:84%
It's like, OK So
we'll finish it.

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:55.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Makes sense.

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.635 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Let's just
go ahead and do it.

00:18:57.635 --> 00:19:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And then she had "The
Convoluted Universe Book V."

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:03.620 align:middle line:84%
She was working on those two
pretty much at the same time,

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:05.370 align:middle line:84%
so that one was,
like, right behind it.

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And so then-- I'm
working on that one now.

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:10.160 align:middle line:90%
It'll be out probably by summer.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So does
that particular one

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.500 align:middle line:90%
have any kind of theme to it?

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:21.250 align:middle line:84%
The closest I can come to
it, because it's-- and that's

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:23.282 align:middle line:90%
what-- this woman--

00:19:23.282 --> 00:19:25.024 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:25.024 --> 00:19:25.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Your mother.

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:28.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Oh, yes.

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:35.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, she's-- I'm really
learning to have a whole

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:43.890 align:middle line:90%
different respect for her.

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:46.350 align:middle line:84%
One, in how she put
her material together.

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:48.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she was
definitely a master.

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.970 align:middle line:84%
She was a master in so
many things I did know.

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And I knew how she
wrote her books,

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:57.250 align:middle line:84%
and I helped her write--
put them together.

00:19:57.250 --> 00:20:00.380 align:middle line:84%
But even this part, I mean,
it's-- I see where it is,

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:02.546 align:middle line:90%
but then where it is.

00:20:02.546 --> 00:20:05.280 align:middle line:90%
It's like, even how she did it.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm still going,
how did you do it?

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:08.135 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:20:08.135 --> 00:20:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you need
to hook up with her.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:10.300 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Exactly.

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Get someone
to hook up with her.

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:12.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Exactly.

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:13.580 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to do that.

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.000 align:middle line:90%
And I'm still talking to her.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.940 align:middle line:90%
So yes.

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:20.870 align:middle line:84%
To get the theme, because
one thing I'm seeing for sure

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:22.200 align:middle line:90%
is the energy.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.010 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with
expanded energy.

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:25.020 align:middle line:90%
I can see that.

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:27.300 align:middle line:84%
So there's something--
and that makes sense.

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:30.650 align:middle line:84%
Because if you look at "The
Convoluted Universe" series,

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:35.129 align:middle line:84%
it's like each one, they're all
about mind bending concepts.

00:20:35.129 --> 00:20:37.170 align:middle line:84%
Each one is a little bit
more, a little bit more,

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:37.920 align:middle line:90%
a little bit more.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:40.665 align:middle line:84%
OK, we want to bend the
mind a little bit more.

00:20:40.665 --> 00:20:44.700 align:middle line:84%
A little bit more on the
metaphysical concepts.

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:46.620 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And then also, about
showing us a little bit more

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:52.080 align:middle line:90%
about who we are.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:55.494 align:middle line:84%
So that's what it's
moving towards.

00:20:55.494 --> 00:20:56.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's good.

00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:57.409 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: It's like, OK.

00:20:57.409 --> 00:20:59.659 align:middle line:90%
We're just a little bit bigger--

00:20:59.659 --> 00:21:00.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Than we think we are.

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:01.700 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Exactly.

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:04.480 align:middle line:84%
Each one keeps showing a
little bit more of who we are.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.269 align:middle line:84%
So that's-- I'll
give you that peak.

00:21:06.269 --> 00:21:06.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:07.110 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:07.660 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.130 align:middle line:84%
Now the book we're
talking about today

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:12.380 align:middle line:84%
is the last one
she was working on.

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:14.050 align:middle line:90%
And let's go into that.

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's a series
of regressions that

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:21.170 align:middle line:84%
are really dedicated to bringing
forward people's regression

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:24.230 align:middle line:90%
experiences of hidden knowledge.

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:28.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And--
which is interesting.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:33.360 align:middle line:84%
Because as I read it, I saw also
some themes popping up in it.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And so, why don't we start
out-- the first of them was--

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:40.317 align:middle line:90%
and you can tell me-- your mom.

00:21:40.317 --> 00:21:41.900 align:middle line:84%
OK, so one thing
your mom talked about

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:43.300 align:middle line:84%
is the world's
sacred structures.

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:46.970 align:middle line:84%
Because these structures
are featured in this book.

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And she learned, over the
course of these thousands

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:53.910 align:middle line:84%
and thousands of
regressions, that there was

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:55.680 align:middle line:90%
help building these structures.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.720 align:middle line:84%
This was not-- this was
nothing by primitive people.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.345 align:middle line:84%
Our audience is totally
on board with that

00:22:01.345 --> 00:22:07.260 align:middle line:84%
and understands whether it
was master beings at depths

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:10.600 align:middle line:84%
of some kind that were here
and embodied physically

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:13.710 align:middle line:84%
and taught the human species
how to use certain technologies,

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:16.700 align:middle line:84%
or whether they did them
with their own, themselves.

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:18.090 align:middle line:90%
We won't argue that point.

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:20.904 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because we still--
that's still being revealed.

00:22:20.904 --> 00:22:21.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Right.

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But there were
a lot of people on Earth

00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:27.630 align:middle line:84%
who knew of, were aware
of, who witnessed,

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:31.530 align:middle line:84%
who worked alongside, and
who were those beings.

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:33.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Right.

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:35.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so in the
beginning of the book,

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.770 align:middle line:90%
one thing that came up-- Isis.

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:40.070 align:middle line:90%
The theme of Isis in general.

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:42.130 align:middle line:84%
It kind of came up
repeatedly through the book

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:45.610 align:middle line:84%
about this being an
embodied person, not

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:48.220 align:middle line:90%
a mythological character.

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.160 align:middle line:84%
Just share a little
bit about that.

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Well, and
in general, what

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:56.800 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing are
gods and goddesses,

00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:01.350 align:middle line:84%
in general, were beings
from other planets.

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:02.730 align:middle line:90%
They are from the stars.

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And they are beings that were
here to-- they came here,

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:16.380 align:middle line:84%
and then they were here to teach
the humans how to learn to be.

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:16.880 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And then they were treated
as gods and goddesses

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:21.610 align:middle line:84%
just because they were
not from this plane.

00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And so she is-- Isis would've
been just another one of them.

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:28.070 align:middle line:84%
But she is featured
heavily in this book.

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:30.120 align:middle line:90%
Probably the time element.

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:31.460 align:middle line:90%
But-- or maybe just--

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:34.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I wonder about that
too, about why that message,

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:36.720 align:middle line:90%
why Isis now?

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.350 align:middle line:90%
Why is that theme emerging?

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:41.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Well, in the
story that was brought up

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:43.320 align:middle line:84%
is that she was
now, and then she's

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.459 align:middle line:84%
coming back, as they
said, in the end times.

00:23:45.459 --> 00:23:47.625 align:middle line:84%
But it's also-- and then
they describe the end times

00:23:47.625 --> 00:23:48.140 align:middle line:90%
as being--

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:49.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
explain the end times.

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:50.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Well, they
said the end times--

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.370 align:middle line:84%
not being that it
was the end of times,

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:54.960 align:middle line:84%
but it was the change
of consciousness again.

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:58.530 align:middle line:84%
So that being the end
of that way of thinking.

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:01.890 align:middle line:84%
So I like that that is the
way that they're described.

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:04.970 align:middle line:84%
Because that's another theme
that was in Nostradamus.

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Again, they kept talking about
the end times, the end times.

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And that was always an issue I
had with the Nostradamus books.

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:13.510 align:middle line:90%
It was, "the end times."

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:16.604 align:middle line:90%
I didn't like that negativity.

00:24:16.604 --> 00:24:18.270 align:middle line:84%
But when you read the
Nostradamus books,

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:19.634 align:middle line:90%
they're actually books of hope.

00:24:19.634 --> 00:24:20.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:24.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: And so I had
never seen this description

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:25.890 align:middle line:90%
of the end times.

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:26.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:30.125 align:middle line:84%
And associated with Isis, what
is that end time scenario like?

00:24:30.125 --> 00:24:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Well, that's
what they were saying.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.980 align:middle line:90%
I mean, she's the sun goddess.

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And then here it's
the end-- I mean,

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:36.970 align:middle line:90%
it's a change of consciousness.

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:39.090 align:middle line:84%
So here it's like
the representation

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:41.200 align:middle line:90%
of new consciousness.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So were they saying
that Isis would be coming back

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:45.130 align:middle line:90%
in physical form?

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:46.095 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: That's
what it's implying.

00:24:46.095 --> 00:24:46.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: As a human being?

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:47.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: As a human being, yes.

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
it looked like when

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:50.031 align:middle line:90%
I was reading it as well.

00:24:50.031 --> 00:24:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And again, we have to
remember that when people

00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:57.460 align:middle line:84%
are in regression, it's
not like you become

00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:59.960 align:middle line:90%
brilliant or a superhero.

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:03.460 align:middle line:84%
You know only what
you knew in that day.

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:06.560 align:middle line:84%
And there can be confusion,
as I'll explain later on.

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:07.750 align:middle line:90%
There can be confusion.

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:09.920 align:middle line:84%
You may have misunderstandings
at that time.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.250 align:middle line:90%
You pass it on.

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:12.210 align:middle line:90%
It's not gospel.

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:14.766 align:middle line:84%
It's your perception of what
was going on in the time.

00:25:14.766 --> 00:25:15.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Absolutely.

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.056 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think that's
where the strength in numbers

00:25:18.056 --> 00:25:20.590 align:middle line:84%
comes in, because she
did so many of them,

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:22.220 align:middle line:84%
you start hearing
these same themes.

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:25.370 align:middle line:84%
Like, about Isis, that
Isis-- and the way

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:30.400 align:middle line:84%
they described the awe people
felt for Isis when they could

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.470 align:middle line:90%
have a glimpse of her even.

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:39.395 align:middle line:84%
That this was a very beautiful,
very powerful, regal being.

00:25:39.395 --> 00:25:41.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: I thought
it was interesting.

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:43.730 align:middle line:10%
They said that people would
come from all over the galaxies

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:45.097 align:middle line:10%
to come and learn from her.

00:25:45.097 --> 00:25:45.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:49.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: And-- but if they
were not of the right frequency,

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:51.762 align:middle line:84%
that all they would
see was a statute.

00:25:51.762 --> 00:25:52.345 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:52.345 --> 00:25:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Isn't
that interesting?

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:54.364 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is
so fascinating.

00:25:54.364 --> 00:25:55.300 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:58.770 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about with
eyes to see in that.

00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:01.795 align:middle line:84%
Because it had to do
also with dwellings.

00:26:01.795 --> 00:26:04.390 align:middle line:90%


00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:05.027 align:middle line:90%
Temples.

00:26:05.027 --> 00:26:05.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:07.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So talk
about what was revealed

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.090 align:middle line:84%
during these cha--
not channelings,

00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:11.620 align:middle line:90%
but during these regressions.

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:15.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Well, I mean,
that's happening all the time,

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:15.980 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:17.700 align:middle line:90%
That even is happening now.

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:21.060 align:middle line:84%
They say that will
happen within, like,

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:23.600 align:middle line:84%
pyramids and things
like that all the time.

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:26.797 align:middle line:84%
If you are of the
right-- I keep wishing

00:26:26.797 --> 00:26:29.130 align:middle line:84%
I could go into a pyramid and
be of the right frequency,

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:30.880 align:middle line:84%
and then everything
will start opening up.

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.010 align:middle line:84%
Because they say that's
what will actually happen.

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:33.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:35.752 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: That's what they're
looking for, is the right--

00:26:35.752 --> 00:26:37.790 align:middle line:84%
the Sphinx will open, and
everything will happen

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:38.110 align:middle line:90%
if you're the right--

00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:40.026 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's supposed
to happen supposedly

00:26:40.026 --> 00:26:42.650 align:middle line:84%
in our lifetime that
underneath one of the paws

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:44.940 align:middle line:84%
will be revealed
the contents, which

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:46.650 align:middle line:90%
affects our future greatly.

00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:49.480 align:middle line:90%
But it hasn't been released yet.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if it's because
we don't have eyes to see yet.

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:52.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Right.

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:52.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:55.370 align:middle line:84%
It's when we have--
when we're ready.

00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:56.020 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:59.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so it wasn't
just that Isis was a statue.

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:02.020 align:middle line:84%
It's that they wouldn't
even see a temple that they

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:03.440 align:middle line:90%
had made a pilgrimage to.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: There
wasn't anything there.

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:05.090 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:06.680 align:middle line:84%
It was just-- there
was nothing there.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:08.960 align:middle line:84%
It was just-- there were no
ho-- it was just nothing.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.320 align:middle line:84%
They did not have
the eyes to see it.

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:10.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It would be ruin.

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:11.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Exactly.

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:14.211 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like, just
literally a ruin of some kind.

00:27:14.211 --> 00:27:14.960 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Exactly.

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:15.793 align:middle line:90%
The same as we goes.

00:27:15.793 --> 00:27:18.500 align:middle line:84%
It's probably exactly what
we see when we go see ruins.

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:21.010 align:middle line:84%
There's probably actually
a beautiful city there.

00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:21.930 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:22.975 align:middle line:90%
And we see nothing.

00:27:22.975 --> 00:27:23.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.270 align:middle line:84%
That's both depressing
and awe inspiring.

00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:25.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Exactly.

00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:26.350 align:middle line:90%
You're like, ah.

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:27.330 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:27.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:31.240 align:middle line:84%
In the work of James
the Wing Maker-- I

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:35.290 align:middle line:84%
did a brief-- a radio
interview a while back

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:37.210 align:middle line:84%
with his right
hand person, Mark.

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And in the stories he writes,
which are thinly disguised

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:45.840 align:middle line:84%
fiction, they talk
about how places

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:51.070 align:middle line:84%
around the planet, including
modern structures, that

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:54.370 align:middle line:84%
for whatever reason,
whoever occupies them do not

00:27:54.370 --> 00:27:57.320 align:middle line:84%
want these to be seen, are
using modern day cloaking

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:58.030 align:middle line:90%
technologies.

00:27:58.030 --> 00:28:02.050 align:middle line:84%
Actual technology that can cloak
the appearance of facilities,

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:04.810 align:middle line:84%
for example, to look like
it just kind of blends

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:06.400 align:middle line:90%
in with the mountain side.

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I recently
interviewed Jerry Wills.

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And he went through this
experience as a child.

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:16.560 align:middle line:84%
They'd go through the
swamp lands in Florida,

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:19.340 align:middle line:84%
and come up to what would
just look like more trees.

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And then it's like
this thing parted,

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.680 align:middle line:84%
and there was a whole room
in there he'd go behind.

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:27.980 align:middle line:84%
So this is something that's
being validated throughout.

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:30.580 align:middle line:90%
So Isis was there for those.

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And what was the nature-- what
were they gaining from her

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:35.070 align:middle line:90%
if they had access to her?

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:37.195 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Well, it would
have been these teachings.

00:28:37.195 --> 00:28:39.930 align:middle line:90%
It was just-- it was the--

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:41.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The great
cosmic teachings,

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:44.090 align:middle line:84%
depending on what any
individual needed to learn.

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:45.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Right.

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.300 align:middle line:90%
Just-- yeah.

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And they said they came here
it was the beauty and the love

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:52.140 align:middle line:90%
and the teachings from here.

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:54.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what was it-- now
another thing that would come

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:56.466 align:middle line:90%
up was the notion of earth.

00:28:56.466 --> 00:28:57.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:58.908 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about that, and what

00:28:58.908 --> 00:29:00.910 align:middle line:84%
she discovered through
the years about Earth,

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:03.350 align:middle line:90%
the uniqueness of Earth.

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Earth was
always very unique.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.680 align:middle line:90%
It was this beautiful planet.

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:09.814 align:middle line:84%
It originally was
the vacation planet

00:29:09.814 --> 00:29:10.980 align:middle line:90%
because it was so beautiful.

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And beings came
here to vacation.

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And then they
started coming here,

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:18.246 align:middle line:90%
and then kind of got stuck here.

00:29:18.246 --> 00:29:19.796 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:29:19.796 --> 00:29:20.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:22.600 align:middle line:84%
That's a story I'm
very interested

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:24.940 align:middle line:84%
in, and in my own
way involved with.

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And they all-- all the stories
merge at this one point.

00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:34.080 align:middle line:84%
Initially, benign experience
was happening here.

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.660 align:middle line:90%
Edgar Cayce, same thing.

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:40.340 align:middle line:84%
Benign experience for pleasure,
for enjoyment, for curiosity.

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:42.560 align:middle line:84%
Scientific discovery
was occurring.

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And then came a period where
some kind of density process

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:50.770 align:middle line:84%
occurred, and the beings started
finding they really weren't

00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:52.100 align:middle line:90%
able to traverse out of here.

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:53.160 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Right.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's what
emerged out of her work

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:55.279 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:29:55.279 --> 00:29:56.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now some of the
people that come through--

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:01.190 align:middle line:84%
and I have many
different people here.

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:03.580 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's talk about Rachel.

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:07.270 align:middle line:84%
She had a very wealthy,
very powerful existence.

00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's under the chapter
"They Thought We Were Gods."

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.516 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about her
and others like her.

00:30:13.516 --> 00:30:14.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Right,
others like her.

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:16.723 align:middle line:84%
That's where they were
coming from a lineage

00:30:16.723 --> 00:30:17.860 align:middle line:90%
of-- they were hybrids.

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:20.230 align:middle line:84%
They're coming from a lineage
of actually bloodlines

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:22.940 align:middle line:90%
from the aliens, from the ETs.

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And the reason they
thought they were gods

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:30.970 align:middle line:84%
is because they came-- they were
able to leave the Earth plane.

00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:34.665 align:middle line:84%
And they really
weren't, like, it wasn't

00:30:34.665 --> 00:30:35.915 align:middle line:90%
that they were that different.

00:30:35.915 --> 00:30:38.297 align:middle line:84%
It was just because they
could leave the Earth plane.

00:30:38.297 --> 00:30:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They still had
certain abilities intact.

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:41.046 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Mm-hm.

00:30:41.046 --> 00:30:41.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:42.980 align:middle line:90%
Some.

00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:44.970 align:middle line:84%
But it was being
diluted out as they kept

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:47.890 align:middle line:90%
interbreeding with the humans.

00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it was
interesting, in her case,

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:54.050 align:middle line:84%
her ability was she could
tell when people were lying.

00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:56.320 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, you know--

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:57.186 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:30:57.186 --> 00:30:58.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that's a useful--

00:30:58.560 --> 00:30:59.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: It's very useful.

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:01.620 align:middle line:90%
And many of us have that.

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:03.960 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you know,
we have that now,

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:05.600 align:middle line:84%
and when we don't
think a lot of it.

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:09.117 align:middle line:84%
But it's like, that's-- so many
of these things, we think, oh,

00:31:09.117 --> 00:31:09.950 align:middle line:90%
if we only had that.

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:11.300 align:middle line:90%
We have those.

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:13.447 align:middle line:90%
We have those abilities now.

00:31:13.447 --> 00:31:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we
don't listen to them.

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:16.880 align:middle line:84%
We allow other
third party things

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:19.120 align:middle line:90%
to tell us what's correct.

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:20.070 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hm.

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And so that was hers
where she had the ability

00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:27.000 align:middle line:84%
to just look at a person and
see lie, lie, truth, lie.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:27.500 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And she-- but she-- there was
a certain kind of wonderment

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:36.100 align:middle line:84%
that people thought she
was a god of some kind.

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And this wasn't uncommon
for some of them.

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And would you say-- what would
you say were the instances?

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:47.140 align:middle line:84%
Was it a relatively
common instance

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:50.250 align:middle line:84%
for people to say they
were hybrid beings?

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:51.534 align:middle line:90%
They had been hybrid beings?

00:31:51.534 --> 00:31:52.700 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: In these sessions?

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:53.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.270 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Fairly common.

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:59.860 align:middle line:84%
Not very common,
but fairly common.

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:01.180 align:middle line:90%
It would go back and forth.

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:04.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I would say
more common lately.

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.930 align:middle line:84%
Earlier, most of
the sessions were

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:10.790 align:middle line:84%
what mom would describe as
the digging potatoes lives.

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:15.650 align:middle line:84%
You know, the normal, regular
past lives and everything.

00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:17.880 align:middle line:84%
Because that's
what people needed.

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:21.420 align:middle line:84%
They needed to go back, and
they would get one little piece

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:22.230 align:middle line:90%
of information.

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:24.820 align:middle line:84%
That's what they
needed to understand.

00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:27.970 align:middle line:84%
But more recently--
and not saying

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:32.020 align:middle line:84%
that that's where everybody's
coming from or what's going on.

00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:35.810 align:middle line:84%
I think this is where
the information lies now

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:38.640 align:middle line:90%
for everybody.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:43.300 align:middle line:84%
I think this is just who we are
and where it's coming from now.

00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And it might be that-- you know,
this is where humans come from.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.930 align:middle line:84%
So why not that be
our information?

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:51.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:52.280 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: It's just--
now it's time for us

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:55.095 align:middle line:90%
to know our lineage.

00:32:55.095 --> 00:32:56.075 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:56.075 --> 00:33:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And in that lineage, there's
another component to this.

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And you said at the
time, you didn't really

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:05.350 align:middle line:84%
understand what they
were talking about.

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
instance of people

00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:10.190 align:middle line:84%
who are perceived
more machine-like

00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:14.680 align:middle line:84%
without a normal sense
of emo-- or emotions,

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:17.060 align:middle line:90%
maybe without conscience.

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:17.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Right.

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you
talk a little bit--

00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:20.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Well, or
like-- or of a soul.

00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And see, that was like--
that I have a problem with.

00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:30.390 align:middle line:84%
I just don't-- I don't know
how to process that yet,

00:33:30.390 --> 00:33:32.919 align:middle line:84%
when they say they
don't have a soul.

00:33:32.919 --> 00:33:34.460 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to
process that yet.

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:35.876 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
one perception

00:33:35.876 --> 00:33:40.000 align:middle line:84%
of that kind of being,
often as it was described.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.860 align:middle line:90%
These are people.

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:43.610 align:middle line:84%
They're people, or
look like people

00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:46.770 align:middle line:84%
anyway, that don't necessarily
have much happening

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:47.300 align:middle line:90%
in the eyes.

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:48.245 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Right.

00:33:48.245 --> 00:33:49.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you
expand on that?

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:49.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Right.

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.011 align:middle line:90%
Well, just that they're-- yeah.

00:33:51.011 --> 00:33:52.370 align:middle line:90%
Just that they're very dark.

00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:54.150 align:middle line:84%
They're just very--
they said, that's

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:55.890 align:middle line:84%
how you can tell that they
were the machine people.

00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:57.556 align:middle line:84%
They were just like--
they're very dead.

00:33:57.556 --> 00:33:58.950 align:middle line:90%
There's just no soul.

00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:59.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And yet at the same time, they
had technological information,

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:06.670 align:middle line:84%
advanced information
technologically.

00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:10.124 align:middle line:84%
And so how were they interfacing
with people of that day?

00:34:10.124 --> 00:34:10.999 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: They were--

00:34:10.999 --> 00:34:14.215 align:middle line:90%


00:34:14.215 --> 00:34:16.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because there
was fear around them.

00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:18.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: A lot of fear,
but I think it was basically

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:19.260 align:middle line:90%
from that perception.

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:23.150 align:middle line:84%
Because even now, if we
were to meet people that--

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't appear to
have empathy or compassion

00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:26.454 align:middle line:90%
and no light happening.

00:34:26.454 --> 00:34:27.120 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Right.

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Because that's how we
relate on emotions.

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And so if we come
up with someone

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:32.854 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't have
emotions, we're

00:34:32.854 --> 00:34:34.159 align:middle line:90%
going to be afraid of them.

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:38.250 align:middle line:84%
So that would be-- there'd
be a lot of fear around them.

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:43.170 align:middle line:84%
But I believe they were
here to learn how to relate.

00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:45.380 align:middle line:84%
That was what they
were here for.

00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:48.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They wanted to
have the human experience.

00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:50.190 align:middle line:90%
Another one was this one.

00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:50.690 align:middle line:90%
Oh, this.

00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:51.250 align:middle line:90%
I love this.

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And I want to go to-- this was
about the right and left side

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:56.260 align:middle line:90%
of the body.

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:58.880 align:middle line:84%
Because that sent the
phenomena we can all relate to.

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And then go to-- then
I'd like to move on

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:04.540 align:middle line:84%
to the story of those
who were healers of old,

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:06.310 align:middle line:90%
and this is a big topic.

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:06.810 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:11.220 align:middle line:84%
So she said, common denominators
among hypnotized beings

00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:14.000 align:middle line:84%
is that things that happen on
the right side of the body,

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.180 align:middle line:90%
that was the present.

00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:16.880 align:middle line:90%
The left side was the past.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:18.480 align:middle line:84%
So tell me your
experience of this.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:21.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: And that's how
you deal with anything.

00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:24.840 align:middle line:84%
You're aches and pains and
illnesses, anything like that.

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:27.230 align:middle line:84%
That's how you know
where it's coming from.

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:29.075 align:middle line:84%
That's one way of
it telling you.

00:35:29.075 --> 00:35:30.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And was that
consistent throughout?

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:31.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Absolutely.

00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:32.200 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:35.580 align:middle line:84%
If it's on the right side of
the body, it means it's now.

00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:38.060 align:middle line:84%
It's something that's
going on in your life now.

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:39.560 align:middle line:84%
Left side of the
body, it means it's

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:43.310 align:middle line:84%
from the past, the childhood
or from another life.

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:45.247 align:middle line:90%
So that gives you an idea.

00:35:45.247 --> 00:35:46.955 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's very
useful information.

00:35:46.955 --> 00:35:47.660 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Very useful.

00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To see, gah, why does
all this stuff keep happening

00:35:49.570 --> 00:35:51.240 align:middle line:90%
to my left side, for example?

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:51.740 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:52.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Absolutely.

00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:56.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so there she
would start digging around.

00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And once they were to
the point they needed

00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:01.910 align:middle line:84%
to be in the regression,
say, if it came from the past

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:03.710 align:middle line:84%
or whatnot, once
that was addressed

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:06.590 align:middle line:84%
and felt and released, they
would experience relief

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:07.335 align:middle line:90%
from symptoms.

00:36:07.335 --> 00:36:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And as you said
in the beginning,

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:10.140 align:middle line:90%
this was happening all the time.

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:11.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: All the time.

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:12.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And so on the right
side, that means just

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:18.020 align:middle line:84%
analyze what's going on
in our lives right now,

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:20.090 align:middle line:84%
what might be bothering
us that we haven't really

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:21.132 align:middle line:90%
taken time to look at it?

00:36:21.132 --> 00:36:21.798 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Right.

00:36:21.798 --> 00:36:22.420 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:23.591 align:middle line:90%
It's just saying, hey.

00:36:23.591 --> 00:36:24.090 align:middle line:90%
Look at me.

00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:25.006 align:middle line:90%
Hello?

00:36:25.006 --> 00:36:26.380 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:27.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm right here.

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:28.330 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's-- yes.

00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:31.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what did she
find throughout these thousands

00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:34.470 align:middle line:84%
of regressions when it
comes to pain and suffering

00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:36.350 align:middle line:90%
in the human body?

00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:38.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Well, those
are just messages.

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:40.440 align:middle line:84%
They're just
messages saying, this

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:43.820 align:middle line:84%
is one way that the body can
communicate to you, messages

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:49.120 align:middle line:84%
from your higher self,
from your oversoul that--

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:51.400 align:middle line:90%
to pay attention.

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:52.742 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:52.742 --> 00:36:54.950 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: That this is
something to pay attention to,

00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:56.250 align:middle line:90%
that you can fix.

00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:58.665 align:middle line:84%
It's just something
that you need to do.

00:36:58.665 --> 00:36:59.452 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:36:59.452 --> 00:37:00.910 align:middle line:84%
So because so many
of the times, we

00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:02.690 align:middle line:90%
don't listen to them directly.

00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:04.639 align:middle line:90%
You can, but we don't.

00:37:04.639 --> 00:37:05.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:06.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: So the
body is-- to me,

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:08.644 align:middle line:90%
it's the path of last resort.

00:37:08.644 --> 00:37:11.060 align:middle line:84%
Because there's so many other
ways we can get the message.

00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:13.101 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: More subtle
before it becomes physical.

00:37:13.101 --> 00:37:14.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Exactly.

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:16.050 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because we
can get messages.

00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:17.860 align:middle line:90%
We get signs all the time.

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:19.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they can
talk to us directly.

00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:22.360 align:middle line:84%
We can get-- somebody
can walk up to us

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:23.360 align:middle line:90%
and say something to us.

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.151 align:middle line:90%
That's another way.

00:37:24.151 --> 00:37:26.369 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's amazing the
way-- the myriad of ways

00:37:26.369 --> 00:37:27.910 align:middle line:84%
that the universe
can speak with you.

00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:28.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Absolutely.

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:31.180 align:middle line:84%
So to me, the body-- I mean,
that's just one more way.

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:32.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's when you
haven't been listening.

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:33.379 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Exactly.

00:37:33.379 --> 00:37:35.380 align:middle line:84%
So that to me is
the last resort.

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:36.860 align:middle line:90%
So that's just one more way.

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:38.060 align:middle line:90%
That's the last way.

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:40.070 align:middle line:90%
And then that's just what it is.

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:43.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how-- let's talk
about the instance of cancer.

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:45.840 align:middle line:84%
Because that's, like,
really getting toward the,

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:49.370 align:middle line:84%
we've been trying to get
your attention for a long.

00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And so, let's talk
about just in general,

00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:54.630 align:middle line:84%
what was some of the
phenomena around cancer

00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:56.130 align:middle line:90%
that came up repeatedly?

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:58.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Cancer is anger.

00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:02.030 align:middle line:84%
It's suppressed anger,
anger that has been going on

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:03.230 align:middle line:90%
for a very long time.

00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
came out through--

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:05.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Repeatedly.

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --virtually
everyone that--

00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:38:06.850 --> 00:38:07.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:07.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:09.033 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: It's suppressed anger.

00:38:09.033 --> 00:38:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And where it is in
the body tells you

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:13.229 align:middle line:90%
what they're angry about.

00:38:13.229 --> 00:38:13.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm.

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:14.311 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: OK.

00:38:14.311 --> 00:38:18.030 align:middle line:84%
So the body part is telling
you what it's all about.

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:20.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, for
example, would you

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:24.110 align:middle line:84%
go to, like, Louise Hay's
original work or something

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:26.190 align:middle line:84%
to find out, what's this
part of the body mean?

00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:27.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Or you'd
go to my books.

00:38:27.370 --> 00:38:29.000 align:middle line:84%
So I'll speak the
language of your body.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:29.481 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:29.481 --> 00:38:30.897 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or you
go to your books.

00:38:30.897 --> 00:38:31.890 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:32.914 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:38:32.914 --> 00:38:33.955 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: You're welcome.

00:38:33.955 --> 00:38:36.110 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:38.595 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then find
out which part of your body

00:38:38.595 --> 00:38:40.670 align:middle line:84%
is trying to tell you
what kind of message

00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:42.750 align:middle line:90%
about anger in your life.

00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:43.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:45.710 align:middle line:84%
Because the body parts,
they're very literal.

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:49.705 align:middle line:84%
It is so beautiful
how it uses the body.

00:38:49.705 --> 00:38:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And those body parts
are very literal in how

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:54.330 align:middle line:90%
they communicate.

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:57.520 align:middle line:84%
You know, the breasts
are about nurturing.

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:00.840 align:middle line:90%
The cervix is about creation.

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:03.970 align:middle line:84%
Those are common parts
that the cancer goes to.

00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:06.150 align:middle line:90%
The gut is about emotions.

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:09.720 align:middle line:84%
That's where we
hold our emotions.

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:11.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm just thinking
as far as cancer.

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:12.430 align:middle line:90%
The throat.

00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:13.800 align:middle line:90%
We speak.

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:16.750 align:middle line:90%
You know, we express ourselves.

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:18.200 align:middle line:90%
We have something to say.

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:21.060 align:middle line:90%
We're not saying it.

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:24.880 align:middle line:84%
So those are-- so it's
like, wherever that is,

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.690 align:middle line:90%
that's what you're angry about.

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:29.420 align:middle line:84%
Now if they would just
speak-- but usually

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:30.870 align:middle line:90%
they are just holding it inside.

00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And they're like,
it's not my problem.

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:34.762 align:middle line:90%
You're the one with the problem.

00:39:34.762 --> 00:39:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And they just won't
speak about it.

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:38.784 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there's a lot
of repressed in general.

00:39:38.784 --> 00:39:39.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Major.

00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:40.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's turning
into regressed anger.

00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:41.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Exactly.

00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's gone on
for a long time.

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's just been
sitting in there,

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.958 align:middle line:84%
churning and churning
and churning and churning

00:39:45.958 --> 00:39:48.850 align:middle line:84%
and churning and churning,
winding on itself,

00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:52.750 align:middle line:84%
and eating now on itself,
and now it's cancer.

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:53.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:56.286 align:middle line:84%
But as you said,
that can be undone.

00:39:56.286 --> 00:39:57.160 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Absolutely.

00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:59.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Release
the emotional trauma.

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:00.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Because once that's
understood-- now in the session,

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.760 align:middle line:90%
it's done like that.

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:09.100 align:middle line:90%
It's immediate.

00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:14.020 align:middle line:84%
Because in a regression, you're
able to make immediate contact

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:17.300 align:middle line:90%
to this-- your bigger self.

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And you can bring in
the healing light.

00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:21.420 align:middle line:90%
It's all done with white light.

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:24.220 align:middle line:84%
And the understanding
and the emotional release

00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:26.060 align:middle line:90%
happens immediately.

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:29.510 align:middle line:84%
And you have the understanding,
and you're able to release.

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:30.995 align:middle line:90%
So it's all immediate.

00:40:30.995 --> 00:40:32.920 align:middle line:84%
But you can do it
consciously as well.

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:34.940 align:middle line:90%
But like you said, yeah.

00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:36.569 align:middle line:84%
You have releasing,
you have talking.

00:40:36.569 --> 00:40:37.360 align:middle line:90%
You've got to talk.

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've
got to dig down.

00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:40.940 align:middle line:90%
You've got to dig down into it.

00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:42.280 align:middle line:90%
You can't avoid it anymore.

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:42.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Absolutely.

00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:45.096 align:middle line:84%
If you want to get rid of
this, you have work to do.

00:40:45.096 --> 00:40:48.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and so kind
of the classic way in new age

00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:52.430 align:middle line:84%
parlance, so to speak is,
oh, everything is fine.

00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:54.832 align:middle line:84%
My cells are healing,
and all that.

00:40:54.832 --> 00:40:57.330 align:middle line:90%
And it's really groovy.

00:40:57.330 --> 00:40:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And your mom found
that wasn't true.

00:40:58.830 --> 00:40:59.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: No.

00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:00.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've got
to get into the source.

00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: You've
got to get in there.

00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:02.701 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:41:02.701 --> 00:41:03.450 align:middle line:90%
There's something.

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:05.200 align:middle line:90%
What is it you're angry about?

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.980 align:middle line:90%
Get in there and get it out.

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:12.890 align:middle line:84%
Go ahead and get it--
you know, get in there.

00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:14.120 align:middle line:90%
It's OK to be angry.

00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:16.630 align:middle line:84%
I think that's one
of our things is

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:21.040 align:middle line:84%
we've been taught
that anger is not OK.

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:22.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is true.

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:26.450 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: We've been taught that
that emotion is not acceptable.

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:28.230 align:middle line:90%
That emotion is fine.

00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And It's an emotion, and
it's an acceptable emotion.

00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:32.950 align:middle line:90%
And as new age--

00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:35.442 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's very charged,
and it has information in it.

00:41:35.442 --> 00:41:37.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: I think we're
afraid of that emotion.

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:39.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think we are too.

00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: And we're afraid
of ourselves sometimes of it,

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:42.820 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:45.800 align:middle line:84%
But like you said, it has
a lot of information in it.

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:47.630 align:middle line:90%
It tells us about ourselves.

00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:50.760 align:middle line:84%
But if we are angry, then we
just need to look behind it.

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:52.090 align:middle line:90%
What is it we're angry about?

00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:54.510 align:middle line:84%
But go ahead and get
angry and then look at it.

00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:56.510 align:middle line:84%
What is it-- it's trying
to teach you something.

00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:57.890 align:middle line:84%
It's trying to
tell you something.

00:41:57.890 --> 00:42:00.098 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And in these
sessions, people do get angry.

00:42:00.098 --> 00:42:01.420 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes, absolutely.

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:03.241 align:middle line:90%
And then go through it.

00:42:03.241 --> 00:42:03.740 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:05.690 align:middle line:90%
Cry, kick, scream, whatever.

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:06.550 align:middle line:90%
Do it.

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And then, what is it
you're trying to teach me?

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:11.080 align:middle line:90%
What do you want me to know?

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:11.799 align:middle line:90%
Go on through it.

00:42:11.799 --> 00:42:13.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that work,
you all are still doing.

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:16.717 align:middle line:84%
Many practitioners that are
using your mom's methods

00:42:16.717 --> 00:42:17.800 align:middle line:90%
are working with this now.

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:18.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Absolutely.

00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:19.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:19.700 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:20.675 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ooh, I'd have a mess.

00:42:20.675 --> 00:42:22.340 align:middle line:84%
You see, my back
went out because I

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:26.560 align:middle line:84%
was wearing a pair of new
fancy boots that were too tall.

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:28.520 align:middle line:90%
So I had a lesson about vanity.

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:32.170 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Through that little--
pinched a nerve over vanity.

00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:36.280 align:middle line:90%
There's one for you.

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:37.876 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:37.876 --> 00:42:39.730 align:middle line:90%
I'll have to look at that.

00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:40.660 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:43.280 align:middle line:84%
No, I was going to-- I
brought up before the notion

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:45.390 align:middle line:84%
that in many of the
people that come in,

00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:48.730 align:middle line:84%
they go back to lifetimes
in ancient times

00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:51.180 align:middle line:84%
where they were
healers of some kind.

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Now one thing was
guardians of knowledge.

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:58.740 align:middle line:84%
People that were there alongside
the powerful information

00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:02.160 align:middle line:90%
bearers had a life.

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Literally they would put
their life on the line

00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:05.930 align:middle line:90%
to protect that knowledge.

00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:09.360 align:middle line:84%
That that wasn't supposed
to be trickled down

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:12.030 align:middle line:84%
if people didn't have the
ability to understand it,

00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:14.610 align:middle line:90%
and the wisdom within it, right?

00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:15.710 align:middle line:90%
So that was one thing.

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:17.960 align:middle line:90%
Another one was healers.

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:20.670 align:middle line:90%
A lot of healers come to you.

00:43:20.670 --> 00:43:21.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:24.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so there's
a common experience

00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:28.460 align:middle line:84%
they run into, and it happened
a couple times in this book.

00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:29.381 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about it.

00:43:29.381 --> 00:43:30.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: You mean,
like the healers

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:32.880 align:middle line:84%
where they're afraid
to bring that back?

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
that's a lot of us.

00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:38.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Well, or afraid to
bring forth-- well, healers

00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:39.980 align:middle line:90%
or any other abilities.

00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:41.807 align:middle line:84%
They may have other
abilities as well.

00:43:41.807 --> 00:43:42.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yep.

00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:45.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: But that's part of
it is, they were persecuted.

00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:46.690 align:middle line:90%
They were tortured.

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:47.520 align:middle line:90%
They were killed.

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:50.959 align:middle line:84%
They had a lot of nasty things
happen to them before because

00:43:50.959 --> 00:43:51.750 align:middle line:90%
of those abilities.

00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:53.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And maybe
in repeated lifetimes.

00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:54.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Absolutely.

00:43:54.920 --> 00:44:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And so-- and in very, like I
said, not so nice ways, many

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:02.415 align:middle line:90%
of us were burned many times.

00:44:02.415 --> 00:44:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:05.859 align:middle line:84%
Burned-- scorching, burning,
fire comes up repeatedly

00:44:05.859 --> 00:44:06.400 align:middle line:90%
in this book.

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:06.983 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:44:06.983 --> 00:44:07.820 align:middle line:90%
Heads cut off.

00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:09.430 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:11.136 align:middle line:84%
And you name it,
we've had it done.

00:44:11.136 --> 00:44:11.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:12.802 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: But we're back.

00:44:12.802 --> 00:44:13.718 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're back.

00:44:13.718 --> 00:44:14.266 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:44:14.266 --> 00:44:16.505 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: You know,
it's like, OK.

00:44:16.505 --> 00:44:18.340 align:middle line:84%
You can only-- is
doesn't matter.

00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:23.030 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was funny
was one of the things

00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:27.960 align:middle line:84%
as I was preparing, you
know, I thought it was funny.

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:34.330 align:middle line:84%
One of the best ways that
we preserved this knowledge

00:44:34.330 --> 00:44:38.360 align:middle line:84%
that I don't know if
we even realized it,

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:41.377 align:middle line:90%
was we hid it in our DNA.

00:44:41.377 --> 00:44:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Talk about that.

00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:44.179 align:middle line:84%
Someone talks about
that in this book.

00:44:44.179 --> 00:44:45.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Well, I mean,
that's what we did.

00:44:45.970 --> 00:44:50.146 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that we even-- it's
in our DNA and in our memory

00:44:50.146 --> 00:44:51.630 align:middle line:90%
just because.

00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:54.766 align:middle line:84%
Because we ever lived
it at any time at all--

00:44:54.766 --> 00:44:55.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's there.

00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:57.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: --it's there.

00:44:57.010 --> 00:44:57.875 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:44:57.875 --> 00:44:59.000 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: So there you are.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.624 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what's
happening is people

00:45:00.624 --> 00:45:02.310 align:middle line:84%
are starting to
open those doors.

00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:04.220 align:middle line:84%
They're starting to
remember certain things.

00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And more so, I think
we're having urges.

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:08.110 align:middle line:90%
Like, ooh.

00:45:08.110 --> 00:45:09.840 align:middle line:84%
I need to quit my
job with the state

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:12.740 align:middle line:84%
and start doing
Reiki or whatever.

00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:15.264 align:middle line:84%
People are starting have very
strong, or just like this.

00:45:15.264 --> 00:45:15.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Right.

00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:18.880 align:middle line:84%
But back to your other--
that's why some people, they

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:21.620 align:middle line:84%
were reluctant or they
were like, oh, yeah,

00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:24.040 align:middle line:84%
I've had the urge to do
this, but I'm afraid.

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:26.440 align:middle line:84%
Or what will people
think, or what will--

00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:27.810 align:middle line:90%
it's because maybe they--

00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:28.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they're
having problems in life

00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:29.590 align:middle line:90%
because they're stuck.

00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:30.881 align:middle line:90%
They're not living their truth.

00:45:30.881 --> 00:45:31.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Absolutely.

00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:33.814 align:middle line:84%
And they really need
to do something.

00:45:33.814 --> 00:45:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times,
that's where they're

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:36.880 align:middle line:90%
having the illnesses or things.

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:39.190 align:middle line:84%
It's because
they've got to move.

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:41.309 align:middle line:84%
They've got to-- that's
where the body's going,

00:45:41.309 --> 00:45:43.100 align:middle line:84%
you've got to move in
this other direction.

00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:44.700 align:middle line:84%
You need to get
out of this place,

00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:47.300 align:middle line:90%
and you need to move over here.

00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:48.744 align:middle line:90%
That's the messages.

00:45:48.744 --> 00:45:51.035 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and a lot of
these people that came in,

00:45:51.035 --> 00:45:53.220 align:middle line:84%
came in because they were
having physical problems.

00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And then this
lifetime, you know,

00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:59.510 align:middle line:84%
pre-Atlantis or Atlantis or
in ancient times in Europe

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:01.800 align:middle line:84%
start surfacing, and
that's where they find out

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:03.670 align:middle line:90%
that this is what was going on.

00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:06.544 align:middle line:84%
And part of them has been
denying that in this life.

00:46:06.544 --> 00:46:07.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Right.

00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:08.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
aspect of themselves.

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:10.323 align:middle line:90%
But as you say, it's embedded.

00:46:10.323 --> 00:46:12.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: It's embedded.

00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that
must have been one

00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:19.350 align:middle line:84%
of the most common things your
mom saw, was the fear to bring

00:46:19.350 --> 00:46:20.285 align:middle line:90%
who we are forward.

00:46:20.285 --> 00:46:21.420 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We are in challenging
times, on a physical level.

00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:26.140 align:middle line:90%
I mean, things are changing.

00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And that might be why
all these people who

00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:33.970 align:middle line:84%
have been living lives as
herbologists and healers

00:46:33.970 --> 00:46:36.800 align:middle line:84%
and seers and so on in
the past are resurfacing

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:38.240 align:middle line:90%
at this point in time.

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:39.760 align:middle line:84%
It's also why
they're getting sick,

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:41.354 align:middle line:90%
and they're denying themselves.

00:46:41.354 --> 00:46:42.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Right.

00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:44.020 align:middle line:84%
As you recall, one of
the chapters was called

00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:45.560 align:middle line:84%
"Don't Repeat the
Same Mistakes."

00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:46.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:48.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: And that
is a lot of why

00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:51.120 align:middle line:84%
they're coming back is so that
we don't do these same things.

00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And so that's part
of it, I believe,

00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:55.200 align:middle line:84%
is so that we can
warn ourselves,

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:58.150 align:middle line:84%
we can make sure that we
don't do these things.

00:46:58.150 --> 00:47:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And so that could be
part of that as well.

00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:01.094 align:middle line:90%
Help cleanse.

00:47:01.094 --> 00:47:01.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:05.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: I mean, when you
look at how many-- I mean,

00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:08.460 align:middle line:84%
when you look, really, the
shifting of the consciousness

00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:13.990 align:middle line:84%
is-- part of that is how
ecologically conscious

00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:15.780 align:middle line:90%
we have all gotten.

00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:17.021 align:middle line:90%
And I know we can do better.

00:47:17.021 --> 00:47:18.520 align:middle line:84%
But really, look
at what we've done.

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:19.936 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We don't
think about it.

00:47:19.936 --> 00:47:22.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the big E. You know,
we talk about the big C.

00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:26.280 align:middle line:84%
But the big E is something
that since, I think,

00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:28.370 align:middle line:84%
the '70s or '80s when
it first surfaced,

00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:29.970 align:middle line:90%
everyone was terrified of this.

00:47:29.970 --> 00:47:30.680 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my God.

00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:33.090 align:middle line:84%
What if some horrible
disease like Ebola

00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:35.510 align:middle line:84%
were to poke its
ugly head up again?

00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:36.640 align:middle line:90%
It did.

00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:38.830 align:middle line:90%
And however it happened, it did.

00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:42.700 align:middle line:84%
But the point being, it didn't
ravage the entire population.

00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:44.160 align:middle line:90%
It did take lives.

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:47.290 align:middle line:84%
But it didn't ravage us It
didn't spread around the globe

00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:49.580 align:middle line:90%
like everybody said it would.

00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:52.445 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that is devastating.

00:47:52.445 --> 00:47:54.570 align:middle line:84%
You know, especially because
they didn't understand

00:47:54.570 --> 00:47:56.900 align:middle line:84%
there were actually rather
simple ways to deal with it,

00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:58.525 align:middle line:84%
and they weren't
making them available.

00:47:58.525 --> 00:48:00.690 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, it could
have ravaged the planet,

00:48:00.690 --> 00:48:01.790 align:middle line:90%
but it didn't.

00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:02.577 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Right.

00:48:02.577 --> 00:48:04.076 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So maybe
this is also some

00:48:04.076 --> 00:48:06.430 align:middle line:84%
of what Nostradamus was
saying is some of these things

00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:10.094 align:middle line:90%
will not come to pass now.

00:48:10.094 --> 00:48:11.760 align:middle line:84%
Because that's something
I'd heard years

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:13.720 align:middle line:84%
ago too that there
could be something that

00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:15.680 align:middle line:90%
was devastating to humanity.

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:18.810 align:middle line:90%
But so far, it's not happening.

00:48:18.810 --> 00:48:20.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Right.

00:48:20.550 --> 00:48:23.450 align:middle line:90%
Another thing-- boy.

00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And I almost want to clip
my wings as I say this.

00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:26.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, say it anyway.

00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:27.345 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Do I dare?

00:48:27.345 --> 00:48:27.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:27.870 align:middle line:90%
Say it.

00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:28.510 align:middle line:90%
Say it.

00:48:28.510 --> 00:48:30.343 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: There was
something I was really--

00:48:30.343 --> 00:48:33.372 align:middle line:84%
because we're always so
concerned about, well,

00:48:33.372 --> 00:48:35.580 align:middle line:84%
this stuff in the food and
this stuff and this stuff,

00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:37.829 align:middle line:84%
and how do I-- oh, all these
things we're so concerned

00:48:37.829 --> 00:48:38.350 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And in one of the sessions that
I was privy to listening to,

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:47.162 align:middle line:84%
the SC part, they
were talking about--

00:48:47.162 --> 00:48:48.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Subconscious.

00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:48.630 align:middle line:90%
SC is subconscious.

00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:48.710 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:49.310 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:48:49.310 --> 00:48:50.100 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hm.

00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:52.390 align:middle line:84%
When it was talking
about, it said,

00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:56.620 align:middle line:84%
you have to understand that
as your frequencies raise,

00:48:56.620 --> 00:49:00.960 align:middle line:84%
you are actually above
these things now.

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And these will not
affect you anymore.

00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:05.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you
for sharing that.

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, it's a complex
thing we're going through

00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:09.110 align:middle line:90%
as we're changing.

00:49:09.110 --> 00:49:12.360 align:middle line:84%
I totally agree with that,
that the frequency of some

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:15.040 align:middle line:84%
of the things that we keep going
on about, oh, this'll kill you,

00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:16.292 align:middle line:90%
sausage, it'll kill you.

00:49:16.292 --> 00:49:16.792 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:49:16.792 --> 00:49:18.010 align:middle line:90%
Not necessarily.

00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:20.550 align:middle line:84%
But every body is
tuned differently,

00:49:20.550 --> 00:49:23.060 align:middle line:84%
and is in a different
stage of advancement.

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:24.740 align:middle line:84%
Because we are
moving into a stage

00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:26.830 align:middle line:84%
where our digestive
systems will change,

00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:28.830 align:middle line:84%
because our frequencies
change, because our need

00:49:28.830 --> 00:49:30.370 align:middle line:84%
for certain kinds
of foods change.

00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:31.600 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Right.

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:33.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I mean,
fearing putting everything

00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:35.020 align:middle line:90%
in our mouth-- yet--

00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:35.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:49:35.790 --> 00:49:37.419 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
biggest thing is fear.

00:49:37.419 --> 00:49:38.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The fear of it.

00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:39.251 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: The fear.

00:49:39.251 --> 00:49:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And so it's like that's
what-- let go of the fear.

00:49:41.950 --> 00:49:43.501 align:middle line:90%
Just don't fear these things.

00:49:43.501 --> 00:49:44.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Don't fear it.

00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Yet at the same time,
things like gluten.

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Our body-- it's
been manipulated.

00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:53.140 align:middle line:84%
It has been-- I mean, you have
a lovely, fluffy croissant,

00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:55.440 align:middle line:84%
and it may have had
up to 60% gluten

00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:57.584 align:middle line:84%
added to it to make
it light and fluffy.

00:49:57.584 --> 00:49:58.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Right.

00:49:58.250 --> 00:50:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not like the
original heirloom wheats,

00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:02.940 align:middle line:90%
heritage wheats and so forth.

00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:04.920 align:middle line:84%
So we do have to be
aware that, yeah.

00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:07.380 align:middle line:84%
There are some things our
bodies just don't dig.

00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And if you've swell up and
feel terrible and go to sleep,

00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:12.450 align:middle line:84%
well, don't eat
that food anymore.

00:50:12.450 --> 00:50:14.430 align:middle line:84%
But other than that,
there's nothing to fear.

00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:15.387 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Exactly.

00:50:15.387 --> 00:50:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a
really important message.

00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:19.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: I think
that's the-- do we dare

00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:21.047 align:middle line:90%
say that's the biggest message?

00:50:21.047 --> 00:50:21.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:22.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: I think it is.

00:50:22.410 --> 00:50:22.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fear is the--

00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:23.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Exactly.

00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:25.556 align:middle line:84%
I feel like that's one
of my missions on Earth

00:50:25.556 --> 00:50:28.110 align:middle line:90%
is to eradicate fear.

00:50:28.110 --> 00:50:31.120 align:middle line:90%
I just-- that to me is biggie.

00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:32.450 align:middle line:90%
That's major, major.

00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:33.897 align:middle line:90%
To stop fear.

00:50:33.897 --> 00:50:34.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And your mom was
big on that too.

00:50:36.090 --> 00:50:37.729 align:middle line:84%
She said, there's
nothing to fear.

00:50:37.729 --> 00:50:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And she had to coax people
through all their fear

00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:41.460 align:middle line:90%
in all these regressions.

00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:43.564 align:middle line:84%
And I know with me, it
wasn't fear so much.

00:50:43.564 --> 00:50:45.480 align:middle line:84%
She had to coax me through
a couple of things.

00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:47.280 align:middle line:90%
I thought, oh, my God.

00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:49.010 align:middle line:90%
Are we on that day?

00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:50.800 align:middle line:90%
I don't really want to go there.

00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:52.575 align:middle line:90%
And yet, we went there anyway.

00:50:52.575 --> 00:50:54.890 align:middle line:84%
But it also-- and
this is something

00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:56.520 align:middle line:90%
that goes really deep.

00:50:56.520 --> 00:51:01.080 align:middle line:84%
In my regression with
her-- a lot of people

00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:04.820 align:middle line:84%
had these-- she wrote about
this in "Convoluted Universe I."

00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:07.030 align:middle line:84%
I was in "Convoluted
Universe II."

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:09.805 align:middle line:84%
My name was changed to something
like Veronica or something.

00:51:09.805 --> 00:51:10.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: OK.

00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:12.700 align:middle line:84%
Was your career
changed and everything?

00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I think she said
it was a television reporter,

00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:16.780 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:19.160 align:middle line:84%
But she talked about
this experience.

00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And I bring it up because it
instilled mass fear in us.

00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:28.650 align:middle line:84%
That was at the end of
the times of Atlantis,

00:51:28.650 --> 00:51:30.990 align:middle line:84%
which had three stages
where it went down.

00:51:30.990 --> 00:51:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And in one of the times, I
went back to that final day.

00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at what was
going on, what had happened.

00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:40.520 align:middle line:84%
I had a misunderstanding
about why it was coming about.

00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:43.500 align:middle line:84%
It was natural earth
activity, actually,

00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:45.840 align:middle line:90%
that had become very unstable.

00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:47.960 align:middle line:84%
We had advanced
technologies at the time

00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:51.790 align:middle line:90%
to try to ameliorate it.

00:51:51.790 --> 00:51:52.360 align:middle line:90%
Didn't work.

00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:54.370 align:middle line:84%
And it went on for a
very long period of time.

00:51:54.370 --> 00:51:56.100 align:middle line:90%
And that's in the regression.

00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:59.484 align:middle line:84%
We'd been working on it for what
we would call now generations.

00:51:59.484 --> 00:52:00.400 align:middle line:90%
We knew it was coming.

00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:02.310 align:middle line:90%
Just keep this energy stable.

00:52:02.310 --> 00:52:05.510 align:middle line:84%
Beams from other places
were-- there were saucers out.

00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:07.230 align:middle line:90%
This happened in this book.

00:52:07.230 --> 00:52:09.262 align:middle line:84%
Someone else recalled
the same thing.

00:52:09.262 --> 00:52:10.720 align:middle line:84%
There were beings
from other places

00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:12.400 align:middle line:84%
who were coming,
using their energies,

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:17.310 align:middle line:84%
trying to stabilize that part of
Atlantis, Atlantia, whichever.

00:52:17.310 --> 00:52:19.810 align:middle line:90%
And ultimately, it didn't work.

00:52:19.810 --> 00:52:21.540 align:middle line:84%
I happened to drop
into the regression

00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:23.550 align:middle line:90%
the final-- on the final day.

00:52:23.550 --> 00:52:26.150 align:middle line:84%
That was not what I went
to your mom for at all.

00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:27.485 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:27.485 --> 00:52:28.778 align:middle line:90%
But it seldom is, right?

00:52:28.778 --> 00:52:29.444 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Right.

00:52:29.444 --> 00:52:30.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You know?

00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:32.880 align:middle line:84%
But when it was over,
this was the thing

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:35.150 align:middle line:90%
that I came away with.

00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And that was I kept
saying, among many things,

00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:44.260 align:middle line:84%
I kept saying to her, we
have to go to sleep now.

00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:46.104 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't
understand initially.

00:52:46.104 --> 00:52:47.770 align:middle line:84%
She said, oh, you're
going to sleep now.

00:52:47.770 --> 00:52:48.400 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no.

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:50.160 align:middle line:90%
We're all going to sleep.

00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And I bring it up
for this reason.

00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:57.380 align:middle line:84%
We all have this fear of
annihilation on some level.

00:52:57.380 --> 00:53:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
was so devastating,

00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:06.580 align:middle line:84%
to have such a really lovely,
advanced culture, plenty

00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:09.170 align:middle line:84%
of everything, people doing
what they're here to do,

00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:11.610 align:middle line:84%
and doing their-- and
able and having time

00:53:11.610 --> 00:53:14.580 align:middle line:84%
to do their passions
and talents and play.

00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:15.930 align:middle line:90%
It was lovely.

00:53:15.930 --> 00:53:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And when it ended in a flash,
so to speak, very quickly

00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:26.570 align:middle line:84%
at the final moment, if
we had known what we lost,

00:53:26.570 --> 00:53:28.790 align:middle line:84%
if we carried that
memory forward,

00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:33.669 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't be able to continue
repopulating and find ourselves

00:53:33.669 --> 00:53:35.210 align:middle line:84%
right back to where
we are right now.

00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's why that
information's coming up again.

00:53:38.530 --> 00:53:41.340 align:middle line:84%
They did use technology
interfacing with this.

00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:43.100 align:middle line:84%
They did the best they
could in the time.

00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:44.670 align:middle line:90%
They just ramped it up a bit.

00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:45.280 align:middle line:90%
Things blew.

00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:47.810 align:middle line:84%
But it was natural, and it
was going to happen anyway.

00:53:47.810 --> 00:53:51.370 align:middle line:84%
That one of the three was
going to happen anyway.

00:53:51.370 --> 00:53:54.340 align:middle line:84%
So I think we need to
quit blaming each other.

00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:55.670 align:middle line:90%
Oh, bad people.

00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:56.639 align:middle line:90%
You know, bad ETs.

00:53:56.639 --> 00:53:57.680 align:middle line:90%
Everyone with technology.

00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:01.200 align:middle line:84%
No, everyone tried to save the
thing and save the technology

00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:03.130 align:middle line:90%
and save what we knew.

00:54:03.130 --> 00:54:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And so now we have this
mass fear of annihilation.

00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Now would buy into
end times scenarios

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:12.510 align:middle line:84%
because many, many people on
this Earth went through it.

00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And they have that
memory in them.

00:54:14.530 --> 00:54:17.579 align:middle line:84%
That's not what we're
looking at now at this time.

00:54:17.579 --> 00:54:19.495 align:middle line:84%
And isn't that an important
part of the story?

00:54:19.495 --> 00:54:20.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Absolutely.

00:54:20.370 --> 00:54:21.845 align:middle line:84%
And as you said
that, and as you're

00:54:21.845 --> 00:54:23.970 align:middle line:84%
saying the craft were all
around, I got the vision.

00:54:23.970 --> 00:54:27.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've had some
regressions as well recently

00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:32.030 align:middle line:84%
where I've been able to
beam out and look on now.

00:54:32.030 --> 00:54:34.452 align:middle line:84%
And you see all these
craft around now.

00:54:34.452 --> 00:54:35.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're everywhere.

00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:36.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Exactly.

00:54:36.410 --> 00:54:38.630 align:middle line:84%
They're just like--
it's standing room only,

00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:39.810 align:middle line:90%
watching what's going on.

00:54:39.810 --> 00:54:40.135 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:54:40.135 --> 00:54:40.635 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:40.635 --> 00:54:41.580 align:middle line:90%
It's so true.

00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:44.040 align:middle line:84%
This is the greatest show
in the universe right now,

00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:47.310 align:middle line:84%
and all that has to happen
is for us to drop the fear

00:54:47.310 --> 00:54:49.180 align:middle line:90%
and just say, oh, OK.

00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:49.850 align:middle line:90%
We're doing it.

00:54:49.850 --> 00:54:50.980 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:54.067 align:middle line:84%
And thanks to you
and all the people--

00:54:54.067 --> 00:54:56.400 align:middle line:84%
how many people are now doing
your mom's work out there?

00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:59.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Oh, it's over
5,000 that we've trained.

00:54:59.210 --> 00:55:00.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fabulous.

00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:02.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: And
continuing to train.

00:55:02.090 --> 00:55:05.359 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do they find everyone
through dolorescannon.com?

00:55:05.359 --> 00:55:06.525 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Dolorescannon.com.

00:55:06.525 --> 00:55:08.649 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK, and I'll
mention that again in a sec.

00:55:08.649 --> 00:55:09.170 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:55:09.170 --> 00:55:09.753 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:55:09.753 --> 00:55:11.385 align:middle line:90%
It's so lovely to sit with you.

00:55:11.385 --> 00:55:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think that you don't
need to fill your mom's shoes.

00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:15.130 align:middle line:90%
You just have to fill your own.

00:55:15.130 --> 00:55:16.490 align:middle line:90%
You're on your way, girl.

00:55:16.490 --> 00:55:18.170 align:middle line:90%
You guys are doing great work.

00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:19.577 align:middle line:90%
Thanks so much, Julia.

00:55:19.577 --> 00:55:20.660 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Thank you again.

00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:22.701 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Again, the name
of Dolores' newest book

00:55:22.701 --> 00:55:24.680 align:middle line:10%
is "Hidden Sacred
Knowledge" to be followed

00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:26.720 align:middle line:10%
by "Convoluted Universe V."

00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:29.530 align:middle line:10%
The work lives on with
her daughter Julia.

00:55:29.530 --> 00:55:31.490 align:middle line:10%
You can go to the site
for workshop dates,

00:55:31.490 --> 00:55:32.870 align:middle line:10%
et cetera, and to
learn how to do

00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:34.872 align:middle line:10%
this work at dolorescannon.com.

00:55:34.872 --> 00:55:36.830 align:middle line:84%
You might also want to
go to the Gaiam Archives

00:55:36.830 --> 00:55:39.280 align:middle line:84%
and see a couple of my
interviews with Dolores

00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:39.970 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:55:39.970 --> 00:55:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
