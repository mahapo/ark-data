00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LAURIE MCDONALD: We don't
do anything for nothing.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:16.309 align:middle line:84%
And once we understand that
and accept it and embrace it,

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:17.690 align:middle line:90%
we can create change.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.630 align:middle line:84%
Talk therapy never hits
the emotional part,

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.910 align:middle line:90%
but hypnotherapy does.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.740 align:middle line:84%
Because there are
universal laws,

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.140 align:middle line:90%
there are universal loopholes.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And the human, not
fully understanding

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.750 align:middle line:84%
the universal laws,
can be tricked.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.430 align:middle line:90%
Aliens lie.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.970 align:middle line:90%
That's a fact.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.640 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps look at entity
attachment often misdiagnosed

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.440 align:middle line:90%
for schizophrenia.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Absolutely.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LAURIE MCDONALD: All
change, all growth,

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.510 align:middle line:84%
all healing does begin
with our ability to relax.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.180 align:middle line:84%
Anything can be
weaponized, even telepathy.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.980 align:middle line:90%


00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Laurie McDonald
has spent decades rummaging

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.080 align:middle line:84%
through the deep recesses
of people's minds,

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.470 align:middle line:84%
helping them excavate buried
treasure that can free them.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.180 align:middle line:84%
This happens
through hypnotherapy

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.830 align:middle line:90%
and she's a master in the field.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.930 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, one of
the memories surfacing

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.700 align:middle line:84%
more frequently
now is the feeling

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.680 align:middle line:84%
of seeing non-human
entities around us.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.930 align:middle line:90%
So we're going to get to that.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:14.980 align:middle line:90%
Welcome again, Laurie.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:15.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Thank you.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm so glad to be back.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.412 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to
be getting to that part.

00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:20.800 align:middle line:84%
But first, we're going to
talk about the mind itself

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.830 align:middle line:84%
and how this works because
I don't know that there's

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.030 align:middle line:84%
anything more fascinating than
the complex called the greater

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.177 align:middle line:90%
human mind.

00:01:29.177 --> 00:01:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: I agree.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
that's your job is

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.890 align:middle line:84%
to get in and rattle around, see
where the stuff's coming from,

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.540 align:middle line:84%
and see how we can
start overwriting

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.847 align:middle line:84%
programs because mostly
we're walking programs.

00:01:39.847 --> 00:01:41.680 align:middle line:84%
So I want to ask you
this right off the top.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.130 align:middle line:84%
What's the most astounding
thing you've discovered

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.280 align:middle line:90%
being inside people's heads?

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.920 align:middle line:10%
>>MCDONALD: Well, that
a lot of times people

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.290 align:middle line:10%
have blocked out an enormous
amount of subtle information

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.860 align:middle line:10%
that could really help
them in their daily life.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.680 align:middle line:10%
I find that the mind controls
the body and the body obeys.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.470 align:middle line:10%
That when we learn
how to use the mind

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.740 align:middle line:10%
and begin to create
the program, then we're

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.440 align:middle line:10%
more self-actualized.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.750 align:middle line:84%
We're living the
life that we want to.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.000 align:middle line:84%
So in order to do that, we
have to evaluate ourselves.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.060 align:middle line:84%
We have to take a deep dark
dive into our own personalities

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.100 align:middle line:90%
and gauge.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.000 align:middle line:90%
But just accept it.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.790 align:middle line:90%
It's a neutral experiment.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.410 align:middle line:90%
You just accept it.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.060 align:middle line:90%
It is what it is.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.500 align:middle line:90%
It's cause and effect.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.480 align:middle line:90%
There's a reason for everything.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.000 align:middle line:84%
We don't do anything
for nothing.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And once we understand that
and accept it and embrace it,

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.100 align:middle line:84%
we can create change because you
cannot change what you cannot

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.120 align:middle line:90%
accept.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.750 align:middle line:84%
So upon the acceptance of
the self without shaming,

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.810 align:middle line:84%
without blaming,
it is what it is.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.550 align:middle line:90%
Let's just deal with it.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.330 align:middle line:84%
With that, we can move
forward and develop.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and as you
said at the beginning,

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.210 align:middle line:84%
the body is listening
to every single thing

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.680 align:middle line:84%
that the mind is
putting out there.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.690 align:middle line:84%
The body is absorbing
it and the body

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.530 align:middle line:84%
is making adjustments to the
information and the emotions

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:19.447 align:middle line:90%
that we're generating.

00:03:19.447 --> 00:03:20.247 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Right.

00:03:20.247 --> 00:03:21.330 align:middle line:90%
We're mostly the brain.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.650 align:middle line:84%
The body is designed
to interpret

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.060 align:middle line:84%
our environment, our sight,
sound, taste, our limbs.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.780 align:middle line:84%
All of these things allow us
to interpret our environment,

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.283 align:middle line:84%
to process that information,
and then act upon it.

00:03:35.283 --> 00:03:36.575 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's listening.

00:03:36.575 --> 00:03:37.520 align:middle line:90%
It's always listening.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.728 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Always listening.

00:03:38.728 --> 00:03:41.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I mean,
to me, so much of I

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.340 align:middle line:84%
think even in my own
life, the early work

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.190 align:middle line:84%
that I was doing more on a
spiritual basis was always

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.560 align:middle line:84%
moving upward, going up into
connection with the higher

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.360 align:middle line:90%
aspect of self.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.170 align:middle line:90%
And that's useful.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.970 align:middle line:90%
It's very useful.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:52.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: It is.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: However,
using the body

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.880 align:middle line:84%
as our tuning fork for truth is
every bit as profound and more

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:00.680 align:middle line:90%
accessible.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well,
the body holds memory

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.430 align:middle line:84%
as does the mind, the
subconscious specifically.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: But the body does
hold memory and you can see.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.590 align:middle line:84%
Once you become very
attuned into sensing

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.050 align:middle line:84%
into people's energy
fields, you can

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:22.130 align:middle line:84%
tell exactly where
they're feeling deficient

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.561 align:middle line:84%
or where their body
is holding trauma.

00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:29.990 align:middle line:84%
When you work with chiropractors
and acupuncturists,

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.700 align:middle line:84%
they'll touch one spot on a
body inadvertently and they'll--

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Scream, cry, carry on.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: All of it,
all of it because a memory

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:39.950 align:middle line:90%
has been touched.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, a memory
that needed to be touched.

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Released, freed.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.945 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Needed to be freed.

00:04:45.945 --> 00:04:46.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah, I try
not to say released.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And I know people have
asked me about that

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.680 align:middle line:90%
before why I don't do that.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't use-- but I would say
let something go or free it

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.900 align:middle line:84%
because a lease is a
contract with set terms.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.020 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever leased a car
and it comes to the end,

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.100 align:middle line:90%
you have to release it--

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.175 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it makes sense.

00:05:04.175 --> 00:05:04.187 align:middle line:90%
So you're careful.

00:05:04.187 --> 00:05:04.212 align:middle line:90%
You don't use that word.

00:05:04.212 --> 00:05:06.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: So you're going
back to the same contract.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:07.460 align:middle line:90%
Women do it all the time.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.980 align:middle line:90%
New man, same stuff, OK?

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.320 align:middle line:90%
So verbiage is very important.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.460 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious mind acts
upon the emotional energy

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.660 align:middle line:90%
of the verbiage that we use.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.140 align:middle line:84%
And so the words obviously
we know they have power,

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.620 align:middle line:84%
they have their own specific
vibration for everything

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.000 align:middle line:90%
that we utter.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.660 align:middle line:84%
But using the right word in
accessing the subconscious mind

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.890 align:middle line:84%
brings us to where
we want to be.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.490 align:middle line:84%
So when I do an intake
interview with somebody,

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:41.680 align:middle line:84%
I spend the first hour listening
to how they express themselves

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.640 align:middle line:84%
or how they describe situations,
how open they are or how

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.410 align:middle line:84%
not open, whether
it's permissive

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.350 align:middle line:84%
languaging I should use,
whether I should be more direct

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.330 align:middle line:84%
and just tell them
what to do or allow it.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.560 align:middle line:84%
It depends, but it's all
about the right words.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:02.200 align:middle line:84%
Words have more power and people
use words far too loosely,

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.010 align:middle line:84%
and it affects them outside
of their conscious awareness.

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:07.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, you're so right.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.410 align:middle line:90%
You're very right on that.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.220 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the people
that come through your door.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes someone is there
because their husband or wife

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.800 align:middle line:84%
said, you need to
figure this out.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.390 align:middle line:90%
You need to go to hypnotherapy.

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.490 align:middle line:84%
You need to see what it
is that's buried that you

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:22.780 align:middle line:90%
can't access and remember.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And so a person feeling
nervous or resistant

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:27.260 align:middle line:90%
comes through the door.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.307 align:middle line:84%
How do you deal with
people that don't

00:06:29.307 --> 00:06:31.640 align:middle line:84%
necessarily-- they're not
even there of their own accord

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.660 align:middle line:90%
per se?

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: I'll just say,
I don't go into any session

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.440 align:middle line:84%
without calling upon my own
highest self and guidance.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.580 align:middle line:84%
I do understand what
a huge responsibility

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.420 align:middle line:84%
it is to be into
somebody else's head.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: And I want
to always be respectful.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.100 align:middle line:84%
So somebody comes and
it wasn't their idea,

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.690 align:middle line:90%
and they're resistant.

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:59.450 align:middle line:84%
I do the best that I can to
alleviate any misnomers they

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:03.650 align:middle line:84%
may believe, and then they think
that it would be a good idea.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.070 align:middle line:84%
If I can get them to agree
that hypnotherapy would

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.560 align:middle line:84%
be a good idea for
them, then we're

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.720 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to go
where we need to go.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.630 align:middle line:84%
If somebody resists,
then I'm wasting

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.520 align:middle line:90%
my time and their money.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And a lot of people
have a fear that they're

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:20.300 align:middle line:90%
somehow going to be controlled.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.220 align:middle line:90%
That's one fear.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:21.545 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: That's
stage, stage hypnosis--

00:07:21.545 --> 00:07:22.962 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They've
been state fairs

00:07:22.962 --> 00:07:25.490 align:middle line:84%
and they see people
clucking like a chicken.

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:29.090 align:middle line:84%
They're also afraid that
their deep dark secrets

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:30.200 align:middle line:90%
are going to come out.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well, that
actually happens--

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That does happen
and they're afraid of it.

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: --because they
want me to know, actually,

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:36.952 align:middle line:90%
or it wouldn't happen.

00:07:36.952 --> 00:07:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:40.130 align:middle line:84%
That's the part I think
it's important to explain

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:41.720 align:middle line:90%
to people with hypnotherapy.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.060 align:middle line:84%
You don't do anything
against your true will.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:45.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Right.

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And I do give
post-hypnotic suggestions.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.500 align:middle line:84%
That at any time,
it's uncomfortable.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.850 align:middle line:84%
They have the ability to
count themselves back up

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.610 align:middle line:90%
or to break their trance.

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:02.810 align:middle line:90%
This is designed to help them.

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:07.400 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's trying to do
anything against their will.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.890 align:middle line:84%
Once they're trusting
and they're open to that,

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.280 align:middle line:90%
then we're highly successful.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I bring
this whole subject up

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.590 align:middle line:84%
and the reason I wanted you
here is because right now we're

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:20.990 align:middle line:84%
going through this
incredible transformation

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.870 align:middle line:84%
on the planet energetically
with all aspects

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.280 align:middle line:90%
of self and systems.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And as I was interviewing
Andrew Harvey recently,

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.510 align:middle line:84%
his point was that
all of this trauma

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:36.110 align:middle line:84%
gives us a chance to really
allow the unconscious

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:40.169 align:middle line:84%
and subconscious to bubble
up and grab our attention.

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And so what you're
doing is you're

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:46.130 align:middle line:84%
helping people access that at a
time when humanity really needs

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:47.780 align:middle line:90%
to access our unconscious.

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah,
it's OK to be hurt.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.650 align:middle line:90%
It's OK to be traumatized.

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:54.950 align:middle line:84%
It's OK to even be a
victim because there's

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:56.750 align:middle line:90%
legitimate victimization.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:59.270 align:middle line:90%
It just can't last forever, OK?

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:02.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what if you're
the perpetrator and you

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.340 align:middle line:84%
do but you don't
want to look at it.

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: I had a hard time
in the beginning of my career

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.240 align:middle line:90%
working with perpetrators.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:09.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:10.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: I mean--

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know
that's why I'm asking.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.395 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: --I had a
difficult time with it.

00:09:13.395 --> 00:09:18.540 align:middle line:84%
But now I do see that the
perpetrators at least that I've

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.630 align:middle line:84%
worked with had
redeeming qualities

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:25.560 align:middle line:84%
and had suffered
major trauma or abuse,

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:29.760 align:middle line:84%
both sexual and psychological,
all types of abuse really,

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:30.720 align:middle line:90%
physical.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.320 align:middle line:90%
And hurt people hurt people.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.820 align:middle line:90%
We know this is true.

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.010 align:middle line:84%
Now there's a difference
between somebody

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:45.300 align:middle line:84%
who is completely psychotic and
they have psychopathic ideas

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:46.830 align:middle line:90%
and they act on them.

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:50.380 align:middle line:84%
That's a different
type of predator.

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.310 align:middle line:90%
But other people--

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:54.091 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can't really
help that so much, can you?

00:09:54.091 --> 00:09:54.891 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: No--

00:09:54.891 --> 00:09:57.510 align:middle line:90%


00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:00.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because psychosis is
growing, a lot of conditions

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:01.740 align:middle line:90%
are growing.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:06.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: If you catch it
early in young adolescents,

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:11.290 align:middle line:84%
you can circumvent
certain things.

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:13.010 align:middle line:90%
You can redirect the energy.

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:17.140 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you can create
an internal alignment

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.810 align:middle line:84%
so that the unconscious,
the subconscious,

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:23.030 align:middle line:84%
and your conscious mind
is all on the same page.

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And so this is when we do bring
in the body and the energy

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:30.880 align:middle line:84%
work, chakra
balancing, cleansing.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.940 align:middle line:84%
Most people who are
acting out are wounded.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:36.820 align:middle line:84%
People who have difficult
relationships, who

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:41.170 align:middle line:84%
are feeling jealous or insecure,
they don't trust their partner,

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:45.400 align:middle line:84%
those people were
a child who was not

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:49.420 align:middle line:84%
nourished, nurtured,
adored, pampered

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.050 align:middle line:90%
and they have trust issues.

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:51.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:55.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Now until the
inner child is rescued,

00:10:55.570 --> 00:11:00.040 align:middle line:84%
is secured, is safe living
in that root chakra,

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.500 align:middle line:84%
until that, all of
your relationships

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.630 align:middle line:90%
will be based on that energy.

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Once the inner child
is listened to,

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:10.840 align:middle line:84%
respected, and given
something to do--

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:14.380 align:middle line:84%
I always let them go
play, sing, dance, spin.

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:15.610 align:middle line:90%
That's my inner child.

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:18.820 align:middle line:84%
But whoever, they
do what they want.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:22.420 align:middle line:84%
At that point, though, once the
inner child has been rescued,

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.540 align:middle line:84%
then and only then
does the adult

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.120 align:middle line:90%
see their actual potential.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.280 align:middle line:90%
They can break the program.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:33.970 align:middle line:84%
That one defining moment
where it doesn't matter

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:36.340 align:middle line:84%
if it's hypnotherapy,
talk therapy,

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:39.370 align:middle line:84%
there's one defining
moment in our lives

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:43.480 align:middle line:84%
when we just have to say,
I'm not going to do it.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.180 align:middle line:84%
Ask yourself, does
this feel good?

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:47.860 align:middle line:90%
Do I like how I feel?

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:49.600 align:middle line:90%
Is this the way I want to be?

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.140 align:middle line:84%
If the answer is no, then
there's your opening.

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:57.220 align:middle line:84%
At that moment, you can
effectively fundamentally

00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:02.000 align:middle line:84%
change and create the life
that you want to live.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.310 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't happen overnight.

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it is rapid,
but it's not overnight.

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:11.170 align:middle line:84%
Because once you change your
mind, everything changes.

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:15.010 align:middle line:84%
Everything is energy based on
our personal belief systems

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:18.700 align:middle line:84%
or our personal realities that
create those belief systems.

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:24.250 align:middle line:84%
Once we move into that
energy, then we're accepting,

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:27.040 align:middle line:84%
we're understanding,
and we're deciding,

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:31.810 align:middle line:84%
do I want to be like this or
is there something more for me?

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And there's always
something more.

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:35.940 align:middle line:90%
We're limitless--

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:36.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:37.610 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful answer.

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:38.527 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Thank you.

00:12:38.527 --> 00:12:41.952 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So just
for a moment, say,

00:12:41.952 --> 00:12:44.410 align:middle line:84%
you're working with one of the
young people that is showing

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:46.120 align:middle line:90%
psychopathic tendencies.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:49.480 align:middle line:84%
Can you help them regain
some things as essential

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.480 align:middle line:84%
or develop things as
essential as empathy

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.340 align:middle line:90%
for others or compassion?

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:57.760 align:middle line:84%
Is that something
that can be learned?

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.977 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: No,
I don't think so.

00:12:59.977 --> 00:13:01.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's why I'm asking.

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:04.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah, I haven't
seen evidence of it.

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:07.210 align:middle line:90%
I think that medication--

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:10.210 align:middle line:90%
you can stunt--

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:12.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Certain
types of acting out.

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:12.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:14.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah,
but that's about it.

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:19.450 align:middle line:84%
So the idea then here is to not
think, oh, they're hopeless.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:23.650 align:middle line:84%
I think the idea then is to
flip the script completely

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:29.350 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps look at
entity attachment and--

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:30.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:31.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Absolutely.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.715 align:middle line:84%
And often misdiagnosed
for schizophrenia--

00:13:34.715 --> 00:13:35.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:38.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: --plethora of
other mental illnesses,

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:43.000 align:middle line:84%
as could be low-level
entity attachment or more.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.370 align:middle line:84%
It could just be
spirit attachment,

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:48.310 align:middle line:84%
but whatever it
is it's cloaking.

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:54.850 align:middle line:84%
It's taking a form of
possession and the human now

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:56.740 align:middle line:90%
is not their free self.

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.910 align:middle line:90%
And so they are psychotic.

00:13:58.910 --> 00:13:59.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:01.010 align:middle line:90%
Very good point.

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:03.700 align:middle line:84%
So we're going on-- so we were
rummaging around in the mind.

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:05.020 align:middle line:90%
We're talking off camera.

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And this is a sad thing to
recognize in us, but it is.

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:11.950 align:middle line:84%
It's my observation, and
the research I've read

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:14.290 align:middle line:84%
is very similar to what
you know to be true,

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:19.090 align:middle line:84%
that 90% of what we do
where we think we're acting

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:24.190 align:middle line:84%
from our own choice is actually
reaction to subconscious

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:25.528 align:middle line:90%
events and programming.

00:14:25.528 --> 00:14:26.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: That's right.

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:30.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: 90%, meaning
10% genuine free will.

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:35.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: And it usually comes
when we're very present, very

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.360 align:middle line:90%
calm, and very relaxed.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:43.070 align:middle line:84%
In fact, all change,
all growth, all healing

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:45.710 align:middle line:84%
does begin with our
ability to relax.

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:52.670 align:middle line:84%
Upon relaxation, the energy
in the body loosens, blocks,

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.800 align:middle line:90%
feel a bit of relief.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And energy bubbles up into
the conscious awareness,

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.930 align:middle line:84%
good and bad energy,
but it gives us

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:07.730 align:middle line:84%
a point to call upon the inner
observer and just look at it

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:11.090 align:middle line:84%
and decide how we
want to handle it.

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:12.650 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
trauma happening.

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:13.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I just started to say.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: It's
not a bad thing.

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:15.410 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:18.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Trauma shakes
you free from your moorings

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.150 align:middle line:90%
in that hypnagogic state.

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:21.530 align:middle line:90%
These things kind of wake up.

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:22.330 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: And
sometimes a harsh wake

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:26.450 align:middle line:90%
up call is necessary.

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:30.650 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, it
leads us to a place

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:34.370 align:middle line:84%
where we can feel
some form of peace

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:39.600 align:middle line:84%
and love, self-love
and love for others.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.417 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of that lacking--

00:15:42.417 --> 00:15:43.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right now.

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: --because
we're all so externalized.

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:48.020 align:middle line:84%
It's all outside of
ourselves but internally.

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:50.670 align:middle line:84%
Me too, I often forget
to take care of myself.

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:53.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to do better
at that now because I

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.110 align:middle line:90%
take care of many other people.

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:59.100 align:middle line:84%
But we do all have to take
responsibility for how we look,

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:02.480 align:middle line:84%
feel, sound, act,
all of those things.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:08.210 align:middle line:84%
Gauge it, make a decision,
take an empowered step forward.

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:10.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
get into the mechanics

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:12.340 align:middle line:84%
then of how this works
between the subconscious.

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:14.132 align:middle line:84%
And I'll bring up a
personal example that's

00:16:14.132 --> 00:16:17.230 align:middle line:84%
somewhat vulnerable and
the ways in which things

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:20.810 align:middle line:84%
can express themselves
inexplicably in life.

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:22.960 align:middle line:90%
So this is the question.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.480 align:middle line:84%
Just because you've gone
in through hypnotherapy

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:28.900 align:middle line:84%
and you have discovered the
source of something that

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.180 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean it's
automatically transformed.

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: No, it
gives you awareness.

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:36.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: And then at
the point of awareness,

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:38.830 align:middle line:90%
we're able to see cause.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:41.380 align:middle line:90%
We already saw the effect.

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.900 align:middle line:84%
So now we understand
cause and effect.

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is why
talk therapy is good

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:48.280 align:middle line:84%
because it teaches
you cause and effect.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:51.220 align:middle line:84%
Talk therapy never hits
the emotional part.

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:53.480 align:middle line:84%
You can be told, oh,
do this or do that.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.380 align:middle line:84%
But then you're like, but
I still feel this way.

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:59.200 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't always hit
the emotional energy,

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.152 align:middle line:90%
but hypnotherapy does--

00:17:01.152 --> 00:17:02.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it does.

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:06.069 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: --move it into
that so that you can let go of

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:10.790 align:middle line:84%
and free yourself from
those beliefs and the hurt

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:16.880 align:middle line:84%
and the pain that prevent people
from growing or just living.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, or just living.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:22.054 align:middle line:84%
I'll share a little story
because it was so surprising.

00:17:22.054 --> 00:17:26.220 align:middle line:84%
So I had a little
hypnotherapy clinic years ago.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:28.710 align:middle line:84%
So I was able to do some
self-hypnosis as well pretty

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:29.510 align:middle line:90%
easily.

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And I had become
addicted to mochas,

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.810 align:middle line:84%
and I never drank
coffee till I was 40.

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:39.020 align:middle line:84%
And I was in a situation that
was very stressful on a home

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:41.900 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:45.170 align:middle line:90%
And he turned me on to mochas.

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, chocolate milk
and coffee, I couldn't do that.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And so I started drinking
and then became addicted.

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought, no, it's
like a year down the road,

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:56.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to do this
anymore, but I can't stop.

00:17:56.090 --> 00:18:00.200 align:middle line:84%
So I went into a little
session to hypnotize myself

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.030 align:middle line:90%
and just do something simple.

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:05.030 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know where the
craving was coming from.

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:08.690 align:middle line:84%
Boom, I'm in another lifetime
and I'm in a lifetime

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:11.660 align:middle line:84%
where there is
sexual abuse in a way

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:13.880 align:middle line:84%
that I was completely
vulnerable because I

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.740 align:middle line:84%
was more or less
adopted into the family

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.090 align:middle line:90%
and it was their son.

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And I would be turned
out-- and in those days,

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:20.900 align:middle line:90%
you are on the street.

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:23.130 align:middle line:84%
You don't survive if you're
turned out as a girl.

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And so after these incidents,
I would go downstairs

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.870 align:middle line:84%
where the galley was and
the women were cooking

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:32.450 align:middle line:84%
and they always made these
little vanilla cakes,

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:35.150 align:middle line:84%
but they mixed
together and they'd

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:38.870 align:middle line:84%
make for me pots of hot
chocolate and a pot of coffee

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:40.070 align:middle line:90%
to take upstairs.

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:41.420 align:middle line:90%
And I would blend them together.

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And this gave me kind of
a serotonin hit-- well,

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:48.890 align:middle line:84%
probably a dopamine hit too
to start bringing myself back

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:51.830 align:middle line:84%
in alignment from
feeling shattered.

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:55.280 align:middle line:84%
Not surprisingly I was having
a very challenging situation,

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.348 align:middle line:84%
that's the time I started
drinking mochas again.

00:18:57.348 --> 00:18:58.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: It's an elixir now.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:18:59.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was an elixir.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And anytime there's anything
super stressful in life--

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:05.670 align:middle line:84%
even now I'm not
addicted anymore,

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:07.880 align:middle line:84%
but I will still
turn to a mocha.

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:11.930 align:middle line:84%
It's so deeply programmed from
such deep trauma so long ago.

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:12.780 align:middle line:90%
But I don't mind.

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:13.580 align:middle line:90%
I like them.

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:17.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: And that's when
you now control the behavior

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.870 align:middle line:84%
and you enjoy the
mochas occasionally

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:22.985 align:middle line:84%
without having the
addiction part.

00:19:22.985 --> 00:19:24.110 align:middle line:90%
But it was just a program--

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:26.525 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Who would have guessed
all that is lying underneath--

00:19:26.525 --> 00:19:26.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Oh, yeah.

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:27.670 align:middle line:90%
Well--

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:30.755 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --a cup of chocolate
and an espresso together?

00:19:30.755 --> 00:19:31.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well,
you never know.

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:33.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I bring
it up to illustrate

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:37.610 align:middle line:84%
that that is how random and
surprising the subconscious is

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:39.800 align:middle line:84%
in what it holds and
how it might manifest

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.040 align:middle line:90%
in a seemingly innocuous way.

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:41.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Right.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't really
always come from this life,

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:45.320 align:middle line:90%
as you can tell.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:45.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:47.372 align:middle line:84%
A lot of it is from
other times we've

00:19:47.372 --> 00:19:48.657 align:middle line:90%
carried in the subconscious.

00:19:48.657 --> 00:19:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: And
that's interesting too

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:55.730 align:middle line:84%
because when we do come into
this life with our past life

00:19:55.730 --> 00:20:01.700 align:middle line:84%
energy, we're looking
at what we call karma.

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And karma, as most people know,
is a Sanskrit word for action.

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:11.180 align:middle line:84%
It means it's not tit for
tat like many people think.

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:13.220 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I did that, so I'm
going to have to suffer.

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:16.830 align:middle line:84%
Or I hurt this person, so
now I'm indebted to them.

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:17.630 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:19.713 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It can just be
deeply ingrained programs

00:20:19.713 --> 00:20:22.460 align:middle line:84%
that you haven't broken
free from showing up

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:23.360 align:middle line:90%
in the same role.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: If something
continues to come up,

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:26.570 align:middle line:90%
its lack of action.

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:26.840 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:27.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:28.190 align:middle line:90%
Lack of action.

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:29.495 align:middle line:90%
Lack of recognition--

00:20:29.495 --> 00:20:30.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Lack of action.

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:31.910 align:middle line:90%
You have not addressed it--

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:32.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Meaning
lack of action.

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:33.305 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: You have
not addressed it--

00:20:33.305 --> 00:20:33.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Often
because it's hidden.

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.008 align:middle line:84%
You don't even know it's
there and what's causing it.

00:20:36.008 --> 00:20:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: No, but
it does bleed through.

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And if we're more
observant, if people

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:44.223 align:middle line:84%
could take time in meditation
or other mindful practices,

00:20:44.223 --> 00:20:45.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You would find it.

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:47.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: --then
we do find it.

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:49.550 align:middle line:90%
And if we have good parents, OK?

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:51.830 align:middle line:84%
If you have good
parenting, you can

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:55.580 align:middle line:84%
recognize what is coming
from this life or past life.

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.300 align:middle line:84%
People do bring
me their children

00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.850 align:middle line:84%
and I'll tell you that is
the highest honor of any.

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:01.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:04.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: --to be allowed
to help them with the child.

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:05.700 align:middle line:90%
And we do see--

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:07.800 align:middle line:84%
I have a child now
that I'm working with.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:12.520 align:middle line:84%
He's got what they thought
were just night terrors.

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:14.050 align:middle line:90%
These are not night terrors.

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now we're going
to hop into that other--

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:16.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: These are past life.

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, OK.

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:21.190 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about that,
and then let's hop into also

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:22.960 align:middle line:84%
some of what people
are experiencing

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:25.240 align:middle line:84%
that aren't necessarily from
this plane or dimension.

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Sure.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.610 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of that.

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:27.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:28.870 align:middle line:90%
Just the night terrors.

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:30.700 align:middle line:84%
What you would instruct
a parent if they're

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.550 align:middle line:84%
seeing a child who doesn't have
the experience in the world

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:37.150 align:middle line:84%
to have had that kind of trauma
and traumatic response to life

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:39.580 align:middle line:84%
just yet, but they're
sure exhibiting it?

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:43.000 align:middle line:84%
How would you talk to a parent
of a child with night terrors?

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.365 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: When you see--

00:21:44.365 --> 00:21:47.740 align:middle line:84%
you have to understand
that when a child is

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:51.670 align:middle line:84%
locked in that energy,
they're in a hypnotic state.

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:54.130 align:middle line:90%
They're not in our world.

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:55.870 align:middle line:84%
They're not seeing
what we're seeing,

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:57.520 align:middle line:84%
they're not
addressing the parent.

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:01.850 align:middle line:84%
They are reacting to
something that we can't see.

00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And so it's very difficult
now to allow the child

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:08.440 align:middle line:90%
to be first safe.

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And then depending
on the child's age,

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:15.640 align:middle line:84%
we can begin to have them
articulate their experience.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.980 align:middle line:84%
But they're still
trapped in the fear

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:21.100 align:middle line:84%
and often they don't have the
right words to really describe

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:22.780 align:middle line:90%
what's happening.

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:27.730 align:middle line:84%
We just ask the parents always
to be patient, to be kind,

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:31.120 align:middle line:84%
but to just be present
and don't overreact.

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:32.620 align:middle line:90%
Don't raise your voice.

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:33.880 align:middle line:90%
Don't yell at your child.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:37.510 align:middle line:84%
Don't discipline them,
which we've seen that.

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:39.593 align:middle line:84%
I've told you to stop
screaming, while the child--

00:22:39.593 --> 00:22:40.968 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh,
that's so horrible.

00:22:40.968 --> 00:22:42.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: --child
doesn't know, sadly

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:44.470 align:middle line:90%
neither does the parent.

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:46.645 align:middle line:90%
So there's a level of education.

00:22:46.645 --> 00:22:49.580 align:middle line:84%
You have to take a test
to get a driver's license,

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:51.023 align:middle line:90%
but anybody can raise a child.

00:22:51.023 --> 00:22:51.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:55.000 align:middle line:10%
>>MCDONALD: And people who are
raising children right now,

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.510 align:middle line:10%
these parents have to be more
observant, more educated,

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:02.870 align:middle line:10%
more aware than at any
other time in our history,

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:06.490 align:middle line:10%
not just for safety reasons
because we know how many

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:08.010 align:middle line:10%
of them there are--

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:08.990 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: But also--

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:09.850 align:middle line:10%
>>MCDONALD:
--vulnerable situations.

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:10.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:12.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: But there
are other things

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:13.622 align:middle line:84%
that the children
are being subjected

00:23:13.622 --> 00:23:20.690 align:middle line:84%
to, energy, media,
both online media

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:24.130 align:middle line:84%
programming and programming
through television that they

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:24.930 align:middle line:90%
watch.

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:25.805 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:23:25.805 --> 00:23:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And that quote, dimensional
veils are thinner now.

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And where more interaction
is taking place

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:35.845 align:middle line:90%
than in times past.

00:23:35.845 --> 00:23:37.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: And
I think we should

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:41.330 align:middle line:84%
expect that and the cosmology
of the universe and the universe

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:43.850 align:middle line:84%
always being in a
state of expansion.

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:47.690 align:middle line:84%
The energies are cosmic
rays that the Earth

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:49.730 align:middle line:90%
is receiving is changing.

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:55.580 align:middle line:84%
These will create what people
refer to as a thinning,

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:57.890 align:middle line:90%
and it is in essence a thinning.

00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:00.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And even kind of
perforations in a way as well.

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:01.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Right.

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:02.120 align:middle line:90%
Things are coming through--

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:02.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, they are.

00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:04.495 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: --and
we're being affected.

00:24:04.495 --> 00:24:05.570 align:middle line:90%
So it is time now.

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And we're getting closer
to that 10 billion mark

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:10.790 align:middle line:84%
and we know we've talked
before about that being

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:12.560 align:middle line:90%
an evolutionary step.

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.750 align:middle line:84%
As the population
gets to 10 billion,

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:17.900 align:middle line:84%
that creates a quanta
specific amount of energy

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:21.480 align:middle line:84%
at the natural
evolution in humans.

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And this is the time that
most societies prior to ours

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.990 align:middle line:90%
have collapsed.

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:33.410 align:middle line:84%
They have not been able
to take that 10 billion

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:35.840 align:middle line:90%
mark and beyond.

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:41.750 align:middle line:84%
But there's an opportunity for a
gentle collective understanding

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:45.140 align:middle line:84%
of the humans because
it's necessary.

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:51.050 align:middle line:84%
If we can't do this how
on earth, no pun intended,

00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:55.570 align:middle line:84%
how on earth are we to
compete galactically?

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:58.190 align:middle line:90%


00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:00.620 align:middle line:84%
Because that will
come eventually.

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:04.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the first thing will
be an exchange of information.

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:06.813 align:middle line:84%
After that, an exchange
of goods, products.

00:25:06.813 --> 00:25:08.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I mean,
probably the good side

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:12.270 align:middle line:84%
of the explosion of access
to information and knowledge

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:15.510 align:middle line:84%
is that we can raise
ourselves as a species

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:middle line:84%
more quickly if we
handle it in a mature way

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.180 align:middle line:90%
and not a mind deadening way.

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And these are choices
we have to make.

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:23.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: And this all
comes back right to parenting.

00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:26.610 align:middle line:84%
We have to raise
our children to be

00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:29.370 align:middle line:84%
open to that form
of a mindset, which

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:34.380 align:middle line:84%
we have to make them more
self-accepting and less

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:36.030 align:middle line:90%
judgmental.

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Without judgment,
there's seldom conflict.

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:41.820 align:middle line:90%
Conflict comes from judgment.

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:46.620 align:middle line:84%
Oh, your religion is stupid
or your culture is weird.

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:47.482 align:middle line:90%
Ours is better.

00:25:47.482 --> 00:25:53.130 align:middle line:84%
So that's judgment and
that creates conflict.

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:56.890 align:middle line:84%
If we're empowered
enough to be relaxed

00:25:56.890 --> 00:26:01.970 align:middle line:84%
with who and what we are, there
is no need to change others.

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:05.960 align:middle line:84%
We can simply allow them
to believe or worship or do

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:09.290 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is that
they want and still have

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:13.520 align:middle line:84%
a passive collective
consciousness among us.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:17.690 align:middle line:84%
Because after all,
we're all human, mostly,

00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:20.180 align:middle line:90%
and we all want the same things.

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:21.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:22.400 align:middle line:90%
At the core, we do.

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:24.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: At the core,
we all want the same thing.

00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:26.037 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about those kind

00:26:26.037 --> 00:26:27.290 align:middle line:90%
of perforations and thinning.

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And why are there more
non-human entities

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:34.400 align:middle line:84%
now coming in among the
clients that you're seeing?

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: It's
their own thoughts.

00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:44.570 align:middle line:84%
There are universal laws and
our thoughts can create energy

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:47.270 align:middle line:90%
and we can attract energy.

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:52.780 align:middle line:84%
You have to be able to
resonate, create harmonics,

00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:55.930 align:middle line:84%
a balance between
energy for there

00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:59.080 align:middle line:90%
to be a flow of communication.

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:02.380 align:middle line:84%
The energies on each side
have to have similarities.

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There has
to be resonance.

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:06.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: There
has to be resonance.

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:10.150 align:middle line:84%
We have nowhere to
look but ourselves.

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:12.403 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now that brings
me to another point

00:27:12.403 --> 00:27:14.570 align:middle line:84%
before we get to the fact
that a lot of these people

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:17.730 align:middle line:84%
have been traumatized
in their lives.

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And that is, is it possible
that a lot of the people that

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.550 align:middle line:84%
are being contacted
actually have

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:28.190 align:middle line:84%
some roots with the
people that are coming,

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:29.810 align:middle line:84%
the beings that
are coming to them?

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:32.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: It depends on
what beings specifically, OK?

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, let's
talk about the difference,

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:36.470 align:middle line:84%
whether it's
someone that you may

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:40.025 align:middle line:84%
have an unconscious soul kind
of understanding resonance

00:27:40.025 --> 00:27:41.900 align:middle line:84%
and agreement with and
they're coming through

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:44.720 align:middle line:84%
to connect with you for either
their learning or your growth

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:49.010 align:middle line:84%
versus one that is maybe a
little bit more predatory.

00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:51.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: OK, so
if we're talking

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:56.870 align:middle line:84%
interdimensional or discarnate
entities, or extraterrestrial,

00:27:56.870 --> 00:28:01.610 align:middle line:84%
or just pure energy
beings, just those four

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:07.700 align:middle line:84%
all have their own
specific reasons,

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:10.550 align:middle line:84%
each for different
things depending

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:14.940 align:middle line:84%
on the frequency of the energy
and how it affects the human.

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:16.430 align:middle line:90%
But there is a connection.

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:21.020 align:middle line:84%
So like the soul connection
to, say, an ET race,

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:22.820 align:middle line:90%
it could be very ancient.

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And so you would want to be open
to that form of communication,

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:32.550 align:middle line:84%
education, and a
mutual exchange.

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:39.460 align:middle line:84%
However, if the protocol for
that exchange isn't followed,

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:42.250 align:middle line:90%
then we risk being tricked.

00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:44.320 align:middle line:90%
Now there are universal laws.

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:45.940 align:middle line:84%
Because there are
universal laws,

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:48.370 align:middle line:90%
there are universal loopholes.

00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And the human being
uneducated in its infancy

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:57.160 align:middle line:84%
still, not fully understanding
the universal laws,

00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:58.570 align:middle line:90%
can be tricked.

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And with that, they then
need to be educated.

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.640 align:middle line:84%
Though many ETs will
come and they will

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:10.280 align:middle line:84%
claim to be family
members or this or that.

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:11.320 align:middle line:90%
And it's not true.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.970 align:middle line:90%
Aliens lie.

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:14.510 align:middle line:90%
That's a fact.

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:19.310 align:middle line:84%
We've seen them lie and
that's all there is to it.

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:22.270 align:middle line:84%
But depending on where the
extraterrestrial race is coming

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:24.910 align:middle line:84%
from, in our specific
universe, there

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:29.710 align:middle line:84%
are five main ET races
that are primarily

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:34.060 align:middle line:84%
responsible for abduction, or
to be taken against the will,

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:36.850 align:middle line:84%
or for any of the hybridization
programs, the harvesting

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:40.900 align:middle line:84%
of genetics, as well as
the psychological programs

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:42.340 align:middle line:90%
that they're pushing people.

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:45.520 align:middle line:84%
Now people who are
being affected right

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:49.690 align:middle line:84%
now and they're
afraid, this could

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:52.630 align:middle line:84%
be another part of
the ET programming

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:55.990 align:middle line:84%
because what happens
to some humans

00:29:55.990 --> 00:30:00.940 align:middle line:84%
if they're pushed too far,
that human exhibits superhuman

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:04.390 align:middle line:90%
strength or superhuman clarity.

00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Not only all of a
sudden have we activated

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:13.630 align:middle line:84%
some form of higher
psychism, we can push back

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:16.360 align:middle line:90%
without using physical force.

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:17.560 align:middle line:90%
It's mental.

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:19.100 align:middle line:90%
It's in the mind.

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And this is what they're very
interested in at this point.

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:26.830 align:middle line:84%
For years, it was mostly
the hybridization.

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:31.120 align:middle line:84%
Now it's said humans
who exhibit high levels

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:36.260 align:middle line:84%
of psychic ability-- and I
myself would never call myself

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:37.060 align:middle line:90%
a psychic.

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:40.690 align:middle line:84%
I'd say I'm intuitive, I'm
sensitive, I'm experienced.

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:44.620 align:middle line:84%
But under certain
moments, I have seen

00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:46.930 align:middle line:90%
that happen even within myself.

00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:48.850 align:middle line:90%
Something is irritating me.

00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:53.560 align:middle line:84%
I've pointed at things to
stop them and it's happened.

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:54.530 align:middle line:90%
It's simple.

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:57.010 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a
telekinetic type of--

00:30:57.010 --> 00:30:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, well,
people can go back

00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:01.270 align:middle line:84%
and listen to one of our
previous conversations

00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:04.040 align:middle line:84%
and understand you didn't come
into this life in a normal way

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:04.550 align:middle line:90%
anyway.

00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:05.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: That's true.

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:07.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now I want
to go into that story,

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:11.540 align:middle line:84%
but I want to backtrack a
little bit to the 1980s and '90s

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:13.250 align:middle line:90%
when you were reading a lot.

00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:15.080 align:middle line:84%
John Mack was
doing a lot of work

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:18.020 align:middle line:84%
and we were reading a lot
about the abduction phenomena

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:21.720 align:middle line:90%
and the hybridization programs.

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:25.790 align:middle line:84%
So if there were
offspring, those offspring

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:30.940 align:middle line:84%
would be, what, 30,
40 years old now.

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:33.850 align:middle line:84%
Are you seeing
anything regarding

00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:36.580 align:middle line:90%
the beings that were created?

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Do they have relationships
ever with these parents?

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:41.050 align:middle line:84%
Does it happen
interdimensionally?

00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:44.650 align:middle line:84%
What happens after
the baby, the child is

00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:47.590 align:middle line:90%
brought into whomever's world?

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:49.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Now what
I'm seeing right now

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:56.350 align:middle line:84%
is the offspring of the hybrid
child that lives off planet.

00:31:56.350 --> 00:32:02.140 align:middle line:84%
The parents now wanting me to
help them form a communication.

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:05.230 align:middle line:84%
They know their
eggs were harvested.

00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:10.180 align:middle line:84%
They've dreamed, they've
sensed small alien children.

00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:15.310 align:middle line:84%
They described them as having
very thin, wispy hair, almost

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:19.330 align:middle line:84%
balding-like, a larger
than normal eyes, but human

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:20.860 align:middle line:90%
looking eyes.

00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And they want relationships,
they desire a connection

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:30.980 align:middle line:84%
to the human part of
that hybrid child.

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:34.180 align:middle line:84%
So the adult parent
at that time, those

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:36.370 align:middle line:84%
are the ones who are
very interested in where

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:37.900 align:middle line:90%
those offspring are.

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:42.970 align:middle line:84%
The offspring that were left
here or born here that came in

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:48.790 align:middle line:84%
are more sensitive, more aware
and do display higher levels

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:50.170 align:middle line:90%
of psychic ability.

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:51.890 align:middle line:90%
We all have that.

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:53.930 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
many people are saying

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:57.650 align:middle line:84%
is as the universe is expanding
and the cosmic energy is

00:32:57.650 --> 00:33:01.250 align:middle line:84%
changing, it's creating
a disintegration

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:04.430 align:middle line:84%
of the calcification
on the pineal gland.

00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And this is allowing a more
telepathic communication.

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:15.110 align:middle line:84%
So telepathy is number
one in psychic ability.

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:19.280 align:middle line:84%
The years that I spent
learning in a Buddhist temple,

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:25.160 align:middle line:84%
one of the trainings was in
telepathy and it was with ants.

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:31.670 align:middle line:84%
They say that ants are a
hive-minded insect in that you

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:35.080 align:middle line:84%
can affect the hive by
projecting energy into it.

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:36.720 align:middle line:90%
So these were some of the tests.

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.420 align:middle line:90%
But telepathy is number one.

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:41.940 align:middle line:84%
It's the lowest of
energies when we

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:45.600 align:middle line:84%
come to telepathy because even
people who have discovered

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:49.320 align:middle line:84%
that they have other
abilities, they still

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:53.730 align:middle line:84%
are telepathic because that
is the universal language.

00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:55.650 align:middle line:90%
It is telepathy.

00:33:55.650 --> 00:33:58.830 align:middle line:84%
It's also the common
denominator among

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:02.190 align:middle line:84%
every spiritual
or religious thing

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:04.230 align:middle line:84%
that's ever happened
on our Earth.

00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:10.300 align:middle line:84%
Telepathic beings from the stars
came here, those two things.

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:11.550 align:middle line:90%
And so the same thing.

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:14.040 align:middle line:84%
Now we see these telepathic
beings living here.

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And where do they
claim to come from?

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:17.659 align:middle line:90%
The stars.

00:34:17.659 --> 00:34:20.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so you started
to say a bit ago and we'll just

00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:23.810 align:middle line:84%
wrap that part up that the
beings coming are intrigued

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:26.630 align:middle line:90%
with our abilities that develop.

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:28.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah,
not the good ones.

00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:28.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:28.930 --> 00:34:34.229 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: So the abductor
races say Reptilian, Tall Grey.

00:34:34.229 --> 00:34:37.850 align:middle line:84%
They are concerned with
our abilities to do that.

00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:44.389 align:middle line:84%
Because of course, anything can
be weaponized, even telepathy.

00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And you can hurt people by
sending telepathic messages.

00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:57.150 align:middle line:84%
You can create
disbelieving thoughts

00:34:57.150 --> 00:35:02.010 align:middle line:84%
and you can break somebody
down outside of their awareness

00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:03.120 align:middle line:90%
by doing this.

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:07.297 align:middle line:84%
It can be done using telepathy
and also synthetic telepathy.

00:35:07.297 --> 00:35:09.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But why would they
be threatened or concerned,

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:11.190 align:middle line:84%
unless we were to
use it against them?

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:13.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Because
that's exactly what we do

00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:15.030 align:middle line:84%
is we use it against
them when we're

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:19.980 align:middle line:84%
cornered or afraid or
unable to protect ourselves.

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's spontaneous and
that's the difference.

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:27.750 align:middle line:84%
OK, so it's a spontaneous
telepathy that they see

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:29.530 align:middle line:84%
and you never know
what's going to happen.

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:30.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And this was played
with especially

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:36.600 align:middle line:84%
behind the Iron Curtain
of the Soviet Union.

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:39.420 align:middle line:84%
They had programs such
as remote strangulation

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:41.970 align:middle line:84%
that they were using,
using telepathy

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:45.930 align:middle line:84%
to strangle someone to a point
of unconsciousness and death.

00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:47.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've been
working with this

00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:50.340 align:middle line:84%
and this kind of black magic
has been on this planet

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:53.280 align:middle line:84%
for a long time, but it
was only among the few.

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Now you're saying, as
these people have contact,

00:35:56.190 --> 00:36:02.500 align:middle line:84%
as these people start becoming
unconsciously upgraded,

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:06.520 align:middle line:84%
their fear alone can take
that and [WHOOSH] right back.

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:10.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: And that is part
of the ascension process

00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:16.810 align:middle line:84%
for the human is understanding
their ability to move thoughts

00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:18.460 align:middle line:90%
and to control their thoughts.

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:20.020 align:middle line:90%
Now, we're not our thoughts.

00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:21.820 align:middle line:90%
We're our actions.

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:27.370 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is that to
control them so that we

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:30.260 align:middle line:90%
don't cause harm to others.

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And if that's part
of the ascension,

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:35.890 align:middle line:84%
then it's quite clear our
thoughts being projected.

00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And now say there's 10 of
us all on the same page

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:44.860 align:middle line:84%
projecting either a very
positive thought or a very

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:45.850 align:middle line:90%
negative one.

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:48.190 align:middle line:90%
You will see results.

00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:53.500 align:middle line:84%
For some reason, negative
thoughts manifest more rapidly.

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:54.677 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're denser.

00:36:54.677 --> 00:36:55.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Heavier.

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:56.005 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're heavier.

00:36:56.005 --> 00:36:56.365 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: That's right.

00:36:56.365 --> 00:36:57.295 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:36:57.295 --> 00:36:58.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not as ephemeral.

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:00.400 align:middle line:84%
It takes more time
for the ephemeral

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:01.600 align:middle line:90%
to become concretized.

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: But
that negative weight

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.200 align:middle line:90%
just drops right in there.

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:09.520 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now we're getting toward
sort of a little bit of how to

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:11.560 align:middle line:84%
toward the end of
our conversation.

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:13.930 align:middle line:84%
Most everybody finds
themselves, OK, we

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:15.400 align:middle line:90%
get we're being upgraded.

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.920 align:middle line:84%
We are upgraded
being-- not being,

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:19.270 align:middle line:90%
we're upgrading ourselves to.

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:21.040 align:middle line:84%
We're working with
our own consciousness

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:23.530 align:middle line:84%
and our minds are
becoming even more potent.

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:25.660 align:middle line:84%
But what we're seeing
around us can also

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:29.800 align:middle line:84%
result in more destruction
or if we're responsible,

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.000 align:middle line:90%
more upliftment.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.390 align:middle line:84%
So how do we break
the mind loops

00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:38.860 align:middle line:84%
that we get into that drive
us crazy, these negative loops

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:42.310 align:middle line:84%
that we get into that
really take our energy away

00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:47.020 align:middle line:84%
and denude our ability to
use our mind in a clear way

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:47.978 align:middle line:90%
and with free will?

00:37:47.978 --> 00:37:49.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Got to override it.

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:50.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
let's talk about it.

00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: You override that.

00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:53.540 align:middle line:84%
You can do it a couple
of different ways.

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:55.120 align:middle line:10%
I've created a
program that I use

00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:58.720 align:middle line:10%
in people who are very stuck
in self-defeating thought

00:37:58.720 --> 00:37:59.890 align:middle line:10%
processes.

00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:01.660 align:middle line:90%
It's called a stop thought.

00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And I've created a
technique that they

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:09.550 align:middle line:84%
can sense the prethought before
it becomes a full thought so it

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:11.260 align:middle line:90%
can redirect the energy.

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:13.480 align:middle line:84%
Because we all know
that's not a road

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:17.020 align:middle line:84%
anybody needs to go
down, especially if it's

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:18.735 align:middle line:90%
not beneficial or serving any--

00:38:18.735 --> 00:38:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What a
waste of a life.

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:21.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: And energy.

00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:23.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and
energy and a mind.

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:24.580 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: And a mind.

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:25.870 align:middle line:90%
It's very sad.

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:29.440 align:middle line:84%
But people do suffer
from depression,

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:33.100 align:middle line:84%
which causes anxiety, which
causes more depression

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:34.150 align:middle line:90%
and it's a vicious cycle.

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:35.442 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a vicious cycle.

00:38:35.442 --> 00:38:38.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: But the thing
is it's not a hard cycle

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:43.650 align:middle line:84%
to break once you
believe that you can.

00:38:43.650 --> 00:38:44.760 align:middle line:90%
Now here's education.

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:49.290 align:middle line:90%
Look at, say, a 12-step program.

00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:52.740 align:middle line:84%
They will leave you believing
that for the rest of your life,

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:55.050 align:middle line:90%
you're an alcoholic.

00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:57.570 align:middle line:90%
That is not right.

00:38:57.570 --> 00:39:01.240 align:middle line:84%
You should be able to celebrate
the freedom of breaking

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:02.040 align:middle line:90%
a program--

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:02.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Freedom.

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:02.490 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:04.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: --and
creating new energy

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:06.540 align:middle line:84%
and living a new life,
not trapped in one.

00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Because what, they don't
believe that you won't

00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:11.080 align:middle line:90%
be able to not stick with that?

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:13.740 align:middle line:84%
So there should be a
13-step, and I've got it

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:15.420 align:middle line:90%
if they've ever want to know.

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:17.303 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, if they're
listening, call you.

00:39:17.303 --> 00:39:18.345 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: [LAUGHS] Yes.

00:39:18.345 --> 00:39:20.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's
talk about your hack

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:24.570 align:middle line:84%
about moving through fear
because right now people can go

00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:26.410 align:middle line:90%
into fear on a lot of levels.

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:28.800 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about fear
and how you hack that.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: OK, well,
most fear isn't real.

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:32.460 align:middle line:90%
That's it right there.

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:36.060 align:middle line:84%
OK, there's a simple process
working with your solar plexus.

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:40.920 align:middle line:84%
Solar plexus really is a
seat of your divine power

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:44.200 align:middle line:90%
and using the right use of will.

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:48.820 align:middle line:84%
See, there's willpower, but
there's the right use of will.

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:52.480 align:middle line:84%
The right use of will
is internal alignment.

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:54.610 align:middle line:90%
So I teach meditation.

00:39:54.610 --> 00:40:00.310 align:middle line:84%
I teach meditation to a lot of
different classes of people.

00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And some people are very anxious
to get into a meditative,

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.600 align:middle line:84%
and they'll be like,
come on, inner peace.

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:09.430 align:middle line:90%
And how come it's not working?

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:10.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, OK.

00:40:10.490 --> 00:40:11.290 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:12.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Go for a walk.

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:12.960 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:17.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: You can see that
that mindset isn't helpful,

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:18.450 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:24.840 align:middle line:84%
So when you can teach the
mind and train the mind

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:27.480 align:middle line:84%
that you're the
master and that you

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.340 align:middle line:84%
want to use the
right use of will,

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:34.710 align:middle line:84%
that angst wrong use of
will, if you're on a diet--

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:37.200 align:middle line:84%
and oh, I can only
eat so many calories.

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:38.015 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm hungry.

00:40:38.015 --> 00:40:39.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be
hungry all night.

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:41.160 align:middle line:90%
Wrong use of will.

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:43.680 align:middle line:84%
You're setting yourself
up for failure.

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:47.730 align:middle line:84%
All levels of your consciousness
are not in alignment

00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:50.325 align:middle line:90%
or there would be no will.

00:40:50.325 --> 00:40:52.800 align:middle line:90%
It would be at ease.

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
right use of will.

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:59.130 align:middle line:84%
So understanding the
difference and moving

00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:01.350 align:middle line:90%
into the right use of will.

00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:05.920 align:middle line:84%
You go into the solar plexus
and you simply ask yourself,

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:09.670 align:middle line:90%
what am I afraid of?

00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:14.140 align:middle line:84%
Let the answer effervescently
bubble up into your awareness,

00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:19.230 align:middle line:84%
observe it, look at
it, then ask yourself,

00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:23.980 align:middle line:84%
is that a real fear
or an imagined fear?

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And if it's a real
fear, then you

00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:28.930 align:middle line:84%
move back in and ask
yourself, then what

00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:32.040 align:middle line:90%
is my next empowered step?

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:35.640 align:middle line:84%
But if it's not a real fear,
it's therefore imagined

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:38.780 align:middle line:90%
and you simply disengage.

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:44.030 align:middle line:84%
You disengage because
the mind is visual.

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:47.120 align:middle line:84%
See yourself
unplugging something,

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:49.970 align:middle line:90%
disconnect, disengage.

00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:52.430 align:middle line:90%
It's not real.

00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:55.910 align:middle line:84%
The conscious critical
beta brainwave,

00:41:55.910 --> 00:42:01.160 align:middle line:84%
allow that now to see that real
fear as opposed to imagine.

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:03.420 align:middle line:90%
Imagine fear sounds like this.

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:04.318 align:middle line:90%
What if that happens?

00:42:04.318 --> 00:42:05.360 align:middle line:90%
This has happened before.

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:06.920 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to go
down that road again.

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:08.462 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
subconscious chatter.

00:42:08.462 --> 00:42:13.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Imagined
fear, not real, OK?

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:15.230 align:middle line:90%
So you must disengage.

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And respectfully
because the subconscious

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:21.033 align:middle line:84%
is there trying to protect
us, trying to help us survive.

00:42:21.033 --> 00:42:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, oh,
this happened before.

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:24.290 align:middle line:84%
Something like it
could happen again.

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And it is chattering
all the time,

00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:28.110 align:middle line:84%
but so is the
invitation to go higher.

00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:28.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Right.

00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:31.840 align:middle line:10%
Well, so when the
mind is saying,

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:36.240 align:middle line:10%
oh, this has happened before,
that's a reference point.

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:39.180 align:middle line:10%
Though, it'll never be
under the same circumstances

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:42.180 align:middle line:10%
because you can never
enter the same river twice.

00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:46.080 align:middle line:90%
So it's not real.

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:48.030 align:middle line:90%
It's just history.

00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:50.560 align:middle line:84%
OK, so it doesn't
have to affect you.

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And so understanding
that you can discern

00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:56.760 align:middle line:90%
real fear from imagined fear.

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:59.370 align:middle line:84%
Then ask yourself,
if it's real, then

00:42:59.370 --> 00:43:01.650 align:middle line:90%
what is my next empowered step?

00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:03.780 align:middle line:84%
Your mind will
give you the answer

00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:07.300 align:middle line:90%
only upon asking the question.

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:10.680 align:middle line:84%
If you don't sit with yourself
and don't ask the questions,

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:12.690 align:middle line:84%
then you're going to
be left in the fear

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:14.760 align:middle line:84%
and nobody should have
to live like that.

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:17.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, just go in
and your body will tell you.

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: 20 minutes a day--

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:19.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
where we started.

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:21.188 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: --of meditation
is all we all need.

00:43:21.188 --> 00:43:22.272 align:middle line:90%
If you can do more, great.

00:43:22.272 --> 00:43:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And some people
argue even 10 minutes a day.

00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:26.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: But
make it specific.

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:28.710 align:middle line:84%
Carve the time for
the peace and quiet.

00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:31.950 align:middle line:84%
10 minutes if you've been doing
it for a long time, no problem.

00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:33.283 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, do what you can.

00:43:33.283 --> 00:43:34.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Do what you can.

00:43:34.450 --> 00:43:36.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Final thoughts
before we say goodbye.

00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:39.003 align:middle line:84%
You've done a beautiful job
articulating these things.

00:43:39.003 --> 00:43:39.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Thank you.

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:44.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, my final thoughts really
at this point in our history

00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:46.870 align:middle line:90%
we are at a crossroads.

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:50.020 align:middle line:84%
We're going to make it or
we're going to break it.

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And we need to take steps
forward collectively

00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:58.960 align:middle line:84%
from that non-judgmental
accepting position.

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:03.400 align:middle line:84%
When we do live in that mind,
we're not shaming other people,

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:05.170 align:middle line:90%
we're not blaming them.

00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:08.440 align:middle line:84%
We're simply taking
responsibility for ourselves.

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:10.700 align:middle line:84%
We're not beating
ourselves up for it.

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:13.490 align:middle line:90%
We accept it and we make change.

00:44:13.490 --> 00:44:14.740 align:middle line:90%
It's called growth.

00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:16.330 align:middle line:90%
It's time to grow.

00:44:16.330 --> 00:44:18.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Time to grow up.

00:44:18.310 --> 00:44:21.340 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much, Laurie, for
taking time to be here again.

00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:21.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: It's my pleasure.

00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:22.270 align:middle line:90%
