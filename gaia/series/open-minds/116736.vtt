00:00:27.734 --> 00:00:30.150 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: Few subjects
have drawn more attention

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.310 align:middle line:10%
and curiosity than that of
disclosure of extraterrestrial

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.720 align:middle line:10%
presence on Earth.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.690 align:middle line:84%
Having been at the original
disclosure event in 2001

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.930 align:middle line:84%
in Washington, DC,
the hope was that it

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.270 align:middle line:90%
would have happened long ago.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.700 align:middle line:84%
But here we are, 2015, and
there are still no signs

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.810 align:middle line:84%
that official entities
will be forthcoming

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.580 align:middle line:90%
with this information.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.670 align:middle line:84%
Ken Cherry demonstrates why in
his new book, "The Stephenville

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.720 align:middle line:84%
UFO," a thinly disguised
work of fiction.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.150 align:middle line:84%
I have to say, I
research a lot, and it

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.470 align:middle line:84%
was really refreshing to be
able to glean information out

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.740 align:middle line:90%
of a fast-paced work of fiction.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.807 align:middle line:84%
Is that the first work
of fiction you've done?

00:01:05.807 --> 00:01:06.890 align:middle line:90%
>> KEN CHERRY: Yes, it is.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.070 align:middle line:10%
I wrote a financial
column for 27 years.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, wow.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.390 align:middle line:84%
That might be a little
drier than this.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.949 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Little bit.

00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:17.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So first of all, tell
us a little background about

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.370 align:middle line:84%
your own life and what intrigued
you about the subject of UFOS

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:22.340 align:middle line:90%
at the very beginning.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.300 align:middle line:90%


00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.900 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: I was an investment
adviser for 26 years,

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.420 align:middle line:84%
and I had an interest in UFOs
because of an incident that

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.240 align:middle line:84%
occurred when I was
about seven years old.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.424 align:middle line:84%
I never really shared
that with my clients.

00:01:40.424 --> 00:01:41.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Good thing.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.673 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: They might not
want me to handle their money.

00:01:43.673 --> 00:01:48.400 align:middle line:84%
But at any rate, when
I was about seven,

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.360 align:middle line:84%
I was alone on a
ranch at the time,

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.920 align:middle line:84%
and came through into a
clearing and looked up.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.380 align:middle line:84%
And there was this
silvery object

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.340 align:middle line:84%
going across the
horizon, just slowly.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And of course, at
that age, I had

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.220 align:middle line:84%
no comprehension of
the types of vehicles,

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.430 align:middle line:84%
or aircraft, or
anything of that nature.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.750 align:middle line:84%
Next thing I know, there
was this craft coming down

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.050 align:middle line:84%
at a very rapid speed
toward the silvery object.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if it
was the glint of the sun

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.720 align:middle line:84%
or if there was some
interaction between the object

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.260 align:middle line:84%
and the craft, but there was,
like, a lightning or something.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.650 align:middle line:84%
Next thing I knew, the pilot
of the plane bailed out,

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.640 align:middle line:84%
and the craft started
billowing smoke

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.120 align:middle line:90%
and crashed into the ground.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.730 align:middle line:90%
The silvery object took off.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.290 align:middle line:90%


00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.160 align:middle line:84%
Back in those days, kids
were to be heard-- I mean,

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.560 align:middle line:90%
to be seen and not heard.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.700 align:middle line:84%
So I really never had a chance
to discuss it with anybody.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.630 align:middle line:84%
But whenever my parents would
get together with neighbors,

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.180 align:middle line:84%
all they could talk about
was rescuing this pilot

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.730 align:middle line:90%
from the trees.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And I later realized that
this was one of our early jets

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:07.830 align:middle line:84%
that had-- it tried to attack
or force down a flying saucer.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And this would have been
about 1952, when we still

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.190 align:middle line:84%
had this order standing-- force
them down or shoot them down.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.950 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it never
really worked.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.170 align:middle line:84%
At one point, I
think General Chidlaw

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.740 align:middle line:84%
said we were losing
an aircraft a day

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.090 align:middle line:84%
around the world trying
to force down saucers.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.610 align:middle line:90%
So they finally gave up on that.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And the saucers, apparently,
we're just in defensive mode.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.360 align:middle line:84%
But at any rate,
later in life, when

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.910 align:middle line:84%
I had time to
pursue these things,

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.320 align:middle line:84%
I became involved with the
Mutual UFO Network, where

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.300 align:middle line:84%
we were supplied a steady
number of witness reports

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.320 align:middle line:90%
to investigate--

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.755 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Better
known as MUFON.

00:03:57.755 --> 00:04:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: Better
known as MUFON, yes.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.864 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:04:00.864 --> 00:04:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting--
we're going

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.772 align:middle line:84%
to get back to the notion
of jets in pursuit of craft

00:04:05.772 --> 00:04:07.230 align:middle line:84%
because the stories
start changing.

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.960 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Yes.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And when you were
saying "a silvery thing,"

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.570 align:middle line:84%
it just reminded me of
something that was really weird.

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.380 align:middle line:84%
When my husband and I at
the time were in London,

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:23.260 align:middle line:84%
we saw these silvery--
whatever they were-- moving

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.050 align:middle line:84%
kind of erratically,
but they kept

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.870 align:middle line:84%
moving in and out of
the chemtrails that

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.560 align:middle line:90%
were in the sky over London.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.720 align:middle line:84%
They'd dart in, dart
out, and then blink out.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And there were half a
dozen or so of them.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And this went on
for a while, and we

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.350 align:middle line:84%
were on Portobello Road
and kind of dumbfounded,

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.770 align:middle line:90%
standing there, looking at them.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.540 align:middle line:84%
The weird thing was
no one looked up.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:45.670 align:middle line:90%
No one looked up.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.080 align:middle line:84%
If you're standing like--
oh, my god-- like that,

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.871 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't you'd think
someone would look up?

00:04:49.871 --> 00:04:51.607 align:middle line:90%
Later on, we went to Hyde Park.

00:04:51.607 --> 00:04:52.690 align:middle line:90%
Same thing happened again.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.190 align:middle line:84%
They disappeared and came
back in the afternoon.

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And we're standing in
the park looking at them,

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.200 align:middle line:84%
and some man came up to us
and said, "Don't do that.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.300 align:middle line:90%
It'll frighten the children."

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.660 align:middle line:90%
No one else looked up.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:05.830 align:middle line:90%
No, he didn't even look up.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.949 align:middle line:84%
That's all he said
and then left.

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:09.490 align:middle line:84%
Don't you think
that's kind of weird?

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:10.950 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: That's very odd, yes.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The whole thing was
this whole notion of, it's not

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.310 align:middle line:84%
within our realm of thinking,
so we just turn a blind eye.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And in the case of
Londoners, didn't even

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.680 align:middle line:84%
bother looking up from
their daily routine.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.060 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Right.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.680 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, now, you ended
up deeply involved with MUFON.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about your
tenure there and what

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.730 align:middle line:84%
you felt you were doing
and the charge of MUFON

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:38.460 align:middle line:84%
was compared to what ended
up being your reality.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.060 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: I became the state
director there for about 12

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.350 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And over that period of
time, we handled hundreds,

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.850 align:middle line:84%
if not thousands, of sighting
reports, investigated them.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:55.440 align:middle line:84%
At one time, I had over 40
investigators in the state.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.350 align:middle line:90%


00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.630 align:middle line:84%
Primarily, they were
individuals who would say,

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.160 align:middle line:84%
I went outside for a
smoke, and I saw something.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And routinely, we
would check to see

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.500 align:middle line:84%
if there was any
explanation for it,

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.310 align:middle line:84%
whether it be satellite
or an aircraft

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.820 align:middle line:84%
in the area, or just
something of that nature--

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.920 align:middle line:84%
a celestial event or
something of that nature.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:26.330 align:middle line:84%
So for the most part, that
was the typical type of thing.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.190 align:middle line:84%
A less usual would
be where there

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:32.820 align:middle line:84%
were a group of people who would
report that three or four of us

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.560 align:middle line:84%
saw something, and that
becomes more significant.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And we had a number of
those over the years

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.210 align:middle line:90%
that I was state director.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:47.200 align:middle line:84%
But in 2008, after I had been
the director for about 10 years

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.760 align:middle line:84%
or so, we began to get a
very large concentration

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.250 align:middle line:84%
of sighting reports from
about a four-county area.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.800 align:middle line:84%
Bear in mind Texas
has 254 counties,

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.815 align:middle line:84%
so that's pretty significant
for as many sighting reports

00:07:03.815 --> 00:07:07.590 align:middle line:84%
that we had there as
the rest of the state.

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.660 align:middle line:84%
So we knew something
was going on.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.530 align:middle line:90%


00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:19.080 align:middle line:84%
In late 2007 and early 2008,
I received a phone call

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:23.460 align:middle line:84%
from an AP reporter
who said, there's

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:28.740 align:middle line:84%
a report of this enormous
UFO down near Stephenville,

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.110 align:middle line:84%
and it's reported by
a number of people.

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.310 align:middle line:84%
Does this sound credible,
and what are your plans?

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yes,
it sounds typical.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.840 align:middle line:84%
We've had other reports
from a number of people,

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:47.400 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to send
down a team to investigate.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.900 align:middle line:84%
The sighting took place in
2008, and the AP reporter

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:56.220 align:middle line:84%
called me on-- pardon
me-- on January the 10th.

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.900 align:middle line:84%
The sighting took place
on January the 8th.

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.840 align:middle line:84%
When she put that
out on the AP wire,

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:05.450 align:middle line:84%
suddenly the whole
world became interested.

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And when the story went
out in the newspapers,

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:13.830 align:middle line:84%
we had a massive number of
people who called and said,

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:15.840 align:middle line:90%
I saw it too.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And unusually, these
were very credible folks.

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:20.250 align:middle line:90%
Although

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:24.190 align:middle line:84%
Stephenville is a town
of about 15,000 folks

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:29.300 align:middle line:84%
and it is a college town, we
didn't have college students.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:34.440 align:middle line:84%
We had, for the most part,
middle-aged professional folks

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:39.220 align:middle line:84%
who came forward-- and some in
groups-- many law enforcement

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:47.530 align:middle line:84%
officers, doctors, politicians,
bankers, and so forth,

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:53.700 align:middle line:84%
who also reported seeing
very similar a thing.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:09:00.740 align:middle line:84%
So that is probably as
close as it gets to proof.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So that brought a
lot of interest in from other

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:05.620 align:middle line:90%
agencies?

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:06.300 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Yes.

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:07.690 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's get into
that part of the story.

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And then I went to-- I'm kind
of jumping the gun going forward

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.110 align:middle line:84%
a bit, but we can
always backtrack later.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:12.818 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Right.

00:09:12.818 --> 00:09:15.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The nature of the
questioning that occurred,

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.810 align:middle line:84%
which I found interesting,
in your novel,

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:22.370 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to ask you if
it was literally the kind

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:25.000 align:middle line:90%
of questioning that was done.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: In the novel, I've
sort of compressed the time

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:31.160 align:middle line:84%
between the beginning
of the investigation,

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.260 align:middle line:84%
and the types of
questions we asked,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:37.510 align:middle line:84%
and the kinds of answers that
we got later on because this was

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:40.640 align:middle line:84%
such a very hyped story in the
media that the coverage went

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.110 align:middle line:90%
on for several months.

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:46.886 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that we found--

00:09:46.886 --> 00:09:49.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Who descended
on Stephenville?

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:51.030 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Who descended?

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:53.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, the media from
all over the world.

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:57.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we had camera crews from
San Francisco, Japan, London,

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:59.840 align:middle line:90%
New York, Houston.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:04.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just when I got
there, at the central location

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:08.710 align:middle line:84%
we had chosen to interview
about 75 witnesses initially,

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:11.960 align:middle line:84%
you couldn't get in the room
there were so many newspaper

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.440 align:middle line:90%
reporters and so forth.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:20.080 align:middle line:84%
The interest from other folks,
from the extra-governmental

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:23.570 align:middle line:90%
types and so forth, came later.

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:27.650 align:middle line:84%
But the kinds of answers
that we got, initially,

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:29.470 align:middle line:84%
were that people
were very excited

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:32.060 align:middle line:84%
and interested about
what they had seen,

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:36.230 align:middle line:84%
and very certain that they had--
this was a once in a lifetime

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:38.750 align:middle line:90%
event that they had witnessed.

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:43.260 align:middle line:84%
However, with all
of the coverage,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.920 align:middle line:90%
it made people hypersensitive.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:51.190 align:middle line:84%
I think they started reporting
they were saying UFOs

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:51.952 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:10:51.952 --> 00:10:52.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:53.270 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: And so then it
started a type of a mania there

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.400 align:middle line:90%
in the town.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think later on that
that was what really took

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.080 align:middle line:90%
hold of most of the citizens.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But
perhaps for a reason.

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:09.020 align:middle line:84%
Now first, before
we go any further,

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:12.210 align:middle line:84%
why did you decide to write
a book that you say is not

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:14.267 align:middle line:90%
fiction, but fictionalized?

00:11:14.267 --> 00:11:15.850 align:middle line:84%
Explain the difference
between the two

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:18.190 align:middle line:84%
and why you decided
to write it this way.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: Well, as I said, the
media coverage was so intense

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:30.680 align:middle line:84%
that I began to be called by
witnesses almost immediately.

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:34.840 align:middle line:84%
My phone rang day and night with
either reporters or witnesses.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And many of them would say,
we've been seeing things here

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.920 align:middle line:84%
for many years, and we were
afraid to come forward.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.640 align:middle line:84%
But now it seems
like it's finally

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.510 align:middle line:90%
OK to go public with our story.

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:49.330 align:middle line:84%
And when you hear a couple
that's 80 years old that says,

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:52.650 align:middle line:84%
50 years ago, we saw something,
but we couldn't go into town

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:55.341 align:middle line:84%
and tell people because they
would think we were crazy.

00:11:55.341 --> 00:11:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And now they could
tell their story.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And yet, they were
so very similar

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:04.610 align:middle line:84%
to the same type of reports
we were getting current day.

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:08.850 align:middle line:84%
But at any rate,
unbeknownst to most people,

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:12.400 align:middle line:84%
the UFOs-- and there
were two basic types

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.555 align:middle line:84%
that people were
seeing-- kept coming back

00:12:15.555 --> 00:12:19.010 align:middle line:84%
to the same area
over the entire year.

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:22.565 align:middle line:84%
And as a matter of fact, the
one that was so publicized

00:12:22.565 --> 00:12:23.940 align:middle line:90%
was in January.

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.130 align:middle line:84%
But there was another
major sighting

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:28.600 align:middle line:84%
in October of the
same year that we

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.280 align:middle line:84%
purposely tried to keep low-key,
and out of media, and so forth.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Was it
triangular as well?

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.660 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Yes.

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:39.580 align:middle line:84%
The other type of UFOs,
they were the orbs

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.620 align:middle line:84%
that people would
describe as being

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:46.400 align:middle line:84%
as intense as an acetylene
torch, for example.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:50.020 align:middle line:84%
Some even came very close to
witnesses in their automobiles.

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:55.470 align:middle line:84%
They said there was
no heat, no sound.

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And so the animals
did seem to sense

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:02.280 align:middle line:90%
these things, in every case.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:06.780 align:middle line:84%
People would say my dog started
whimpering, hid under the car,

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:09.070 align:middle line:90%
under the table-- something.

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:15.570 align:middle line:84%
But over that year's time
that the publicity continued,

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:20.860 align:middle line:84%
I began to receive other calls,
other contacts from people who

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.870 align:middle line:84%
claimed to be insiders
that said, look,

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:26.890 align:middle line:84%
we want to help you
with your investigation.

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:29.310 align:middle line:84%
Here are things that
you need to look at.

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And that changed the
whole direction and tenor

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:36.860 align:middle line:90%
of my investigation.

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.250 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: How so?

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:43.100 align:middle line:10%
>> CHERRY: Well, for one thing,
I began to question my own

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:47.810 align:middle line:10%
organization, who consistently
denied us of the assets that we

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:50.260 align:middle line:10%
needed to conduct
the investigation.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.790 align:middle line:84%
I started out with
a radar specialist,

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:57.790 align:middle line:84%
who was also a FOIA specialist,
that was assigned to my team.

00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:01.620 align:middle line:84%
But soon after, he reported
only to the board of directors

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:02.120 align:middle line:90%
at MUFON.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:06.590 align:middle line:90%


00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:11.290 align:middle line:84%
The spokesperson for MUFON
would go on radio programs

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:15.203 align:middle line:84%
with reporters who were trying
to discredit our investigation.

00:14:15.203 --> 00:14:18.680 align:middle line:90%


00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.090 align:middle line:84%
Subtle things like
that, but of course

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:23.690 align:middle line:84%
denying us some of
the resources we

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:25.402 align:middle line:90%
needed, getting radar report.

00:14:25.402 --> 00:14:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Taking some
of the credibility away.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: Taking
credibility away.

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:34.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And the
radar expert, FOIA--

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:38.072 align:middle line:84%
Freedom of information Act--
he also had access to a lot

00:14:38.072 --> 00:14:39.530 align:middle line:84%
of redacted documents
and so forth.

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:40.740 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Exactly.

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:49.300 align:middle line:84%
So I, with the help
of the UFO hunters,

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:54.810 align:middle line:84%
got another UFO-- I mean,
another radar specialist.

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And he was able to--
after several attempts--

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:02.270 align:middle line:90%
to obtain radar information.

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:05.030 align:middle line:84%
At first, the FAA said,
no, it's not available.

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:06.620 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:11.940 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, this gentleman
had retired as a weatherman

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.112 align:middle line:90%
and knew that there were--

00:15:13.112 --> 00:15:14.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Knew people.

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:15.028 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Knew people.

00:15:15.028 --> 00:15:18.640 align:middle line:84%
And he kept bugging them,
until they finally provided

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.540 align:middle line:90%
the information that we needed.

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:22.980 align:middle line:90%
And we did find this UFO.

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:25.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was
not trans-bonding.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was where the
witnesses said it was.

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:32.240 align:middle line:90%


00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:36.950 align:middle line:84%
In the October
case, the witnesses

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:41.210 align:middle line:84%
reported the UFO being
in specific areas

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:43.180 align:middle line:90%
at a certain time.

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And 87% of the cases,
the radar inferential

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.130 align:middle line:90%
lined up exactly with them.

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:49.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.270 align:middle line:84%
So I want to get
back to something

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:54.510 align:middle line:84%
you said a bit ago, and then
a question I brought up.

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:55.176 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Sure.

00:15:55.176 --> 00:15:57.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So as all this is
transpiring and you say this

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.780 align:middle line:84%
kind of mania is occurring,
as a result of this group mass

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:05.640 align:middle line:84%
reaction, that's when some of
the agencies people may have

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:10.240 align:middle line:84%
stepped in and started doing
a different kind of inquiry.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:13.770 align:middle line:84%
The way you wrote in the book
is the nature of the questioning

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:15.560 align:middle line:84%
was very different
than what you would

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.170 align:middle line:90%
have expected of witnesses.

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:18.680 align:middle line:90%
Now is this true?

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.030 align:middle line:84%
First of all, did it
happen in this way,

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:23.740 align:middle line:84%
where they didn't
conduct interviews

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.570 align:middle line:84%
talking about how
the witnesses were

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:28.490 align:middle line:90%
feeling about this experience?

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:31.014 align:middle line:90%


00:16:31.014 --> 00:16:34.119 align:middle line:84%
As opposed to what
happened-- the nuts and bolts

00:16:34.119 --> 00:16:36.160 align:middle line:84%
of what happened-- but
more how it affected them.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.868 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: They asked
them what happened,

00:16:37.868 --> 00:16:42.180 align:middle line:84%
how did they feel about it, if
they could describe the craft

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:46.815 align:middle line:84%
in terms of, would it be like
looking at a quarter held out

00:16:46.815 --> 00:16:50.020 align:middle line:84%
at the length of your
arm, just how would you--

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:53.860 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of the people
did describe it that way.

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:57.180 align:middle line:84%
It was something-- I didn't
know if we're being invaded

00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:58.420 align:middle line:90%
or something of that nature.

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:02.520 align:middle line:84%
But that tenor became
more and more persistent

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.349 align:middle line:90%
as time went on.

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:06.980 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot
of disinformation

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:10.339 align:middle line:84%
that was, I believe,
purposely aimed

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:15.369 align:middle line:84%
at the public--
scenarios that just

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:19.109 align:middle line:90%
were completely unrealistic.

00:17:19.109 --> 00:17:22.980 align:middle line:84%
One reporter said that she
had seen some video that

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:29.070 align:middle line:84%
was taken by a constable there
from his dashboard camera that

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:34.180 align:middle line:90%
showed a UFO with a window.

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And through that window, you
could clearly see aliens.

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And the dash cam video was held
up by the county commissioners

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:47.850 align:middle line:84%
because this was
owned by the county.

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:50.321 align:middle line:84%
And they had a big question
of, can we release this?

00:17:50.321 --> 00:17:51.320 align:middle line:90%
Can we not release this?

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.986 align:middle line:84%
And I think she was
counting on the fact

00:17:52.986 --> 00:17:54.759 align:middle line:84%
that probably the
public would never know,

00:17:54.759 --> 00:17:55.800 align:middle line:90%
so she could just say it.

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: She
could say it, yeah.

00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:00.400 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: But like the
constable and I became quite

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.610 align:middle line:90%
close.

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:04.847 align:middle line:84%
And he said, look, I'll let
you look at these tapes.

00:18:04.847 --> 00:18:05.805 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what you think.

00:18:05.805 --> 00:18:08.050 align:middle line:90%
And he had three tapes.

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:11.540 align:middle line:84%
The county had-- these
were old VHS tapes.

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:14.440 align:middle line:84%
And they had been recorded
over so many times,

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:17.530 align:middle line:84%
the first two tapes were
just-- I said, toss them.

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:18.990 align:middle line:90%
They're not usable.

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:21.860 align:middle line:84%
The other one was a call that
he answered about 2 o'clock

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:25.340 align:middle line:84%
in the morning to an alarm that
went off at a shopping center.

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And he's going through
there and suddenly, he

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:34.530 align:middle line:84%
starts reacting very
strangely, like he's anxious.

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:38.790 align:middle line:84%
And this was typical
of the kind of attitude

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:42.240 align:middle line:84%
that I was talking
about, where people just

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.830 align:middle line:90%
were seeing UFOs everywhere.

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:45.801 align:middle line:84%
And he started driving
across the parking lot,

00:18:45.801 --> 00:18:47.800 align:middle line:84%
hitting these speed bumps--
bumping up and down,

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.670 align:middle line:90%
trying to move the camera.

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:53.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, he adjusted it
as much as he could,

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:58.610 align:middle line:84%
and then he focused
on this one area.

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And there were a barrier of
trees along this parking lot.

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:06.626 align:middle line:84%
And to me, clearly on the
other side was a street lamp.

00:19:06.626 --> 00:19:07.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Not a UFO.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:08.403 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: No.

00:19:08.403 --> 00:19:10.050 align:middle line:84%
You would have to
completely suspend

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:15.050 align:middle line:84%
your sense of whatever
to imagine that this

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:17.264 align:middle line:90%
was a UFO with aliens in it.

00:19:17.264 --> 00:19:19.180 align:middle line:84%
But this was what this
reporter had described.

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This kind of
thing was happening, yes.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.190 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: And this was the kind
of thing that was happening.

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:24.800 align:middle line:84%
Another reporter that I'm
sure you know very well,

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:29.280 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE], took pictures
and put them on her website,

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:35.910 align:middle line:84%
said that this one,
in a series of photos

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:38.260 align:middle line:84%
that had symbols in it, was
an attempt by the aliens

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:39.970 align:middle line:90%
to speak to us and so forth.

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:44.855 align:middle line:84%
So it a long way toward just
making the whole thing into--

00:19:44.855 --> 00:19:45.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Discrediting it.

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:47.230 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Describing it, yes.

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:50.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now meanwhile, on
your side of this equation,

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:54.640 align:middle line:84%
you were being sidelined, and
people were coming in above you

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.270 align:middle line:84%
and doing their
own investigations,

00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:58.890 align:middle line:84%
and cutting you
out of all of that.

00:19:58.890 --> 00:19:59.515 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Yes.

00:19:59.515 --> 00:20:01.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And after
a couple more years,

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:05.590 align:middle line:84%
you really weren't with
them any longer, right?

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:07.924 align:middle line:84%
But along the way, there were
other bits of information

00:20:07.924 --> 00:20:09.340 align:middle line:84%
that had been
passed to you, which

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:11.630 align:middle line:84%
I assume is what inspired
you to write this book.

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:13.004 align:middle line:84%
And I want to get
into some of it

00:20:13.004 --> 00:20:16.437 align:middle line:84%
because there's a lot
embedded in there.

00:20:16.437 --> 00:20:18.270 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you talked
about, in the '50s,

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:23.850 align:middle line:84%
how they were losing a plane a
day in pursuit of alien craft.

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:26.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, now let's
get to the F-16s,

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:29.730 align:middle line:84%
switch supposedly
did a lame pursuit--

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:31.832 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Right.

00:20:31.832 --> 00:20:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --in Stephenville.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.810 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: The initial
big story that I think got

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:39.960 align:middle line:84%
everyone's attention
was Mr. Steve Allen,

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:43.940 align:middle line:84%
who was a private pilot and
local businessman in the area.

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:48.490 align:middle line:84%
He was out with three of
his friends one evening

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:50.960 align:middle line:90%
on January the 8th.

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.350 align:middle line:84%
By chance, one of his
friends who was there

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:59.100 align:middle line:84%
was a career American
Airlines employee as well,

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:03.020 align:middle line:84%
so she had plenty of
experience with aircraft.

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And what they reported
was a craft that

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:09.240 align:middle line:84%
was a mile long and
a quarter-mile wide,

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.610 align:middle line:84%
that Steve said, we
have perfect visibility.

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I know
the distances that

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:16.750 align:middle line:90%
traveled across the horizon.

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:18.445 align:middle line:84%
I've flown it many
times, and I estimate

00:21:18.445 --> 00:21:21.950 align:middle line:84%
it was flying about
2,000 miles an hour.

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And it came back a second time
after it had left their view.

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:28.970 align:middle line:84%
They stood there for a
while, and it came back,

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:33.020 align:middle line:84%
this time pursued by F-16s
with their afterburners on.

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:35.441 align:middle line:84%
And he said that at
some point, the UFO just

00:21:35.441 --> 00:21:36.940 align:middle line:84%
said, well, I've
had enough of this,

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:41.400 align:middle line:84%
and just left them
sitting still in the air.

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And we had a number of other
sightings that same evening

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:46.510 align:middle line:90%
of this same craft.

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:49.840 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't get
much better than that.

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:53.135 align:middle line:84%
We had so many expert
witnesses-- law enforcement

00:21:53.135 --> 00:21:55.220 align:middle line:90%
officers and so forth.

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:58.670 align:middle line:84%
One police officer--
there were three

00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:03.200 align:middle line:84%
who came back to the
headquarters and said,

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.440 align:middle line:90%
you won't believe what I saw.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And the three of
them compared notes.

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:10.770 align:middle line:84%
But one of them
had been monitoring

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:14.470 align:middle line:84%
traffic-- speed trap,
whatever you want to call it.

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, he said everything
just what quiet.

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:20.270 align:middle line:84%
He was sitting there in
his cruiser, and he said,

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:21.260 align:middle line:90%
that's very odd.

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:22.830 align:middle line:90%
He's on the side of the highway.

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:24.913 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: All the animals,
everything went quiet.

00:22:24.913 --> 00:22:26.910 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: And no crickets
chirping, nothing.

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And he looked up and he said
there was this enormous craft

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:33.150 align:middle line:90%
just looming over him.

00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:36.355 align:middle line:84%
So he said, I didn't know what
to do, but I took my radar gun

00:22:36.355 --> 00:22:38.600 align:middle line:84%
and I pointed it at
the thing like this.

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:42.585 align:middle line:84%
And he said the first indication
was 18 miles an hour--

00:22:42.585 --> 00:22:43.420 align:middle line:90%
I believe it was.

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:44.670 align:middle line:90%
And he said next, it was gone.

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:45.180 align:middle line:90%
Pew.

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:46.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:49.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, OK, now some people
listening to this, this

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:50.855 align:middle line:84%
is reminiscent of
the Phoenix Lights.

00:22:50.855 --> 00:22:51.480 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Yes.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Very similar
experience from the witnesses

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:53.750 align:middle line:90%
on that.

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:58.290 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: Well, there were
some similarities for different

00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:05.470 align:middle line:84%
reasons with the Phoenix Lights
and the Stephenville event.

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:08.282 align:middle line:84%
But both of these
were demonstrations.

00:23:08.282 --> 00:23:08.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:11.920 align:middle line:90%
So demonstrations by whom?

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:15.879 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: Well, there's theirs,
and there's ours, and there's--

00:23:15.879 --> 00:23:17.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Some
collaborated version.

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:19.253 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: Some
collaborated version, right.

00:23:19.253 --> 00:23:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So now the
Stephenville event-- and again,

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.120 align:middle line:84%
we're going to kind of go
back and forth in this story.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.920 align:middle line:90%


00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:32.410 align:middle line:84%
Was the consensus or
understanding, as far

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:35.510 align:middle line:84%
as you knew, that this
might have been man-made,

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:39.260 align:middle line:90%
a collaboration, or ET a run?

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:42.240 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: What I was told
by a source was that it was

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:48.910 align:middle line:84%
a collaboration, that there
are at least three distinct

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:53.730 align:middle line:84%
groups-- for disclosure,
against disclosure,

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:54.799 align:middle line:90%
and then the others.

00:23:54.799 --> 00:23:57.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we're going to
get into that part of the story

00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:57.900 align:middle line:90%
in a minute.

00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:58.910 align:middle line:90%
I want to set up this.

00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:01.640 align:middle line:84%
OK, so saying that,
and before we even

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:08.230 align:middle line:84%
jump into those groups and
kind of the meat of this story,

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:11.550 align:middle line:84%
this technology was a
collaborative venture

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:14.530 align:middle line:84%
between military and
off-planet culture.

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:16.610 align:middle line:84%
Or on-planet
culture, as it were.

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:17.600 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Right.

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.275 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to say off-planet,
but they're non-human.

00:24:20.275 --> 00:24:21.150 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Non-human.

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:21.480 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Yes.

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:22.146 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:22.146 --> 00:24:23.100 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is something,
when I was at disclosure,

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:28.790 align:middle line:84%
I remember one of
the people that-- one

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:31.290 align:middle line:84%
of the witnesses,
Mark McCandlish--

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:33.385 align:middle line:84%
had drawings of craft
that he had seen.

00:24:33.385 --> 00:24:36.010 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to other people who
had been in hangars, where they

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:38.690 align:middle line:84%
had seen crafts
suspended that appeared

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:40.800 align:middle line:84%
to be using
anti-gravitation technology

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.500 align:middle line:84%
that they say was either
a collaboration or maybe,

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:47.540 align:middle line:84%
by this time, actually something
that our shadowy governments

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.280 align:middle line:90%
had created themselves.

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:51.790 align:middle line:84%
So how do you start--
how do we start

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:53.830 align:middle line:84%
evaluating this
story when we realize

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:59.530 align:middle line:84%
we have man-made, ET-made,
and collaborative vehicles up

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:00.120 align:middle line:90%
there?

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:03.200 align:middle line:84%
What is the purpose of trotting
out the man-made vehicles?

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:07.630 align:middle line:90%


00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:08.130 align:middle line:90%
Well,

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:12.750 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: there's an enormous--
enormous doesn't describe it--

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:18.630 align:middle line:84%
immense power that goes with
controlling this technology.

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:21.220 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine
why we would want

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:25.440 align:middle line:84%
to have the
technology, or at least

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:27.530 align:middle line:90%
the people at the very top.

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And they're also the ones
who are against disclosure

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:36.550 align:middle line:84%
because they want to continue
to maintain control of it.

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:39.215 align:middle line:84%
The non-humans have
a different agenda.

00:25:39.215 --> 00:25:41.905 align:middle line:90%


00:25:41.905 --> 00:25:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if you want to
jump into this right now, but--

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:45.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well,
let's go for it.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.440 align:middle line:84%
I can always go back and
pick up other threads

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:48.250 align:middle line:90%
of the story later.

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:50.000 align:middle line:90%
Let's go for it.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: Well, there is a
long history of UFO sightings

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:57.910 align:middle line:90%
in and around Erath County.

00:25:57.910 --> 00:26:03.940 align:middle line:84%
We found a report that
went back to 1897.

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:06.840 align:middle line:84%
Actually, Mr. Mark Murphy,
who was a city councilman

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:10.660 align:middle line:84%
of the little town Dublin, down
the road from Stephenville,

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:14.960 align:middle line:84%
produced it from their
newspaper office archives.

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, I
had witnesses who

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:21.820 align:middle line:84%
would tell me about things that
happened there 50 years ago.

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And so we found
this, that there was

00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:31.945 align:middle line:84%
constant sightings over a
very long period of time.

00:26:31.945 --> 00:26:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And one of my
sources said, well,

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:35.460 align:middle line:90%
there's a good reason for it.

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:39.530 align:middle line:84%
There are a terrestrial
species who've

00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:43.730 align:middle line:84%
been here since the
dawn of mankind,

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:48.680 align:middle line:84%
and they have
installations near there.

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And this particular
gentleman said

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:56.110 align:middle line:84%
this information is
highly compartmentalized

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:58.910 align:middle line:84%
among the people who know
within our own government.

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And he was aware of
two installations

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:02.920 align:middle line:90%
within the state of Texas.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.580 align:middle line:84%
One of them is where
this craft came from.

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And that in all the time
he worked for this agency,

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:16.170 align:middle line:84%
that he had only met one other
person that admitted to knowing

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:18.380 align:middle line:90%
about two other installations.

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:22.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You're talking about
extraterrestrial installations.

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: Well, they're
not extraterrestrial per se,

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:26.130 align:middle line:90%
as such.

00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What we commonly
refer to as ETs, or EBEs,

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:30.189 align:middle line:90%
or Little Greys--

00:27:30.189 --> 00:27:30.980 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Exactly.

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:34.220 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --those beings who
happened to, as your book is

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:36.060 align:middle line:84%
stating and as
these people stated,

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:37.780 align:middle line:90%
actually they're terrestrial.

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:39.405 align:middle line:84%
They're not necessarily
from elsewhere.

00:27:39.405 --> 00:27:41.050 align:middle line:90%
They're right here.

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And this is, I think,
a part of the story

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:45.780 align:middle line:84%
that most people would
be surprised at when

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:48.415 align:middle line:90%
they're reading this book.

00:27:48.415 --> 00:27:52.310 align:middle line:10%
>> CHERRY: I have interviewed
hundreds of people over

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:53.200 align:middle line:10%
the years.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.240 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how many.

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:57.145 align:middle line:84%
I stopped counting
at 150 people,

00:27:57.145 --> 00:27:58.520 align:middle line:84%
just with the
Stephenville event.

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And I've been interviewing
people long before that.

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And almost to a
person, I would say

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:08.860 align:middle line:84%
that they would accept the fact
that we are visited, from time

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:11.530 align:middle line:84%
to time, by intelligent
beings from other places

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:14.690 align:middle line:84%
in our galaxy, or
even other dimensions,

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:15.940 align:middle line:90%
or even time travelers.

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:18.130 align:middle line:90%
They could accept that.

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:23.760 align:middle line:84%
But I think what-- and
I've heard the arguments

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.970 align:middle line:84%
from both the people who just
want disclosure and the people

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:28.840 align:middle line:90%
who don't want disclosure.

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And they both have very
powerful arguments.

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And one of the more
powerful arguments

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:36.270 align:middle line:84%
from the non-disclosure
folks is that, OK,

00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:39.580 align:middle line:84%
people could accept that there
are non-humans coming here

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:41.570 align:middle line:90%
visiting from time to time.

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:43.750 align:middle line:84%
But they couldn't accept,
or sleep at night,

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:48.710 align:middle line:84%
knowing that they live
here in large numbers.

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:51.940 align:middle line:90%
And they're a superior race.

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that
is the big concern,

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:58.900 align:middle line:84%
that it would upset
our entire world--

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:01.330 align:middle line:84%
the economies,
social structures,

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:06.490 align:middle line:84%
religion, you name it,
our power structures.

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:10.280 align:middle line:84%
It is a frightening thought
for a lot of people.

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Do you
know how vast--

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:14.680 align:middle line:90%
is this a global phenomenon?

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:16.885 align:middle line:84%
Are there bases underground
all over the world?

00:29:16.885 --> 00:29:17.510 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Yes.

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And one of my sources
is an NSA contractor.

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:24.560 align:middle line:90%


00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:27.210 align:middle line:84%
He was instrumental in
creating a new system

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:29.260 align:middle line:90%
for our nuclear submarines.

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And on the maiden voyage
of this system-- of course,

00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:36.710 align:middle line:84%
he had all of the
necessary clearances

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:42.430 align:middle line:84%
to be on board, to try it out so
he could see how it functioned.

00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And he said that they were
up in the North Atlantic,

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:50.510 align:middle line:84%
among a good large number
of islands and things

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:53.230 align:middle line:84%
that they were
maneuvering through.

00:29:53.230 --> 00:30:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And he heard the radar operator
yell out "fast walker."

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And he was nearby, and he
looked over at this huge screen.

00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:08.180 align:middle line:84%
And he said this USO
just shot by them

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.192 align:middle line:90%
at this incredible speed.

00:30:10.192 --> 00:30:12.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And did they see
it come out of the water?

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:13.020 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: No.

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:13.603 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:30:13.603 --> 00:30:15.577 align:middle line:84%
USO-- unidentified
submerged objects.

00:30:15.577 --> 00:30:16.160 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Yes

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:16.785 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:30:16.785 --> 00:30:20.200 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: And he turned to the
admiral that was there with him

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.700 align:middle line:90%
during this test.

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And the admiral just shrugged
his shoulders and said,

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:26.260 align:middle line:90%
we see those all the time.

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:28.870 align:middle line:90%
They're very active underwater.

00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:31.380 align:middle line:90%
And they have underwater bases.

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The most common area
for viewing is off the coast

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:39.130 align:middle line:84%
of Los Angeles, out near the--
is it the Channel Islands?

00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:40.650 align:middle line:90%
Out that way.

00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:41.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:45.450 align:middle line:84%
So that appears to be one
area that the can go for--

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:46.450 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Another area.

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:46.770 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:48.780 align:middle line:84%
But as you say, this
is all over the planet.

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:49.800 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: All over.

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.210 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:56.000 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Mitchell-- and
I respect him highly--

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.370 align:middle line:84%
said that the ETs
have saved our planet

00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:01.002 align:middle line:90%
from nuclear destruction.

00:31:01.002 --> 00:31:06.560 align:middle line:84%
And I take difference with
Dr. Mitchell two counts.

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:08.960 align:middle line:90%
First of all, they're not ETs.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.910 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't save us.

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:12.352 align:middle line:90%
They saved the planet.

00:31:12.352 --> 00:31:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: To save themselves
and their own cultures.

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:15.643 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: They live here.

00:31:15.643 --> 00:31:17.090 align:middle line:84%
They don't want
us screwing it up.

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:21.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And this can is a
very different viewpoint than I

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:23.890 align:middle line:84%
even heard, being associated
with all the people

00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:25.100 align:middle line:90%
in disclosure.

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:27.940 align:middle line:84%
No one talks about
the fact that-- I

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:31.230 align:middle line:84%
mean, a lot of
people-- Phil Schneider

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:34.341 align:middle line:84%
brought attention to the
Dulce Firefight, for example.

00:31:34.341 --> 00:31:34.840 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about-- because
people have heard of that.

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:41.140 align:middle line:84%
I think people thought maybe it
was anomalous-- a few ETs had

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:43.430 align:middle line:84%
somehow landed here
and gone into collusion

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:46.270 align:middle line:84%
with the government, and some
kind of kerfuffle happened.

00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:50.566 align:middle line:84%
What's more likely what
happened, in your opinion?

00:31:50.566 --> 00:31:52.315 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: Well, it
would only be opinion.

00:31:52.315 --> 00:31:55.190 align:middle line:90%


00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:58.060 align:middle line:84%
From my understanding, there
have been collaborations

00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:00.980 align:middle line:90%
that haven't worked out.

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:02.970 align:middle line:90%
We think that they are benign.

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:05.630 align:middle line:84%
But from time to
time, they decide

00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:10.370 align:middle line:84%
they have their own agenda,
and we have our differences.

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And the underground installation
I speak about in my book

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:20.380 align:middle line:84%
is one of those
examples of where

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:23.590 align:middle line:84%
there was collaboration to
begin with, and then somehow

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:28.690 align:middle line:84%
or another, that didn't work
out, on a working basis.

00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:34.000 align:middle line:84%
Now they still have the
scientific back engineering

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:34.620 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:36.450 align:middle line:90%
They had several scientists.

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:38.714 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It sounds like
it's an uneasy truce between

00:32:38.714 --> 00:32:41.130 align:middle line:84%
the military, and the shadow
government, and these beings.

00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: Well, we're
unequal with them.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And anybody that
thinks that we can just

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:48.440 align:middle line:84%
make an agreement with them and
that they'll stick by it really

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.320 align:middle line:90%
doesn't understand.

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:58.890 align:middle line:84%
One of the calls that I got
early on in January of 2008--

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:01.630 align:middle line:84%
or it was more like the
middle of the month--

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:05.000 align:middle line:84%
was from a good friend of
mine that you probably know,

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.260 align:middle line:90%
Jim Morris, who is probably--

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:06.885 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:33:06.885 --> 00:33:07.420 align:middle line:90%
Love Jim.

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: --one of the premier
conspiracy writers of all time.

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:14.950 align:middle line:84%
But over his 40-some,
45-year career,

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:20.060 align:middle line:84%
he has garnered
many, many sources

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:22.010 align:middle line:90%
that feed him information.

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And one day, Jim
called and said--

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:28.160 align:middle line:84%
he knew that I was--
obviously, we're close

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:30.760 align:middle line:84%
and he knew I was involved
in the investigation.

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:34.331 align:middle line:84%
He said, I have
a source that has

00:33:34.331 --> 00:33:36.830 align:middle line:84%
been pretty good over the years
who wants to speak with you.

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And he said, all I can
tell you is his information

00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:41.300 align:middle line:90%
has generally been good.

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:42.090 align:middle line:90%
I said, great.

00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:43.520 align:middle line:90%
I'd love to hear from him.

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:47.260 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, the gentleman
said, in early February,

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:52.820 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be
a meeting at the UN.

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:59.325 align:middle line:84%
There is so much that-- this
Stephenville UFO situation

00:33:59.325 --> 00:34:02.650 align:middle line:84%
has upset so many
people that they're

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:05.740 align:middle line:84%
going to have a special
meeting with people

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:09.650 align:middle line:84%
from the major
companies-- countries.

00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:10.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:11.436 align:middle line:90%
Companies too.

00:34:11.436 --> 00:34:12.310 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Companies.

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: The company.

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:15.949 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: Well, I often think
we have a corporatocracy--

00:34:15.949 --> 00:34:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Corporatocracy,
absolutely.

00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:20.780 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: --rather
than a democracy,

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:22.590 align:middle line:90%
so I get them confused.

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:25.580 align:middle line:84%
But at any right, I said,
well, that's interesting.

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:27.870 align:middle line:90%
So I sort of put that aside.

00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:30.409 align:middle line:84%
Then later on, I
did find that there

00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:33.790 align:middle line:84%
was a three-day
closed-door meeting.

00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And the source said that
the general gist of it--

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:43.130 align:middle line:84%
if you want some summary-- is
that the others are getting

00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:48.330 align:middle line:84%
unhappy with our-- displeased
with our pace of disclosure,

00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:54.929 align:middle line:84%
and that we all need to increase
the information to the public

00:34:54.929 --> 00:34:56.536 align:middle line:90%
to get them ready for it.

00:34:56.536 --> 00:34:59.249 align:middle line:90%


00:34:59.249 --> 00:35:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: From all
the indications--

00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:05.870 align:middle line:84%
that you've heard, anyway--
what's in it for them to have

00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:06.562 align:middle line:90%
disclosure?

00:35:06.562 --> 00:35:08.770 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: Well, first of
all they don't have to hide

00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:09.270 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:11.510 align:middle line:90%
They don't have to avoid us.

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:13.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Don't they think
there'd be a very long learning

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:17.700 align:middle line:84%
curve, where people would
be quite frightened--

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:20.000 align:middle line:90%
if we feel as genuinely unequal?

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.200 align:middle line:90%


00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: In some respect,
they don't have the same

00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:29.417 align:middle line:90%
sensitivities that we do.

00:35:29.417 --> 00:35:30.125 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:35:30.125 --> 00:35:30.470 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:31.428 align:middle line:90%
They're more pragmatic.

00:35:31.428 --> 00:35:35.790 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: They're trying to
put their feelings into a little

00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:36.300 align:middle line:90%
bottle.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:39.410 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty impossible for us.

00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:41.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So to
them, it's simply,

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:42.700 align:middle line:90%
we can all live out in the open.

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:44.915 align:middle line:84%
These collaborations
can be open.

00:35:44.915 --> 00:35:45.540 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Yes.

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:46.586 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:35:46.586 --> 00:35:47.710 align:middle line:90%
So it makes logical sense--

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:48.330 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: What's the big deal?

00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:50.413 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --to them, and
what's the deal to them?

00:35:50.413 --> 00:35:52.897 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: Why should
everybody worry about it?

00:35:52.897 --> 00:35:53.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:56.450 align:middle line:84%
So let me ask you
another question then.

00:35:56.450 --> 00:36:01.350 align:middle line:84%
How does this play out with
the subjects of abduction,

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:04.140 align:middle line:90%
for example?

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:07.136 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: Now that is
a tricky question, and--

00:36:07.136 --> 00:36:08.510 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because
of that story,

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:10.700 align:middle line:84%
of course people are
frightened of the notion that

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:11.910 align:middle line:90%
they're living here.

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:13.020 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Yes.

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And I think that to
tell the whole truth

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:20.520 align:middle line:84%
about the relationship
between them

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:25.290 align:middle line:84%
and us over the
history of mankind

00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:29.540 align:middle line:84%
is another thing that would
scare the hell out of people.

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And I do suspect
that there has been

00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:35.580 align:middle line:84%
a good deal of that going on--
the abductions and so forth.

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:39.110 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed a
number of abductees.

00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:42.580 align:middle line:84%
Jim Sparks wrote
a book, and he was

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:45.265 align:middle line:90%
the subject of-- and pardon me.

00:36:45.265 --> 00:36:45.890 align:middle line:90%
I don't recall.

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:51.130 align:middle line:84%
Oh, John Mack, who was
the Harvard professor that

00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:53.820 align:middle line:90%
interviewed so many abductees.

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And John Mack claimed that
Jim Sparks over 90% recall

00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:01.090 align:middle line:90%
of his abductions.

00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And Jim and I got to know
each other quite well.

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:07.360 align:middle line:84%
He said, actually, he
just says 90% to be safe,

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:11.200 align:middle line:84%
but I have almost
perfect recall of it.

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And so he's one of the many
people who has been abducted

00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:18.740 align:middle line:84%
and remembers going
to the classes,

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:22.690 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, and seeing hybrids
and interacting with hybrids,

00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:23.450 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:26.290 align:middle line:90%


00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:29.160 align:middle line:84%
He once described to me that
he was learning a language

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:33.030 align:middle line:84%
that they can communicate
thousands of times faster.

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:37.520 align:middle line:84%
They use a symbol that can equal
many thousands of our own words

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:38.960 align:middle line:90%
to communicate.

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And so I think they're
superior in ways

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.170 align:middle line:90%
that we can't even imagine.

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:48.460 align:middle line:84%
But they're also
clinical in that they

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:52.830 align:middle line:84%
don't have the feelings
and emotions that we do,

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:54.810 align:middle line:84%
and they don't relate
to that as well.

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:58.090 align:middle line:84%
So they're taking
people for study.

00:37:58.090 --> 00:37:58.790 align:middle line:90%
I don't think.

00:37:58.790 --> 00:37:59.280 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:37:59.280 --> 00:37:59.810 align:middle line:90%
For a study.

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:01.930 align:middle line:84%
People don't want to
be taken for studies.

00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:03.700 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Well, of course.

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:06.110 align:middle line:84%
Someone asked me
why would they keep

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:09.160 align:middle line:84%
taking people to study them
and so forth, probing them

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:09.910 align:middle line:90%
and whatnot.

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
how many cadavers

00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:15.470 align:middle line:84%
do you think have been
cut up by medical students

00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:17.170 align:middle line:84%
over the last 100
and some-odd years?

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:17.996 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:38:17.996 --> 00:38:19.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:21.850 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: Why do we keep
studying the human body

00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:22.450 align:middle line:90%
ourselves?

00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:22.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:24.231 align:middle line:84%
Well, what about
the notion-- and you

00:38:24.231 --> 00:38:27.240 align:middle line:84%
said hybrids-- of
cross-breeding, missing people,

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:29.840 align:middle line:84%
women that have reported--
like Kim Carlsberg

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:32.670 align:middle line:84%
and others-- who have said
they have relationships

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:34.540 align:middle line:90%
with-- well, not relationships.

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:37.640 align:middle line:84%
But their ovum such
as has been used

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.540 align:middle line:90%
for cross-breeding purposes.

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:42.530 align:middle line:90%
What about that?

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: Well, we interviewed
Betty Hill very shortly before

00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:49.140 align:middle line:90%
she passed away.

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:54.290 align:middle line:84%
And she was still very sharp,
right up till near the end.

00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And to hear her
describe then what

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:01.900 align:middle line:84%
she described many
years earlier,

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:04.150 align:middle line:84%
you could tell that this was
something that absolutely

00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:05.600 align:middle line:90%
just burdened her mind.

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:10.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these abductions
and these things are real.

00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And of course, she
described amniocentesis

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:15.779 align:middle line:84%
before it was a procedure
by the medical profession.

00:39:15.779 --> 00:39:16.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Amniocentesis.

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:17.341 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:17.341 --> 00:39:17.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:18.460 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:21.040 align:middle line:90%
Because she had undergone that.

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:21.700 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Yes.

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:22.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:25.800 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: So many of the
procedures that people have

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.527 align:middle line:90%
described--

00:39:27.527 --> 00:39:29.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Were common in
the abductee experience.

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:31.484 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: Common in
the abductee experience.

00:39:31.484 --> 00:39:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, we can
find physical evidence

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:37.550 align:middle line:84%
of that-- in other
words, puncture wounds

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:43.740 align:middle line:84%
or implants of one sort or
another underneath the skin.

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:47.990 align:middle line:84%
So what all they're trying
to find out-- who knows?

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:52.914 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's trying to
introduce some of our--

00:39:52.914 --> 00:39:54.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Some of our
DNA into their species.

00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: Some of our DNA
into their own species, sure.

00:39:57.650 --> 00:39:59.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which,
in the long term,

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:02.365 align:middle line:84%
would make practical sense if
they're going to remain here.

00:40:02.365 --> 00:40:02.990 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Yes.

00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:05.406 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And arguably, they
may have been here before we

00:40:05.406 --> 00:40:06.090 align:middle line:90%
were.

00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:07.298 align:middle line:90%
Who knows who was here first?

00:40:07.298 --> 00:40:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: Well, we found
very realistic drawings

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:17.750 align:middle line:84%
of saucer-shaped craft
in cave dwellings.

00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:20.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We have to assume
we have a subterranean culture

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:22.680 align:middle line:84%
that's been living here
all along, side by side.

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:23.090 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Exactly.

00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:24.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And by and
large, I mean, yes,

00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:27.070 align:middle line:90%
we do know the phenomena.

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:28.990 align:middle line:84%
Different circles say
for different reasons

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:32.480 align:middle line:84%
of a lot of missing people--
people do disappear.

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:34.780 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: And they may
have affected our history,

00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:35.970 align:middle line:90%
our own development.

00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:37.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They may have.

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:38.570 align:middle line:90%
Now let me just say this.

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:39.070 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:42.335 align:middle line:84%
So going back to the, quote,
"fictitious" part of the book.

00:40:42.335 --> 00:40:44.190 align:middle line:84%
You made up new
names for characters,

00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:46.860 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of these characters,
in one guise or another,

00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:49.370 align:middle line:84%
exist in real
life-- people you've

00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:50.910 align:middle line:90%
known or been in contact with.

00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:51.790 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Yes.

00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This story is
about a man named Marc Slade,

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:55.815 align:middle line:90%
who is you.

00:40:55.815 --> 00:40:57.840 align:middle line:90%
You're Marc Slade.

00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And Marc Slade is an
intrepid UFO researcher

00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:02.374 align:middle line:84%
in Texas, who
basically got ousted

00:41:02.374 --> 00:41:04.290 align:middle line:84%
because these other
forces came in and started

00:41:04.290 --> 00:41:05.459 align:middle line:90%
distorting things.

00:41:05.459 --> 00:41:06.500 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Former marine.

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:07.552 align:middle line:90%
Don't forget that.

00:41:07.552 --> 00:41:08.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And former marine.

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:11.360 align:middle line:84%
So you are Marc Slade
and quite a character.

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And he's in contact
with another,

00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:22.590 align:middle line:84%
more sophisticated gentleman
from an agency of some kind,

00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:26.485 align:middle line:84%
and who is
encouraging disclosure

00:41:26.485 --> 00:41:31.350 align:middle line:84%
and who is encouraging him
to get this work of fiction

00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:32.770 align:middle line:90%
out there in the world.

00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:36.650 align:middle line:84%
So shall I ask you, I mean, is
that part of your story, where

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:40.780 align:middle line:84%
someone did say to you, why
don't you put all of this

00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:45.060 align:middle line:84%
into one amazing fast-paced
story and kind of put

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:48.120 align:middle line:84%
all of the elements and
together that would take forever

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:49.790 align:middle line:90%
to ascertain separately?

00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: Yes, this Mr.
Drake is a real person,

00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:57.380 align:middle line:84%
based on a real
person, as is Gladys,

00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:01.020 align:middle line:84%
who's another
carrier in the book.

00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:08.730 align:middle line:84%
But I had people from the
CIA, NSA, law enforcement,

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:14.640 align:middle line:84%
military-- just
well-informed people who

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:17.520 align:middle line:84%
work with the government
in various capacities.

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:21.250 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing to me how many
hundreds, if not thousands,

00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:26.500 align:middle line:84%
of people must have
access to this knowledge

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:30.715 align:middle line:84%
about our secret space program,
about the terrestrial beings

00:42:30.715 --> 00:42:34.430 align:middle line:84%
that are living
here on the Earth

00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:38.630 align:middle line:84%
with us, about our back
engineer technology,

00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:41.430 align:middle line:84%
about the alien technology,
about abduction.

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:43.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are a
huge number of people

00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:44.940 align:middle line:90%
that are aware of this.

00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And yet, they can't come
forward and tell about it.

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:51.200 align:middle line:84%
But for some reason
or another, with all

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:54.160 align:middle line:84%
of the stories about me
that appeared everywhere,

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:56.090 align:middle line:84%
they seized upon
me as the person

00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:58.080 align:middle line:84%
they wanted to tell to
get this story out there

00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:00.020 align:middle line:90%
because they could not.

00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And one NASA scientist
actually died

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:08.837 align:middle line:84%
of-- suspicious
circumstances, we'll say.

00:43:08.837 --> 00:43:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Not
uncommon in that world.

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:11.044 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Yes.

00:43:11.044 --> 00:43:14.710 align:middle line:90%


00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:19.560 align:middle line:84%
But going back to your
question about Mr. Drake,

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:22.050 align:middle line:84%
he was an older
man when I met him.

00:43:22.050 --> 00:43:24.460 align:middle line:90%
And he told me this story.

00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:30.640 align:middle line:84%
And he said that as a young
man, he had joined the OSS.

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:32.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Precursor to CIA.

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:35.126 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Precursor to CIA.

00:43:35.126 --> 00:43:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And had been instrumental in the
occupation government of Japan

00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:46.310 align:middle line:84%
after World War II, and he had
become close with MacArthur.

00:43:46.310 --> 00:43:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And so apparently, had
gained quite a bit favor.

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:54.060 align:middle line:84%
There are stories--
and I won't go

00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:56.030 align:middle line:84%
into exactly what he
said-- but that there were

00:43:56.030 --> 00:44:00.160 align:middle line:84%
several UFOs shot down
accidentally or on purpose

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:03.120 align:middle line:84%
during World War II
that MacArthur viewed.

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And apparently,
Mr. Drake did too,

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:12.640 align:middle line:84%
so that kind of put him
into that box from then on.

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:17.000 align:middle line:84%
He said that much
later on, he was

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.270 align:middle line:84%
one of three men on a committee
who made the final approvals

00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:24.870 align:middle line:90%
for the black budget projects.

00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And that one year, the request
was just so huge, astronomical,

00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:32.540 align:middle line:90%
that they just couldn't sign it.

00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:34.040 align:middle line:84%
He said, we just
could not sign it.

00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:36.230 align:middle line:84%
He said it was just
too much money.

00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:40.020 align:middle line:84%
So they called some four-star
general in front of the panel

00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:44.680 align:middle line:84%
and said, this is so much
larger than last year

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:47.617 align:middle line:90%
and there's no oversight.

00:44:47.617 --> 00:44:49.200 align:middle line:84%
We don't know where
the money's going.

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:49.890 align:middle line:84%
We're not going
to sign it till--

00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:52.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Who is this panel
that authorizes a black budget,

00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:55.256 align:middle line:84%
which is supposed
to be mysterious?

00:44:55.256 --> 00:44:57.505 align:middle line:84%
No one's supposed to know
where the money goes, right?

00:44:57.505 --> 00:44:57.860 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Sure.

00:44:57.860 --> 00:44:58.360 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:01.880 align:middle line:84%
But even they had a
conscious back in those days.

00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:02.510 align:middle line:90%
And so they--

00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:04.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you don't have
to tell us what it's for.

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:05.970 align:middle line:90%
How much did you say, again?

00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:07.170 align:middle line:90%
And it was just too much, right?

00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:08.503 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: It was just too much.

00:45:08.503 --> 00:45:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And so they told
the general, we're

00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:15.260 align:middle line:84%
not signing this until you tell
us where the money's going.

00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:17.820 align:middle line:84%
So he said that they
took the three of them

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:23.020 align:middle line:84%
to this enormous hangar, and he
wouldn't tell me where it was.

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:25.700 align:middle line:84%
But he said they opened
up this enormous hangar,

00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:28.010 align:middle line:84%
and there were all sizes
of, what he called,

00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:30.100 align:middle line:90%
flying saucers in there.

00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And the general turned
to him and said,

00:45:32.310 --> 00:45:34.120 align:middle line:90%
that's where the money's going.

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they
approved it after that.

00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:42.430 align:middle line:84%
But that's a scene in my--
more or less-- in my book.

00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:45.740 align:middle line:84%
So the crux of
this story, though,

00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:51.510 align:middle line:84%
is it that was 1964
that this occurred.

00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:53.420 align:middle line:84%
So we have had a
secret space program

00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:55.110 align:middle line:90%
at least since the '60s.

00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:57.774 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which clouds
everything about sightings.

00:45:57.774 --> 00:45:58.690 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Everything.

00:45:58.690 --> 00:45:59.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:04.080 align:middle line:84%
So many of these are our
back-engineered craft.

00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you
and I both know

00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:08.700 align:middle line:84%
that powerful people,
who have access

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:10.976 align:middle line:84%
to this kind of
technology, are not

00:46:10.976 --> 00:46:15.150 align:middle line:84%
going to waste it just flying
around in our own atmosphere.

00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:16.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And as far as the kind
of psychological effect

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:23.790 align:middle line:84%
on the people of
the planet, these

00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:26.450 align:middle line:84%
can be trotted out
for effect as well.

00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:29.930 align:middle line:84%
These can be trotted out to
create very specific feelings

00:46:29.930 --> 00:46:32.880 align:middle line:84%
among people, which
can be exploited then

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:36.760 align:middle line:84%
by a highly, tightly controlled
media, which can be exploited

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:39.480 align:middle line:84%
further into agendas,
and legislation,

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.770 align:middle line:90%
and so forth based on fear.

00:46:41.770 --> 00:46:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And your book does
a really good job,

00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:48.660 align:middle line:84%
I think, of just kind of showing
the disparate agendas going on

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:54.085 align:middle line:84%
and why this disclosure thing
is really such a challenge.

00:46:54.085 --> 00:46:55.210 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Well, thank you.

00:46:55.210 --> 00:46:56.670 align:middle line:90%
I hope I did an adequate job--

00:46:56.670 --> 00:46:57.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No,
you did a really--

00:46:57.530 --> 00:46:57.900 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: --of describing that.

00:46:57.900 --> 00:46:59.608 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, you
did a really good job.

00:46:59.608 --> 00:47:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just saying you did talk
about, a few times in there,

00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:06.300 align:middle line:84%
about how the emotions
of the human species

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:10.000 align:middle line:84%
can be explained by these
sightings and contact.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's these agencies that are
keeping very close notes on how

00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:15.410 align:middle line:84%
we respond to these
things and now we

00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:18.180 align:middle line:90%
can be manipulated as a result.

00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:22.290 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: And the
Stephenville experiment--

00:47:22.290 --> 00:47:24.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Why do you
call it an experiment?

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:27.190 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: Because they did
want to gauge the effect upon

00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:27.590 align:middle line:90%
the population.

00:47:27.590 --> 00:47:29.631 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's what I
was alluding to earlier.

00:47:29.631 --> 00:47:36.690 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: They picked a small,
middle-class, working-class,

00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:40.450 align:middle line:84%
middle-America community--
15,000 or so people, rural.

00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:43.150 align:middle line:84%
But you don't want to
conduct this sort of thing

00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:45.030 align:middle line:84%
over Los Angeles
and New York City,

00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:47.010 align:middle line:84%
or Dallas, or Houston--
some place like that.

00:47:47.010 --> 00:47:49.110 align:middle line:84%
You pick a place
like that if you

00:47:49.110 --> 00:47:53.620 align:middle line:84%
want to see how the average
person would react to this.

00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the F-16s
made a half-hearted attempt

00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:58.820 align:middle line:90%
to catch it.

00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:03.480 align:middle line:84%
The fact is, the UFO
came back many times.

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And there was never a
reaction after that.

00:48:06.730 --> 00:48:12.630 align:middle line:84%
So the military--
one of the people

00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:16.885 align:middle line:84%
on the base of where these
jets were from I spoke with.

00:48:16.885 --> 00:48:19.010 align:middle line:84%
Initially, there was a
major who came out and tried

00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:22.330 align:middle line:84%
to poo-poo it, and said it
was an optical illusion.

00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And of course after
we obtained the radar

00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:27.760 align:middle line:84%
proof that there was
a UFO and that there

00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:31.180 align:middle line:84%
were F-16s in the area, he had
to fess up and say, oh, yeah,

00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:33.510 align:middle line:90%
there was an exercise.

00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:35.570 align:middle line:84%
I spoke with a young
first lieutenant--

00:48:35.570 --> 00:48:37.419 align:middle line:84%
an Air Force first
lieutenant-- who

00:48:37.419 --> 00:48:39.210 align:middle line:84%
had already decided he
wasn't going to make

00:48:39.210 --> 00:48:41.800 align:middle line:90%
a career in the military.

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:44.820 align:middle line:84%
He was quite interested
in the investigation.

00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we see those on
our radar here all the time,

00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:51.120 align:middle line:84%
and we're ordered
not to talk about it.

00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:53.910 align:middle line:84%
So they're well aware of the
fact that there are UFOs.

00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:56.140 align:middle line:84%
They had no reason to chase
it more so than another

00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:58.590 align:middle line:84%
except to make a
public show of it,

00:48:58.590 --> 00:49:01.050 align:middle line:84%
just to see what kind
of reaction there was.

00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm not telling you that
every member of the military

00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:05.400 align:middle line:90%
knows about all this.

00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:06.189 align:middle line:90%
This, again, is--

00:49:06.189 --> 00:49:07.605 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's
compartmentalized.

00:49:07.605 --> 00:49:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: It is highly
compartmentalized.

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:14.580 align:middle line:84%
But both the people who
are for disclosure and who

00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:18.985 align:middle line:84%
are against disclosure were
very interested in the effect

00:49:18.985 --> 00:49:20.150 align:middle line:90%
that this had.

00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:25.200 align:middle line:84%
Initially, the folks who were
for disclosure were clapping,

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:29.870 align:middle line:84%
oh, yay, this is great, because
everybody's taking it so well.

00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:33.010 align:middle line:84%
Here's folks that are
basically farmers.

00:49:33.010 --> 00:49:37.200 align:middle line:84%
The number one product of
Erath County is dairy farming.

00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:39.940 align:middle line:84%
That's the big--
so these are folks

00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:41.180 align:middle line:90%
who go to bed early at night.

00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:43.750 align:middle line:84%
They don't watch sci-fi
and all this kind of stuff.

00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:46.070 align:middle line:84%
They're not prone
to flights of fancy.

00:49:46.070 --> 00:49:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And they took it very
calmly, initially.

00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:52.610 align:middle line:84%
But with the constant
barrage, suddenly

00:49:52.610 --> 00:49:58.240 align:middle line:84%
even the trained observers
were seeing UFOs everywhere.

00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking about a lot of
the law enforcement officers

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:05.190 align:middle line:84%
and other folks-- people
who were pilots and whatnot.

00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And you could tell that it had
a real effect upon a population.

00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And that it was just
within two, three weeks,

00:50:13.850 --> 00:50:16.770 align:middle line:84%
maybe-- four weeks at
the most, a month's time.

00:50:16.770 --> 00:50:18.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you
said in the book,

00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:21.140 align:middle line:84%
one of the scenarios is
that people start asking

00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:21.720 align:middle line:90%
for answers.

00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:24.710 align:middle line:84%
Then they start wanting
their official entity,

00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:28.650 align:middle line:84%
such as military and stuff, to
start stepping in to help them.

00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And so this can create a
drive toward, you might say,

00:50:33.970 --> 00:50:37.060 align:middle line:84%
military expenditure and
commitments having to do with,

00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:38.340 align:middle line:90%
quote, "off-planet cultures."

00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:39.430 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Certainly.

00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:40.190 align:middle line:90%
Protect us.

00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:42.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Protect us
against these beings.

00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:46.820 align:middle line:84%
So this can drive funds and
legislation, and so forth.

00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:48.670 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Certainly.

00:50:48.670 --> 00:50:54.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, and of course,
every excuse like this

00:50:54.400 --> 00:51:01.250 align:middle line:84%
gives the wrong people--
they stand up and ask

00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:03.340 align:middle line:90%
for more control as well.

00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:04.310 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:51:04.310 --> 00:51:07.350 align:middle line:84%
OK, so going back a
little bit to the beings

00:51:07.350 --> 00:51:12.690 align:middle line:84%
themselves-- the
intraterrestrials

00:51:12.690 --> 00:51:18.830 align:middle line:84%
or whatever you want to call
them, that look like ETs-- one

00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:20.830 align:middle line:84%
of the things you were
commenting on in the book

00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:23.660 align:middle line:84%
is their mind operates
more as a hive mentality.

00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:26.040 align:middle line:84%
It's as though there
is a collective cloud

00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:29.380 align:middle line:84%
of information, and each of
them are tapped into the cloud.

00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:32.520 align:middle line:84%
So if one knows,
than the others know.

00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:33.930 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Yes.

00:51:33.930 --> 00:51:37.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, bear in mind that
there are many species that

00:51:37.470 --> 00:51:39.760 align:middle line:84%
visit the Earth, and
there are several

00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:41.350 align:middle line:90%
that actually reside here.

00:51:41.350 --> 00:51:44.490 align:middle line:84%
So they don't all
operate the same,

00:51:44.490 --> 00:51:46.490 align:middle line:84%
and their technology
is not all the same.

00:51:46.490 --> 00:51:48.990 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the reasons we
are still back engineering

00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:49.730 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:53.100 align:middle line:90%
It's from different sources.

00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So aside from
the Little Greys, who else?

00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:58.020 align:middle line:84%
What other types of
species have you--

00:51:58.020 --> 00:52:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: Well, of course,
you've got your classic

00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:03.650 align:middle line:84%
Nordics, that
everybody wants to me.

00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:09.180 align:middle line:84%
I met one gentleman who
said that he was abducted

00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:13.190 align:middle line:90%
by crew of Nordic women beings.

00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And they promised him
that they would reward him

00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:17.750 align:middle line:90%
if he'd cooperate.

00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:19.440 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Comb his hair.

00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:23.800 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: Yeah, that
kind of a reward.

00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:27.920 align:middle line:84%
So take that with
a grain of salt.

00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:30.245 align:middle line:90%
But there are any number of--

00:52:30.245 --> 00:52:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Different
kinds of species--

00:52:31.870 --> 00:52:32.960 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: --different species.

00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --that
people have witnessed.

00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:37.720 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: And many are more--
some are more like humanoid,

00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:42.417 align:middle line:84%
more like us, but more
advanced, obviously.

00:52:42.417 --> 00:52:43.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.110 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
one part in your book.

00:52:45.110 --> 00:52:47.710 align:middle line:84%
We have-- oh, we've got
about five minutes left.

00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:50.920 align:middle line:84%
That I found interesting is
this adventure or this story

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:52.800 align:middle line:90%
takes us to a Super Collider.

00:52:52.800 --> 00:53:00.420 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about the
notion of the entities' bases

00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:02.880 align:middle line:84%
or facilities--
wherever they live,

00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:06.650 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want to call that--
a living quarters being often

00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:09.790 align:middle line:84%
associated with military
installations or some kind

00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:11.260 align:middle line:84%
of other installation
where they're

00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:15.390 align:middle line:84%
underneath that, and kind of,
by virtue of that uneasy truce,

00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:17.500 align:middle line:90%
protected.

00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:18.750 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: It works both ways.

00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:20.520 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we're protecting them.

00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:26.960 align:middle line:84%
We're protect-- it's our first
line of defense too, with them.

00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:31.990 align:middle line:84%
I was told that that was the
intent of that whole project

00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:35.800 align:middle line:84%
from the beginning, was
to place it in that they

00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:37.470 align:middle line:90%
knew that there was a--

00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:38.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Underground
civilization.

00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:40.805 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: --non-human
installation there.

00:53:40.805 --> 00:53:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you're talking
about a Super Collider

00:53:42.930 --> 00:53:43.752 align:middle line:90%
in Texas.

00:53:43.752 --> 00:53:44.460 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Right.

00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:47.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was closed
down for cost overruns.

00:53:47.570 --> 00:53:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And I was also told that
those cost overruns were

00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:55.260 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of the
extra tunneling that

00:53:55.260 --> 00:54:00.940 align:middle line:84%
went on to connect with the
bases of the non-humans.

00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:04.270 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
I was told most cost

00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:06.820 align:middle line:84%
overruns on large
government projects

00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:09.920 align:middle line:90%
do end up in the black budget.

00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:11.200 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:16.259 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is-- I have to
say it was-- congratulations

00:54:16.259 --> 00:54:17.550 align:middle line:90%
for your first work of fiction.

00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:19.170 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you did an amazing job.

00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:20.810 align:middle line:90%
It was a page-turner.

00:54:20.810 --> 00:54:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And it was also
so-- I thought, god,

00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:25.140 align:middle line:90%
I can't wait to meet this guy.

00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:27.260 align:middle line:84%
What a story that
you were approached,

00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:31.480 align:middle line:84%
to write this story-- I mean,
to be Marc Slade in real life,

00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:33.620 align:middle line:90%
to be the real-life Marc Slade.

00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:38.329 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
the group that you

00:54:38.329 --> 00:54:40.620 align:middle line:84%
were in association-- Marc
Slade's in association with.

00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:41.960 align:middle line:90%
They want disclosure.

00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:45.300 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about the ones
that don't want disclosure.

00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:47.870 align:middle line:84%
Just to wrap this
up, let's have a kind

00:54:47.870 --> 00:54:52.216 align:middle line:84%
of succinct encapsulation
of the thought of each side.

00:54:52.216 --> 00:54:53.590 align:middle line:84%
You already talked
about the ETs.

00:54:53.590 --> 00:54:56.140 align:middle line:84%
They say, hey, we don't want
to operate underground anymore.

00:54:56.140 --> 00:54:58.390 align:middle line:84%
Probably not bad to have a
little human DNA if they're

00:54:58.390 --> 00:55:00.242 align:middle line:84%
going to break
the surface anyway

00:55:00.242 --> 00:55:02.700 align:middle line:84%
because our atmosphere isn't
particularly friendly to them.

00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:05.040 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the other two sides--

00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:06.500 align:middle line:90%
to disclose and not disclose.

00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:10.920 align:middle line:84%
What are the lucid
arguments on both sides?

00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:13.980 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: Well, I think the
disclose people feel that,

00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:16.570 align:middle line:84%
eventually, it's going
to take place anyway,

00:55:16.570 --> 00:55:20.370 align:middle line:84%
and that it should take
place as a benign disclosure.

00:55:20.370 --> 00:55:20.870 align:middle line:90%
Come out.

00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Tell everybody exactly
what's happened

00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:25.190 align:middle line:90%
over what period of time.

00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:26.570 align:middle line:90%
Educate the public.

00:55:26.570 --> 00:55:28.830 align:middle line:84%
And in some sense, I
think an education process

00:55:28.830 --> 00:55:29.589 align:middle line:90%
has been going on.

00:55:29.589 --> 00:55:31.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Through
movies, certainly.

00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:31.470 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Through movies.

00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:32.620 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Television.

00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:33.142 align:middle line:90%
Novels.

00:55:33.142 --> 00:55:35.100 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: Harking back
to the Robertson Panel,

00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:37.141 align:middle line:84%
that was one of the things
that they recommended,

00:55:37.141 --> 00:55:41.330 align:middle line:84%
was that a public
education program begin.

00:55:41.330 --> 00:55:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And they named
that, oddly enough,

00:55:44.170 --> 00:55:46.270 align:middle line:84%
even the Walt Disney
Company back in the '50s--

00:55:46.270 --> 00:55:47.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, yes, I remember.

00:55:47.070 --> 00:55:48.519 align:middle line:90%
And you said Arthur Godfrey.

00:55:48.519 --> 00:55:50.810 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: Arthur Godfrey
was the big radio-- and then,

00:55:50.810 --> 00:55:54.780 align:middle line:90%
later, TV-- star of the day.

00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You even talked
about Orson Welles and that "War

00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:00.102 align:middle line:84%
of the Worlds" scenario,
that that was an experiment.

00:56:00.102 --> 00:56:02.310 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: Yeah, the education
process has been going

00:56:02.310 --> 00:56:05.520 align:middle line:84%
on for a long time and
has really become popular

00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:06.740 align:middle line:90%
in our culture now.

00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:11.060 align:middle line:84%
They accept UF-- I
mean, we don't even

00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:12.780 align:middle line:84%
call them flying
saucers anymore.

00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:17.040 align:middle line:84%
People think of the Enterprise
and that sort of thing.

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And you have people who've
been waiting in line for weeks

00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:23.230 align:middle line:90%
now to see the new Star Wars.

00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:26.640 align:middle line:90%
So that's, again, one of the--

00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:28.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We're looking
at that as our future.

00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:30.980 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: We're looking
at that as our future,

00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:34.170 align:middle line:84%
and I think people are much more
accepting than they ever have

00:56:34.170 --> 00:56:35.170 align:middle line:90%
been.

00:56:35.170 --> 00:56:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's for a reason
that we've been

00:56:38.130 --> 00:56:42.001 align:middle line:84%
bombarded with these
images for 60 years or so.

00:56:42.001 --> 00:56:44.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But the thing that's
a little disturbing to me is

00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:48.380 align:middle line:84%
that it seems
that, by and large,

00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:50.600 align:middle line:84%
most of the scenarios
that are put forth--

00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:55.560 align:middle line:84%
in film in particular-- are
quite negative and frightening.

00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:58.265 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: Well, there would
be frightening aspects to it.

00:56:58.265 --> 00:57:00.265 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But I mean,
intended to scare people,

00:57:00.265 --> 00:57:01.550 align:middle line:90%
where we're enemies.

00:57:01.550 --> 00:57:04.060 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Right.

00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:11.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, if they're
bad, we could've

00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:12.719 align:middle line:90%
been wiped out a long time ago.

00:57:12.719 --> 00:57:13.510 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:14.860 align:middle line:90%
That's my feeling.

00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:19.240 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: I mean, when
UNICOM was in its infancy.

00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:22.880 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think
it's that so much as

00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:26.780 align:middle line:84%
if they just-- I think
they're much more

00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:28.310 align:middle line:90%
clinical in their thinking.

00:57:28.310 --> 00:57:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that frightens
people because we

00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:36.400 align:middle line:84%
make a lot of decisions with
our heart, and not our head.

00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And you can't negotiate
with a computer.

00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, and
at the same time,

00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:48.030 align:middle line:84%
we want to demonize their--
the whole notion of cattle

00:57:48.030 --> 00:57:50.860 align:middle line:84%
mutilation and disappearing
animals, and so forth.

00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And we want to demonize
them for that kind of work.

00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we go to Burger
King and don't think twice

00:57:55.790 --> 00:58:00.290 align:middle line:90%
about eating our brethren cow.

00:58:00.290 --> 00:58:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And the slaughterhouse
scenario--

00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:05.110 align:middle line:84%
it's just a different way
of thinking that, of course,

00:58:05.110 --> 00:58:07.870 align:middle line:84%
nobody's comfortable with people
who think differently anyway.

00:58:07.870 --> 00:58:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: Well, one of the
ways that it was put to me was

00:58:12.450 --> 00:58:16.080 align:middle line:84%
asking if they liked
or didn't like us.

00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And somebody said,
well, do you like cows?

00:58:19.260 --> 00:58:20.421 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:58:20.421 --> 00:58:22.170 align:middle line:84%
But you kill them and
eat them, don't you?

00:58:22.170 --> 00:58:25.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, did you dislike them
the day you killed him, or are

00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:26.650 align:middle line:90%
you just-- you know.

00:58:26.650 --> 00:58:30.020 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that they
like or dislike us.

00:58:30.020 --> 00:58:31.130 align:middle line:90%
It's not that.

00:58:31.130 --> 00:58:35.550 align:middle line:84%
It's just that-- I
think in some sense,

00:58:35.550 --> 00:58:40.380 align:middle line:84%
alien is far more alien than
most of us can conceive.

00:58:40.380 --> 00:58:46.320 align:middle line:84%
We think of humanoids who have
pretty much the same operating

00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:47.350 align:middle line:90%
system as we do.

00:58:47.350 --> 00:58:48.817 align:middle line:90%
They just look different.

00:58:48.817 --> 00:58:49.400 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:49.920 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: No.

00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:50.450 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:58:50.450 --> 00:58:52.790 align:middle line:90%
They're completely alien.

00:58:52.790 --> 00:58:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what would
be scary to a lot of people.

00:58:57.060 --> 00:59:00.710 align:middle line:84%
And also the fact that,
well, suddenly, our military

00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:02.940 align:middle line:90%
can't really protect us.

00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:04.807 align:middle line:90%
They can't control the skies.

00:59:04.807 --> 00:59:06.640 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's one
of the reasons there's

00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:09.520 align:middle line:84%
been this hectic pace
of back engineering.

00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:12.270 align:middle line:84%
It's so we can at least get
up to some level of technology

00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:14.940 align:middle line:84%
with them, so that we
can assure the people.

00:59:14.940 --> 00:59:17.219 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand, there
are many powerful people.

00:59:17.219 --> 00:59:19.010 align:middle line:84%
Just think of all the
Middle East countries

00:59:19.010 --> 00:59:21.470 align:middle line:84%
that have only one
thing to sell to keep

00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:25.130 align:middle line:90%
their population peaceful.

00:59:25.130 --> 00:59:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And if suddenly oil was
just worthless, I mean,

00:59:28.530 --> 00:59:30.240 align:middle line:90%
it would start a world war.

00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And yet, that kind of
anti-gravity technology

00:59:33.310 --> 00:59:34.450 align:middle line:90%
exists, free energy.

00:59:34.450 --> 00:59:35.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It all exists.

00:59:35.550 --> 00:59:36.960 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: It all exists.

00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:39.320 align:middle line:84%
And yet, the people
at the very top

00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:41.970 align:middle line:84%
that control this
technology do not

00:59:41.970 --> 00:59:46.095 align:middle line:84%
want us to have access to it, or
even know about is, as a matter

00:59:46.095 --> 00:59:46.874 align:middle line:90%
of fact.

00:59:46.874 --> 00:59:47.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:59:47.790 --> 00:59:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, we could go on, but
we don't have any more time.

00:59:51.630 --> 00:59:54.090 align:middle line:84%
And I loved where
you left your book.

00:59:54.090 --> 00:59:58.230 align:middle line:84%
So shall I assume you have
another one in the works?

00:59:58.230 --> 01:00:01.270 align:middle line:84%
>> CHERRY: I have another one
that's based on a real case.

01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:02.829 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

01:00:02.829 --> 01:00:05.120 align:middle line:84%
Because it was a little bit
of a-- you left us hanging.

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:06.509 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Right.

01:00:06.509 --> 01:00:08.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, anyway--
again, congratulations.

01:00:08.550 --> 01:00:09.650 align:middle line:90%
I recommended it.

01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:12.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm even giving it for
gifts to a couple of people

01:00:12.650 --> 01:00:14.640 align:middle line:84%
that I know who are
curious about this subject,

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:17.530 align:middle line:84%
but aren't going to
digest volume after volume

01:00:17.530 --> 01:00:18.851 align:middle line:90%
from various people.

01:00:18.851 --> 01:00:21.350 align:middle line:84%
I said, you can kind of get the
gist of it in this one book,

01:00:21.350 --> 01:00:22.280 align:middle line:90%
and it's fun.

01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:23.410 align:middle line:90%
>> CHERRY: Well, thank you.

01:00:23.410 --> 01:00:25.826 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Anyway, thank you
so much, Ken, for joining us.

01:00:25.826 --> 01:00:27.351 align:middle line:10%
>> CHERRY: It was my pleasure.

01:00:27.351 --> 01:00:29.517 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Of course, there
isn't enough time to get

01:00:29.517 --> 01:00:31.760 align:middle line:84%
into the entire plot, which
includes men in black,

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:34.550 align:middle line:84%
and loads of references
to true events and people.

01:00:34.550 --> 01:00:36.800 align:middle line:84%
I think anyone would find
this an enlightening and

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:39.090 align:middle line:84%
entertaining glimpse
into a shadowy world

01:00:39.090 --> 01:00:41.500 align:middle line:84%
and a profound
subject for humankind.

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:44.040 align:middle line:84%
Again, the name of the book
is "The Stephenville UFO,"

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:46.220 align:middle line:84%

through major booksellers.
