00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:31.398 align:middle line:84%
>> US Navy sailors on board
the USS Ronald Reagan were some

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:35.469 align:middle line:84%
of the first to respond to the
tsunami and nuclear disaster

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:38.205 align:middle line:90%
in Fukushima, Japan in 2011.

00:00:38.205 --> 00:00:40.774 align:middle line:84%
Now they're suing TEPCO,
the company in charge

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:44.578 align:middle line:84%
of the stricken Fukushima
Daiichi nuclear power plant.

00:00:44.578 --> 00:00:48.549 align:middle line:84%
At least 71 sailors on the USS
Ronald Reagan have reported

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:49.683 align:middle line:90%
radiation sickness.

00:00:49.683 --> 00:00:51.819 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a shocking
story, and I first learned

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:54.622 align:middle line:84%
of it last March 11, which
was the second anniversary

00:00:54.622 --> 00:00:58.392 align:middle line:84%
of the Fukushima
catastrophe, beginning in 2011.

00:00:58.392 --> 00:00:59.994 align:middle line:84%
>> They had kept this
buried for two years?

00:00:59.994 --> 00:01:02.863 align:middle line:84%
>> Two of the sailors came to a
big gathering in New York City

00:01:02.863 --> 00:01:04.064 align:middle line:90%
to mark the anniversary,

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:06.100 align:middle line:84%
and they were suffering
health effects

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.502 align:middle line:84%
from their service
on board the Reagan.

00:01:08.502 --> 00:01:11.539 align:middle line:84%
Turns out that the Reagan was
anchored just a mile or two off

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:14.575 align:middle line:84%
of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear
power plant during the worst

00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:16.177 align:middle line:90%
of the radioactivity releases.

00:01:16.177 --> 00:01:17.578 align:middle line:90%
Which was news to me, I mean,

00:01:17.578 --> 00:01:19.847 align:middle line:84%
I followed this as
closely as I can.

00:01:19.847 --> 00:01:22.248 align:middle line:84%
Two years into this thing I
find out that the Reagan was

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:25.853 align:middle line:84%
that close to these catastrophic
radioactivity releases.

00:01:25.853 --> 00:01:29.356 align:middle line:84%
So the crew on board that
ship, 5,000-plus sailors were

00:01:29.356 --> 00:01:32.560 align:middle line:84%
in harm's way for
several long days on end,

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.729 align:middle line:84%
not warned by TEPCO, not warned
by the Japanese government,

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.098 align:middle line:84%
not warned by the
United States government,

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:40.568 align:middle line:84%
which had radiation-detecting
planes flying all

00:01:40.568 --> 00:01:41.968 align:middle line:90%
over north eastern Japan.

00:01:41.968 --> 00:01:45.472 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: I've decided
to devote two to three programs

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:47.775 align:middle line:84%
to the subject of
radiation contamination

00:01:47.775 --> 00:01:50.044 align:middle line:90%
from the disaster at Fukushima.

00:01:50.044 --> 00:01:53.314 align:middle line:84%
My intention is to look at the
subject as honestly as we can,

00:01:53.314 --> 00:01:56.483 align:middle line:84%
and more so to look at the
very real ways we can protect

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:57.585 align:middle line:90%
our bodies.

00:01:57.585 --> 00:01:59.420 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed several
scientists, doctors,

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.621 align:middle line:90%
and healthcare practitioners,

00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:03.557 align:middle line:84%
and thank goodness
there are rather simple

00:02:03.557 --> 00:02:05.159 align:middle line:90%
and inexpensive remedies.

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.295 align:middle line:84%
But first we need to look
at the problem up close.

00:02:08.295 --> 00:02:10.898 align:middle line:84%
Dr. John Apsley first
highlighted the problem

00:02:10.898 --> 00:02:14.535 align:middle line:84%
in his book "Fukushima
Meltdown" back in 2011,

00:02:14.535 --> 00:02:16.670 align:middle line:84%
but things have taken
a turn for the worst,

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.706 align:middle line:90%
so he's here to update us today.

00:02:18.706 --> 00:02:21.574 align:middle line:84%
I think everybody's doing
stories on this at the moment

00:02:21.574 --> 00:02:23.644 align:middle line:84%
because there has been
some breaking news.

00:02:23.644 --> 00:02:25.079 align:middle line:90%
And what we just saw there

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.748 align:middle line:84%
in that little clip
is the breaking news,

00:02:27.748 --> 00:02:30.317 align:middle line:90%
and you're involved with this.

00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:31.685 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr John Apsley: Yes, I am.

00:02:31.685 --> 00:02:35.256 align:middle line:84%
I was contacted by the legal
team representing the sailors.

00:02:35.256 --> 00:02:36.624 align:middle line:90%
And what they wanted me

00:02:36.624 --> 00:02:40.728 align:middle line:84%
to do was put together some
treatment protocols and a team

00:02:40.728 --> 00:02:43.530 align:middle line:84%
to be able to help
these sailors.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.468 align:middle line:84%
And my book goes into how
people can reverse a lot

00:02:47.468 --> 00:02:50.336 align:middle line:84%
of this exposure once
it's in the body.

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:52.439 align:middle line:84%
We have that data
from Chernobyl,

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:55.576 align:middle line:84%
where they decontaminated
the children

00:02:55.576 --> 00:02:58.579 align:middle line:84%
with some very simple
things, as you mentioned.

00:02:58.579 --> 00:02:59.980 align:middle line:90%
And it was very effective.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.348 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:03.784 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: But these sailors
were exposed to huge volumes.

00:03:03.784 --> 00:03:05.252 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Now they were
what, just to get it straight,

00:03:05.252 --> 00:03:07.388 align:middle line:84%
they were only a
mile or two off shore

00:03:07.388 --> 00:03:09.189 align:middle line:90%
when the plume went up, right?

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:10.257 align:middle line:90%
>> Apsley: That's correct.

00:03:10.257 --> 00:03:11.659 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And there
were 5,000, roughly,

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:13.861 align:middle line:84%
a little more than
5,000 on board?

00:03:13.861 --> 00:03:14.828 align:middle line:90%
>> Apsley: That's right.

00:03:14.828 --> 00:03:15.863 align:middle line:84%
But there were also
crews that went

00:03:15.863 --> 00:03:18.032 align:middle line:84%
up in helicopters
and flew through --

00:03:18.032 --> 00:03:19.033 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Through the plume?

00:03:19.033 --> 00:03:19.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Apsley: Yeah.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.701 align:middle line:90%
Continuously.

00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:23.871 align:middle line:84%
And those helicopters
had to be buried,

00:03:23.871 --> 00:03:26.307 align:middle line:84%
they were so contaminated,
they couldn't clean them.

00:03:26.307 --> 00:03:30.544 align:middle line:84%
So for the open doors in
the helicopter for people

00:03:30.544 --> 00:03:33.781 align:middle line:84%
to be breathing that air in, you
can imagine they're quite sick.

00:03:33.781 --> 00:03:37.384 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So now when we're
looking, because you are

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:41.889 align:middle line:84%
up close to this story, what are
we looking at percentage wise?

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:46.226 align:middle line:84%
I know they said 78 have come
down with obvious symptoms.

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:49.763 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to thyroid
disease, cancer and so forth,

00:03:49.763 --> 00:03:52.499 align:middle line:84%
it usually has a much
longer gestation period.

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:55.235 align:middle line:84%
So what are you actually
expecting to see out of this?

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:56.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: You know,
that's a really great point.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.205 align:middle line:90%
With people that were exposed

00:03:58.205 --> 00:04:01.608 align:middle line:84%
to large doses right away
they became sick pretty quick.

00:04:01.608 --> 00:04:04.345 align:middle line:84%
For those that were exposed
to the smaller doses,

00:04:04.345 --> 00:04:06.814 align:middle line:84%
which in many cases can
be even more lethal,

00:04:06.814 --> 00:04:08.716 align:middle line:90%
but it does take longer.

00:04:08.716 --> 00:04:12.419 align:middle line:84%
So there are different
kinds of radiation

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.822 align:middle line:84%
that can cause different kinds
of problems in the human body.

00:04:15.822 --> 00:04:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And so we might see a majority
of the crew at some point

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.595 align:middle line:84%
in time, say over
the next ten years,

00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:23.931 align:middle line:84%
experiencing some
serious difficulties.

00:04:23.931 --> 00:04:25.666 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Is it fair to say

00:04:25.666 --> 00:04:30.003 align:middle line:84%
that maybe it's even an
optimistic view to say

00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:32.639 align:middle line:84%
that only 78, they were
right in the blast of it,

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.309 align:middle line:84%
but only 78 are seriously
ill right now.

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:36.543 align:middle line:90%
Does that say something?

00:04:36.543 --> 00:04:37.544 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: That's
a small number.

00:04:37.544 --> 00:04:38.912 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:04:38.912 --> 00:04:40.614 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: But there were crews
that not only flew directly

00:04:40.614 --> 00:04:42.349 align:middle line:84%
into the plumes with
the helicopters

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:45.619 align:middle line:84%
that were doing recon, but then
there were the cleaning crews.

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:47.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.156 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: So that is where the
number is a little bit smaller

00:04:49.156 --> 00:04:51.492 align:middle line:84%
than the 5,000 sailors
that were on board.

00:04:51.492 --> 00:04:53.193 align:middle line:90%
Some just stayed under the deck.

00:04:53.193 --> 00:04:57.831 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Now the thing is
they weren't warned about this,

00:04:57.831 --> 00:05:01.602 align:middle line:84%
there was no information given,
they had flights going overhead,

00:05:01.602 --> 00:05:03.670 align:middle line:84%
the US government
was monitoring this,

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.540 align:middle line:84%
the world of science
was monitoring this.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.842 align:middle line:84%
They had to have seen
what was going on.

00:05:08.842 --> 00:05:12.079 align:middle line:84%
But these guys on the ground
or in the water, as it were,

00:05:12.079 --> 00:05:14.515 align:middle line:84%
and all of the others
that were working on this,

00:05:14.515 --> 00:05:17.384 align:middle line:84%
including the Japanese,
were given no heads up as

00:05:17.384 --> 00:05:19.620 align:middle line:84%
to what they were
being exposed to.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.754 align:middle line:90%
>> Apsley: That is correct.

00:05:20.754 --> 00:05:23.824 align:middle line:84%
And we -- there has been
no nation on the Earth

00:05:23.824 --> 00:05:28.962 align:middle line:84%
that has been good or equipped
or prepared or has moved

00:05:28.962 --> 00:05:31.799 align:middle line:84%
through these crisises
with wisdom,

00:05:31.799 --> 00:05:36.503 align:middle line:84%
it's always been
chaotic, it's with crews

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:39.406 align:middle line:84%
that on the left hand doesn't
know what the right hand is

00:05:39.406 --> 00:05:42.209 align:middle line:84%
doing, with the captain
of the ship, for example.

00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:44.445 align:middle line:84%
I assume that if the captain
of the ship knew

00:05:44.445 --> 00:05:47.915 align:middle line:84%
that he would be stationed or
sailing through the plumes

00:05:47.915 --> 00:05:50.951 align:middle line:84%
that he would have taken evasive
action before it occured.

00:05:50.951 --> 00:05:55.389 align:middle line:84%
They also didn't realize just
how dangerous these plumes were.

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:59.426 align:middle line:84%
Did anyone from either Japan
side or the US side think

00:05:59.426 --> 00:06:00.961 align:middle line:90%
to warn the captain of the ship?

00:06:00.961 --> 00:06:04.765 align:middle line:84%
I don't think the communication
systems were just that good.

00:06:04.765 --> 00:06:06.600 align:middle line:90%
Historically, they haven't been.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But it's not just
that, it's taken two years

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.640 align:middle line:84%
for you and for the other
journalists that we just saw

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.944 align:middle line:84%
to even begin ferreting some
of this information out.

00:06:16.944 --> 00:06:18.779 align:middle line:90%
It sounds as though it was --

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:22.216 align:middle line:84%
and we know there have been
serious allegations in terms

00:06:22.216 --> 00:06:25.719 align:middle line:84%
of the TEPCO higher-ups,
of hiding the data.

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:28.722 align:middle line:84%
But also the US has
been hiding the data,

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:31.859 align:middle line:84%
people have been trying to
go for it under the freedom

00:06:31.859 --> 00:06:34.228 align:middle line:84%
of information act and
had very little luck.

00:06:34.228 --> 00:06:35.863 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
this a little bit?

00:06:35.863 --> 00:06:37.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Apsley: Sure.

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.433 align:middle line:84%
When the Atomic Energy
Commission was first formed it

00:06:39.433 --> 00:06:43.937 align:middle line:84%
was part of the CIA, and
their job was to not --

00:06:43.937 --> 00:06:47.508 align:middle line:84%
not let the public know
what was really going on.

00:06:47.508 --> 00:06:50.043 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until Clinton,
President Clinton,

00:06:50.043 --> 00:06:54.081 align:middle line:84%
released the information
in 1997 that the horrors

00:06:54.081 --> 00:06:57.117 align:middle line:84%
that were taking place
with the nuclear program

00:06:57.117 --> 00:07:00.654 align:middle line:84%
on US soil was released
to the general public.

00:07:00.654 --> 00:07:04.458 align:middle line:84%
They became extremely good
at hiding the information.

00:07:04.458 --> 00:07:08.362 align:middle line:84%
In the case of Chernobyl, it was
outlawed to release information

00:07:08.362 --> 00:07:10.764 align:middle line:84%
for three years under
severe penalty.

00:07:10.764 --> 00:07:12.933 align:middle line:84%
It took twenty years
to get that data

00:07:12.933 --> 00:07:15.569 align:middle line:84%
so that we now know what
actually happened at Chernobyl,

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:17.538 align:middle line:84%
which is the basis for
how we know what's going

00:07:17.538 --> 00:07:19.773 align:middle line:90%
to be happening with Fukushima.

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:24.645 align:middle line:84%
Now just two weeks ago the
Japanese parliament made it a

00:07:24.645 --> 00:07:27.414 align:middle line:90%
violation of their secrecy act

00:07:27.414 --> 00:07:29.716 align:middle line:84%
to divulge any information
that's coming

00:07:29.716 --> 00:07:31.351 align:middle line:90%
out of the Fukushima now.

00:07:31.351 --> 00:07:35.389 align:middle line:84%
So they replicated what
the Soviet Union did back

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:37.658 align:middle line:90%
with Chernobyl in 1987.

00:07:37.658 --> 00:07:40.294 align:middle line:84%
We also saw this occur
with Three Mile Island.

00:07:40.294 --> 00:07:41.995 align:middle line:90%
It was 15 years, basically,

00:07:41.995 --> 00:07:43.497 align:middle line:84%
before they got the
information out.

00:07:43.497 --> 00:07:44.364 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: That's criminal.

00:07:44.364 --> 00:07:45.732 align:middle line:90%
>> Apsley: It is criminal.

00:07:45.732 --> 00:07:46.934 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I mean, isn't --
aren't these governments sitting

00:07:46.934 --> 00:07:49.436 align:middle line:84%
in a position for massive
class action lawsuits,

00:07:49.436 --> 00:07:52.673 align:middle line:84%
are they protected, have
they protected themselves

00:07:52.673 --> 00:07:54.007 align:middle line:90%
through some sort of loop hole?

00:07:54.007 --> 00:07:55.108 align:middle line:90%
>> Apsley: Yeah.

00:07:55.108 --> 00:07:57.644 align:middle line:84%
The Ferris Doctrine
protects the governments

00:07:57.644 --> 00:08:00.447 align:middle line:84%
from being sued by
military members.

00:08:00.447 --> 00:08:04.451 align:middle line:84%
It's like one of the worst
things that we have done

00:08:04.451 --> 00:08:06.320 align:middle line:90%
to our military service members.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.388 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be real tough
to make the lawsuits --

00:08:08.388 --> 00:08:09.556 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, like
agent orange, I mean,

00:08:09.556 --> 00:08:12.192 align:middle line:84%
they have a long
history of -- yeah --

00:08:12.192 --> 00:08:15.162 align:middle line:84%
exposing these guys to just
horrid stuff, and then --

00:08:15.162 --> 00:08:16.863 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: And they rationalize
it in different ways,

00:08:16.863 --> 00:08:19.666 align:middle line:84%
saying that well, if we're
going into harm's way,

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:21.969 align:middle line:84%
and that's our purpose,
of course crazy,

00:08:21.969 --> 00:08:23.770 align:middle line:84%
chaotic things are
going to happen.

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:26.340 align:middle line:84%
We can't have everybody
suing us.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:29.676 align:middle line:90%
But in cases where we knew

00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:32.479 align:middle line:84%
that where they built
the Fukushima plants was

00:08:32.479 --> 00:08:36.016 align:middle line:84%
in the worst possible location,
the ground water that flows

00:08:36.016 --> 00:08:40.053 align:middle line:84%
down from the basic mountain
that's behind it, constantly is

00:08:40.053 --> 00:08:44.124 align:middle line:84%
bathing that entire area with
water that has to flow into the

00:08:44.124 --> 00:08:45.192 align:middle line:90%
Pacific. So if there's

00:08:45.192 --> 00:08:47.160 align:middle line:84%
any leakage it comes
out of these things,

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.930 align:middle line:90%
it goes right into the Pacific.

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:51.665 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Since you
brought that point up,

00:08:51.665 --> 00:08:54.768 align:middle line:84%
one of the people I also
interviewed was Adam Trumbaley

00:08:54.768 --> 00:08:56.203 align:middle line:90%
on this subject.

00:08:56.203 --> 00:09:00.140 align:middle line:84%
When he was young he
was invited back there

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.142 align:middle line:84%
and was shown the
diagrams of the --

00:09:02.142 --> 00:09:06.346 align:middle line:84%
what was going to be the
fully constructed site.

00:09:06.346 --> 00:09:08.715 align:middle line:90%
So this was several decades ago.

00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:12.219 align:middle line:84%
And he was looking at
it, and we'll take a look

00:09:12.219 --> 00:09:13.854 align:middle line:84%
at the sound bite and
see what he had to say

00:09:13.854 --> 00:09:17.124 align:middle line:84%
when he saw the renderings
of this plant.

00:09:17.124 --> 00:09:18.458 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:09:18.458 --> 00:09:20.761 align:middle line:84%
>> So I went out there with
them, went out to Fukushima.

00:09:20.761 --> 00:09:25.265 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I got there, I
was like, okay, why am I here?

00:09:25.265 --> 00:09:29.069 align:middle line:90%
You know, what am I doing here?

00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:30.470 align:middle line:90%
And I looked at these things.

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:33.707 align:middle line:84%
They're very proud of their sea
wall, their ten meter sea wall.

00:09:33.707 --> 00:09:37.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was kind
of like, new back then.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:40.247 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, this
is not high enough.

00:09:40.247 --> 00:09:43.050 align:middle line:84%
This sea wall is
not high enough.

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:47.821 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw where their
diesel generators were outside,

00:09:47.821 --> 00:09:50.190 align:middle line:84%
and I said what's going to
happen if a tsunami comes

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:52.859 align:middle line:84%
over this wall and
floods these generators.

00:09:52.859 --> 00:09:54.194 align:middle line:90%
These things were obvious.

00:09:54.194 --> 00:09:57.798 align:middle line:84%
I was only just there,
it wasn't like you had

00:09:57.798 --> 00:10:00.167 align:middle line:84%
to be some great
genius to see this.

00:10:00.167 --> 00:10:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And they said well, our
geophysicists assure us

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:07.307 align:middle line:84%
that there's not going to
be an earthquake above 7.5.

00:10:07.307 --> 00:10:11.144 align:middle line:84%
And I said, but you had
a tsunami in the 1800's

00:10:11.144 --> 00:10:14.047 align:middle line:84%
that went back a
hundred miles inland

00:10:14.047 --> 00:10:17.017 align:middle line:84%
which means that that earthquake
was over 8 points, easily,

00:10:17.017 --> 00:10:21.088 align:middle line:84%
and that tsunami that
resulted was also giant

00:10:21.088 --> 00:10:23.323 align:middle line:84%
and would have gone
right over this wall.

00:10:23.323 --> 00:10:25.092 align:middle line:84%
These structures
weren't designed

00:10:25.092 --> 00:10:28.028 align:middle line:84%
to sustain a 9 point
quake, ever.

00:10:28.028 --> 00:10:29.463 align:middle line:90%
They're just not.

00:10:29.463 --> 00:10:32.365 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, so it appears
they were certainly aware

00:10:32.365 --> 00:10:34.034 align:middle line:84%
from the very beginning
this could be a problem.

00:10:34.034 --> 00:10:37.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even from
reading novels one knows

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:39.740 align:middle line:84%
that Japan has always
been the subject

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:42.442 align:middle line:90%
of very powerful earthquakes.

00:10:42.442 --> 00:10:44.745 align:middle line:84%
I mean, here we are,
this is the site of it.

00:10:44.745 --> 00:10:47.447 align:middle line:84%
Throughout its history and
literature, it always speaks

00:10:47.447 --> 00:10:50.183 align:middle line:84%
of these earthquakes that
have occurred and wiped

00:10:50.183 --> 00:10:52.119 align:middle line:84%
out whole regions
of the country.

00:10:52.119 --> 00:10:54.454 align:middle line:84%
Why in the world would
that not have been taken

00:10:54.454 --> 00:10:58.725 align:middle line:84%
into consideration, as you say,
with the very delicate location

00:10:58.725 --> 00:11:02.462 align:middle line:84%
of this and the contents
of these nuclear cores?

00:11:02.462 --> 00:11:05.766 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: The only explanation
is that there's money to be

00:11:05.766 --> 00:11:08.735 align:middle line:84%
made. The tax payers subsidized
the building of the plants

00:11:08.735 --> 00:11:10.637 align:middle line:90%
at tremendous expense.

00:11:10.637 --> 00:11:13.440 align:middle line:84%
So when the power comes
out and it's cheaper,

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.641 align:middle line:90%
no one considers the fact

00:11:14.641 --> 00:11:16.943 align:middle line:84%
that the tax payer already
subsidized the building

00:11:16.943 --> 00:11:18.245 align:middle line:90%
of the plant.

00:11:18.245 --> 00:11:20.981 align:middle line:84%
When it's decommissioned,
the tax payer pays for that,

00:11:20.981 --> 00:11:22.482 align:middle line:90%
no one talks about that.

00:11:22.482 --> 00:11:24.418 align:middle line:84%
And when there's an
accident like this,

00:11:24.418 --> 00:11:26.353 align:middle line:90%
the tax payer pays for it again.

00:11:26.353 --> 00:11:28.288 align:middle line:84%
Nuclear power is
not cheap at all.

00:11:28.288 --> 00:11:32.492 align:middle line:84%
It's very dangerous. People that
are involved with government

00:11:32.492 --> 00:11:35.061 align:middle line:84%
that get officials
elected that are involved

00:11:35.061 --> 00:11:39.833 align:middle line:84%
with the nuclear power industry
are the ones that are motivated

00:11:39.833 --> 00:11:42.769 align:middle line:84%
by factors that don't have
to do with human safety.

00:11:42.769 --> 00:11:44.104 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: No, not at all.

00:11:44.104 --> 00:11:48.375 align:middle line:84%
And lest it sound like we're
bashing the fellows at TEPCO

00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:51.845 align:middle line:84%
and in Japan, the reality is
we've done it, Russia has done

00:11:51.845 --> 00:11:54.714 align:middle line:84%
it, we know for a fact that most
countries are covering this

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:56.216 align:middle line:84%
information up to
their own people

00:11:56.216 --> 00:11:58.185 align:middle line:84%
for the same reasons,
for economic gain.

00:11:58.185 --> 00:12:00.220 align:middle line:90%
Purely economic gain.

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:04.090 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
cores themselves, okay?

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:06.092 align:middle line:90%
The reactors themselves.

00:12:06.092 --> 00:12:09.129 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I was reading
through some of your material

00:12:09.129 --> 00:12:13.900 align:middle line:84%
and you were saying that some of
these cores, here we have one,

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:17.537 align:middle line:84%
two, three, and four
reactors. Now one, two,

00:12:17.537 --> 00:12:21.007 align:middle line:84%
and three are reaching what
is called the China syndrome.

00:12:21.007 --> 00:12:24.211 align:middle line:84%
And if you can talk a little bit
about exactly what that means,

00:12:24.211 --> 00:12:28.682 align:middle line:84%
and how close those are to
that, and the information

00:12:28.682 --> 00:12:32.686 align:middle line:84%
that has been given out
officially around what's going

00:12:32.686 --> 00:12:34.821 align:middle line:84%
on there, that would
be very helpful to us.

00:12:34.821 --> 00:12:35.922 align:middle line:90%
>> Apsley: Very helpful.

00:12:35.922 --> 00:12:37.557 align:middle line:90%
So we know for background

00:12:37.557 --> 00:12:40.760 align:middle line:84%
that Chernobyl likely
caused the death of just

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.662 align:middle line:90%
under a million people.

00:12:42.662 --> 00:12:45.532 align:middle line:84%
From the five-year
study that was done

00:12:45.532 --> 00:12:50.337 align:middle line:84%
over a twenty year time period
by five Russian epidemiologists.

00:12:50.337 --> 00:12:51.538 align:middle line:90%
They were meticulous

00:12:51.538 --> 00:12:56.543 align:middle line:84%
in surveying 5,000
peer-reviewed studies and showed

00:12:56.543 --> 00:13:00.180 align:middle line:84%
that about a million
people were killed.

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:02.649 align:middle line:90%
Eight million were crippled.

00:13:02.649 --> 00:13:07.087 align:middle line:84%
Now, at Unit one,
there's approximately two

00:13:07.087 --> 00:13:10.156 align:middle line:84%
to three times the amount of
nuclear fuel that has melted

00:13:10.156 --> 00:13:12.659 align:middle line:90%
down compared to Chernobyl.

00:13:12.659 --> 00:13:15.462 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Two to three times
just in reactor Number One?

00:13:15.462 --> 00:13:17.864 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: Just in
Unit Number One.

00:13:17.864 --> 00:13:19.900 align:middle line:90%
And Unit Number Two, same thing.

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.768 align:middle line:84%
And Unit Number Three,
same thing.

00:13:21.768 --> 00:13:23.837 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So we're looking
at a multiple of what?

00:13:23.837 --> 00:13:25.872 align:middle line:90%
>> Apsley: At least seven.

00:13:25.872 --> 00:13:27.507 align:middle line:90%
And that's the hush-hush.

00:13:27.507 --> 00:13:29.576 align:middle line:84%
That's what nobody
wants to talk about.

00:13:29.576 --> 00:13:33.079 align:middle line:84%
But from all of the science
and from knowing the history

00:13:33.079 --> 00:13:34.714 align:middle line:84%
of Three Mile Island
and Chernobyl

00:13:34.714 --> 00:13:38.018 align:middle line:84%
and what damage was actually
done -- see, let me take --

00:13:38.018 --> 00:13:40.253 align:middle line:90%
and give the audience an idea.

00:13:40.253 --> 00:13:44.558 align:middle line:84%
All of the predictions
for human loss of life

00:13:44.558 --> 00:13:50.030 align:middle line:84%
and injury are based upon
theoretical mathematical models.

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:52.398 align:middle line:90%
They have never been accurate.

00:13:52.398 --> 00:13:57.404 align:middle line:84%
What does portend the truth
is actual historical facts.

00:13:57.404 --> 00:14:01.441 align:middle line:84%
So if Chernobyl told us that a
million people died over twenty

00:14:01.441 --> 00:14:04.377 align:middle line:84%
to twenty-five years, and
eight million were crippled

00:14:04.377 --> 00:14:07.948 align:middle line:84%
over twenty to twenty-five
years and now we have unit one,

00:14:07.948 --> 00:14:11.384 align:middle line:84%
unit two, unit three, that
had basically complete core

00:14:11.384 --> 00:14:12.752 align:middle line:90%
meltdowns --

00:14:12.752 --> 00:14:14.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: We're looking
at essentially a factor

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.623 align:middle line:84%
of about 63 million that
would be impacted.

00:14:16.623 --> 00:14:17.691 align:middle line:90%
>> Apsley: Yeah.

00:14:17.691 --> 00:14:19.159 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at no
less, in my opinion,

00:14:19.159 --> 00:14:22.228 align:middle line:84%
than seven million people
dead over twenty-five years,

00:14:22.228 --> 00:14:24.464 align:middle line:84%
and then over the next
80 years past that,

00:14:24.464 --> 00:14:26.333 align:middle line:90%
another seven million.

00:14:26.333 --> 00:14:28.501 align:middle line:84%
And the same way
with the injuries.

00:14:28.501 --> 00:14:31.705 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at seven
times eight crippled,

00:14:31.705 --> 00:14:33.506 align:middle line:84%
and then another seven
times eight crippled

00:14:33.506 --> 00:14:35.709 align:middle line:84%
over the average 80
years from there.

00:14:35.709 --> 00:14:37.844 align:middle line:84%
Now this -- the reason
is, is because one

00:14:37.844 --> 00:14:42.415 align:middle line:84%
of the most lethal radioactive
hot particles is cesium 137

00:14:42.415 --> 00:14:43.750 align:middle line:90%
and 134.

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:47.721 align:middle line:84%
And it has a biological
impact of 300 years.

00:14:47.721 --> 00:14:49.556 align:middle line:90%
It just doesn't stop.

00:14:49.556 --> 00:14:51.523 align:middle line:90%
That's the problem.

00:14:51.523 --> 00:14:54.828 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And there are
some other very esoteric,

00:14:54.828 --> 00:14:59.332 align:middle line:84%
interesting information
surrounding that cesium 134

00:14:59.332 --> 00:15:02.168 align:middle line:84%
and 137 that we'll get
to in a little bit.

00:15:02.168 --> 00:15:05.739 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what
happened with Number Four.

00:15:05.739 --> 00:15:09.509 align:middle line:84%
Because we all saw the
news a couple of weeks ago,

00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:12.612 align:middle line:84%
they were going to
start removing the rods

00:15:12.612 --> 00:15:15.982 align:middle line:84%
and this is very, very
tricky and dangerous.

00:15:15.982 --> 00:15:19.986 align:middle line:84%
This isn't -- on a scale that
hasn't ever been done before.

00:15:19.986 --> 00:15:21.121 align:middle line:90%
>> Apsley: That's correct.

00:15:21.121 --> 00:15:23.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Let's talk
about what that entails

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:26.259 align:middle line:84%
and what the implications
are of that.

00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:29.629 align:middle line:84%
And also if you know,
how that's progressing.

00:15:29.629 --> 00:15:30.897 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: Well,
what we're looking

00:15:30.897 --> 00:15:35.035 align:middle line:84%
at here are the stored
fuel rods at unit four.

00:15:35.035 --> 00:15:37.103 align:middle line:84%
Unit four was not
active at the time,

00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:39.305 align:middle line:90%
it was just a storage facility.

00:15:39.305 --> 00:15:43.043 align:middle line:84%
The pool here underwent
at least three fires

00:15:43.043 --> 00:15:45.045 align:middle line:90%
and several explosions.

00:15:45.045 --> 00:15:47.480 align:middle line:84%
That meant that the water
had to come off the top

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.916 align:middle line:90%
of these stored fuel rods.

00:15:49.916 --> 00:15:52.719 align:middle line:84%
The individual squares
are called assemblies.

00:15:52.719 --> 00:15:56.423 align:middle line:84%
They hold a number of
rods, up to 60 to 70 rods.

00:15:56.423 --> 00:15:59.492 align:middle line:84%
And they were damaged during
the fires and the explosions,

00:15:59.492 --> 00:16:01.694 align:middle line:90%
and nobody knows to what extent.

00:16:01.694 --> 00:16:05.832 align:middle line:84%
Now that will cause the
entire assembly to be brittle.

00:16:05.832 --> 00:16:08.768 align:middle line:84%
So when they're lifted out
and put into other containers

00:16:08.768 --> 00:16:11.704 align:middle line:84%
for safe removal they
could easily break apart.

00:16:11.704 --> 00:16:15.975 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're considering to
be the greatest risk right now.

00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:18.411 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But they are
underway in doing this, right?

00:16:18.411 --> 00:16:19.779 align:middle line:90%
>> Apsley: Yes.

00:16:19.779 --> 00:16:24.851 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And where are these
rods, these brittle, broken,

00:16:24.851 --> 00:16:27.554 align:middle line:84%
spent, whatever,
rods being sent to?

00:16:27.554 --> 00:16:29.522 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: Well, they're
going to be moved next door.

00:16:29.522 --> 00:16:30.924 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: What do
you mean next door?

00:16:30.924 --> 00:16:33.927 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: Well, there's another
storage facility that has one

00:16:33.927 --> 00:16:37.630 align:middle line:84%
of the world's largest
stores of nuclear material.

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's only 200
feet, 300 feet away.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.205 align:middle line:84%
So we have a diagram, if
you look at reactor four,

00:16:45.205 --> 00:16:48.508 align:middle line:84%
there's an arrow there that
points to the actual building,

00:16:48.508 --> 00:16:51.544 align:middle line:84%
to the upper left,
the slight upper left,

00:16:51.544 --> 00:16:54.914 align:middle line:84%
is one of the world's
largest storage facilities.

00:16:54.914 --> 00:16:58.251 align:middle line:84%
It's called the Common
Fuel Storage Facility.

00:16:58.251 --> 00:17:02.455 align:middle line:84%
It houses well over 6,000
of these assemblies.

00:17:02.455 --> 00:17:04.557 align:middle line:90%
It's just a huge facility.

00:17:04.557 --> 00:17:08.861 align:middle line:84%
Now what we're worried about
is that if an event, a fire,

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:11.563 align:middle line:84%
a massive fire breaks
out at Unit four,

00:17:11.563 --> 00:17:13.700 align:middle line:84%
it could turn off
again the electricity

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.534 align:middle line:90%
in the entire campus.

00:17:15.534 --> 00:17:19.339 align:middle line:84%
That would eventually cause
the Common Storage fuel pool

00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:20.673 align:middle line:90%
to fail.

00:17:20.673 --> 00:17:24.043 align:middle line:84%
It might take several weeks,
but that's one of the risks.

00:17:24.043 --> 00:17:28.948 align:middle line:84%
With the amount of cesium,
just one of the thirty elements

00:17:28.948 --> 00:17:32.051 align:middle line:84%
that we're most concerned with,
with the amount of cesium that's

00:17:32.051 --> 00:17:34.954 align:middle line:84%
in both unit four
and the common,

00:17:34.954 --> 00:17:37.957 align:middle line:84%
it's enough to contaminate
the entire northern hemisphere

00:17:37.957 --> 00:17:43.163 align:middle line:84%
and cause massive
extinction events.

00:17:43.163 --> 00:17:44.264 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay --

00:17:44.264 --> 00:17:44.964 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: That's what
we're worried about.

00:17:44.964 --> 00:17:47.667 align:middle line:90%
So let me explain this.

00:17:47.667 --> 00:17:52.572 align:middle line:84%
Those fuel assemblies
are 15 feet tall.

00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:57.343 align:middle line:84%
They have to be lifted out with
a crane and if they're brittle

00:17:57.343 --> 00:17:59.145 align:middle line:90%
from the prior fires

00:17:59.145 --> 00:18:01.447 align:middle line:84%
and explosions they
could break apart.

00:18:01.447 --> 00:18:04.584 align:middle line:84%
If they break apart, they fall
back down, they land on top

00:18:04.584 --> 00:18:07.453 align:middle line:84%
of other assemblies, and
that's where a chain reaction

00:18:07.453 --> 00:18:10.590 align:middle line:84%
or a near-chain reaction
starts to cause a fire.

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:14.294 align:middle line:84%
What happened during the
tsunami to unit four was

00:18:14.294 --> 00:18:17.564 align:middle line:84%
because of the ground water
saturating the ground underneath

00:18:17.564 --> 00:18:21.334 align:middle line:84%
unit four and the tsunami,
unit four started tilting

00:18:21.334 --> 00:18:23.236 align:middle line:90%
like the Tower of Pisa.

00:18:23.236 --> 00:18:26.306 align:middle line:84%
And they became concerned
that it could topple.

00:18:26.306 --> 00:18:28.908 align:middle line:84%
If it did topple with
that amount of fuel just

00:18:28.908 --> 00:18:31.778 align:middle line:84%
in unit four, that meant
that a fire would start

00:18:31.778 --> 00:18:33.246 align:middle line:90%
that could not be put out,

00:18:33.246 --> 00:18:36.249 align:middle line:84%
and that would risk the
Common Storage Facility,

00:18:36.249 --> 00:18:38.017 align:middle line:90%
you know, 200 feet away.

00:18:38.017 --> 00:18:43.156 align:middle line:84%
So they built as fast as they
could a building on top of it

00:18:43.156 --> 00:18:48.127 align:middle line:84%
that enables the -- these
assemblies to be pulled out and

00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:50.997 align:middle line:84%
put into great caskets that
can then be off-loaded

00:18:50.997 --> 00:18:53.533 align:middle line:90%
into a safer area of the campus.

00:18:53.533 --> 00:18:55.501 align:middle line:90%
That's going to take 18 months.

00:18:55.501 --> 00:18:57.337 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: 18 months
if thing go well.

00:18:57.337 --> 00:18:59.005 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: If things
go well, right.

00:18:59.005 --> 00:19:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: What is
the current status?

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.109 align:middle line:84%
Have they been successful
in removing some

00:19:03.109 --> 00:19:05.011 align:middle line:90%
of the rods safely thus far?

00:19:05.011 --> 00:19:08.114 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: Well, as I said,
two weeks ago they put a black

00:19:08.114 --> 00:19:11.618 align:middle line:84%
out -- it is against
the law for information

00:19:11.618 --> 00:19:14.187 align:middle line:84%
to be released now
from Fukushima.

00:19:14.187 --> 00:19:18.024 align:middle line:84%
That was done by parliament
about two to three weeks ago.

00:19:18.024 --> 00:19:19.892 align:middle line:90%
That's not good.

00:19:19.892 --> 00:19:23.897 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And you know,
this could be rumor,

00:19:23.897 --> 00:19:27.066 align:middle line:84%
but depending on,
you know, the source,

00:19:27.066 --> 00:19:30.103 align:middle line:90%
there has been some implication

00:19:30.103 --> 00:19:34.841 align:middle line:84%
that there's plutonium
involved as well?

00:19:34.841 --> 00:19:35.975 align:middle line:90%
>> Apsley: There is plutonium.

00:19:35.975 --> 00:19:37.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: In reactor
number four, in particular.

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:39.913 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: Well, there was
more in unit number three,

00:19:39.913 --> 00:19:42.348 align:middle line:84%
but there's plutonium in
all of these facilities.

00:19:42.348 --> 00:19:45.351 align:middle line:84%
And of course that's
among the most dangerous

00:19:45.351 --> 00:19:46.953 align:middle line:90%
and lethal of all the particles.

00:19:46.953 --> 00:19:49.289 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So that
is accurate, anyway?

00:19:49.289 --> 00:19:51.457 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: It's an absolute
fact, there is plutonium

00:19:51.457 --> 00:19:56.062 align:middle line:84%
that has been sprayed in
large areas of Fukushima.

00:19:56.062 --> 00:20:00.934 align:middle line:84%
There were large particles that
wound up over half a mile away.

00:20:00.934 --> 00:20:03.436 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
heaviest metals known.

00:20:03.436 --> 00:20:04.837 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:20:04.837 --> 00:20:07.473 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: And then it could be
vaporized into tiny particles

00:20:07.473 --> 00:20:10.643 align:middle line:84%
that have been actually tracked
over to the United States.

00:20:10.643 --> 00:20:11.844 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:20:11.844 --> 00:20:15.715 align:middle line:84%
Okay. Let's talk about
the migration patterns,

00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:17.684 align:middle line:84%
we've looked at what's
happening there.

00:20:17.684 --> 00:20:20.286 align:middle line:84%
Now that there's a black
out we're not likely

00:20:20.286 --> 00:20:22.655 align:middle line:84%
to hear much more from
any official sources,

00:20:22.655 --> 00:20:24.490 align:middle line:84%
not that we've heard
much from them anyway,

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:28.094 align:middle line:84%
in terms of how the extraction
of the rods is going, right?

00:20:28.094 --> 00:20:30.396 align:middle line:84%
And so the rest you've
caught us up-to-date

00:20:30.396 --> 00:20:31.631 align:middle line:90%
in terms of what you know.

00:20:31.631 --> 00:20:33.299 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything else
that you care to share

00:20:33.299 --> 00:20:36.669 align:middle line:84%
about the condition of the
four reactors at this time?

00:20:36.669 --> 00:20:39.172 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: Well, just to finish
up that section on unit four,

00:20:39.172 --> 00:20:41.441 align:middle line:84%
it's not just me that's bringing
this forward, there's a lot

00:20:41.441 --> 00:20:43.343 align:middle line:84%
of other great scientists
much smarter than I,

00:20:43.343 --> 00:20:45.345 align:middle line:90%
including the former chairman

00:20:45.345 --> 00:20:48.481 align:middle line:84%
of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, Dr. Jacko.

00:20:48.481 --> 00:20:52.285 align:middle line:84%
He's going around in as
many locations as he can

00:20:52.285 --> 00:20:55.421 align:middle line:84%
to warn the public about
this unit four risk.

00:20:55.421 --> 00:20:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Over the next 18 months,
we have to watch it.

00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:59.959 align:middle line:84%
Let me give your
audience some signs.

00:20:59.959 --> 00:21:02.895 align:middle line:84%
If there's ever an announcement
that a fire has broken

00:21:02.895 --> 00:21:05.231 align:middle line:84%
out at unit four that
does get out to the press,

00:21:05.231 --> 00:21:09.635 align:middle line:84%
and it likely would if there's a
serious event, there's 48 hours

00:21:09.635 --> 00:21:12.839 align:middle line:84%
that would be needed to kind of
see if it would quench itself,

00:21:12.839 --> 00:21:14.741 align:middle line:90%
it would be contained.

00:21:14.741 --> 00:21:17.577 align:middle line:84%
That would be bad
but not horrific

00:21:17.577 --> 00:21:19.379 align:middle line:90%
for the west coast of the US.

00:21:19.379 --> 00:21:22.682 align:middle line:90%
If, however, they state we have

00:21:22.682 --> 00:21:26.152 align:middle line:84%
to evacuate the plant,
that's bad.

00:21:26.152 --> 00:21:29.522 align:middle line:84%
That means the west coast within
six to seven days is going

00:21:29.522 --> 00:21:32.258 align:middle line:84%
to get hit with a massive
amount of fall out.

00:21:32.258 --> 00:21:33.726 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I worry about.

00:21:33.726 --> 00:21:36.562 align:middle line:84%
So there are thing that
we can do to deal with that.

00:21:36.562 --> 00:21:38.064 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So pay
attention to the news

00:21:38.064 --> 00:21:41.100 align:middle line:84%
of either a fire
or an evacuation?

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:42.502 align:middle line:90%
>> Apsley: That's correct.

00:21:42.502 --> 00:21:44.170 align:middle line:84%
Now let's get back to units one,
two, and three with the leakage

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:45.638 align:middle line:84%
into the ocean that's
already happened.

00:21:45.638 --> 00:21:46.706 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:21:46.706 --> 00:21:48.141 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: My book
predicted, it forecasted

00:21:48.141 --> 00:21:50.476 align:middle line:84%
that seven times the
amount of radiation

00:21:50.476 --> 00:21:53.112 align:middle line:84%
from the Chernobyl
incident would be released

00:21:53.112 --> 00:21:54.480 align:middle line:90%
from Fukushima.

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.249 align:middle line:90%
We know -- we have confirmation

00:21:56.249 --> 00:21:59.185 align:middle line:84%
that three times the amount
has indeed been released

00:21:59.185 --> 00:22:01.554 align:middle line:90%
into the Pacific Ocean already.

00:22:01.554 --> 00:22:06.893 align:middle line:84%
Now that is something that
can cause massive initiations

00:22:06.893 --> 00:22:10.096 align:middle line:84%
of damage to the food
chain in the Pacific

00:22:10.096 --> 00:22:13.099 align:middle line:84%
that might rival
extinction events.

00:22:13.099 --> 00:22:15.868 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that National
Geographic just published

00:22:15.868 --> 00:22:19.172 align:middle line:84%
on November 5 an
incredible study

00:22:19.172 --> 00:22:22.508 align:middle line:84%
that showed while they were
surveying the ocean bottom

00:22:22.508 --> 00:22:26.112 align:middle line:84%
around the west coast of the
US, they normally expect to find

00:22:26.112 --> 00:22:29.916 align:middle line:84%
about 1% dead matter
on the ocean floor.

00:22:29.916 --> 00:22:32.051 align:middle line:90%
They're seeing 98%.

00:22:32.051 --> 00:22:33.052 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Is that true?

00:22:33.052 --> 00:22:34.520 align:middle line:84%
Now I've seen the
articles come out,

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:37.256 align:middle line:84%
then I've seen I think it
was an article by someone --

00:22:37.256 --> 00:22:39.725 align:middle line:90%
a marine biologist at Deep Sea.

00:22:39.725 --> 00:22:42.228 align:middle line:84%
Deep Sea said no,
not the case at all.

00:22:42.228 --> 00:22:43.362 align:middle line:90%
And I know there are a lot

00:22:43.362 --> 00:22:45.932 align:middle line:84%
of people shooting
articles via the web back

00:22:45.932 --> 00:22:47.333 align:middle line:90%
and forth to each other.

00:22:47.333 --> 00:22:50.736 align:middle line:84%
It's near an extinction kind
of event, others saying no,

00:22:50.736 --> 00:22:52.872 align:middle line:90%
that's absolutely not true.

00:22:52.872 --> 00:22:54.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Apsley: This is the battle.

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:58.511 align:middle line:84%
The point of propaganda is
to turn truth into untruth,

00:22:58.511 --> 00:23:00.546 align:middle line:90%
and to turn untruth into truth.

00:23:00.546 --> 00:23:03.883 align:middle line:84%
To be able to sort that out
scientifically is a real

00:23:03.883 --> 00:23:07.153 align:middle line:84%
problem, because we have
the bending of science occur

00:23:07.153 --> 00:23:10.957 align:middle line:84%
because some of these big vested
interests can hire the greatest

00:23:10.957 --> 00:23:14.227 align:middle line:84%
scientists to state whatever
they want them to state.

00:23:14.227 --> 00:23:15.761 align:middle line:90%
National Geographic is one

00:23:15.761 --> 00:23:18.197 align:middle line:84%
of the most experienced
scientific groups

00:23:18.197 --> 00:23:20.533 align:middle line:84%
that has been monitoring
the ocean floor

00:23:20.533 --> 00:23:22.502 align:middle line:90%
for a number of years.

00:23:22.502 --> 00:23:24.637 align:middle line:84%
They're very, very credible
in what they publish.

00:23:24.637 --> 00:23:25.738 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: They are.

00:23:25.738 --> 00:23:27.940 align:middle line:84%
But you know what, I
learned more recently

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:32.011 align:middle line:84%
that they have editorial
controls at the top also,

00:23:32.011 --> 00:23:33.946 align:middle line:84%
depending on if --
I'm just saying this,

00:23:33.946 --> 00:23:35.948 align:middle line:84%
I'm playing devil's
advocate now.

00:23:35.948 --> 00:23:39.051 align:middle line:84%
If they have a particular
agenda, and you have to look

00:23:39.051 --> 00:23:44.357 align:middle line:84%
at it, would it be in
anybody's best interest

00:23:44.357 --> 00:23:46.959 align:middle line:84%
to terrify the public
to that extent?

00:23:46.959 --> 00:23:48.127 align:middle line:90%
Maybe yes, maybe no.

00:23:48.127 --> 00:23:49.562 align:middle line:90%
I'm just saying what if.

00:23:49.562 --> 00:23:51.898 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: Well,
let's look at what if.

00:23:51.898 --> 00:23:56.102 align:middle line:84%
Let's say there are people that
have enough data to show --

00:23:56.102 --> 00:23:59.572 align:middle line:84%
we've got to really question
that National Geographic data.

00:23:59.572 --> 00:24:02.742 align:middle line:84%
Well, then how do you explain
the number of sea orcas,

00:24:02.742 --> 00:24:06.612 align:middle line:84%
the killer whales, the massive
die-off we've seen with them.

00:24:06.612 --> 00:24:09.115 align:middle line:84%
How do you explain the
salmon runs that are going

00:24:09.115 --> 00:24:11.384 align:middle line:84%
into the lowest numbers
they've ever seen.

00:24:11.384 --> 00:24:14.153 align:middle line:84%
How do you explain the
tuna, the blue fin tuna

00:24:14.153 --> 00:24:17.223 align:middle line:84%
that comes all the way, migrates
across the Pacific, both ways,

00:24:17.223 --> 00:24:20.259 align:middle line:84%
several times a year,
100% contaminated

00:24:22.595 --> 00:24:25.464 align:middle line:84%
How do you explain the
starfish massively melting.

00:24:25.464 --> 00:24:26.599 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:24:26.599 --> 00:24:27.633 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: How do you
explain the sea urchins?

00:24:27.633 --> 00:24:29.502 align:middle line:84%
How do you explain
the sea otter?

00:24:29.502 --> 00:24:34.106 align:middle line:84%
These are events that different
scientific bodies are recording

00:24:34.106 --> 00:24:39.645 align:middle line:84%
and we also have what appears
to be a lack of information

00:24:39.645 --> 00:24:42.448 align:middle line:84%
and confirmation coming
from our own US FDA

00:24:42.448 --> 00:24:45.685 align:middle line:84%
and the Canadian Food
Inspection Agency.

00:24:45.685 --> 00:24:47.053 align:middle line:90%
So what's happened?

00:24:47.053 --> 00:24:49.555 align:middle line:84%
It's gone into the
hands of universities

00:24:49.555 --> 00:24:52.925 align:middle line:84%
and investigative reporters
that bring the truth forward.

00:24:52.925 --> 00:24:55.761 align:middle line:84%
I consider those people just
as credible as anyone else.

00:24:55.761 --> 00:24:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I was
agree with that.

00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:59.098 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:24:59.098 --> 00:25:02.568 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when Fukushima
happened, aside from the shock

00:25:02.568 --> 00:25:05.237 align:middle line:84%
and horror everybody went
through, my instinct was,

00:25:05.237 --> 00:25:08.040 align:middle line:84%
I know this is bizarre,
every now and then I

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:12.211 align:middle line:84%
like wild-caught tuna, and so I
called my fisherman that I buy

00:25:12.211 --> 00:25:15.281 align:middle line:84%
from in Oregon and
ordered that day,

00:25:15.281 --> 00:25:17.917 align:middle line:84%
before anything could
reach the west coast.

00:25:17.917 --> 00:25:21.554 align:middle line:84%
And that supply has run out, and
I know many, many people feel

00:25:21.554 --> 00:25:25.391 align:middle line:84%
like I do, that's kind of
it for any kind of sea food

00:25:25.391 --> 00:25:27.927 align:middle line:90%
from the Pacific Ocean.

00:25:27.927 --> 00:25:30.129 align:middle line:90%
>> Apsley: Good, wise decision.

00:25:30.129 --> 00:25:31.597 align:middle line:90%
Until proven otherwise --

00:25:31.597 --> 00:25:34.700 align:middle line:84%
there's a rule in science
that I think is the thing

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:36.168 align:middle line:90%
that we need to use here.

00:25:36.168 --> 00:25:39.872 align:middle line:84%
Until proven otherwise
that the sea food is safe,

00:25:39.872 --> 00:25:41.240 align:middle line:90%
let's just stay away from it.

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:44.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But the FDA isn't
supplying us with any data,

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:47.413 align:middle line:84%
they're not -- no special
precautions, testing,

00:25:47.413 --> 00:25:49.448 align:middle line:90%
batch testing, nothing.

00:25:49.448 --> 00:25:52.018 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: No. In my book I
document that Hillary Clinton

00:25:52.018 --> 00:25:53.319 align:middle line:90%
who was the secretary --

00:25:53.319 --> 00:25:58.190 align:middle line:84%
what was she, the head of
the Department of State --

00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:01.794 align:middle line:84%
yeah, she told the
Japanese don't worry,

00:26:01.794 --> 00:26:03.763 align:middle line:84%
we're going to help you
economically, we'll make sure

00:26:03.763 --> 00:26:07.333 align:middle line:84%
that the market channels
stay open.

00:26:07.333 --> 00:26:10.703 align:middle line:84%
Well, the FDA was sitting there
on all the ports monitoring

00:26:10.703 --> 00:26:11.904 align:middle line:90%
from radiation coming in.

00:26:11.904 --> 00:26:16.008 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly that stops, or
it was severely curtailed.

00:26:16.008 --> 00:26:18.144 align:middle line:84%
The same thing happened
in Canada.

00:26:18.144 --> 00:26:20.179 align:middle line:84%
So that's when these
universities

00:26:20.179 --> 00:26:22.181 align:middle line:84%
and investigative
reporters started noticing

00:26:22.181 --> 00:26:24.850 align:middle line:84%
that when the Japanese
fleets that fish all over

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:28.087 align:middle line:84%
the Pacific were dropping
off their seafood

00:26:28.087 --> 00:26:29.722 align:middle line:90%
in the Canadian ports.

00:26:29.722 --> 00:26:33.959 align:middle line:84%
And 90% of it was
contaminated with 134 and 137,

00:26:33.959 --> 00:26:37.830 align:middle line:84%
it can only have come from
Fukushima if it has 134 in it.

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:41.033 align:middle line:84%
That's cesium, that
particular kind of cesium.

00:26:41.033 --> 00:26:45.504 align:middle line:84%
So there's something foul
going on with our agencies.

00:26:45.504 --> 00:26:49.809 align:middle line:84%
They're not designed to
protect the public so much

00:26:49.809 --> 00:26:51.577 align:middle line:90%
as these agencies are designed

00:26:51.577 --> 00:26:53.779 align:middle line:84%
to protect the policies
of the government.

00:26:53.779 --> 00:26:54.714 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:26:54.714 --> 00:26:56.582 align:middle line:84%
I would absolutely
agree with that.

00:26:56.582 --> 00:27:00.419 align:middle line:84%
Okay, so I was going to
ask you about the center --

00:27:00.419 --> 00:27:02.388 align:middle line:90%
the Center For Disease Control.

00:27:02.388 --> 00:27:05.391 align:middle line:84%
But there was something else I
wanted to talk to you about

00:27:05.391 --> 00:27:06.892 align:middle line:90%
prior to that -- before that.

00:27:06.892 --> 00:27:10.463 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I know what it was, it had
to do with the distribution

00:27:10.463 --> 00:27:15.601 align:middle line:84%
of air borne versus ocean
migrations of the radiation.

00:27:15.601 --> 00:27:18.070 align:middle line:84%
We'll look at the ocean
migrations and some graphs

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:19.905 align:middle line:90%
of it in a little bit.

00:27:19.905 --> 00:27:24.643 align:middle line:84%
But Patrick Flanagan created
-- I believe he was --

00:27:24.643 --> 00:27:26.545 align:middle line:84%
he was involved in
the creation --

00:27:26.545 --> 00:27:28.647 align:middle line:84%
fiddling, he's always
creating things,

00:27:28.647 --> 00:27:31.650 align:middle line:84%
of a super-sensitive
Geiger counter.

00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:34.720 align:middle line:84%
It picks up things other normal
Geiger counters simply don't

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:35.955 align:middle line:90%
pick up.

00:27:35.955 --> 00:27:37.957 align:middle line:84%
And he has been taking
that with him out and about

00:27:37.957 --> 00:27:41.327 align:middle line:84%
around the United States
and looking at the migration

00:27:41.327 --> 00:27:44.930 align:middle line:84%
of air borne radiation, and
let's just take a quick look

00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:48.067 align:middle line:84%
at what he had to say in
his findings very recently.

00:27:48.067 --> 00:27:53.873 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's coming over
and polluting the waters

00:27:53.873 --> 00:28:00.146 align:middle line:84%
of the entire west coast,
all the way from Canada,

00:28:00.146 --> 00:28:04.683 align:middle line:84%
all the way down to the
tip of South America.

00:28:04.683 --> 00:28:12.124 align:middle line:84%
And -- and there's a huge amount
of -- of radiation in the water

00:28:12.124 --> 00:28:18.164 align:middle line:84%
and some of it's also in
the air, sweeping over.

00:28:18.164 --> 00:28:23.068 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we're getting more
radiation than the people

00:28:23.068 --> 00:28:26.138 align:middle line:90%
who live in Japan are getting

00:28:26.138 --> 00:28:30.042 align:middle line:84%
because it's all
blowing this way.

00:28:30.042 --> 00:28:36.315 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So it appears that --
I mean, one would have to assume

00:28:36.315 --> 00:28:39.952 align:middle line:84%
that this air borne radiation
has already completed its

00:28:39.952 --> 00:28:41.220 align:middle line:90%
circuit around the planet.

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.088 align:middle line:84%
Is there any place that
has not been exposed

00:28:43.088 --> 00:28:44.323 align:middle line:90%
to the air borne radiation?

00:28:44.323 --> 00:28:46.559 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: Well, the
southern hemisphere is fairly

00:28:46.559 --> 00:28:47.960 align:middle line:90%
well protected.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:51.897 align:middle line:84%
It will cross over, but it will
take longer and less will do so.

00:28:51.897 --> 00:28:54.667 align:middle line:84%
So the southern hemisphere
is relatively protected.

00:28:54.667 --> 00:28:57.703 align:middle line:84%
Both in the ocean currents
as well as the air.

00:28:57.703 --> 00:28:59.104 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Sounds like Canada

00:28:59.104 --> 00:29:02.441 align:middle line:84%
and the United States are the
most vulnerable at this time.

00:29:02.441 --> 00:29:03.242 align:middle line:90%
>> Apsley: And Europe as well.

00:29:03.242 --> 00:29:05.411 align:middle line:90%
But yes. Also you have times

00:29:05.411 --> 00:29:07.913 align:middle line:84%
when there's lots
of precipitation.

00:29:07.913 --> 00:29:11.283 align:middle line:84%
And so if it happens to
coincide when there's fall

00:29:11.283 --> 00:29:14.920 align:middle line:84%
out in the upper atmosphere, the
moisture will cling on to that

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.522 align:middle line:84%
and then drop it to
the Earth at that time.

00:29:16.522 --> 00:29:18.157 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you an example.

00:29:18.157 --> 00:29:22.494 align:middle line:84%
During the after math of
the explosions at Fukushima,

00:29:22.494 --> 00:29:25.231 align:middle line:84%
Philadelphia was one of
the hardest-hit areas,

00:29:25.231 --> 00:29:29.201 align:middle line:84%
according to Centers for
Disease Control data,

00:29:29.201 --> 00:29:34.073 align:middle line:84%
the infant death rate jumped
to over 40% in Philadelphia

00:29:34.073 --> 00:29:36.876 align:middle line:84%
because it had received
one of the highest levels

00:29:36.876 --> 00:29:38.878 align:middle line:84%
of rainfall during
that time period.

00:29:38.878 --> 00:29:41.614 align:middle line:84%
We saw the same thing
occur in Vancouver, Canada

00:29:41.614 --> 00:29:45.417 align:middle line:84%
where it jumped up to I think
it was close to 45% or higher,

00:29:45.417 --> 00:29:46.452 align:middle line:90%
the infant death rate.

00:29:46.452 --> 00:29:49.488 align:middle line:84%
And we saw an average
of 30% increase

00:29:49.488 --> 00:29:51.891 align:middle line:84%
in the infant death rate
along the west coast,

00:29:51.891 --> 00:29:53.559 align:middle line:90%
all the way down to San Diego.

00:29:53.559 --> 00:29:54.793 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:29:54.793 --> 00:29:58.264 align:middle line:84%
Infants are 10 to a thousand
times more vulnerable

00:29:58.264 --> 00:30:01.066 align:middle line:84%
to radioactive particles
than an adult is.

00:30:01.066 --> 00:30:03.535 align:middle line:84%
We have better systems
to keep it under control.

00:30:03.535 --> 00:30:04.770 align:middle line:84%
One thing the audience
ought to keep

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:07.640 align:middle line:84%
in mind is the reason we
can do something about this,

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:10.809 align:middle line:84%
what these hot radioactive
particles do when we inhale them

00:30:10.809 --> 00:30:13.479 align:middle line:84%
or ingest them is they
produce massive amounts

00:30:13.479 --> 00:30:15.147 align:middle line:90%
of hydrogen peroxide.

00:30:15.147 --> 00:30:18.684 align:middle line:84%
We have systems that can
quench that, fortunately.

00:30:18.684 --> 00:30:21.287 align:middle line:84%
We just have to turn that on
full hilt, and then we have

00:30:21.287 --> 00:30:24.123 align:middle line:84%
to remove the hot particle
as quickly as possible,

00:30:24.123 --> 00:30:26.392 align:middle line:90%
and then prevent reexposure.

00:30:26.392 --> 00:30:27.660 align:middle line:90%
That's the answer.

00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:29.895 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Now I'd like to
get into the esoteric part

00:30:29.895 --> 00:30:35.501 align:middle line:84%
of our discussion because we've
hit on cesium 134 and 137.

00:30:35.501 --> 00:30:39.238 align:middle line:84%
And you brought it up off
camera, looking at the flower

00:30:39.238 --> 00:30:41.307 align:middle line:90%
of life behind me saying

00:30:41.307 --> 00:30:45.811 align:middle line:84%
that this is actually a really
intrinsic part of the story.

00:30:45.811 --> 00:30:49.782 align:middle line:84%
So we have a very well-educated
and open-minded audience.

00:30:49.782 --> 00:30:53.319 align:middle line:84%
So maybe you can explain
what the interaction

00:30:53.319 --> 00:30:54.320 align:middle line:90%
between that piece --

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:58.223 align:middle line:84%
that particular geometry
and cesium 134.

00:30:58.223 --> 00:31:00.926 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: So the reason
why that there's the bending

00:31:00.926 --> 00:31:04.229 align:middle line:84%
of science possible with all
of these nuclear accidents,

00:31:04.229 --> 00:31:06.332 align:middle line:84%
and you have one
group argues oh,

00:31:06.332 --> 00:31:09.034 align:middle line:84%
it's lower than normal
background radiation,

00:31:09.034 --> 00:31:11.870 align:middle line:84%
it can't possibly hurt
you, or it will be diluted

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:14.807 align:middle line:84%
over the entire atmosphere
of the northern hemisphere,

00:31:14.807 --> 00:31:15.874 align:middle line:90%
or it will be diluted

00:31:15.874 --> 00:31:18.243 align:middle line:84%
in the Pacific Ocean
before it hurts you

00:31:18.243 --> 00:31:20.846 align:middle line:90%
on the west coast of the US.

00:31:20.846 --> 00:31:23.115 align:middle line:84%
That's the argument that
they stand upon to say

00:31:23.115 --> 00:31:26.952 align:middle line:84%
that there's no harm that's
going to be occurring from this.

00:31:26.952 --> 00:31:31.123 align:middle line:84%
But there's a serious
problem with that.

00:31:31.123 --> 00:31:35.527 align:middle line:84%
The natural borne radiation
does not include cesium 134

00:31:35.527 --> 00:31:38.163 align:middle line:90%
and cesium 137.

00:31:38.163 --> 00:31:42.167 align:middle line:84%
In every cell of our body
there is a new cell biology

00:31:42.167 --> 00:31:43.535 align:middle line:90%
that has been formed by some

00:31:43.535 --> 00:31:47.373 align:middle line:84%
of the most brilliant cell
biologists of our age,

00:31:47.373 --> 00:31:50.909 align:middle line:84%
Gilbert Endling, Freeman
Cope, Raymond Damandean,

00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:53.545 align:middle line:84%
all highly credentialed,
geniuses

00:31:53.545 --> 00:31:56.048 align:middle line:84%
like Einsteins of
cellular biology.

00:31:56.048 --> 00:31:57.583 align:middle line:84%
And what they have done
is they have looked

00:31:57.583 --> 00:32:01.353 align:middle line:84%
at the water molecule inside all
of the cells in the human body

00:32:01.353 --> 00:32:05.290 align:middle line:84%
and they noted that potassium
and a special protein that comes

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:07.993 align:middle line:84%
from mother's breast
milk form a relationship

00:32:07.993 --> 00:32:11.830 align:middle line:84%
to structure water inside
the cells of our body

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:13.565 align:middle line:90%
that basically runs everything.

00:32:13.565 --> 00:32:17.136 align:middle line:84%
It runs the genetic code, it
runs all the enzyme systems.

00:32:17.136 --> 00:32:21.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, potassium is easily
replaced and readily replaced

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:25.277 align:middle line:84%
by tiny amounts of
radioactive cesium.

00:32:25.277 --> 00:32:28.013 align:middle line:84%
So because it does not occur
in nature, it only occurs

00:32:28.013 --> 00:32:32.785 align:middle line:84%
in these accidents or in nuclear
explosions, these tiny amounts

00:32:32.785 --> 00:32:36.121 align:middle line:84%
that don't fit into the idea
that, oh, you have to go

00:32:36.121 --> 00:32:39.425 align:middle line:84%
above a great level to
cause harm to human beings,

00:32:39.425 --> 00:32:41.627 align:middle line:84%
it's completely wiped
off the table.

00:32:41.627 --> 00:32:45.697 align:middle line:84%
Tiny amounts of radioactive
cesium will indeed cause massive

00:32:45.697 --> 00:32:47.066 align:middle line:90%
harm to tissue.

00:32:47.066 --> 00:32:49.201 align:middle line:84%
And it's not easily
taken back out again,

00:32:49.201 --> 00:32:50.836 align:middle line:84%
you have to do it
very specifically

00:32:50.836 --> 00:32:53.739 align:middle line:90%
with very special clays.

00:32:53.739 --> 00:32:57.509 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So the body's
recognizing it. Is it, like,

00:32:57.509 --> 00:33:01.113 align:middle line:84%
faking out the potassium
absorption or something?

00:33:01.113 --> 00:33:02.548 align:middle line:90%
>> Apsley: Exactly.

00:33:02.548 --> 00:33:04.850 align:middle line:84%
The protein we get from mother's
breast milk is a very strong

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:06.685 align:middle line:90%
negatively charged protein.

00:33:06.685 --> 00:33:09.755 align:middle line:84%
Cesium and potassium are
both about the same size

00:33:09.755 --> 00:33:11.824 align:middle line:84%
and they're both
positively charged.

00:33:11.824 --> 00:33:14.359 align:middle line:84%
So that protein just whips it
right out of the blood stream

00:33:14.359 --> 00:33:16.028 align:middle line:84%
and pulls it right
into the cell.

00:33:16.028 --> 00:33:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And then harmonics
develop, which --

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:21.366 align:middle line:84%
you're referring to the esoteric
component of this thing.

00:33:21.366 --> 00:33:24.169 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that water
that's properly structured

00:33:24.169 --> 00:33:28.474 align:middle line:84%
with potassium and the mother's
breast milk protein holds

00:33:28.474 --> 00:33:30.676 align:middle line:90%
memory, it holds our thoughts.

00:33:30.676 --> 00:33:33.445 align:middle line:84%
It could be considered the
mind of the human body.

00:33:33.445 --> 00:33:35.981 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I think Masaru Emoto
popularized the

00:33:35.981 --> 00:33:37.716 align:middle line:84%
notion that water
has memory, but many,

00:33:37.716 --> 00:33:39.151 align:middle line:90%
many other people have done work

00:33:39.151 --> 00:33:41.753 align:middle line:84%
on it decades prior
to that proving it.

00:33:41.753 --> 00:33:43.122 align:middle line:90%
>> Apsley: Exactly.

00:33:43.122 --> 00:33:45.357 align:middle line:84%
Gilbert Link has shown that
the communication between cells

00:33:45.357 --> 00:33:48.627 align:middle line:84%
and within cells is
this structured water.

00:33:48.627 --> 00:33:52.364 align:middle line:84%
And the -- the pulsation
of potassium

00:33:52.364 --> 00:33:55.000 align:middle line:84%
with this protein
with the water.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.103 align:middle line:84%
So if cesium gets in
there that's radioactive

00:33:58.103 --> 00:34:00.305 align:middle line:90%
and it throws the potassium out

00:34:00.305 --> 00:34:03.709 align:middle line:84%
and it just generates huge
amounts of hydrogen peroxide,

00:34:03.709 --> 00:34:07.679 align:middle line:84%
it burns and burns and burns,
and nothing can be done

00:34:07.679 --> 00:34:10.849 align:middle line:84%
about it unless you know
what to do about it.

00:34:10.849 --> 00:34:12.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay.

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:14.086 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to the
Centers for Disease Control

00:34:14.086 --> 00:34:16.988 align:middle line:84%
for just a moment, even though
they're part of the government.

00:34:16.988 --> 00:34:18.689 align:middle line:84%
So who knows what you
can trust from them.

00:34:18.689 --> 00:34:20.892 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, they
do have some data

00:34:20.892 --> 00:34:22.461 align:middle line:84%
that they have published
in terms

00:34:22.461 --> 00:34:24.930 align:middle line:84%
of thyroid disease
and cancer rates.

00:34:24.930 --> 00:34:29.101 align:middle line:84%
Can you just kind of put us in
the loop on the official story?

00:34:29.101 --> 00:34:30.169 align:middle line:90%
>> Apsley: Well, Joe Manguano

00:34:30.169 --> 00:34:32.704 align:middle line:84%
and Janet Sherman
are epidemiologists

00:34:32.704 --> 00:34:35.574 align:middle line:84%
that take the Centers
for Disease Control data,

00:34:35.574 --> 00:34:39.845 align:middle line:84%
the raw data, and if enough
time elapses they can get very

00:34:39.845 --> 00:34:42.948 align:middle line:84%
accurate models as to
how many children --

00:34:42.948 --> 00:34:46.517 align:middle line:84%
in this case children --
were injured and in what way

00:34:46.517 --> 00:34:49.388 align:middle line:84%
that did not occur
in previous years

00:34:49.388 --> 00:34:51.622 align:middle line:84%
when we did not have
a nuclear accident.

00:34:51.622 --> 00:34:54.359 align:middle line:84%
So they did this related
to the Chernobyl incident

00:34:54.359 --> 00:34:56.595 align:middle line:84%
and now they're doing it
with the Fukushima incidents,

00:34:56.595 --> 00:34:58.931 align:middle line:84%
and they've done it
with other events,

00:34:58.931 --> 00:35:02.868 align:middle line:84%
with nuclear power plants that
were leaking, for example.

00:35:02.868 --> 00:35:06.138 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of the latest
study that Joe Manguano

00:35:06.138 --> 00:35:10.709 align:middle line:84%
and Janet Sherman released, it
related to the spike in children

00:35:10.709 --> 00:35:15.781 align:middle line:84%
with thyroid disorders
that can, for all intents

00:35:15.781 --> 00:35:17.583 align:middle line:84%
and purposes, can
only be attributed

00:35:17.583 --> 00:35:19.351 align:middle line:90%
to the Fukushima event.

00:35:19.351 --> 00:35:20.485 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay,
how does this show

00:35:20.485 --> 00:35:22.654 align:middle line:84%
up if you have a little
child, what kind of --

00:35:22.654 --> 00:35:25.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the thyroid is
one of the master glands,

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:28.327 align:middle line:84%
so how does a thyroid
disfunction show up in a child?

00:35:28.327 --> 00:35:31.063 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the
most common signs?

00:35:31.063 --> 00:35:32.231 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: Well,
we talked about it

00:35:32.231 --> 00:35:34.766 align:middle line:84%
when we first started
mentioning about this.

00:35:34.766 --> 00:35:37.703 align:middle line:84%
The first thing that happens
is the immune system plummets

00:35:37.703 --> 00:35:40.405 align:middle line:84%
in the very young,
and so the common cold

00:35:40.405 --> 00:35:42.975 align:middle line:84%
that normally wouldn't be
a problem or the common flu

00:35:42.975 --> 00:35:45.744 align:middle line:84%
that normally wouldn't become
a problem becomes lethal.

00:35:45.744 --> 00:35:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And that causes the
spike in the increase

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.849 align:middle line:90%
in death rates of the infants.

00:35:50.849 --> 00:35:54.887 align:middle line:84%
Later on as this radiation
continues in the children

00:35:54.887 --> 00:35:58.056 align:middle line:84%
that survived, that didn't
die from the initial exposure,

00:35:58.056 --> 00:36:01.526 align:middle line:84%
the thyroid then starts
dwindling in its ability

00:36:01.526 --> 00:36:03.829 align:middle line:84%
and all sorts of chronic
illnesses start seeping

00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:05.697 align:middle line:90%
in at earlier ages.

00:36:05.697 --> 00:36:09.268 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, it can relate
to autoimmune disease

00:36:09.268 --> 00:36:13.171 align:middle line:84%
with the thyroid, and it will
eventually lead to large numbers

00:36:13.171 --> 00:36:15.774 align:middle line:84%
of children having
thyroid cancer.

00:36:15.774 --> 00:36:19.411 align:middle line:84%
That's happening right now
with the Japanese children.

00:36:19.411 --> 00:36:20.812 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay.

00:36:20.812 --> 00:36:24.149 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that I wanted
to get to, because I want to get

00:36:24.149 --> 00:36:27.252 align:middle line:84%
on to all of the ways in which
we can start detoxing our

00:36:27.252 --> 00:36:28.287 align:middle line:90%
bodies, our children's bodies,

00:36:28.287 --> 00:36:31.089 align:middle line:84%
and protecting ourselves
because we can.

00:36:31.089 --> 00:36:34.326 align:middle line:84%
I just feel it's fair for
everybody to know exactly what's

00:36:34.326 --> 00:36:36.261 align:middle line:84%
up and what we're
being exposed to.

00:36:36.261 --> 00:36:40.632 align:middle line:84%
But the one area that very
seldom is ever spoken of is any

00:36:40.632 --> 00:36:44.703 align:middle line:84%
kind of potential, more subtle
radiation exposure that's

00:36:44.703 --> 00:36:47.205 align:middle line:84%
happening from our
own nuclear reactors.

00:36:47.205 --> 00:36:49.441 align:middle line:84%
We spoke about the --
we spoke about them

00:36:49.441 --> 00:36:52.711 align:middle line:84%
for a moment earlier on,
but I don't think people

00:36:52.711 --> 00:36:56.581 align:middle line:84%
in the United States
have an idea of how many

00:36:56.581 --> 00:36:59.751 align:middle line:84%
of these nuclear
facilities exist,

00:36:59.751 --> 00:37:01.086 align:middle line:90%
decommissioned and active.

00:37:01.086 --> 00:37:04.189 align:middle line:84%
So let's just take a look
at a graph to get an idea

00:37:04.189 --> 00:37:06.792 align:middle line:84%
of how much is surrounding
us, just in the United States.

00:37:06.792 --> 00:37:08.694 align:middle line:84%
Not counting France
and other places.

00:37:08.694 --> 00:37:11.697 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
yellow are decommissioned,

00:37:11.697 --> 00:37:13.265 align:middle line:90%
if you can't read that.

00:37:13.265 --> 00:37:18.003 align:middle line:84%
And the red are active
nuclear power plants, right?

00:37:18.003 --> 00:37:20.105 align:middle line:90%
Look at the east coast.

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:23.709 align:middle line:84%
How many facilities
are we looking at here?

00:37:23.709 --> 00:37:26.078 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: A total
of 102, I believe.

00:37:26.078 --> 00:37:29.748 align:middle line:84%
And there's about
70 that are online.

00:37:29.748 --> 00:37:30.882 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay.

00:37:30.882 --> 00:37:38.957 align:middle line:84%
Okay, so what --
realistically, there they are.

00:37:38.957 --> 00:37:42.728 align:middle line:84%
How often would it occur
that there would be some kind

00:37:42.728 --> 00:37:45.998 align:middle line:84%
of effect on the
public at large?

00:37:45.998 --> 00:37:47.399 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: Well,
let's talk about that,

00:37:47.399 --> 00:37:51.703 align:middle line:84%
because this is the real
basis to the problem

00:37:51.703 --> 00:37:54.673 align:middle line:90%
with nuclear power as a whole.

00:37:54.673 --> 00:37:57.809 align:middle line:84%
Any hot particle that's
either inhaled or ingested

00:37:57.809 --> 00:38:00.879 align:middle line:84%
in tiny amounts will
have a profound effect

00:38:00.879 --> 00:38:05.350 align:middle line:84%
on the structural glue that
holds cells together, the fats.

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:07.986 align:middle line:84%
At higher levels,
much higher levels,

00:38:07.986 --> 00:38:09.354 align:middle line:90%
it can effect the genetic code.

00:38:09.354 --> 00:38:11.923 align:middle line:84%
And that's what most
scientists think, is that oh,

00:38:11.923 --> 00:38:15.160 align:middle line:84%
it's altering --
mutating the genetic code.

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:18.363 align:middle line:84%
But at low levels it can be
a hundred billion times more

00:38:18.363 --> 00:38:22.100 align:middle line:84%
lethal because it will melt
these fatty connective glues

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:23.835 align:middle line:90%
that hold the cells together.

00:38:23.835 --> 00:38:24.736 align:middle line:90%
That's the first thing.

00:38:24.736 --> 00:38:25.971 align:middle line:90%
It's called the Petkau effect.

00:38:25.971 --> 00:38:28.507 align:middle line:84%
It was known in 1970.
It was discovered

00:38:28.507 --> 00:38:30.075 align:middle line:90%
by a Canadian scientist.

00:38:30.075 --> 00:38:31.576 align:middle line:90%
So let me repeat that.

00:38:31.576 --> 00:38:35.614 align:middle line:84%
Extremely low levels do not
cause the body to recognize

00:38:35.614 --> 00:38:37.315 align:middle line:90%
that there's a serious threat,

00:38:37.315 --> 00:38:40.152 align:middle line:84%
and that hot particle just sits
there and it burns and burns

00:38:40.152 --> 00:38:42.788 align:middle line:84%
and burns, and it burns
away these essential fats

00:38:42.788 --> 00:38:44.956 align:middle line:84%
in our body causing
massive problems

00:38:44.956 --> 00:38:47.292 align:middle line:84%
like brain disorders
and heart disease.

00:38:47.292 --> 00:38:50.495 align:middle line:84%
There's a thing called Chernobyl
heart. There were massive

00:38:50.495 --> 00:38:53.098 align:middle line:84%
amounts of MS and Lou Gehrig's
syndrome that came

00:38:53.098 --> 00:38:54.599 align:middle line:90%
out of the kids at Chernobyl.

00:38:54.599 --> 00:38:56.868 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It has to do with the
sheath and lining of the nerves.

00:38:56.868 --> 00:38:58.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Apsley: It does.

00:38:58.170 --> 00:38:59.504 align:middle line:84%
It just melts it away like
a hot knife through butter,

00:38:59.504 --> 00:39:02.007 align:middle line:90%
because butter is fat, right?

00:39:02.007 --> 00:39:04.075 align:middle line:84%
This next thing is
that any amount

00:39:04.075 --> 00:39:06.578 align:middle line:84%
of radioactivity,
none of it is safe.

00:39:06.578 --> 00:39:08.647 align:middle line:84%
There is no safe
level of radiation.

00:39:08.647 --> 00:39:11.216 align:middle line:84%
That's National Academy
of Sciences.

00:39:11.216 --> 00:39:14.820 align:middle line:84%
On top of that, now the third
thing is any amount of radiation

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:19.191 align:middle line:84%
that gets into our body
will multiply the toxicity

00:39:19.191 --> 00:39:22.861 align:middle line:84%
of anything else in the
body by at least ten fold.

00:39:22.861 --> 00:39:24.429 align:middle line:84%
So if you have another
carcinogen

00:39:24.429 --> 00:39:26.965 align:middle line:84%
or you smoke cigarettes or
if you have some heavy dose

00:39:26.965 --> 00:39:29.434 align:middle line:84%
of herbicide because you're
out in your garden that day,

00:39:29.434 --> 00:39:33.238 align:middle line:84%
that toxicity has now
been amplified by ten fold.

00:39:33.238 --> 00:39:36.475 align:middle line:84%
If you at the same time
live within five miles

00:39:36.475 --> 00:39:40.278 align:middle line:84%
of a nuclear power plant and
the Fukushima event is going on,

00:39:40.278 --> 00:39:42.781 align:middle line:84%
and you're eating GMO
foods, for example,

00:39:42.781 --> 00:39:44.049 align:middle line:90%
you're in a world of hurt.

00:39:44.049 --> 00:39:47.285 align:middle line:84%
For example, back when the
initial studies were done

00:39:47.285 --> 00:39:51.156 align:middle line:84%
on what nuclear power plants by
themselves were causing in terms

00:39:51.156 --> 00:39:55.260 align:middle line:84%
of health consequences
here it was noted that 18%

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:59.231 align:middle line:84%
of the female population in the
United States lived in and near

00:39:59.231 --> 00:40:02.734 align:middle line:84%
within 50 miles of an
active nuclear power plant.

00:40:02.734 --> 00:40:07.105 align:middle line:90%
That 18% was responsible for 55%

00:40:07.105 --> 00:40:09.608 align:middle line:84%
of all breast cancers
in the United States.

00:40:09.608 --> 00:40:11.543 align:middle line:90%
That to me is cause and effect.

00:40:11.543 --> 00:40:14.379 align:middle line:84%
The CDC immediately got
involved and they said no,

00:40:14.379 --> 00:40:16.081 align:middle line:90%
no, no, that's not true.

00:40:16.081 --> 00:40:18.083 align:middle line:84%
And when their scientists
got up there and did all

00:40:18.083 --> 00:40:22.287 align:middle line:84%
of the number re-crunching he
admitted, oh, 18% of the women

00:40:22.287 --> 00:40:25.524 align:middle line:84%
in this country are
responsible for 33%

00:40:25.524 --> 00:40:27.526 align:middle line:84%
of all the breast
cancers in this country.

00:40:27.526 --> 00:40:31.429 align:middle line:84%
Now I disagree with that
expert, I think it is 55%.

00:40:31.429 --> 00:40:32.330 align:middle line:90%
But so what.

00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:34.132 align:middle line:90%
It was approximately double.

00:40:34.132 --> 00:40:37.435 align:middle line:84%
Now last thing, children
that are within five miles

00:40:37.435 --> 00:40:39.905 align:middle line:84%
of an active nuclear
power plant are known

00:40:39.905 --> 00:40:43.542 align:middle line:84%
from international studies and
several international studies

00:40:43.542 --> 00:40:47.179 align:middle line:84%
to be 200% more likely to
come down with Leukemia.

00:40:47.179 --> 00:40:49.681 align:middle line:84%
So just from these
tritium releases

00:40:49.681 --> 00:40:52.250 align:middle line:84%
from nuclear power plants,
that's radioactive hydrogen

00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:54.452 align:middle line:84%
which occurs all the
time, and it's legal,

00:40:54.452 --> 00:40:57.756 align:middle line:84%
it's part of the normal
operation of these plants,

00:40:57.756 --> 00:41:00.492 align:middle line:84%
added on top of the
Fukushima fall out,

00:41:00.492 --> 00:41:03.595 align:middle line:84%
if a heavy rain fall
occurs, and you can realize

00:41:03.595 --> 00:41:05.330 align:middle line:84%
that because these particles
are going to be with us

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:09.434 align:middle line:84%
for 300 years in the food chain,
that we're in a world of hurt.

00:41:09.434 --> 00:41:14.606 align:middle line:84%
Last thing, it doesn't matter
how much radioactive mass

00:41:14.606 --> 00:41:15.907 align:middle line:90%
is diluted.

00:41:15.907 --> 00:41:18.910 align:middle line:84%
The amount of cancer
that would be caused

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:21.146 align:middle line:84%
if that total amount
was released

00:41:21.146 --> 00:41:26.151 align:middle line:84%
in a small group
immediately will occur even

00:41:26.151 --> 00:41:28.486 align:middle line:84%
if it takes twenty
years to occur.

00:41:28.486 --> 00:41:31.723 align:middle line:84%
Steven Wing at Chapel
Hill has proved that.

00:41:31.723 --> 00:41:33.692 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't matter
how diluted it becomes.

00:41:33.692 --> 00:41:36.127 align:middle line:90%
And the reason is because we --

00:41:36.127 --> 00:41:39.698 align:middle line:84%
as it goes through the food
chain those diluted particles

00:41:39.698 --> 00:41:45.503 align:middle line:84%
become magnified, they become
reconcentrated by 300-fold.

00:41:45.503 --> 00:41:47.472 align:middle line:84%
So we're at the top
of the food chain.

00:41:47.472 --> 00:41:50.308 align:middle line:84%
We eat the little fish eat
the algae that are grabbing

00:41:50.308 --> 00:41:51.409 align:middle line:90%
onto the cesium, right?

00:41:51.409 --> 00:41:53.478 align:middle line:90%
The plant at Fukushima.

00:41:53.478 --> 00:41:56.281 align:middle line:84%
Then these fish migrate
and the tuna eat them.

00:41:56.281 --> 00:41:58.516 align:middle line:84%
We start eating sushi
on the west coast,

00:41:58.516 --> 00:42:01.319 align:middle line:84%
and we keep eating the tuna,
we keep eating the tuna,

00:42:01.319 --> 00:42:04.189 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't leave our
body, keeps burning us,

00:42:04.189 --> 00:42:06.124 align:middle line:84%
and then suddenly we wind
up with thyroid cancer,

00:42:06.124 --> 00:42:09.094 align:middle line:84%
breast cancer twenty years
later, and because half

00:42:09.094 --> 00:42:10.895 align:middle line:84%
of us are going to
get cancer anyway,

00:42:10.895 --> 00:42:15.066 align:middle line:84%
they can bend the science to say
oh, that wasn't from Fukushima,

00:42:15.066 --> 00:42:16.835 align:middle line:84%
that was because it was
just going to happen.

00:42:16.835 --> 00:42:19.004 align:middle line:90%
I say no, that's not true.

00:42:19.004 --> 00:42:20.105 align:middle line:90%
Number One, we can do something

00:42:20.105 --> 00:42:22.007 align:middle line:84%
about these cancer
rates to begin with.

00:42:22.007 --> 00:42:22.574 align:middle line:90%
That's Number One.

00:42:22.574 --> 00:42:23.575 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:42:23.575 --> 00:42:24.409 align:middle line:84%
I mean because really,
that sharp spike

00:42:24.409 --> 00:42:26.711 align:middle line:90%
in cancer rates has all happened

00:42:26.711 --> 00:42:30.282 align:middle line:84%
since we began detonating
nuclear devices all

00:42:30.282 --> 00:42:34.252 align:middle line:84%
over the planet, starting with
World War II, post World War II.

00:42:34.252 --> 00:42:35.553 align:middle line:90%
This stuff has been everywhere.

00:42:35.553 --> 00:42:36.955 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: You have
hilt on a point.

00:42:36.955 --> 00:42:40.025 align:middle line:84%
In 1950, the US public was the
number one healthiest culture

00:42:40.025 --> 00:42:41.393 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:42:41.393 --> 00:42:44.496 align:middle line:84%
All of the chronic illnesses
that we had were going downhill.

00:42:44.496 --> 00:42:49.300 align:middle line:84%
The moment our first nuclear
explosion started in about 1951,

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:50.402 align:middle line:84%
1952, all of
a sudden we were off

00:42:50.402 --> 00:42:52.537 align:middle line:84%
to the races being
among the sickest

00:42:52.537 --> 00:42:53.872 align:middle line:90%
of nations on the planet.

00:42:53.872 --> 00:42:57.409 align:middle line:84%
We're now about somewhere
between 30th and 40th ranking

00:42:57.409 --> 00:43:00.545 align:middle line:84%
in health, and we spend
twice as much money

00:43:00.545 --> 00:43:02.313 align:middle line:90%
than other country does.

00:43:02.313 --> 00:43:03.682 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So this
has been going on --

00:43:03.682 --> 00:43:05.750 align:middle line:84%
the point is it has been
going on for a long time.

00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:08.019 align:middle line:84%
These are just super
concentrated events.

00:43:08.019 --> 00:43:09.754 align:middle line:90%
Let me bring up something else.

00:43:09.754 --> 00:43:12.590 align:middle line:84%
What about the notion --
you're talking about cancer,

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:16.661 align:middle line:84%
and people use radiation
to kill the cancer.

00:43:16.661 --> 00:43:18.463 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. So let's talk about --

00:43:18.463 --> 00:43:20.699 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: Well, I was in the
middle of finishing a book

00:43:20.699 --> 00:43:22.934 align:middle line:84%
on cancer therapy,
natural cancer therapy,

00:43:22.934 --> 00:43:25.203 align:middle line:84%
when the explosions
occurred at Fukushima.

00:43:25.203 --> 00:43:28.373 align:middle line:84%
I had to stop writing my
cancer book and write the book

00:43:28.373 --> 00:43:31.609 align:middle line:84%
on Fukushima because of the
influence this event was going

00:43:31.609 --> 00:43:33.578 align:middle line:84%
to have on natural
approaches to cancer.

00:43:33.578 --> 00:43:36.614 align:middle line:84%
To answer your question,
conventional chemotherapy

00:43:36.614 --> 00:43:40.118 align:middle line:84%
and radiation therapy all
produce hydrogen peroxide

00:43:40.118 --> 00:43:41.353 align:middle line:90%
to kill the tumor.

00:43:41.353 --> 00:43:44.155 align:middle line:84%
The problem is, is that
-- that's what they do,

00:43:44.155 --> 00:43:46.191 align:middle line:84%
they produce hydrogen
peroxide, kill the tumor.

00:43:46.191 --> 00:43:49.694 align:middle line:84%
The problem is they also damage
healthy tissue at the same time

00:43:49.694 --> 00:43:51.429 align:middle line:84%
and it wears out
our immune system.

00:43:51.429 --> 00:43:52.864 align:middle line:90%
That's the problem.

00:43:52.864 --> 00:43:57.001 align:middle line:84%
Herbs do the same thing, in
fact most chemotherapy comes

00:43:57.001 --> 00:44:00.905 align:middle line:84%
from herbs that also
produce hydrogen peroxide

00:44:00.905 --> 00:44:02.440 align:middle line:90%
in the tumor cells.

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:06.811 align:middle line:84%
The key difference is that those
same herbs that can produce just

00:44:06.811 --> 00:44:09.614 align:middle line:84%
as much hydrogen peroxide
as radiation therapy

00:44:09.614 --> 00:44:16.254 align:middle line:84%
or chemotherapy, they don't
do it to healthy cells.

00:44:16.254 --> 00:44:20.859 align:middle line:84%
They have a -- it's a -- like
an intellectual design in them

00:44:20.859 --> 00:44:24.596 align:middle line:84%
that they spare and protect
the healthy cells while they go

00:44:24.596 --> 00:44:25.964 align:middle line:90%
after the cancer cells.

00:44:25.964 --> 00:44:28.032 align:middle line:84%
Now the cool thing is, this
is what my cancer book it all

00:44:28.032 --> 00:44:30.068 align:middle line:90%
about, we can safely --

00:44:30.068 --> 00:44:34.139 align:middle line:84%
safely enhance conventional
chemotherapy

00:44:34.139 --> 00:44:37.242 align:middle line:84%
and conventional radiation
therapy with herbs.

00:44:37.242 --> 00:44:39.377 align:middle line:84%
It makes them safer and
it makes them work better.

00:44:39.377 --> 00:44:41.279 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, if it's doing
the same thing why do you need

00:44:41.279 --> 00:44:43.581 align:middle line:90%
the chemo and the radiation?

00:44:43.581 --> 00:44:46.251 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: Well, that's
for our culture to decide.

00:44:46.251 --> 00:44:49.087 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're spending as
I said twice as much money

00:44:49.087 --> 00:44:52.190 align:middle line:84%
as anyone else, and
since 1950, folks,

00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:55.093 align:middle line:84%
we have not had any success
in the treatment of cancer.

00:44:55.093 --> 00:44:58.696 align:middle line:84%
The actual CDC data, the sear
data, it's called sear data,

00:44:58.696 --> 00:45:01.800 align:middle line:84%
shows there's been
no improvement

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:05.336 align:middle line:84%
in the overall cancer, either
success rate for treatment

00:45:05.336 --> 00:45:08.673 align:middle line:84%
or prevention rate with
conventional treatment.

00:45:08.673 --> 00:45:11.843 align:middle line:84%
It's been with hygiene, with
better diet, with refrigeration,

00:45:11.843 --> 00:45:14.078 align:middle line:84%
with other things that
we've tone, better exercise,

00:45:14.078 --> 00:45:16.981 align:middle line:84%
stop smoking, those
kinds of things.

00:45:16.981 --> 00:45:21.786 align:middle line:84%
So the question is that if we
were supposed to use our diet

00:45:21.786 --> 00:45:24.389 align:middle line:84%
and our herbs to
keep us healthy,

00:45:24.389 --> 00:45:26.991 align:middle line:84%
then it goes back
to who does this.

00:45:26.991 --> 00:45:28.259 align:middle line:90%
Who does this?

00:45:28.259 --> 00:45:32.063 align:middle line:84%
It's the thirty longest-lived
cultures in the planet

00:45:32.063 --> 00:45:33.298 align:middle line:90%
that don't have doctors,

00:45:33.298 --> 00:45:35.934 align:middle line:84%
don't have hospitals,
and don't get cancer.

00:45:35.934 --> 00:45:39.337 align:middle line:84%
If we just replicate what
they do, we can do it too.

00:45:39.337 --> 00:45:40.605 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And that's what --

00:45:40.605 --> 00:45:41.739 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: And that's what
my cancer book was about,

00:45:41.739 --> 00:45:43.408 align:middle line:84%
but I had to stop, I had
to put this together.

00:45:43.408 --> 00:45:46.077 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You need to
get back on that one now.

00:45:46.077 --> 00:45:49.714 align:middle line:84%
But you're jogging
something in my memory.

00:45:49.714 --> 00:45:52.417 align:middle line:84%
Several years ago I interviewed
a doctor who was talking

00:45:52.417 --> 00:45:54.452 align:middle line:84%
about -- a study
that had happened --

00:45:54.452 --> 00:45:56.354 align:middle line:84%
I think it was during
the Spanish --

00:45:56.354 --> 00:45:59.490 align:middle line:84%
when the Spanish flu
was going around,

00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:03.127 align:middle line:84%
that they were using
hydrogen peroxide

00:46:03.127 --> 00:46:06.931 align:middle line:84%
and successfully getting rid of
the symptoms from that as well.

00:46:06.931 --> 00:46:09.267 align:middle line:84%
But they were ingesting
hydrogen peroxide,

00:46:09.267 --> 00:46:11.936 align:middle line:84%
and I know that there is
food grade hydrogen peroxide

00:46:11.936 --> 00:46:14.672 align:middle line:90%
and people do do this.

00:46:14.672 --> 00:46:15.874 align:middle line:90%
What about that, what's wrong

00:46:15.874 --> 00:46:18.710 align:middle line:84%
with using food grade
hydrogen peroxide?

00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:21.446 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: I would rather
have the cancer cell make an

00:46:21.446 --> 00:46:24.148 align:middle line:84%
excessive amount of
hydrogen peroxide all

00:46:24.148 --> 00:46:26.317 align:middle line:90%
on its own at the target site.

00:46:26.317 --> 00:46:29.787 align:middle line:84%
I would rather have healthy
cells develop more protection

00:46:29.787 --> 00:46:31.089 align:middle line:90%
against hydrogen peroxide,

00:46:31.089 --> 00:46:33.558 align:middle line:84%
because that accelerates
the aging process,

00:46:33.558 --> 00:46:35.426 align:middle line:90%
than them also being dosed

00:46:35.426 --> 00:46:37.896 align:middle line:84%
with excessive amounts
of hydrogen peroxide.

00:46:37.896 --> 00:46:40.331 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that there's
a massive enzyme system

00:46:40.331 --> 00:46:43.668 align:middle line:84%
in the body that protects
us from hydrogen peroxide.

00:46:43.668 --> 00:46:47.138 align:middle line:84%
It's found in relatively low
concentrations in cancer cells,

00:46:47.138 --> 00:46:49.674 align:middle line:84%
but high concentrations
in healthy cells.

00:46:49.674 --> 00:46:52.677 align:middle line:84%
That's how we exploit
natural cures for cancer,

00:46:52.677 --> 00:46:55.647 align:middle line:84%
and that's also how
we aid and assist

00:46:55.647 --> 00:46:58.583 align:middle line:84%
and render more safe
conventional chemotherapy

00:46:58.583 --> 00:46:59.651 align:middle line:90%
and radiation therapy.

00:46:59.651 --> 00:47:01.386 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay, so
let me ask you this.

00:47:01.386 --> 00:47:05.290 align:middle line:84%
We have some time and I want to
devote it to these subjects

00:47:05.290 --> 00:47:08.960 align:middle line:84%
about healing and reversing
some of the damaging effects

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:11.329 align:middle line:84%
of radiation that
we've been exposed to.

00:47:11.329 --> 00:47:14.032 align:middle line:84%
So since you haven't written
the book yet let's talk

00:47:14.032 --> 00:47:17.001 align:middle line:90%
about some of those agents.

00:47:17.001 --> 00:47:19.604 align:middle line:84%
A, some of the countries you're
speaking about, the hallmark

00:47:19.604 --> 00:47:22.006 align:middle line:84%
of their health regime
every day. And then

00:47:22.006 --> 00:47:28.780 align:middle line:84%
also about the foods and the
specific herbs that we can use.

00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:30.148 align:middle line:90%
>> Apsley: Great.

00:47:30.148 --> 00:47:32.016 align:middle line:84%
So in order for the folks to
have the most health to be able

00:47:32.016 --> 00:47:34.552 align:middle line:84%
to know what to do, it
turns out in the last book,

00:47:34.552 --> 00:47:36.554 align:middle line:84%
in the last chapter,
I cover all of this.

00:47:36.554 --> 00:47:38.823 align:middle line:84%
In fact, half of the book
talks about the diet,

00:47:38.823 --> 00:47:41.426 align:middle line:84%
half the book talks
about what not to buy,

00:47:41.426 --> 00:47:42.694 align:middle line:90%
what foods not to buy.

00:47:42.694 --> 00:47:43.661 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: So start there.

00:47:43.661 --> 00:47:45.163 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: Ok, what foods
not to buy.

00:47:45.163 --> 00:47:46.698 align:middle line:90%
So let's start.

00:47:46.698 --> 00:47:48.466 align:middle line:90%
No seafood from the Pacific.

00:47:48.466 --> 00:47:50.201 align:middle line:90%
Get it from the Atlantic.

00:47:50.201 --> 00:47:53.838 align:middle line:84%
If you can get seafood from the
south Pacific and you know it's

00:47:53.838 --> 00:47:55.173 align:middle line:90%
from the south Pacific,

00:47:55.173 --> 00:47:56.841 align:middle line:84%
just make sure it doesn't
have Mercury in it

00:47:56.841 --> 00:48:00.378 align:middle line:84%
because there is some runoff
from the gold mining they do

00:48:00.378 --> 00:48:03.214 align:middle line:84%
in South America, producing
lots of Mercury into the --

00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:04.549 align:middle line:90%
like the Chilean sea bass

00:48:04.549 --> 00:48:07.018 align:middle line:84%
which is my favorite.
It's full of Mercury.

00:48:07.018 --> 00:48:09.587 align:middle line:84%
But other seafoods in
the south can be fine.

00:48:09.587 --> 00:48:12.757 align:middle line:84%
Krill is a wonderful protective
agent that's now

00:48:12.757 --> 00:48:16.060 align:middle line:84%
in capsule form that's got
the best omega 3 of all time.

00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:18.863 align:middle line:84%
It is wonderful and
is perfectly safe.

00:48:18.863 --> 00:48:23.167 align:middle line:84%
Cod liver oil from the
Atlantic is also wonderful.

00:48:23.167 --> 00:48:26.971 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of diet, do
not eat dairy products

00:48:26.971 --> 00:48:28.306 align:middle line:90%
from the west coast.

00:48:28.306 --> 00:48:31.376 align:middle line:84%
With apologies to all the great
organic dairy herds there.

00:48:31.376 --> 00:48:32.643 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh, they're

00:48:32.643 --> 00:48:35.580 align:middle line:84%
such wonderful little
boutique family-owned dairies.

00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:36.948 align:middle line:90%
But it's all contaminated?

00:48:36.948 --> 00:48:38.216 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: We had
a cancer patient

00:48:38.216 --> 00:48:39.951 align:middle line:90%
who was making a recovery

00:48:39.951 --> 00:48:43.921 align:middle line:84%
who was just due north
of Portland, Oregon.

00:48:43.921 --> 00:48:47.659 align:middle line:84%
And he depended upon his food
that he grew organically on --

00:48:47.659 --> 00:48:49.794 align:middle line:90%
we tested his soil, because all

00:48:49.794 --> 00:48:52.196 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden he started
getting worse after Fukushima.

00:48:52.196 --> 00:48:55.700 align:middle line:84%
We sent it off to Boston to one
of the most fancy testing units

00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:57.535 align:middle line:90%
that exist in the United States.

00:48:57.535 --> 00:49:00.405 align:middle line:84%
He had the highest
level of radioactive hit

00:49:00.405 --> 00:49:02.073 align:middle line:90%
that occurred on the west coast.

00:49:02.073 --> 00:49:04.842 align:middle line:84%
So we know there were massive
hits along the west coast.

00:49:04.842 --> 00:49:06.044 align:middle line:90%
He eventually died, I think,

00:49:06.044 --> 00:49:08.446 align:middle line:84%
because he got reexposed
to large doses.

00:49:08.446 --> 00:49:10.748 align:middle line:90%
So no dairy from the west coast.

00:49:10.748 --> 00:49:15.119 align:middle line:84%
The trees that bear fruit like
apples and oranges and pears

00:49:15.119 --> 00:49:17.622 align:middle line:84%
and cherries, that's
safe from the west coast

00:49:17.622 --> 00:49:20.158 align:middle line:84%
because the soil is
going to contain clay,

00:49:20.158 --> 00:49:23.561 align:middle line:84%
and as the radiation
hits the soil the roots

00:49:23.561 --> 00:49:25.963 align:middle line:84%
of the tree aren't going to
be picking up that radiation,

00:49:25.963 --> 00:49:28.666 align:middle line:84%
it's going to get
glued to the topsoil.

00:49:28.666 --> 00:49:30.068 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Apples,
oranges, and --

00:49:30.068 --> 00:49:31.903 align:middle line:90%
>> Apsley: Any tree fruit.

00:49:31.903 --> 00:49:38.109 align:middle line:84%
Avocados, nuts, pecans,
walnuts, cashews, all safe,

00:49:38.109 --> 00:49:39.477 align:middle line:90%
all safe on the west coast.

00:49:39.477 --> 00:49:40.478 align:middle line:90%
But dairy, no.

00:49:40.478 --> 00:49:42.046 align:middle line:90%
Sorry. Seafood, no.

00:49:42.046 --> 00:49:43.414 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You're
talking large --

00:49:43.414 --> 00:49:45.616 align:middle line:90%
>> Apsley: And eggs.

00:49:45.616 --> 00:49:46.384 align:middle line:90%
Eggs.

00:49:46.384 --> 00:49:47.785 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: No eggs?

00:49:47.785 --> 00:49:50.154 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: No eggs, because the
range-fed chickens go out there

00:49:50.154 --> 00:49:51.456 align:middle line:84%
and they scratch feed,
and they're picking

00:49:51.456 --> 00:49:52.723 align:middle line:90%
up this radiation all the time.

00:49:52.723 --> 00:49:54.058 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: When you
say west coast how far

00:49:54.058 --> 00:49:55.193 align:middle line:90%
over are we talking?

00:49:55.193 --> 00:49:56.994 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: Just to the
point of the Rockies.

00:49:56.994 --> 00:49:59.530 align:middle line:84%
Now the other areas
that got hit due

00:49:59.530 --> 00:50:01.732 align:middle line:84%
to the rainfall coming
down, and will get hit

00:50:01.732 --> 00:50:03.868 align:middle line:84%
because it's still going
around in the stratosphere,

00:50:03.868 --> 00:50:06.204 align:middle line:84%
this will go around for
seven, eight, ten more years,

00:50:06.204 --> 00:50:08.372 align:middle line:84%
and every time there's a massive
rain fall there will be --

00:50:08.372 --> 00:50:10.908 align:middle line:84%
that's when the -- Patrick
Flanagan's Geiger counter is

00:50:10.908 --> 00:50:12.477 align:middle line:84%
going to go off through
the roof, nine times,

00:50:12.477 --> 00:50:15.379 align:middle line:84%
ten times the amount of normal
background, for example, that's

00:50:15.379 --> 00:50:17.582 align:middle line:90%
when it occurs.

00:50:17.582 --> 00:50:20.618 align:middle line:84%
They'll get hit, and again
those kinds of foods are safe.

00:50:20.618 --> 00:50:23.788 align:middle line:84%
The tree-borne fruits
and vegetables.

00:50:23.788 --> 00:50:25.590 align:middle line:84%
The vegetables that
aren't safe at all

00:50:25.590 --> 00:50:28.726 align:middle line:84%
on the west coast are the
lettuces, the strawberries,

00:50:28.726 --> 00:50:31.062 align:middle line:84%
the mushrooms that
are grown outside.

00:50:31.062 --> 00:50:32.363 align:middle line:90%
Anything that's grown outside,

00:50:32.363 --> 00:50:35.333 align:middle line:84%
including that incredible
food chlorella and Spirulina

00:50:35.333 --> 00:50:37.902 align:middle line:84%
that they grow
outdoors in Hawaii,

00:50:37.902 --> 00:50:40.071 align:middle line:90%
and also on the west coast.

00:50:40.071 --> 00:50:43.975 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, just don't get
your sources from there.

00:50:43.975 --> 00:50:47.645 align:middle line:84%
But Wisconsin and Texas that
have great organic dairy herds,

00:50:47.645 --> 00:50:49.881 align:middle line:84%
buy all the cheeses, the
yogurts, the milks you want

00:50:49.881 --> 00:50:52.850 align:middle line:84%
from them, the eggs, they have
eggs, little bit more expensive

00:50:52.850 --> 00:50:54.051 align:middle line:90%
but it's a great super food.

00:50:54.051 --> 00:50:55.820 align:middle line:90%
So you know, please buy those.

00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And to the east,
those areas are good.

00:50:58.890 --> 00:51:00.591 align:middle line:84%
But remember we do
have this problem

00:51:00.591 --> 00:51:02.260 align:middle line:90%
with nuclear power plants.

00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:03.394 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes , okay.

00:51:03.394 --> 00:51:04.328 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: Those areas
are a problem too.

00:51:04.328 --> 00:51:05.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: That's been ongoing.

00:51:05.830 --> 00:51:07.532 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: Now how we
solve that, I'm sorry to --

00:51:07.532 --> 00:51:09.333 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to leave the
audience hanging there.

00:51:09.333 --> 00:51:10.835 align:middle line:90%
It's not hopeless, folks.

00:51:10.835 --> 00:51:14.238 align:middle line:84%
We're just talking about two
simple things that we need to

00:51:14.238 --> 00:51:15.306 align:middle line:90%
do. We just have to quench --

00:51:15.306 --> 00:51:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I just have
one more question,

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:18.576 align:middle line:84%
what about the cattle
industries for people

00:51:18.576 --> 00:51:20.077 align:middle line:90%
who eat meats and so forth?

00:51:20.077 --> 00:51:21.779 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: Yes, they're at
the top of the food chain,

00:51:21.779 --> 00:51:23.514 align:middle line:84%
and they're grazing on that
grass all day long.

00:51:23.514 --> 00:51:27.351 align:middle line:84%
If the radiation has hit that,
at low levels because they graze

00:51:27.351 --> 00:51:28.753 align:middle line:90%
and they graze and they graze --

00:51:28.753 --> 00:51:31.656 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So poultry, meats of
all kinds, anything from west

00:51:31.656 --> 00:51:33.457 align:middle line:90%
of the Rockies, don't do it?

00:51:33.457 --> 00:51:34.659 align:middle line:90%
>> Apsley: Well, no.

00:51:34.659 --> 00:51:35.893 align:middle line:90%
East -- correct.

00:51:35.893 --> 00:51:38.229 align:middle line:84%
West of the Rockies,
stay away from it.

00:51:38.229 --> 00:51:39.864 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because they'll
accumulate --

00:51:39.864 --> 00:51:42.233 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Because these
animals are concentrating

00:51:42.233 --> 00:51:44.035 align:middle line:90%
through their own food chain.

00:51:44.035 --> 00:51:45.169 align:middle line:90%
So that's the real danger.

00:51:45.169 --> 00:51:45.736 align:middle line:90%
>> Apsley: They have to.

00:51:45.736 --> 00:51:46.571 align:middle line:90%
They have to.

00:51:46.571 --> 00:51:47.939 align:middle line:90%
And that's exactly what appears

00:51:47.939 --> 00:51:50.975 align:middle line:84%
to be killing off the Pacific
Ocean along the west coast,

00:51:50.975 --> 00:51:53.778 align:middle line:84%
is that it's gone into the food
chain and this will continue

00:51:53.778 --> 00:51:56.280 align:middle line:84%
to get worse because
the bio magnification

00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:59.383 align:middle line:84%
of 300 fold will
continue for the next

00:51:59.383 --> 00:52:02.320 align:middle line:84%
at least 150 years
until it peaks.

00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:03.120 align:middle line:90%
That's a problem.

00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:04.455 align:middle line:90%
But there's good news.

00:52:04.455 --> 00:52:06.557 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yes, let's talk
about the good news part now.

00:52:06.557 --> 00:52:09.727 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: Fruits and vegetables
will get the quenching going

00:52:09.727 --> 00:52:11.395 align:middle line:90%
to stop this production

00:52:11.395 --> 00:52:13.831 align:middle line:84%
of burning levels of
hydrogen peroxide.

00:52:13.831 --> 00:52:16.267 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Now what is it
chemically that creates that?

00:52:16.267 --> 00:52:18.102 align:middle line:90%
Is it just the live enzymes?

00:52:18.102 --> 00:52:19.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: Yeah,
there are two things.

00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:21.873 align:middle line:84%
There are the actual
antioxidants that are in those

00:52:21.873 --> 00:52:23.541 align:middle line:84%
foods. But more importantly,
if we're talking

00:52:23.541 --> 00:52:26.510 align:middle line:84%
about the regeneration effect,
which is my favorite subject,

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:28.279 align:middle line:90%
let the body heal itself.

00:52:28.279 --> 00:52:32.783 align:middle line:84%
What we know is that at the
age of 25 when you're healthy,

00:52:32.783 --> 00:52:38.389 align:middle line:84%
you have 100,000 genetic
mutations or injuries that occur

00:52:38.389 --> 00:52:41.259 align:middle line:90%
in each of your cells each day.

00:52:41.259 --> 00:52:44.395 align:middle line:84%
100,000. And that's just
to the genetic core.

00:52:44.395 --> 00:52:46.931 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't include all of the
mistakes and injuries that occur

00:52:46.931 --> 00:52:49.133 align:middle line:84%
to your cell body or
the outer membrane.

00:52:49.133 --> 00:52:51.936 align:middle line:84%
So say by three,
multiply that by three,

00:52:51.936 --> 00:52:55.439 align:middle line:84%
and you've got 50 trillion human
cells sitting there right now,

00:52:55.439 --> 00:53:01.445 align:middle line:84%
50 trillion times 300,000
serious errors, mutations,

00:53:01.445 --> 00:53:07.018 align:middle line:84%
injuries, that at the age of 25
when you're healthy, you fix.

00:53:07.018 --> 00:53:11.422 align:middle line:84%
If we know how to feed
and maintain that system

00:53:11.422 --> 00:53:16.527 align:middle line:84%
of repair what drug,
what vitamin, what herb,

00:53:16.527 --> 00:53:20.197 align:middle line:84%
what homeopathic remedy
can possibly compete

00:53:20.197 --> 00:53:25.303 align:middle line:84%
with that number of repairs that
we're designed to do each day?

00:53:25.303 --> 00:53:26.804 align:middle line:90%
Let that fix the body.

00:53:26.804 --> 00:53:31.642 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out that
embryonic food factors, nuts,

00:53:31.642 --> 00:53:36.180 align:middle line:84%
seeds, eggs, bee pollen, raw
glandular meets that you get

00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:38.082 align:middle line:84%
in capsule so you don't
have to taste them,

00:53:38.082 --> 00:53:40.184 align:middle line:90%
all turn that system on.

00:53:40.184 --> 00:53:44.188 align:middle line:84%
That's been my subject of study
and practice for thirty years.

00:53:44.188 --> 00:53:45.523 align:middle line:90%
I am an expert in --

00:53:45.523 --> 00:53:47.024 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Embryonic foods?

00:53:47.024 --> 00:53:51.996 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: That means seeds,
pollen, eggs, young --

00:53:51.996 --> 00:53:54.665 align:middle line:84%
even the algaes that
are not contaminated.

00:53:54.665 --> 00:53:56.600 align:middle line:90%
They're wonderful super foods.

00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And in fact I probably coined
the term super foods way back

00:53:59.670 --> 00:54:01.605 align:middle line:90%
in the '80s.

00:54:01.605 --> 00:54:05.910 align:middle line:84%
I actually have mail to
myself my original writings.

00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:09.013 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't because I was
so smart that I came

00:54:09.013 --> 00:54:10.381 align:middle line:90%
up with the term super food.

00:54:10.381 --> 00:54:14.085 align:middle line:84%
It was because of the great work
that had done by others to

00:54:14.085 --> 00:54:17.455 align:middle line:84%
determine what turns on
regeneration in the human body,

00:54:17.455 --> 00:54:19.190 align:middle line:84%
and it's these embryonic
food factors involved.

00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:21.392 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Because it has
the original coding in it?

00:54:21.392 --> 00:54:22.393 align:middle line:90%
>> Apsley: Yes.

00:54:22.393 --> 00:54:23.728 align:middle line:84%
And it's universal
replacement parts.

00:54:23.728 --> 00:54:27.098 align:middle line:84%
That original coding will go
into all of the food chain.

00:54:27.098 --> 00:54:28.666 align:middle line:90%
It will be immediate going on.

00:54:28.666 --> 00:54:29.500 align:middle line:90%
Immediate going it.

00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:30.735 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't need to be converted.

00:54:30.735 --> 00:54:33.871 align:middle line:84%
They're like an immediate
replacement part

00:54:33.871 --> 00:54:37.341 align:middle line:84%
that has the code, that has the
information of correct function.

00:54:37.341 --> 00:54:39.844 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
cesium is so dangerous,

00:54:39.844 --> 00:54:42.880 align:middle line:84%
it's destroying this
code of communication

00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:44.515 align:middle line:90%
that we don't have any longer.

00:54:44.515 --> 00:54:47.385 align:middle line:84%
Last thing, where do I
get my information from?

00:54:47.385 --> 00:54:50.855 align:middle line:84%
From the thirty longest-lived
cultures that are doing it

00:54:50.855 --> 00:54:53.157 align:middle line:84%
for the last five
thousand years.

00:54:53.157 --> 00:54:54.859 align:middle line:90%
We have the science.

00:54:54.859 --> 00:54:59.630 align:middle line:84%
During the Cold War the greatest
of the cultures, the Akazians

00:54:59.630 --> 00:55:03.200 align:middle line:84%
in the Caucasus Mountains
of what's now Georgia,

00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:04.535 align:middle line:90%
they were the longest living.

00:55:04.535 --> 00:55:08.272 align:middle line:84%
They were documented
meticulously to live to the age

00:55:08.272 --> 00:55:12.643 align:middle line:90%
of 140, 150, 130, 120.

00:55:12.643 --> 00:55:14.512 align:middle line:84%
They were known scientifically
not

00:55:14.512 --> 00:55:17.581 align:middle line:84%
to start their aging
process until they were 100.

00:55:17.581 --> 00:55:19.350 align:middle line:84%
The next group with
the Hunzakuts in

00:55:19.350 --> 00:55:23.320 align:middle line:84%
extreme north west Pakistan of
today, but back then in India.

00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:26.757 align:middle line:84%
Amazing studies were
done by a general surgeon

00:55:26.757 --> 00:55:28.826 align:middle line:90%
in the British army, McGarrison.

00:55:28.826 --> 00:55:30.528 align:middle line:90%
I have all of his documentation,

00:55:30.528 --> 00:55:33.397 align:middle line:84%
he went through a massive
animal experiments to show

00:55:33.397 --> 00:55:36.467 align:middle line:84%
that what the humans were
doing in the Himalayas

00:55:36.467 --> 00:55:39.503 align:middle line:84%
that were causing them to
live till 100, 110, 120,

00:55:39.503 --> 00:55:42.339 align:middle line:84%
that they didn't start their
aging process until about 90

00:55:42.339 --> 00:55:45.976 align:middle line:84%
in that case, was because of
how the minerals in the soil

00:55:45.976 --> 00:55:47.945 align:middle line:84%
from the glacial run
off during the spring,

00:55:47.945 --> 00:55:51.215 align:middle line:84%
something that Patrick Flanagan
is a world class an expert in,

00:55:51.215 --> 00:55:54.785 align:middle line:84%
causes the initial
fertilizer of the soil.

00:55:54.785 --> 00:55:57.354 align:middle line:84%
And these foods that
are grown in that,

00:55:57.354 --> 00:56:00.624 align:middle line:84%
when you eat them you don't
need all of these stimulants

00:56:00.624 --> 00:56:03.294 align:middle line:84%
that our kids are doing to
their poor bodies today.

00:56:03.294 --> 00:56:05.396 align:middle line:90%
It's an instant turn on.

00:56:05.396 --> 00:56:10.234 align:middle line:84%
These embryonic super foods
are incredibly powerful foods

00:56:10.234 --> 00:56:12.970 align:middle line:84%
that give you strength,
endurance, clarity of mind,

00:56:12.970 --> 00:56:15.005 align:middle line:84%
vision to see the
moons of Jupiter.

00:56:15.005 --> 00:56:19.009 align:middle line:84%
Just amazing things that these
thirty cultures have experienced

00:56:19.009 --> 00:56:20.377 align:middle line:90%
and even today --

00:56:20.377 --> 00:56:22.146 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And they all have
these embryonic foods in common?

00:56:22.146 --> 00:56:25.249 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: The seventh day
Adventists in the polluted area

00:56:25.249 --> 00:56:30.855 align:middle line:84%
of Los Angeles live to the age
of 90, 95, 100, in massive

00:56:30.855 --> 00:56:33.557 align:middle line:84%
numbers because they concentrate
on nuts and seeds.

00:56:33.557 --> 00:56:36.327 align:middle line:84%
And they purify their
bodies by their diet style.

00:56:36.327 --> 00:56:38.963 align:middle line:84%
And they get lots of oxygen
because they work out all day,

00:56:38.963 --> 00:56:42.466 align:middle line:84%
they walk, for example,
and they meditate.

00:56:42.466 --> 00:56:44.034 align:middle line:90%
They meditate all the time.

00:56:44.034 --> 00:56:45.803 align:middle line:90%
That was the four pillars.

00:56:45.803 --> 00:56:50.441 align:middle line:84%
Detoxification, oxygenation,
embryonic super foods,

00:56:50.441 --> 00:56:55.079 align:middle line:84%
and meditative states, that all
thirty cultures practice every

00:56:55.079 --> 00:56:55.980 align:middle line:90%
single day.

00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:57.648 align:middle line:90%
That was the secret.

00:56:57.648 --> 00:57:00.217 align:middle line:84%
But it comes down to
this whole thing about --

00:57:00.217 --> 00:57:03.320 align:middle line:84%
we live in this profoundly
dirty fish tank today.

00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:07.625 align:middle line:84%
The average American can do this
with a 55 minute daily program,

00:57:07.625 --> 00:57:08.826 align:middle line:90%
first thing in the morning.

00:57:08.826 --> 00:57:11.395 align:middle line:84%
They can set up their
day to accomplish all

00:57:11.395 --> 00:57:13.697 align:middle line:84%
of the same things that these
longest-lived people do,

00:57:13.697 --> 00:57:14.732 align:middle line:90%
right in their own kitchens.

00:57:14.732 --> 00:57:16.333 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if it's
New York City,

00:57:16.333 --> 00:57:19.203 align:middle line:84%
if the seventh day
Adventists are doing it in LA,

00:57:19.203 --> 00:57:21.171 align:middle line:90%
by God we can do it in Chicago.

00:57:21.171 --> 00:57:22.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: What's that
55 minutes look like?

00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:25.943 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: Well, okay, the first
thing is the thyroid function.

00:57:25.943 --> 00:57:27.278 align:middle line:90%
The thyroid function.

00:57:27.278 --> 00:57:30.948 align:middle line:84%
Now we got hit, nailed in this
country, you mentioned it,

00:57:30.948 --> 00:57:32.816 align:middle line:84%
by the bomb explosions
above ground

00:57:32.816 --> 00:57:34.752 align:middle line:84%
which took place
until about '63.

00:57:34.752 --> 00:57:37.621 align:middle line:84%
Massive numbers of American's
thyroids were damaged

00:57:37.621 --> 00:57:39.023 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:57:39.023 --> 00:57:43.227 align:middle line:84%
We have to medicate properly,
naturally, at least with iodine,

00:57:43.227 --> 00:57:45.229 align:middle line:84%
and we have to warm
our bodies up for

00:57:45.229 --> 00:57:46.997 align:middle line:90%
at least 20 to 30 minutes.

00:57:46.997 --> 00:57:49.500 align:middle line:84%
We can do it in a hot tub,
we can do it in a hot shower,

00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:51.435 align:middle line:84%
and we need to breathe
while we're there.

00:57:51.435 --> 00:57:54.338 align:middle line:84%
Cancer treatment, for example,
that is very successful,

00:57:54.338 --> 00:57:58.008 align:middle line:84%
put people in heat, give them
oxygen while they're being

00:57:58.008 --> 00:58:02.313 align:middle line:84%
heated, an then their medicines
improved their treatment ability

00:58:02.313 --> 00:58:04.648 align:middle line:90%
by 2,000%.

00:58:04.648 --> 00:58:06.784 align:middle line:90%
Heat, oxygen, and medicine.

00:58:06.784 --> 00:58:08.919 align:middle line:90%
2,000% increase in benefits.

00:58:08.919 --> 00:58:10.754 align:middle line:84%
We could do the same
thing with our food.

00:58:10.754 --> 00:58:14.358 align:middle line:84%
Take our smoothies, delicious
smoothies, chocolate,

00:58:14.358 --> 00:58:16.226 align:middle line:84%
strawberry flavor,
vanilla flavor.

00:58:16.226 --> 00:58:18.762 align:middle line:84%
Add these super foods in
there, you can't taste them.

00:58:18.762 --> 00:58:22.032 align:middle line:84%
And you drink that
and then make a supply

00:58:22.032 --> 00:58:23.233 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of the day.

00:58:23.233 --> 00:58:26.003 align:middle line:84%
Just a little bit, 4
ounces, 6 ounces, 8 ounces,

00:58:26.003 --> 00:58:28.439 align:middle line:84%
drink it three times a
day and you're there.

00:58:28.439 --> 00:58:29.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: That's it?

00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:30.741 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: Well,
meditation and exercise.

00:58:30.741 --> 00:58:32.509 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay, let me
ask you about other things,

00:58:32.509 --> 00:58:36.480 align:middle line:84%
having interviewed Patrick and
the others, several others,

00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:39.650 align:middle line:84%
one thing that kept coming up
that you can also do to detox,

00:58:39.650 --> 00:58:41.919 align:middle line:84%
and I want your take on it,
because you were talking

00:58:41.919 --> 00:58:46.323 align:middle line:84%
about the quality of the soil,
is folic and humic acid,

00:58:46.323 --> 00:58:49.493 align:middle line:84%
for example, zeolite some
people call it zeolite,

00:58:49.493 --> 00:58:52.630 align:middle line:84%
that this is another thing
one can do to start helping

00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:56.100 align:middle line:84%
to detox the body, along with
as you say the green things.

00:58:56.100 --> 00:58:59.069 align:middle line:84%
Some say the chlorella and such,
you're saying be careful

00:58:59.069 --> 00:59:01.005 align:middle line:84%
of the source, just
not the west coast.

00:59:01.005 --> 00:59:04.441 align:middle line:84%
What about some of those
other kind of super nutrients?

00:59:04.441 --> 00:59:06.377 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: Well, a lot of
chlorella comes from Japan

00:59:06.377 --> 00:59:08.145 align:middle line:90%
and a lot comes from Taiwan.

00:59:08.145 --> 00:59:11.915 align:middle line:84%
Right now I'm saying stay
away from the sources.

00:59:11.915 --> 00:59:15.052 align:middle line:84%
The zeolite is not folic
acid or humic acid,

00:59:15.052 --> 00:59:18.422 align:middle line:84%
folic acid and humic
acid are incredible sources

00:59:18.422 --> 00:59:24.228 align:middle line:84%
of a very unusual carrier
acid that transports minerals

00:59:24.228 --> 00:59:25.562 align:middle line:90%
into the cells of our body.

00:59:25.562 --> 00:59:26.563 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So this
is a good thing?

00:59:26.563 --> 00:59:27.898 align:middle line:90%
>> Apsley: Yeah.

00:59:27.898 --> 00:59:31.068 align:middle line:84%
If it's from good soils, like
the shilajit, excuse me,

00:59:31.068 --> 00:59:33.971 align:middle line:84%
the shilajit from
the Himalayas,

00:59:33.971 --> 00:59:36.707 align:middle line:84%
where one of the
longest-lived cultures live,

00:59:36.707 --> 00:59:37.941 align:middle line:90%
that's great stuff.

00:59:37.941 --> 00:59:40.044 align:middle line:84%
That's really high in
folic and humic acid,

00:59:40.044 --> 00:59:42.279 align:middle line:84%
it has all 80
trace minerals in there.

00:59:42.279 --> 00:59:45.015 align:middle line:84%
That goes into the body
and rips out hydrogen

00:59:45.015 --> 00:59:48.686 align:middle line:84%
which is the poison we need
to get rid of all the time

00:59:48.686 --> 00:59:50.120 align:middle line:90%
and does us a great service.

00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:52.456 align:middle line:84%
It's remarkable for
endurance, and for --

00:59:52.456 --> 00:59:54.958 align:middle line:84%
and also for transporting
even medicines into the body.

00:59:54.958 --> 00:59:56.193 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So that's
a good thing,

00:59:56.193 --> 00:59:58.095 align:middle line:84%
and there are some good
supplies out there.

00:59:58.095 --> 01:00:00.998 align:middle line:84%
I know Drumbloy, I spoke with
Drumbloy about this a week

01:00:00.998 --> 01:00:03.100 align:middle line:90%
or two ago and he was getting --

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:06.804 align:middle line:84%
well, he was using the
science based out of Hungary

01:00:06.804 --> 01:00:08.605 align:middle line:84%
and finding some
good sources of it.

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:12.743 align:middle line:84%
I know on his site
they'll kind of lead you

01:00:12.743 --> 01:00:14.344 align:middle line:90%
to different sources of that.

01:00:14.344 --> 01:00:15.679 align:middle line:90%
But what about the zeolite?

01:00:15.679 --> 01:00:18.315 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: The zeolite,
now that's the special stuff.

01:00:18.315 --> 01:00:22.720 align:middle line:84%
That's the strongest of all
the clays, and there is a --

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:25.055 align:middle line:84%
several groups, not
many, that make it

01:00:25.055 --> 01:00:27.858 align:middle line:90%
into nanoscaler particles.

01:00:27.858 --> 01:00:31.528 align:middle line:84%
So the surface area of that
zeolite that's nanoscaler,

01:00:31.528 --> 01:00:36.767 align:middle line:84%
that's way, way tiny, is
huge, and it's very powerful.

01:00:36.767 --> 01:00:38.969 align:middle line:84%
It's charged, it's
negatively charged.

01:00:38.969 --> 01:00:43.107 align:middle line:84%
So these radioactive particles
are all positively charged,

01:00:43.107 --> 01:00:46.243 align:middle line:84%
except for the iodine and
there's rare other things.

01:00:46.243 --> 01:00:48.445 align:middle line:84%
But for the most part
they're positively charged.

01:00:48.445 --> 01:00:51.982 align:middle line:84%
So when that zeolite
that's nanoscaler goes in,

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:54.618 align:middle line:84%
it goes into the blood
stream, it goes into the cells

01:00:54.618 --> 01:00:58.455 align:middle line:84%
and it selectively, we don't
know why, it selectively rips

01:00:58.455 --> 01:01:01.225 align:middle line:84%
out the worst of the
worst, leaving behind --

01:01:01.225 --> 01:01:02.126 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: It's like chelation

01:01:02.126 --> 01:01:03.427 align:middle line:90%
of sorts.

01:01:03.427 --> 01:01:04.695 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: It's chelation
for the worst of the worst.

01:01:04.695 --> 01:01:09.800 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't chelate out en
masse, the good minerals

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:11.635 align:middle line:84%
that are also positively
charged.

01:01:11.635 --> 01:01:13.937 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So only
identifies the ones

01:01:13.937 --> 01:01:15.472 align:middle line:90%
that need to be, the junk?

01:01:15.472 --> 01:01:16.573 align:middle line:90%
>> Apsley: Yes.

01:01:16.573 --> 01:01:17.808 align:middle line:84%
And what we're doing
with the poor sailors

01:01:17.808 --> 01:01:20.110 align:middle line:90%
from the USS Ronald Reagan,

01:01:20.110 --> 01:01:22.946 align:middle line:84%
that's the first thing we're
going to hit them with,

01:01:22.946 --> 01:01:24.848 align:middle line:90%
with nanoscaler zeolite.

01:01:24.848 --> 01:01:26.049 align:middle line:90%
So they're --

01:01:26.049 --> 01:01:27.084 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Where
do we find that?

01:01:27.084 --> 01:01:29.953 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
-- who makes that?

01:01:29.953 --> 01:01:31.555 align:middle line:90%
I know this isn't to sell,

01:01:31.555 --> 01:01:33.290 align:middle line:84%
but we need to know
how we can access this.

01:01:33.290 --> 01:01:35.092 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: Well it's important
to know the information,

01:01:35.092 --> 01:01:36.560 align:middle line:84%
it's important to
know who sells it.

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.128 align:middle line:84%
If people go to my
website or go

01:01:38.128 --> 01:01:40.964 align:middle line:84%
to my free newsletter, I give
them all the information.

01:01:40.964 --> 01:01:44.802 align:middle line:84%
They can go to their own
source to find these products.

01:01:44.802 --> 01:01:46.036 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Tell us
your website again.

01:01:46.036 --> 01:01:49.039 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: They can contact
me through DrApsley.com.

01:01:49.039 --> 01:01:51.208 align:middle line:90%
That's D-R Apsley.com.

01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:56.513 align:middle line:84%
Or through my e-mail that goes
to that webstie:

01:01:56.513 --> 01:01:58.282 align:middle line:84%
John@drapsley.com and we have
this free newsletter that goes

01:01:58.282 --> 01:02:00.984 align:middle line:84%
out that tells people, here,
these four basic things today is

01:02:00.984 --> 01:02:03.554 align:middle line:84%
what you should look at for your
whole family, here's why,

01:02:03.554 --> 01:02:06.023 align:middle line:84%
and here's where
you can get them.

01:02:06.023 --> 01:02:09.626 align:middle line:84%
So the -- as I stated,
there's four simple steps

01:02:09.626 --> 01:02:11.094 align:middle line:90%
to reverse this problem.

01:02:11.094 --> 01:02:13.197 align:middle line:90%
We have to neutralize the harm

01:02:13.197 --> 01:02:15.299 align:middle line:84%
of the hydrogen peroxide
right now.

01:02:15.299 --> 01:02:18.535 align:middle line:84%
Fruits and vegetables,
the juices, the smoothie.

01:02:18.535 --> 01:02:21.205 align:middle line:84%
We have to then pull it
out as fast as possible,

01:02:21.205 --> 01:02:23.674 align:middle line:84%
the nano zeolite and
the edible clays that go

01:02:23.674 --> 01:02:25.042 align:middle line:90%
through the intestines.

01:02:25.042 --> 01:02:27.511 align:middle line:84%
The nano zeolite goes
out through the kidney.

01:02:27.511 --> 01:02:29.746 align:middle line:84%
It goes into the cells and out
through the kidney.

01:02:29.746 --> 01:02:31.949 align:middle line:84%
The other clays go through
the intestinal tract

01:02:31.949 --> 01:02:34.117 align:middle line:84%
where all the other
poisons come out.

01:02:34.117 --> 01:02:36.386 align:middle line:84%
And that can be done
longer term.

01:02:36.386 --> 01:02:39.122 align:middle line:84%
The nano zeolite shouldn't
be done all the time for a year,

01:02:39.122 --> 01:02:42.759 align:middle line:84%
it should be done just
until all the radiation is

01:02:42.759 --> 01:02:44.728 align:middle line:90%
out of your body.

01:02:44.728 --> 01:02:47.664 align:middle line:84%
Then the -- the regeneration
part, then to repair

01:02:47.664 --> 01:02:51.235 align:middle line:84%
at massive rates of speed the
damage that's already been done.

01:02:51.235 --> 01:02:56.106 align:middle line:84%
And that's done with the super
foods, these detox, oxygenation.

01:02:56.106 --> 01:02:59.243 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I have to ask you
this, we're almost out of time.

01:02:59.243 --> 01:03:00.444 align:middle line:90%
What about iodine?

01:03:00.444 --> 01:03:02.179 align:middle line:90%
I know there are some complexes

01:03:02.179 --> 01:03:04.715 align:middle line:84%
that have T 1, 2,
3, and 4 in them.

01:03:04.715 --> 01:03:07.251 align:middle line:84%
What should we be doing
about iodine supplementation?

01:03:07.251 --> 01:03:10.587 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: Well, if you can find
an iodine source that has T3

01:03:10.587 --> 01:03:13.757 align:middle line:84%
in it, 3 tyrosine
molecules, it's an amino acid,

01:03:13.757 --> 01:03:15.325 align:middle line:84%
more power to you,
that's fantastic.

01:03:15.325 --> 01:03:18.161 align:middle line:84%
That would be likely be
illegal over the counter.

01:03:18.161 --> 01:03:20.297 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to have it over the
counter, because there are

01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:21.665 align:middle line:90%
so many Americans today --

01:03:21.665 --> 01:03:23.233 align:middle line:90%
the way to test for that is

01:03:23.233 --> 01:03:25.769 align:middle line:84%
to do your temperature
underneath your arm first thing

01:03:25.769 --> 01:03:27.337 align:middle line:84%
in the morning before
you get out of bed.

01:03:27.337 --> 01:03:30.807 align:middle line:84%
It needs to be 98.0
with a good thermometer,

01:03:30.807 --> 01:03:32.776 align:middle line:84%
needs to be an accurate
thermometer.

01:03:32.776 --> 01:03:35.078 align:middle line:84%
So if you're using a digital
make sure you buy the ones

01:03:35.078 --> 01:03:38.081 align:middle line:84%
that are accurate to
0.2 degrees Farenheit,

01:03:38.081 --> 01:03:39.516 align:middle line:84%
make sure it says
that when you buy it.

01:03:39.516 --> 01:03:41.184 align:middle line:90%
And then push it down twice

01:03:41.184 --> 01:03:42.786 align:middle line:84%
without moving it
out of the underarm.

01:03:42.786 --> 01:03:49.259 align:middle line:84%
If it's not 98.0, let's say
it's 97.0, your immune system

01:03:49.259 --> 01:03:52.362 align:middle line:84%
and your enzyme systems that
make you work are working

01:03:52.362 --> 01:03:55.499 align:middle line:84%
at least a thousand
percent less than normal.

01:03:55.499 --> 01:03:56.667 align:middle line:90%
Just by one degree.

01:03:56.667 --> 01:03:59.102 align:middle line:84%
Some studies show
2,000% less per degree.

01:03:59.102 --> 01:04:00.437 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Wow.

01:04:00.437 --> 01:04:01.305 align:middle line:84%
Jump in the hot tub and then
take your temperature again.

01:04:01.305 --> 01:04:02.539 align:middle line:90%
>> Apsley: That's it.

01:04:02.539 --> 01:04:04.007 align:middle line:84%
That's why you do that
first thing in the morning.

01:04:04.007 --> 01:04:05.342 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

01:04:05.342 --> 01:04:06.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay, so now I
know a lot of the information

01:04:06.610 --> 01:04:09.813 align:middle line:84%
you've talked about is available
in the back of this book

01:04:09.813 --> 01:04:11.848 align:middle line:84%
until you put out
your cancer book.

01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:14.851 align:middle line:84%
And then again I love
free newsletters,

01:04:14.851 --> 01:04:16.586 align:middle line:84%
I so appreciate it
when people put

01:04:16.586 --> 01:04:19.289 align:middle line:90%
out newsletters as a service.

01:04:19.289 --> 01:04:20.857 align:middle line:84%
Wow, what a wealth
of information.

01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:22.993 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
sharing it with us.

01:04:22.993 --> 01:04:24.261 align:middle line:84%
>> Apsley: Thank you
for having people.

01:04:24.261 --> 01:04:25.662 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I think you've
helped a lot of people today.

01:04:25.662 --> 01:04:27.364 align:middle line:90%
>> Apsley: Thank you, Regina.

01:04:27.364 --> 01:04:28.699 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: You might also want

01:04:28.699 --> 01:04:31.068 align:middle line:84%
to watch my Healing Matrix
program with Katrine Volynsky,

01:04:31.068 --> 01:04:33.337 align:middle line:84%
a Russian woman who
lived through Chernobyl

01:04:33.337 --> 01:04:36.106 align:middle line:84%
and devoted her life to
healing herself and others

01:04:36.106 --> 01:04:38.675 align:middle line:84%
with radiation detox,
well worth watching.

01:04:38.675 --> 01:04:44.614 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
