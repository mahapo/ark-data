>>REGINA MEREDITH: One of the
greatest mysteries to this day

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.330 align:middle line:10%
is the tale of the great island
civilization of Atlantis.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.070 align:middle line:84%
Many of the people I interview
refer to this civilization,

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.890 align:middle line:84%
but seldom talk about
its exact location.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.540 align:middle line:84%
Some of the most
credible research

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.860 align:middle line:84%
indicates that Plato
left clear clues.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.280 align:middle line:84%
Byron Belitsos, publisher of
books about the Urantia work

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.510 align:middle line:84%
and a book on the
discovery of Atlantis

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.360 align:middle line:84%
is here to discuss
the possibilities.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And this is-- I've
really looked forward

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.560 align:middle line:84%
to this, because I love
the subject of Atlantis.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.320 align:middle line:84%
I love all the
different theories

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.090 align:middle line:90%
about its civilizations.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.019 align:middle line:84%
I love the varying timelines,
possible locations.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.870 align:middle line:84%
This really gets me
juiced up, so I'm

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.355 align:middle line:84%
very happy to have you here
talking with us about it.

00:01:08.355 --> 00:01:10.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BYRON BELITSOS: Great to be
back, Regina, and let's dive

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.660 align:middle line:90%
deep.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:11.451 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's go.

00:01:11.451 --> 00:01:14.910 align:middle line:84%
Let's start with Plato
and the stories that were

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.870 align:middle line:90%
passed on to him through Solon.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.960 align:middle line:84%
How Solon came into contact
with that information.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.070 align:middle line:10%
>>BELITSOS: Solon was
one of the great teachers

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.300 align:middle line:10%
of the Athenians, but he was
also the lawgiver of Athens.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.480 align:middle line:10%
And he precedes
Plato by 200 years.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.830 align:middle line:84%
What happened is he
had to get out there,

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.880 align:middle line:90%
because they had come to him.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.440 align:middle line:84%
They said, well,
you're the sage.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.100 align:middle line:90%
We are in chaos.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.150 align:middle line:90%
Give us laws.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.794 align:middle line:84%
So Solon gave them laws
and a constitution.

00:01:45.794 --> 00:01:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And then he figured, I
better get out of here,

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.500 align:middle line:84%
because they're going to
come to me for revision,

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.140 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not going
to revise this.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.240 align:middle line:84%
So he took a voyage
to Egypt, and that's

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.660 align:middle line:90%
how this all got started.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.140 align:middle line:84%
He went to Egypt to do
research and stay away

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.110 align:middle line:90%
for 10 years from Athens.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.910 align:middle line:84%
So this was a
wonderful opportunity

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.130 align:middle line:84%
for somebody in the
Greek civilization

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.710 align:middle line:84%
to find out about the Egyptian
knowledge, wisdom, and history.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.590 align:middle line:84%
So the legend is that
he was given a download

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.420 align:middle line:84%
by Egyptian priests
that they wanted

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.210 align:middle line:90%
to transmit to the Greeks.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And who better than
Solon to do that.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.930 align:middle line:84%
Solon came back with a
story that was handed down

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:33.560 align:middle line:84%
to the family, his family,
which Plato's family was

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.280 align:middle line:90%
related to Solon's family.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.780 align:middle line:84%
So kind of private knowledge
that was handed down.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.659 align:middle line:90%
And so then he publicized it.

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:40.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's go back a
little bit to Solon.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.690 align:middle line:84%
So my understanding
is that it's not

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.390 align:middle line:84%
as though he spoke with
a priest in a temple.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.770 align:middle line:84%
He traveled Egypt and met
with various high priests

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.510 align:middle line:84%
in various regions, cities,
temples, and so forth,

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.730 align:middle line:84%
and kept getting,
essentially, the same story.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: He got this story
of this island that was--

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's
talk about where

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.170 align:middle line:90%
their information came from.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.039 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: I don't think
Plato exactly tells you

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.710 align:middle line:84%
where that comes from, so
that's more speculative

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.070 align:middle line:90%
as to where it comes from.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.235 align:middle line:90%
It's in their records.

00:03:13.235 --> 00:03:14.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And even
today, I mean,

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.980 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptian-- what's left
behind by the Egyptians

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.020 align:middle line:84%
still appears to be some of
the best resourced information

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.760 align:middle line:90%
about ancient human history.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And some would say that that was
passed on through tribes that

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.850 align:middle line:84%
had migrated out of Atlantis
into the very early days

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:30.892 align:middle line:90%
of Egypt and passed down.

00:03:30.892 --> 00:03:31.641 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: Right.

00:03:31.641 --> 00:03:33.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
let's go with that.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: So my contention is
that Atlantis is actually Eden.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.110 align:middle line:84%
So Eden, according to this
book, "Discovery of Atlantis,"

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.350 align:middle line:84%
is on Cyprus, but it moved
to a second location,

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.530 align:middle line:90%
which is Mesopotamia.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.950 align:middle line:84%
So they're right next
door to the Egyptians.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.740 align:middle line:84%
So that culture that
they built, which

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell you about,
precedes the Egyptians-- well,

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.870 align:middle line:84%
depending when the Egyptians
say-- the Egyptian dynasties

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:00.550 align:middle line:90%
start when?

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:01.300 align:middle line:90%
When would we say?

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.424 align:middle line:90%
When would you like to say?

00:04:02.424 --> 00:04:04.000 align:middle line:90%
15,000 BC?

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.010 align:middle line:90%
So this is double that.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.060 align:middle line:84%
So that culture which comes
down as a Sumerian culture

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.720 align:middle line:84%
much, much later, also comes
down as the Egyptian culture

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.970 align:middle line:90%
much later.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.199 align:middle line:84%
So the source
civilization, rather

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:17.740 align:middle line:84%
than being in the
Atlantic, according

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.870 align:middle line:84%
to many, which is something
we need to look at,

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.330 align:middle line:90%
it would be right next door.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.910 align:middle line:90%
That's where Atlantis is.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.820 align:middle line:10%
So there are really
two Atlantis locations.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.660 align:middle line:10%
One in Cyprus, this sunken
land, and then the movement

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.750 align:middle line:10%
of that group, because of
warfare, to Mesopotamia.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.200 align:middle line:84%
So then those legends,
which, for example,

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.730 align:middle line:84%
Isis and Osiris is related
to what I want to get into,

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.690 align:middle line:90%
which is Adam and Eve.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:49.220 align:middle line:10%
So Adam and Eve, Eden,
equals Atlantis in this view.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.280 align:middle line:84%
So it's controversial
to say that,

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.380 align:middle line:84%
but we have
archaeological evidence

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.830 align:middle line:90%
that they're the same thing.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, folks would say that
Atlantis is even further back.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.860 align:middle line:84%
That's definitely
important to look at

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.110 align:middle line:90%
and to see the archeological--

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We'll
get to that later.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.600 align:middle line:84%
But let's look at the core part
of this work and the passed on

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.120 align:middle line:84%
knowledge from Solon and
some of the evidence based

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.520 align:middle line:84%
on the work of
"Critias" and so forth.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: So in the
"Critias" and in the "Timaeus,"

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.015 align:middle line:84%
it gives you really
amazing detail

00:05:18.015 --> 00:05:21.560 align:middle line:84%
that nobody would want
to do if you're Plato.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.940 align:middle line:90%
I mean, or anybody.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.780 align:middle line:84%
Just say, why would you-- if
you're making an allegory,

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.590 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't work as an allegory.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.570 align:middle line:84%
Because I mean, Plato
did a lot of allegories,

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.280 align:middle line:84%
but this doesn't
work as an allegory,

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.456 align:middle line:84%
even though the scholars
say, oh, well, it's

00:05:33.456 --> 00:05:34.520 align:middle line:90%
sort of like an allegory.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.360 align:middle line:84%
It's serves as just an
entertaining diversion.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, there's too much
technology, too much detail.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.506 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was an
historical rendering.

00:05:42.506 --> 00:05:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: It gives
you the length and width

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.950 align:middle line:84%
and what kind of minerals
and what kind of mountains

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.570 align:middle line:90%
and where the ocean was.

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.900 align:middle line:84%
So all that stuff
sounds like he's

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.090 align:middle line:84%
transmitting to
future generations

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.480 align:middle line:84%
this important legend that came
down in his family from Solon.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.350 align:middle line:84%
So we actually
identified 50 clues

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.020 align:middle line:84%
that come out of the "Critias,"
mainly, and also "Timaeus."

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.410 align:middle line:84%
But specifics about flora
and fauna and temperature

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.820 align:middle line:84%
and latitude and all
that sort of thing.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.680 align:middle line:90%
And what's the match?

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.630 align:middle line:84%
So people say,
well, he says it's

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.320 align:middle line:84%
on the other side of
the Pillar of Hercules.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.750 align:middle line:84%
So that would be between
Rock of Gibraltar,

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.570 align:middle line:90%
there, where Spain meets Africa.

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.890 align:middle line:10%
But there's another
possible Pillar of Hercules,

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:28.792 align:middle line:10%
which is in the Bosphorus.

00:06:28.792 --> 00:06:30.250 align:middle line:10%
On the other side
of the Bosphorus,

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.850 align:middle line:10%
meaning in the
Mediterranean, in what we

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.630 align:middle line:10%
consider to be where this is,
which is Eastern Mediterranean.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.040 align:middle line:84%
So that's a
reinterpretation of that.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.580 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that people-- they
interpret that as meaning it

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.476 align:middle line:90%
has to be in the Atlantic.

00:06:44.476 --> 00:06:46.100 align:middle line:84%
But we have an
alternate interpretation

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.520 align:middle line:84%
that is more plausible
in terms of what

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.806 align:middle line:90%
actually happened in the area.

00:06:49.806 --> 00:06:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And all this stuff
we're talking about,

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.600 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptians, the
Sumerians, and the Greeks,

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.900 align:middle line:84%
and the Assyrians, well, they're
not near the Atlantic Ocean.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.720 align:middle line:84%
So how is it that these
primitive people navigated

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.510 align:middle line:84%
all the way from the Atlantic
Ocean, came through this area,

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:10.110 align:middle line:84%
through the Straits,
past Sicily, past Greece,

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.020 align:middle line:84%
and then get all the
way over to Mesopotamia?

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.319 align:middle line:84%
Why would they do-- what
would be the purpose of that?

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:16.860 align:middle line:84%
So I haven't heard
an answer to that.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:17.360 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we can get
into that in a little bit.

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.680 align:middle line:84%
Because I have some things I'll
bring up and toss out to you

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.360 align:middle line:90%
on that.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.960 align:middle line:84%
But meanwhile, let's
talk about some

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.320 align:middle line:84%
of those 50 clues that
have been left behind.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:33.020 align:middle line:84%
So let's launch into Eden,
Atlantis, location, clues,

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.705 align:middle line:84%
similarities, what's
left in the Bible, so on.

00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:37.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: A lot
of stuff there.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.870 align:middle line:84%
So in the "Critias,"
we can't list all 50,

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.370 align:middle line:84%
but there's very
prominent things,

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:47.240 align:middle line:84%
such as the island was
rectangular or mainly east-west

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.320 align:middle line:90%
in its appearance.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And then there was an
island with high mountains

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.590 align:middle line:84%
that jutted out of the
sea that are igneous.

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And then there was a
plain in a low, flat area

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.370 align:middle line:84%
adjacent to that,
which is facing south,

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:05.140 align:middle line:84%
and there's high mountains
all the way around the north

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.820 align:middle line:90%
and also the south.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And in this valley, this flat
plain, there's a mountain.

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:15.490 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it's a large
hill, where the temple was,

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:18.990 align:middle line:84%
or the Acropolis Hill,
as Plato called it.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:22.810 align:middle line:84%
So everything I just mentioned
is a near perfect match

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:24.610 align:middle line:90%
to Cyprus.

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Cyprus has all those
characteristics, including it

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:30.520 align:middle line:90%
has a very equable temperature.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.059 align:middle line:84%
It's moderate, and there are
mountains to the north which

00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:36.450 align:middle line:90%
block cold air coming down.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:37.884 align:middle line:84%
So Plato actually
mentioned that.

00:08:37.884 --> 00:08:39.929 align:middle line:84%
And there's mountains to
the north part of Cyprus

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:41.387 align:middle line:84%
that block cold
air that come down.

00:08:41.387 --> 00:08:46.540 align:middle line:84%
So this south-facing
plain, he said

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:52.060 align:middle line:84%
was 330 equivalent of
miles by 220 miles.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.970 align:middle line:84%
So we think there's
an error there,

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:58.380 align:middle line:84%
because the plain that
we see is 33 by 22.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.770 align:middle line:90%
So it's exactly one tenth.

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:05.800 align:middle line:84%
So we identified-- not me,
but the author of the book

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.370 align:middle line:84%
discovered Atlantis,
over many years

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:12.280 align:middle line:84%
got maps to identify a
place like this that he

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.289 align:middle line:90%
thought was there.

00:09:13.289 --> 00:09:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And he's looking there
because "The Urantia Book"

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.510 align:middle line:90%
says this is where Eden was.

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:19.927 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't say that's
where Atlantis was.

00:09:19.927 --> 00:09:22.010 align:middle line:84%
But we didn't want to go
public about "The Urantia

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:24.600 align:middle line:90%
Book," since it's so obscure.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.640 align:middle line:90%
So we said it was Atlantis.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.910 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we called it
"Discovery of Atlantis."

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:33.610 align:middle line:84%
So we're radical in which
we say, Atlantis is Eden.

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And other clues
it had, he said it

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:39.800 align:middle line:84%
had minerals like gold
and silver and copper.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Cyprus has a lot of
gold, silver, and copper.

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:44.350 align:middle line:90%
Cyprus means copper.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.120 align:middle line:90%
The word kypros means copper.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.490 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of copper.

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And the copper ingots
that came out of Cyprus

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:56.660 align:middle line:84%
are something that were given as
gifts to the Egyptian pharaohs

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.040 align:middle line:90%
coming out of Cyprus.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:02.560 align:middle line:84%
So Cyprus is interesting in
that it matches myth as well.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.480 align:middle line:84%
So the mythic aspect
of this, that Aphrodite

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.850 align:middle line:84%
was born out of the
waves of Cyprus,

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:13.280 align:middle line:90%
and Adonis, who was her consort.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And the two of them are like
fertility deities, right?

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.110 align:middle line:90%
I mean, particularly Aphrodite.

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And the Urantia version
states that this

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.840 align:middle line:90%
is Adam and Eve's location.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.020 align:middle line:90%
This is where Eve is.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:28.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's not the
biblical Adam and Eve

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.630 align:middle line:90%
who are the first family.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:33.380 align:middle line:84%
There had already been humans
for about a million years,

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:36.020 align:middle line:84%
so they had progressed
quite a bit.

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:40.140 align:middle line:84%
And so the story that
I tell states this.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:46.600 align:middle line:84%
That there's a certain point
in the evolution of a people

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.310 align:middle line:84%
where they need a
genetic tweaking.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:53.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which we talked about
in our transhumanist show, yes.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:58.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: And that is when
the universe will notice, will

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:03.140 align:middle line:84%
note this, and will send
these biological up lifters

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.520 align:middle line:84%
that happen to be
called Adam and Eve.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:09.050 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting that every
planet gets an Adam and Eve.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:11.760 align:middle line:84%
So a normal planet
in a typical timeline

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:16.270 align:middle line:84%
will get these celestial
beings that incarnate.

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:19.470 align:middle line:90%
So back to Aphrodite and Adonis.

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.080 align:middle line:84%
They're there on that
same south coast.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.490 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
Cypriots believe

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:28.502 align:middle line:84%
she was born from the
waves of the south coast.

00:11:28.502 --> 00:11:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And what "The
Urantia Book" says is

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:34.070 align:middle line:84%
that south coast is where
that flat plain is where

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:37.770 align:middle line:84%
a beautiful female
and a gorgeous male

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:40.620 align:middle line:90%
incarnated out of the blue.

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:45.000 align:middle line:84%
They had been prepared
for thousands of years.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.470 align:middle line:84%
Certain high humans, actually
transhumans you might say,

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:53.140 align:middle line:84%
knew this was coming, and they
prepped the Garden of Eden

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:55.380 align:middle line:84%
for the reception
of the biological

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.740 align:middle line:90%
up lifters, Adam and Eve.

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:01.450 align:middle line:84%
So when we call
this Atlantis, we

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.230 align:middle line:84%
say that the legend
of Atlantis, which

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:09.010 align:middle line:84%
is a source civilization
of more advanced thinkers

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:11.060 align:middle line:84%
who were more attractive,
more beautiful,

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:13.240 align:middle line:90%
and had better technology.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:18.110 align:middle line:84%
We believe that
Eden is that idea

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:20.160 align:middle line:90%
of the Urantia version of Eden.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.450 align:middle line:90%
It's the same idea.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:27.620 align:middle line:84%
So what you get then
is a divine couple

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:32.370 align:middle line:84%
that, like in pagan versions
of fertility deities,

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:35.090 align:middle line:90%
interbreed with the population.

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:38.750 align:middle line:84%
But this is a planned
and orderly procedure,

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:41.890 align:middle line:84%
which is really a
scientific-like splicing

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:49.710 align:middle line:84%
of genes from off-planet
source into human genetic pool.

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:54.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, so in the last hour,
we talked about the default

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:55.780 align:middle line:90%
of Adam and Eve.

00:12:55.780 --> 00:13:00.900 align:middle line:84%
Adam and Eve failed
in their task.

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:03.510 align:middle line:84%
However, it was not
exactly their fault,

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:06.140 align:middle line:84%
because we talked about
the previous regime,

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:10.170 align:middle line:84%
the previous intervention,
which defaulted as well.

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And the reason it defaulted
was the Lucifer rebellion,

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.280 align:middle line:84%
which was a rebellion
of the angels overseeing

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:23.140 align:middle line:84%
all of this who were inputting
their perverted ideas

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:29.850 align:middle line:84%
onto the planet to the leaders
of the original intervention

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:31.590 align:middle line:90%
in Mesopotamia.

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:32.490 align:middle line:90%
So it's complicated.

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:34.810 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to summarize
it a second time, if I may.

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:35.435 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:35.435 --> 00:13:38.000 align:middle line:84%
Just briefly, and then we'll
launch back to Atlantis.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: So in
the last hour, we

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:43.040 align:middle line:84%
examined that there was a
previous intervention 500,000

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:48.670 align:middle line:84%
years ago of 100 avatars who
were not sent to interbreed,

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:51.850 align:middle line:84%
but sent to taught basic skills
of civilization and arts,

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:53.350 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:57.140 align:middle line:84%
The Lucifer rebellion happened
in the middle of that activity.

00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And by that time,
they had a large city

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:03.330 align:middle line:84%
near the Persian Gulf, right on
the coast of the Persian Gulf.

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:07.670 align:middle line:84%
That entire project was
disrupted, because they

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:09.462 align:middle line:90%
departed from the basic plan.

00:14:09.462 --> 00:14:10.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Was that Dalamatia?

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: And that's
known as Dalamatia.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:16.900 align:middle line:10%
So Dalamatia has remnants in
an area called Dilmun, which

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.970 align:middle line:10%
is known to archaeologists.

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:22.060 align:middle line:10%
This area where Dilmun
is now identified

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.380 align:middle line:10%
as being a very
ancient civilization

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:29.770 align:middle line:10%
is north of where Dalmatia
was, which is under the waves,

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:32.420 align:middle line:10%
like 200,000 years ago.

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:38.490 align:middle line:84%
So that civilization failed
to generate-- to do, actually,

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:43.000 align:middle line:84%
its job, which was to create a
civilization that was existing

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.720 align:middle line:84%
and sustainable in the region
where Adam and Eve would come,

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:51.950 align:middle line:84%
where they would find a
relatively advanced culture

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:55.010 align:middle line:84%
in which to do this
cross breeding.

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:58.190 align:middle line:84%
So they came down
into an area they were

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.980 align:middle line:90%
planning to come all that time.

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:04.280 align:middle line:84%
They came down to something
that was primitive, warlike,

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.480 align:middle line:84%
ignorant, backward, without
the arts and culture

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.030 align:middle line:90%
of civilization.

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:11.110 align:middle line:90%
There were a primitive tribes.

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:16.440 align:middle line:84%
But Adam and Eve needed to come,
because this is the evolution

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:20.380 align:middle line:90%
of the genetic pool of humans.

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:23.620 align:middle line:84%
So the genetic--
the genome of humans

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:26.540 align:middle line:84%
has progressed now four
billion years, really.

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, life was
planted after that,

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:31.810 align:middle line:84%
but progressed all this
time, hits a plateau,

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:35.230 align:middle line:84%
and needs an
off-planet injection.

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:40.020 align:middle line:84%
So that this is the
Adam and Eve mission.

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:43.630 align:middle line:84%
Their race is known
as the Violet race.

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:46.850 align:middle line:84%
So the Violet race sounds
odd, but imagine now,

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:48.710 align:middle line:84%
we have colored
races on the planet.

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:52.470 align:middle line:84%
We've got red, we've got Native
Americans with the red man.

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:55.950 align:middle line:84%
We've got so-called
"yellow" Asians and Chinese.

00:15:55.950 --> 00:16:00.260 align:middle line:84%
We've got so-called
white Caucasian.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.660 align:middle line:90%
So they're colored races.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And there's even a
kind of a green race,

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:08.110 align:middle line:84%
according to "The Urantia Book,"
which is in southern India.

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:09.104 align:middle line:90%
There's a green tinge.

00:16:09.104 --> 00:16:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Green tinge
to the skin, yeah?

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: To the skin, and
you can actually see that.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.213 align:middle line:90%
So there were the colored races.

00:16:14.213 --> 00:16:17.799 align:middle line:84%
And now this is a colored race
being brought from off-planet.

00:16:17.799 --> 00:16:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:20.150 align:middle line:84%
So now this triggers
a couple things.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:23.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, not only skin,
but you could also

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.700 align:middle line:84%
be looking at the
field of a person.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.030 align:middle line:84%
It could be that they were
casting off a violet light,

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:29.370 align:middle line:90%
but also the notion of Hindu.

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:31.080 align:middle line:90%
Krishna, blue.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: Blue, yeah.

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:32.694 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Blue.

00:16:32.694 --> 00:16:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And then also, and
other people I've

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:36.400 align:middle line:84%
heard that have gone
into very ancient times

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:40.560 align:middle line:84%
in past life regressions,
there were bluish tinted skins

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.370 align:middle line:90%
of the people.

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:43.360 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, all this,
I'm just saying,

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.030 align:middle line:84%
in validating from
many odd sources

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:48.900 align:middle line:84%
that violet or
blue skin would not

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:53.630 align:middle line:84%
be out of possibility,
range of possibility.

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: There
was purportedly

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.240 align:middle line:84%
a blue race, according
to "The Urantia Book."

00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:01.190 align:middle line:84%
So there were the three primary
and three secondary colors.

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:03.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's just a very
slight emanation.

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:05.839 align:middle line:90%
And also, the skin color itself.

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:08.950 align:middle line:84%
There was a hue that was
emanating from of a field

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:10.700 align:middle line:90%
effect around the skin.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:13.015 align:middle line:84%
And the blue was a
fairly advanced race.

00:17:13.015 --> 00:17:15.690 align:middle line:84%
It went into Europe mainly,
but it was Caucasian, really,

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:17.730 align:middle line:84%
the source Caucasian
group is known as blue.

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:21.119 align:middle line:84%
So the Caucasus
are close to India,

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:24.300 align:middle line:84%
so maybe that's why
Krishna is blue.

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:27.700 align:middle line:84%
The so-called blue man
had characteristics

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:36.650 align:middle line:84%
that we now identify as European
mixed with the Adamic violet

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:40.450 align:middle line:84%
and other contributors which
are too complicated to get into.

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:41.850 align:middle line:90%
It would be a whole show.

00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is the racial theories
of "The Urantia Book," which

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:47.460 align:middle line:84%
are quite controversial,
but very detailed

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.530 align:middle line:90%
and can be checked out.

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying, geneticists can,
and some have, begun to verify

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:58.500 align:middle line:84%
or not these theories
of the colored races.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.690 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, coming
back to Adam and Eve,

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:03.885 align:middle line:84%
you've got this violet,
which is a higher vibration,

00:18:03.885 --> 00:18:04.385 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:18:04.385 --> 00:18:05.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is, yeah.

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:07.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: And it's
more advanced genetics,

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:12.450 align:middle line:84%
which is going to confer on
you a better cognition, better

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:18.530 align:middle line:84%
immune system and more
creativity, more humor.

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:23.090 align:middle line:84%
Art, creativity, is
conferred by the genetics.

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:25.820 align:middle line:84%
So the idea that
the celestials have

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:29.450 align:middle line:84%
is to import this
into the genetic pool,

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:34.900 align:middle line:84%
because the mutations that are
natural that are constantly--

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:37.420 align:middle line:84%
the novelty is
constantly bubbling up,

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:42.090 align:middle line:84%
doesn't contribute sufficiently
amounts of these kind

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:43.780 align:middle line:90%
of superhuman traits.

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:45.910 align:middle line:84%
Because this is getting
to be super biological,

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:47.740 align:middle line:90%
superhuman in a way.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:51.830 align:middle line:84%
So nature is not going to
contribute that kind of genius.

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:54.180 align:middle line:90%
That has to be imported.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:56.969 align:middle line:84%
But we should be nice to
nature, because nature

00:18:56.969 --> 00:18:58.260 align:middle line:90%
has done a lot of great things.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.240 align:middle line:84%
It evolved eyes
and ears and bodies

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.470 align:middle line:84%
that are beautiful,
and so did a lot.

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:05.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
still spontaneously

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:09.320 align:middle line:84%
combusting from time to time
into beautiful new creations.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:13.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: And there's still
novelty in genetic evolution.

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:16.830 align:middle line:84%
But very, very minor compared
to what happened in the past.

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:21.810 align:middle line:84%
Compared to what we can
do in genetic manipulation

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:24.640 align:middle line:84%
with transhuman
experimentation, and

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:28.724 align:middle line:90%
compare to injections of gene--

00:19:28.724 --> 00:19:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Foreign DNA.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: --from the outside,
either by Adam and Eve type

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.670 align:middle line:84%
beings or by extraterrestrials,
which of course you've

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:37.430 align:middle line:90%
covered on your show here.

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:40.815 align:middle line:84%
That ET hybridization
is quite far along,

00:19:40.815 --> 00:19:42.060 align:middle line:90%
according to some people.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:42.657 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:19:42.657 --> 00:19:44.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're all somewhat
of a product of that.

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:46.615 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: We're probably
a product of that.

00:19:46.615 --> 00:19:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And so this gives-- The Urantia
account gives two big periods

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:53.710 align:middle line:90%
of genetic intervention.

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:56.740 align:middle line:84%
The first one was not
supposed to happen.

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:59.950 align:middle line:84%
That's the one we covered
before with the Nodites.

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:04.360 align:middle line:84%
Secondly is the Adamic
injection, much later.

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a
blending of those two

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:10.620 align:middle line:84%
groups, so-called
Nodites and the Adamites.

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And that blending
is in Mesopotamia

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:18.850 align:middle line:84%
in the period after
Adam and Eve's garden,

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:21.060 align:middle line:84%
the so-called
Second Garden, which

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:23.690 align:middle line:84%
is right at the mouth of
the Tigris and Euphrates--

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:26.880 align:middle line:84%
which is exactly where
Sumeria was later,

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:31.220 align:middle line:84%
35,000 years later-- is where
this blending-- first of all,

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:34.620 align:middle line:84%
the Adamic children
and their bloodline,

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:43.260 align:middle line:84%
the pure line violet children,
are emanating from the garden

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:44.490 align:middle line:90%
site.

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:48.040 align:middle line:84%
Then, over eons of time--
well, thousands of years--

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.770 align:middle line:84%
they're moving out on purpose,
migrating and intermarrying

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:52.990 align:middle line:90%
with the natives.

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:55.380 align:middle line:84%
But they also run
into the Nodites,

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.350 align:middle line:84%
who are quite nearby
in settlements,

00:20:57.350 --> 00:21:00.250 align:middle line:90%
and they're hostile.

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:04.450 align:middle line:84%
But they forget the past,
and they just interbreed.

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:12.470 align:middle line:84%
So this interbreeding goes
over 35,000 to 15,000 BC

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:18.330 align:middle line:84%
of a massive intermarrying of
natives, Nodites, and Adamites

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:19.070 align:middle line:90%
in this area.

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And then begins what
modern anthropologists

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:30.090 align:middle line:84%
and archaeologists can
refer to as migrations

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:34.180 align:middle line:84%
from that area that lead
to modern civilization

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:36.580 align:middle line:84%
and also lead to
civilization in the area.

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:39.140 align:middle line:90%


00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.920 align:middle line:84%
As the Sumerian or
the pre-Sumerians,

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:45.920 align:middle line:84%
Egyptians went right nearby,
and Assyrians north of that.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.910 align:middle line:10%
And in Turkey,
Turkmenistan, there

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:52.170 align:middle line:10%
are civilizations now because
of the Gobekli Tepe finding,

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:55.880 align:middle line:10%
which correlates
beautifully with this.

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:58.560 align:middle line:84%
But that's further-- much
further north in Turkey,

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.521 align:middle line:90%
is how did they get there.

00:22:00.521 --> 00:22:01.270 align:middle line:90%
How did advanced--

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:01.936 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:01.936 --> 00:22:04.190 align:middle line:84%
Whole other story, which
I will be doing. [LAUGHS]

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:06.237 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: It's helpful
for this too, as well.

00:22:06.237 --> 00:22:06.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:07.320 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:09.800 align:middle line:84%
So now let's look at
everything you've just said,

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:13.320 align:middle line:84%
and the inter breeding of these
people, the timeline, and then

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:17.380 align:middle line:84%
the island of Atlantis,
with the concentric circles.

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And now getting
into the being known

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:21.490 align:middle line:84%
as Poseidon and the
rest of that story,

00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:23.767 align:middle line:90%
and how these cross over.

00:22:23.767 --> 00:22:24.600 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: So yeah.

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:30.280 align:middle line:84%
Let's shuttle back to the
advent of Adam and Eve

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:33.670 align:middle line:84%
in this location, which
is now sunken land which

00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:36.490 align:middle line:84%
is adjacent to the
current day Cyprus, which

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:41.040 align:middle line:84%
is a peninsula that sticks
out from Syria, back then.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:44.700 align:middle line:84%
So this peninsula is 27
miles wide at the neck.

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:47.350 align:middle line:84%
That is where it joins in
with current day Syria,

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:48.740 align:middle line:90%
according to "The Urantia Book."

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:52.650 align:middle line:10%
And then the land there
is the exact location

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:54.880 align:middle line:10%
of Atlantis City.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.700 align:middle line:10%
Of course, they call it Eden.

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.510 align:middle line:10%
We can call it Atlantis City.

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:01.700 align:middle line:90%
This is where they incarnate.

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:04.300 align:middle line:84%
Already present
there are thousands

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:06.610 align:middle line:84%
of miles of canals
and roads that

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:10.100 align:middle line:84%
were built by those who
were told this was coming.

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:12.530 align:middle line:84%
So that took a lot of faith
for these progenitors.

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:14.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And these
were supposedly somewhat

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:16.807 align:middle line:90%
sophisticated structures.

00:23:16.807 --> 00:23:18.140 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: Well, for that time.

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not necessarily--
I mean for that time, yes.

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.111 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: Yeah, pretty
much for that time

00:23:22.111 --> 00:23:24.090 align:middle line:84%
and artistically
beautiful structures.

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:27.075 align:middle line:84%
And the direction of that
is a different story.

00:23:27.075 --> 00:23:29.720 align:middle line:84%
Who this is, Timothy
Wyllie tells that story.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.782 align:middle line:90%
And this is someone named Van.

00:23:31.782 --> 00:23:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And we can get into
it if you want.

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Get into the good guy.

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Caligastia--
Van's the other guy.

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:37.301 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: He's the other guy.

00:23:37.301 --> 00:23:38.800 align:middle line:90%
So Van supervises this.

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.740 align:middle line:84%
Van's a superhuman that's
still a resident on earth

00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:43.260 align:middle line:90%
and an immortal.

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:44.920 align:middle line:90%
So he's overseeing this.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And when Adam and
Eve get here, he's

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:51.632 align:middle line:84%
completed with his mission, and
he's removed from the planet.

00:23:51.632 --> 00:23:53.090 align:middle line:84%
So by the time they
get there, they

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:57.810 align:middle line:84%
have all of this infrastructure
for this huge city which would

00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:01.620 align:middle line:90%
be nothing but their children.

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:06.450 align:middle line:84%
So natives were also present
as workers and participants

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:07.750 align:middle line:90%
on the island.

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:12.410 align:middle line:84%
But the children were not
to interbreed with them.

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:19.540 align:middle line:84%
The children were to be a
quantity of 500,000 children

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:20.370 align:middle line:90%
to be generated.

00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:22.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is--
they're intermarrying,

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:26.800 align:middle line:84%
so it's like a kind of
incest, but it's benign.

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And they're building up progeny
and children, grandchildren,

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:35.760 align:middle line:84%
down many generations,
until we get 500,000.

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:39.810 align:middle line:84%
Then they would
migrate out and they

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:44.500 align:middle line:84%
would be the most
attractive peoples

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.510 align:middle line:84%
anyone had ever
seen, because they

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:49.740 align:middle line:84%
come from Adam and Eve, who
were this gorgeous couple

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:53.010 align:middle line:84%
with incredible
attributes and traits.

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And their children would have
the same attributes and traits.

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And anybody would want
to intermarry with them.

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:00.630 align:middle line:90%
So they would spread throughout.

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:03.670 align:middle line:84%
They would be like
biological missionaries.

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:06.460 align:middle line:84%
And so as they met the
different cultures, all the way

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:08.480 align:middle line:84%
to the Pacific, all the
way up to the England,

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:13.090 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, South America, South
Africa, they would intermarry,

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:17.200 align:middle line:84%
and all those colored races
would blend into a single race.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And so according to "The
Urantia Book," on every planet

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:22.110 align:middle line:84%
you have colored
races until you have

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:25.120 align:middle line:84%
an intermarrying
of the violet race

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:29.110 align:middle line:84%
over many thousands of years
with the indigenous races.

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:31.730 align:middle line:84%
So you have the natural
races, colored races,

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:35.640 align:middle line:84%
then you have this super race
that blends with all of them.

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And its genetics are such that
you get a lot of diversity

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:44.880 align:middle line:84%
in the pool, because you've
got the native characteristics

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:45.480 align:middle line:90%
and traits--

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:48.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which are necessary
for survival on that planet.

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:51.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: Which are
necessary for that environment.

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:53.730 align:middle line:84%
But they're diverse because
there's different colors.

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:55.460 align:middle line:84%
There's black,
there's red, there's--

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:56.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All adapted
for whatever purpose

00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:57.324 align:middle line:90%
of that region, yes.

00:25:57.324 --> 00:25:58.781 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: For
where they were at.

00:25:58.781 --> 00:26:01.350 align:middle line:84%
So in genetics, you want to have
massive-- a lot of blending,

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:03.900 align:middle line:84%
because that gives the best
traits the best chance to--

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:05.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Kind of like a mutt?

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:07.210 align:middle line:84%
They always say the
mutts are the strongest.

00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: Yeah, because
they get the best traits.

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.070 align:middle line:84%
Because this is
how genetics works,

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:16.240 align:middle line:84%
is the more adaptive traits
are what get expressed.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:18.150 align:middle line:90%
And so you want this.

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:21.080 align:middle line:84%
So this is a
biological plan, not

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.300 align:middle line:84%
something that we get
in the Bible, which

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:25.695 align:middle line:84%
is all about religion and
about them doing bad stuff

00:26:25.695 --> 00:26:27.111 align:middle line:84%
and being thrown
out of the garden

00:26:27.111 --> 00:26:28.520 align:middle line:90%
because they disobeyed God.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:31.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, they kind of did,
but in metaphorical sense.

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:33.819 align:middle line:90%
But it's really just biology.

00:26:33.819 --> 00:26:34.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:38.370 align:middle line:84%
So now, again, who's
Poseidon in this mix?

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:41.520 align:middle line:84%
Because I want to get us
back into where these beings

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:45.290 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about, the
500,000 now, their species

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:49.124 align:middle line:84%
had been propagated throughout
the region and beyond.

00:26:49.124 --> 00:26:50.290 align:middle line:90%
Where does Poseidon come in?

00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:53.520 align:middle line:84%
Where does the city and
Poseidon's son and Atlantis?

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: Just a
quick correction.

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:56.174 align:middle line:90%
They never got to 500,000.

00:26:56.174 --> 00:26:57.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They didn't.

00:26:57.090 --> 00:26:58.620 align:middle line:84%
That was the plan, but
they didn't get there.

00:26:58.620 --> 00:26:59.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: Yeah.

00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:00.340 align:middle line:90%
The plan collapsed.

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:01.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, the
plan collapsed?

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:01.920 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.476 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: They
got to thousands.

00:27:03.476 --> 00:27:05.650 align:middle line:90%
Several-- some thousands.

00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:07.710 align:middle line:84%
Poseidon is a mythic
figure who carries

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:09.235 align:middle line:90%
a trident with three prongs.

00:27:09.235 --> 00:27:12.070 align:middle line:10%
And the trident, in
our interpretation,

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:17.790 align:middle line:10%
represents the three continents
that are adjacent to Cyprus;

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:21.190 align:middle line:10%
Africa, Asia,
Eurasia, and Europe.

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:22.790 align:middle line:10%
So that's how we see it.

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:23.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And that particular--
when we're talking

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:28.160 align:middle line:84%
about that mythological
figure and his overlay

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.420 align:middle line:84%
and then the divvying up
of the land by the sons,

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:34.300 align:middle line:84%
how does that metaphorically
factor into the Urantia

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:36.710 align:middle line:84%
work and the Bible and
so forth about the place

00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:37.750 align:middle line:90%
known as Atlantis?

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:39.410 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: Atlantis slash Eden.

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:41.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Slash Eden.

00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:43.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: So I
don't exactly know

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:46.760 align:middle line:84%
how Poseidon plays in
this as a mythic figure,

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:48.270 align:middle line:84%
but it's more
interesting to look

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:52.140 align:middle line:84%
at the divine
goddess/god pairings.

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:56.690 align:middle line:84%
Isis and Osiris,
Inanna and Dumuzid--

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The same story repeats
throughout all the religions

00:27:59.250 --> 00:27:59.750 align:middle line:90%
in history.

00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:00.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: All through them.

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:01.740 align:middle line:90%
Krishna and Radha, et cetera.

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:03.540 align:middle line:90%
So it's a divine pair.

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And often, they're fertile
deities, as we mentioned.

00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And they are interbreeding
in many of these myths.

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:13.170 align:middle line:84%
So this says, yes,
they really were there.

00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:18.450 align:middle line:84%
So they defaulted because
of a complicated story.

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:19.939 align:middle line:90%
But I'll tell it in brief form.

00:28:19.939 --> 00:28:21.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I like
complicated stories.

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:25.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: So the bad
guys are the Nodites.

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:29.180 align:middle line:84%
They're next door in Syria
and all through that area.

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And there are Nodite
tribes that are friendly.

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:34.660 align:middle line:84%
And there are Nodite
tribes that are unfriendly.

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And they're under the
awesome aegis of Caligastia

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:44.250 align:middle line:84%
who is this invisible being who
channels stuff to the priests.

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:47.060 align:middle line:84%
So he's channeling
to the priests,

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:49.310 align:middle line:90%
go to war against your neighbor.

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:50.671 align:middle line:90%
Because he loved warfare.

00:28:50.671 --> 00:28:51.170 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:55.285 align:middle line:84%
Because warfare causes progress,
technological progress.

00:28:55.285 --> 00:28:56.535 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Through competition.

00:28:56.535 --> 00:28:57.950 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: Through competition.

00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:00.040 align:middle line:90%
This is the Caligastian way.

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:02.140 align:middle line:84%
Warfare-- and we
see it even now.

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:04.480 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of
technological spin-offs

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.720 align:middle line:90%
from military research.

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:07.050 align:middle line:90%
So there's something to that.

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:10.950 align:middle line:84%
But it's just pure
technology without ethics.

00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:12.220 align:middle line:90%
And that's the point.

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.960 align:middle line:84%
So he's-- back in
these ancient times,

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:18.580 align:middle line:84%
he's literally trying
to foment warfare.

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:24.200 align:middle line:84%
He also resents the fact that
the Galactic government has

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:28.220 align:middle line:90%
sent intruders Adam and Eve.

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:30.150 align:middle line:84%
The Galactics--
"The Urantia Book"

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:33.570 align:middle line:84%
calls them something else, but
let's call them Galactics--

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:38.080 align:middle line:90%
are intruding on his fiefdom.

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:39.420 align:middle line:90%
This is my planet.

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:40.810 align:middle line:90%
I've taken it over.

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:43.550 align:middle line:84%
This is his corrupt
mind speaking.

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:44.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to stop them.

00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:47.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can't stop
them from incarnating,

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:49.590 align:middle line:84%
because that's done
by higher forces,

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:52.480 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to
mess up their plan.

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:55.754 align:middle line:90%
So he actually appears to them.

00:29:55.754 --> 00:29:57.670 align:middle line:84%
He has the ability to
do that to Adam and Eve.

00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And he says, look, Adam
and Eve, you're stuck here.

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:02.419 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you-- I'm stuck
here and you're stuck here.

00:30:02.419 --> 00:30:03.460 align:middle line:90%
This isn't going to work.

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:04.180 align:middle line:90%
Don't you see?

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:05.690 align:middle line:90%
I mean, look around you.

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:08.910 align:middle line:84%
This is all warfare
and primitive tribes.

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:12.339 align:middle line:84%
But these are my people, so
don't mess with my people.

00:30:12.339 --> 00:30:13.630 align:middle line:90%
So here's what you ought to do.

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:17.040 align:middle line:84%
You ought to follow me, and
let me tell you what to do,

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.990 align:middle line:90%
and we'll accelerate evolution.

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:21.430 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there will be
conflict, but that's good.

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:23.190 align:middle line:90%
And they said, absolutely no.

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:24.650 align:middle line:90%
No, we're not going to do this.

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:26.000 align:middle line:90%
So he withdraws.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.390 align:middle line:84%
So then he tries kind
of a flank attack.

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And he gets a tribesman
nearby in a friendly tribe

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:35.750 align:middle line:90%
to seduce Eve.

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:38.360 align:middle line:84%
But it took him
years of dialogue

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:39.890 align:middle line:90%
with Eve to say, look, Eve.

00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:41.430 align:middle line:84%
You see this thing
is not working.

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:43.570 align:middle line:84%
You've got, what,
150 children here.

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:45.430 align:middle line:90%
I think it's 115 children.

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:46.905 align:middle line:90%
And we're not getting anywhere.

00:30:46.905 --> 00:30:47.405 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:30:47.405 --> 00:30:48.446 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, well, yeah.

00:30:48.446 --> 00:30:49.950 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty rough.

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:50.870 align:middle line:90%
Pretty rough.

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:53.290 align:middle line:84%
Because there were tribes that
were trying to fight them.

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:56.990 align:middle line:84%
They had this big wall
between them and the Nodites.

00:30:56.990 --> 00:31:00.770 align:middle line:84%
It 's a huge wall,
which we may discover.

00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And they were trying to
penetrate the defenses of Eden

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:07.090 align:middle line:90%
and Atlantis.

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:11.110 align:middle line:84%
So she decides to
attempt to improvise

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:15.420 align:middle line:84%
and decides to interbreed with
this beautiful tribesperson

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:18.850 align:middle line:84%
and comes out of this episode
realizing she'd made a mistake.

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:21.480 align:middle line:84%
So the Bible tells the
story of Eve eating

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:24.240 align:middle line:90%
of the tree of good and evil.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:28.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's that she actually
interbred outside the plan.

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:31.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'll tell you why
this is not a good idea.

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Because if you created
a bloodline outside

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:39.170 align:middle line:84%
of this restricted
area, that could

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:43.930 align:middle line:84%
become analogous to what
the Nazis were trying

00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:46.180 align:middle line:90%
to do, to create a master race.

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:53.790 align:middle line:84%
What if she did send her genes
through many different suitors

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:56.930 align:middle line:84%
in that tribe, and then suddenly
they had these supermen?

00:31:56.930 --> 00:32:00.780 align:middle line:84%
Then these supermen would
say, hey, we should take over.

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:01.859 align:middle line:90%
Then you'd have warfare.

00:32:01.859 --> 00:32:02.900 align:middle line:90%
You'd have a master race.

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:08.020 align:middle line:84%
So the divine plan, learned from
millions of previous planets,

00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:12.320 align:middle line:84%
is to create so many children
that they spread out totally

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:16.970 align:middle line:84%
throughout the world
evenly and equally.

00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:19.220 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, you don't
easily get a master race.

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A super
race, so to speak.

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.345 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: You don't
get a super race.

00:32:22.345 --> 00:32:25.330 align:middle line:84%
So Hitler is pulling
from ancient legends--

00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:27.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, he was
very much a devotee

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:28.880 align:middle line:90%
of the fables of Atlantis.

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:29.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: Very much so.

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:32.495 align:middle line:84%
And so this is
part-- out of this

00:32:32.495 --> 00:32:36.060 align:middle line:84%
he gets this perverted notion
of the Aryan race, which

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:39.450 align:middle line:84%
is a master race, which
is really the Nodite

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:42.460 align:middle line:84%
tradition, that we are
seeing a superior race.

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And technically, they
were genetically superior.

00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:47.410 align:middle line:90%
But they are pre-Aryan.

00:32:47.410 --> 00:32:49.360 align:middle line:90%
Aryans were much later.

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:53.140 align:middle line:84%
But still, the Aryans,
so-called Aryans, are-- I mean,

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:55.530 align:middle line:84%
there's really such
a thing as Aryans.

00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:59.930 align:middle line:84%
Or 15,000 years later,
then all of this activity.

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:03.770 align:middle line:10%
So this is why it looks--
when you read "The Urantia

00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:07.110 align:middle line:10%
Book," you say, man, that's
really harsh that they aborted

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:12.370 align:middle line:10%
the whole plan just because Eve
made one mistake and interbred.

00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:14.780 align:middle line:10%
But what happened
was not only did

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:22.005 align:middle line:10%
she pass her genes along and had
a child whose name was Abel--

00:33:22.005 --> 00:33:25.280 align:middle line:10%
she had these children,
Cain and Abel--

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:28.370 align:middle line:10%
but also the Nodites
in that tribe,

00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:32.300 align:middle line:10%
when they found out
about this betrayal,

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:36.840 align:middle line:10%
went to war against
Eden, Atlantis.

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:42.039 align:middle line:84%
So they penetrated the defenses,
and they wrecked the city.

00:33:42.039 --> 00:33:42.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:45.900 align:middle line:84%
So what kind of-- what kind
of technology in that era

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:47.650 align:middle line:90%
are we talking about?

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:48.650 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: For weapons?

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:49.541 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:33:49.541 --> 00:33:50.790 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: That I don't know.

00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:52.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure it was
fairly primitive.

00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:55.420 align:middle line:84%
But the Adamites
were not warlike.

00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:58.710 align:middle line:84%
So Adam's children and
all of their followers,

00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:03.930 align:middle line:84%
most of their followers,
fled before the tribes

00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:05.494 align:middle line:90%
overtook the island.

00:34:05.494 --> 00:34:06.410 align:middle line:90%
They got out of there.

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:09.586 align:middle line:84%
So then they transfer
their whole operation,

00:34:09.586 --> 00:34:12.959 align:middle line:84%
all their cattle,
everything they can.

00:34:12.959 --> 00:34:19.420 align:middle line:84%
They flee, and then the Nodite
tribes, these warlike tribes,

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:28.679 align:middle line:84%
swarm over Eden and find all
the artifacts of a great culture

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:31.190 align:middle line:90%
and destroy it.

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:34.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we have a couple
things overlaying here, then.

00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:39.280 align:middle line:84%
The attack by the Nodites took
down the civilization, then.

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:39.780 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:41.250 align:middle line:90%
Because the others had fled.

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:42.850 align:middle line:84%
And we talk about
in-- biblically,

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:44.489 align:middle line:90%
we talk about the fall.

00:34:44.489 --> 00:34:47.570 align:middle line:84%
So that would be part of a
biblical version of the fall.

00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:50.500 align:middle line:84%
If you look at other--
for lack of a better

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:53.770 align:middle line:84%
word, new ager
historical revisionist

00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:57.580 align:middle line:84%
texts and such on Atlantis
from-- through the fabled

00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:59.370 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis, we're
talking about a time

00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:02.720 align:middle line:84%
that it was a time of
devolution or descension.

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:03.420 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And this would all play
into the same thing.

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:07.346 align:middle line:90%
Is that kind of what--

00:35:07.346 --> 00:35:08.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: Yeah,
because if they

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:11.310 align:middle line:84%
have been allowed to
continue to breed children

00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:16.320 align:middle line:84%
and had half a million children
who were pure line super race,

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:18.855 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it would have been
a whole different Earth

00:35:18.855 --> 00:35:19.560 align:middle line:90%
or Urantia.

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:25.830 align:middle line:84%
We would have had this
masterful genetic upgrade.

00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And we would have had a kind
of creativity, a kind of humor,

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:36.020 align:middle line:84%
beauty, a more loving
nature, more peaceful nature,

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:39.042 align:middle line:84%
so the animal traits that
we all seem to have--

00:35:39.042 --> 00:35:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, those
are the traits you-- that

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.790 align:middle line:84%
are supposedly relegated to the
earlier versions of Atlantis,

00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:48.750 align:middle line:84%
or the stories of the very
earliest phases of Atlantis

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:51.120 align:middle line:84%
was this very-- everything
you're talking about.

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:55.940 align:middle line:84%
A very plentiful,
sophisticated, beautiful culture

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:59.360 align:middle line:84%
that wasn't steeped in
competition, and yet

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.690 align:middle line:90%
was able to continue producing.

00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:02.590 align:middle line:90%
Which is interesting.

00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:05.310 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
that, what allowed

00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:10.170 align:middle line:84%
them to continue producing
and evolving and perfecting

00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:11.781 align:middle line:90%
without competition?

00:36:11.781 --> 00:36:13.280 align:middle line:84%
Because the whole
competition thing,

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:15.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're learning
now, is a ruse.

00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:16.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: Right.

00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:17.010 align:middle line:90%
Well--

00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:18.468 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a
crack in the plan.

00:36:18.468 --> 00:36:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: In
this version, they

00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:23.520 align:middle line:84%
just had to get out of the
way of marauding tribes.

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:27.430 align:middle line:84%
So they move way down to
the Tigris Euphrates Mouth.

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:31.860 align:middle line:84%
It's a long distance from--
it took months to get there.

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And they find this area
that's totally fertile,

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:37.466 align:middle line:84%
and there's a few tribes there
who allow them to move in.

00:36:37.466 --> 00:36:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And then those tribes
just left, because they

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:42.042 align:middle line:84%
found this incredible
kind of master race.

00:36:42.042 --> 00:36:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we
better get out of here.

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:47.960 align:middle line:84%
So this is completely
empty land, no competition,

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:49.700 align:middle line:90%
for them to build their culture.

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And then they-- since Adam
and Eve had already wrecked

00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:57.710 align:middle line:84%
their protocol, they
abandoned the protocol,

00:36:57.710 --> 00:37:01.380 align:middle line:84%
which was not to
interbreed prematurely-- it

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:03.130 align:middle line:90%
was too late now.

00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:07.370 align:middle line:90%
So they interbred with natives.

00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:12.207 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, Adam and Eve
were no longer immortals.

00:37:12.207 --> 00:37:13.290 align:middle line:90%
So this is the other part.

00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:16.760 align:middle line:84%
They were supposed to be
immortal with the tree of life.

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:22.040 align:middle line:84%
But the tree of
life was-- they were

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:25.700 align:middle line:84%
unable to-- not the
tree of life continuum,

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:30.760 align:middle line:84%
but they lost their connection
to the off-planet energetic

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:35.340 align:middle line:84%
source, because they had
defaulted on the basic plan.

00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:37.790 align:middle line:84%
But they lived for another--
many hundreds of years.

00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And so as fast as they
could, they interbred.

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:46.140 align:middle line:84%
So Adam interbred with as--
he impregnated as many women

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:50.920 align:middle line:84%
as he could in the natives
around Mesopotamia.

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:52.100 align:middle line:90%
Thousands.

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:55.830 align:middle line:84%
So those children,
"half-breeds" so to speak,

00:37:55.830 --> 00:38:00.740 align:middle line:84%
become a very important kind
of master race for thousands

00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:05.750 align:middle line:84%
of years in that area, who
then migrate north and find

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:09.080 align:middle line:84%
the Nodite tribes who are
also genetically advanced,

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:13.200 align:middle line:84%
mix with them around
20 to 15,000 BC,

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:18.360 align:middle line:84%
create a hybrid of the
Nodites, natives, and Adamites.

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And that group is
known as the Andites.

00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And the Andites are the source
of all these other legends.

00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:29.080 align:middle line:84%
As they moved to
Europe, moved to Asia,

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:31.880 align:middle line:84%
moved to Egypt,
that's what we think

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:36.580 align:middle line:84%
is the source of even the
Atlantis legend and all

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:41.760 align:middle line:84%
of the other myths
of a primeval utopia

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:46.280 align:middle line:84%
where there's two deities, a
god and goddess, who are giving

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:49.260 align:middle line:84%
civilization and who are
interbreeding, all of that

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:52.620 align:middle line:84%
comes from-- these
garbled legends come down

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:54.770 align:middle line:84%
in all of these civilizations
because of the Andite

00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:55.760 align:middle line:90%
migrations.

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can we assume
that with the Andites

00:38:57.890 --> 00:39:02.590 align:middle line:84%
started coming some of the
classic characteristics of more

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:05.640 align:middle line:84%
sophisticated civilizations
in terms of architecture.

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:08.890 align:middle line:84%
The notion of pyramids,
for example, and ziggurats,

00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:11.360 align:middle line:84%
and the Hanging
Gardens of Babylon.

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:13.160 align:middle line:84%
Are you saying
that these Andites

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:15.930 align:middle line:84%
are responsible for
these higher traits?

00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:17.869 align:middle line:84%
And let's get into
agriculture, too,

00:39:17.869 --> 00:39:19.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: That's
what we're saying.

00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:21.710 align:middle line:84%
Adam and Eve also
taught agriculture.

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:24.780 align:middle line:84%
So all of the arts of
civilization-- almost all

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:27.040 align:middle line:84%
of them-- that we
have today emanate

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.660 align:middle line:84%
from this region of
Mesopotamia, which is basically

00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:32.940 align:middle line:90%
what academics will tell you.

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:35.715 align:middle line:84%
But this is much more specific
information and dates,

00:39:35.715 --> 00:39:39.130 align:middle line:84%
and specific dates, and
archaeological sites

00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:40.424 align:middle line:90%
that we can find.

00:39:40.424 --> 00:39:41.840 align:middle line:84%
That we're just
beginning to find,

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:45.440 align:middle line:84%
like Gobekli Tepe and
the Sumerian sites.

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:48.270 align:middle line:84%
Which are much later, but
then definitely hearken back

00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:51.550 align:middle line:84%
to this golden age and
this divine couple.

00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:53.529 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's credited
to being Atlantis.

00:39:53.529 --> 00:39:55.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: It's credited
by some to be Atlantis.

00:39:55.570 --> 00:39:58.070 align:middle line:84%
But according to
Sitchin, this is

00:39:58.070 --> 00:40:02.299 align:middle line:84%
Enki and-- I forget the female--
Ekido or whatever her name is.

00:40:02.299 --> 00:40:04.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I just remember
the brothers, Enki and Enlil,

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:05.090 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:05.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: There's Enlil.

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:07.070 align:middle line:90%
But there's a divine pair.

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:07.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There is.

00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:08.440 align:middle line:90%
I've forgotten her name, too.

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:09.939 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: Analogous
to Isis-Osiris

00:40:09.939 --> 00:40:11.180 align:middle line:90%
and all the other ones.

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:17.980 align:middle line:84%
So this is a genetic argument
as well as a cultural theory

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:22.505 align:middle line:84%
of an origin from this region,
but it's going all the way

00:40:22.505 --> 00:40:23.670 align:middle line:90%
into Asia, too.

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:26.810 align:middle line:84%
So this Andite migration,
much of it goes into Europe.

00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:30.230 align:middle line:84%
Most of it, like 60%
of it goes into Europe.

00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:33.810 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of it goes north
into the central areas,

00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:38.490 align:middle line:84%
and then from there, across
into Tibet, China, and beyond.

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a
genetically-- frankly,

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:45.260 align:middle line:84%
this is genetically superior
people that are interbreeding.

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And the genetic
traits, the higher

00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:49.200 align:middle line:90%
traits are getting diluted.

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:50.600 align:middle line:90%
They're getting diluted.

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:53.870 align:middle line:84%
But there's this impulse
for civilization.

00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:55.650 align:middle line:84%
So this is where this
notion of regression

00:40:55.650 --> 00:40:58.090 align:middle line:84%
comes in, because
they're interbreeding

00:40:58.090 --> 00:41:02.310 align:middle line:84%
with lower stocks, so to speak,
to use genetic terminology.

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:05.400 align:middle line:84%
So they're interbreeding
with lesser stocks,

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:09.900 align:middle line:84%
and so you lose
contact with Adam

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:16.960 align:middle line:84%
and Eve's violet genes and
characteristics in energy.

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:18.000 align:middle line:90%
Pretty much lost.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:23.990 align:middle line:84%
However, there is survival of
small amounts in certain groups

00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:27.310 align:middle line:84%
that show up even
into the current time.

00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:29.950 align:middle line:84%
For example, the more
adventurous traits

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:32.810 align:middle line:84%
are set to show up
in the British, who

00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:35.060 align:middle line:90%
were the first colonizers.

00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:38.540 align:middle line:84%
More creative traits
show up here and there

00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:40.100 align:middle line:90%
in certain groups.

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:43.460 align:middle line:84%
It's stated that the
Cretan civilization was

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:46.245 align:middle line:90%
a fairly pure line connection.

00:41:46.245 --> 00:41:51.460 align:middle line:84%
It was a migrating, benign
group of Andites with Nodites

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:53.770 align:middle line:84%
that had just simply
come across to Crete.

00:41:53.770 --> 00:41:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And they start the-- what later
became the Minoan civilization.

00:41:57.460 --> 00:41:59.790 align:middle line:84%
So that goes back
about 12,000 years.

00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And that was a really
advanced civilization,

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:06.950 align:middle line:84%
way ahead of what comes later,
called Greek civilization.

00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- so why is it going
down rather than progressing

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:11.730 align:middle line:90%
upward?

00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:11.960 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:12.170 align:middle line:90%
Because--

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:12.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that makes sense.

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:14.830 align:middle line:84%
If they-- from
the interbreeding,

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:16.230 align:middle line:90%
that makes absolute sense.

00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
about all of this

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:21.460 align:middle line:84%
is we've gotten
about as far as we

00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:23.380 align:middle line:90%
can through academic studies.

00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:25.300 align:middle line:84%
You can only dig so
much, and especially

00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:29.180 align:middle line:84%
if your history is either under
the sea or maybe 100 meters

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:30.860 align:middle line:90%
under the surface of the Earth.

00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:35.310 align:middle line:84%
So really we are
left, in large part,

00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:38.670 align:middle line:84%
to begin looking at
these channeled works.

00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:41.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: We all use
channeled works, these days.

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:42.430 align:middle line:90%
It seems like we all do.

00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:43.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Urantia is a
channeled work, yeah?

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:43.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: Urantia
is channeled.

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And then there's much, much more
channeled stuff in the Urantia

00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:48.870 align:middle line:90%
tradition now happening.

00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And I will point out that
I hadn't mentioned to you

00:42:51.850 --> 00:42:54.074 align:middle line:90%
that Adam and Eve are back.

00:42:54.074 --> 00:42:55.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it
wouldn't surprise me.

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:57.820 align:middle line:84%
There a lot of players
here at this point--

00:42:57.820 --> 00:42:57.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: Not incarnate.

00:42:57.970 --> 00:42:59.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --in time,
cosmic and so forth.

00:42:59.770 --> 00:43:00.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:00.790 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: And channeling.

00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:01.560 align:middle line:90%
And channeling.

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:05.012 align:middle line:84%
And I had a dialogue with Eve
recently, through channeling.

00:43:05.012 --> 00:43:06.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tell us about that.

00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: Who is
basically saying this.

00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:14.330 align:middle line:84%
That we, Adam and
Eve-- Adam and I

00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:17.960 align:middle line:84%
are sorry that we did
not do our job properly.

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:20.140 align:middle line:84%
But we had very
difficult conditions.

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:23.160 align:middle line:84%
We moved to this other
location and did our best

00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:24.620 align:middle line:90%
in Mesopotamia.

00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:25.170 align:middle line:90%
Then we--

00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:26.086 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tried again.

00:43:26.086 --> 00:43:28.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: And
so now, we get two

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:31.250 align:middle line:84%
different-- there's one
version of this through one

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:35.170 align:middle line:84%
channel states-- several
channel states-- that the ET

00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:37.790 align:middle line:84%
hybridization
program is something

00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:41.045 align:middle line:84%
that Adam and Eve
sponsor and approve of.

00:43:41.045 --> 00:43:44.550 align:middle line:84%
It's controversial
in our own community.

00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:49.630 align:middle line:84%
Another kind of the
line of transmitted work

00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:52.020 align:middle line:84%
is simply saying,
Adam and Eve are here

00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:54.890 align:middle line:90%
to bring us energetic gifts.

00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:56.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
got in this session.

00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:00.810 align:middle line:84%
I got an energy gift
from etheric energy

00:44:00.810 --> 00:44:04.610 align:middle line:84%
from Eve, which has
helped my health.

00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:09.040 align:middle line:84%
So she's ministering,
unseen, to all of us.

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:13.330 align:middle line:84%
Now we're also told that
they will reincarnate again.

00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is apocryphal stuff
in the Urantia community.

00:44:17.310 --> 00:44:20.190 align:middle line:84%
It's not accepted by
many, most, actually.

00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:24.610 align:middle line:84%
It is stating that there'll
be new avatars coming

00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:27.770 align:middle line:84%
as a compensation
for our losses.

00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And Adam and Eve will be back,
and a new set of avatars-- I

00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:33.060 align:middle line:90%
mentioned the 100.

00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:35.060 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be
another group like that

00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:36.580 align:middle line:90%
that's coming soon.

00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:37.732 align:middle line:90%
They're going to incarnate.

00:44:37.732 --> 00:44:39.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So will
we recognize them

00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:41.900 align:middle line:84%
as being particularly
lovely and vibrant,

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:43.819 align:middle line:90%
maybe a little tinge of violet?

00:44:43.819 --> 00:44:45.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: I don't
know about violet race,

00:44:45.610 --> 00:44:48.760 align:middle line:84%
but they will be
obviously avatars.

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:50.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We'll want
to mate with them,

00:44:50.530 --> 00:44:51.170 align:middle line:90%
is what you're saying.

00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:51.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: Well
maybe-- I don't think--

00:44:51.550 --> 00:44:51.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if they're
going to be-- it

00:44:51.830 --> 00:44:53.790 align:middle line:84%
hasn't stated they're
going to be mating.

00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:54.640 align:middle line:90%
Maybe so.

00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:58.100 align:middle line:84%
Because if Adam and Eve came
back, it would be for mating.

00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is a theme
that we were talking

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:05.000 align:middle line:84%
about in the last hour, which
is we've had these defaults.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.180 align:middle line:84%
They're called the double
default of Caligastia

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:09.790 align:middle line:90%
and of Adam and Eve.

00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And there's
compensations, which are

00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:14.720 align:middle line:84%
these blessings that
are extemporaneous, not

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:16.150 align:middle line:90%
done on other planets.

00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:19.480 align:middle line:84%
Other planets don't have
incarnations of the sort

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:22.290 align:middle line:90%
that Jesus was.

00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:25.990 align:middle line:84%
That's a very, very
high being to incarnate.

00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:30.570 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't happen but one in
more than a million planets

00:45:30.570 --> 00:45:33.360 align:middle line:90%
does a creator deity incarnate.

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:36.690 align:middle line:84%
He incarnated here because
things were so backward and so

00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:40.740 align:middle line:84%
dark that he wanted to
portray the love of God for us

00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:43.530 align:middle line:84%
by saying, I'll go
into the worst places,

00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:48.490 align:middle line:84%
and I will incarnate and show
myself and teach you about love

00:45:48.490 --> 00:45:49.380 align:middle line:90%
and get killed.

00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:50.460 align:middle line:90%
He got killed.

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:54.449 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a compensation
for the default of Adam and Eve

00:45:54.449 --> 00:45:56.490 align:middle line:84%
and a compensation for
the default of Caligastia.

00:45:56.490 --> 00:46:01.510 align:middle line:84%
That is, our celestial host
of the planet was dark.

00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:04.510 align:middle line:84%
So Jesus is incarnating
into the middle of this

00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:07.360 align:middle line:84%
and being confronted
by these beings.

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And the Bible states
that he confronted

00:46:10.450 --> 00:46:14.460 align:middle line:84%
Satan on the Mount
Hermon, and also I

00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:15.830 align:middle line:90%
think, Lucifer, in the Bible.

00:46:15.830 --> 00:46:17.579 align:middle line:84%
I get them mixed up
in "The Urantia Book."

00:46:17.579 --> 00:46:22.170 align:middle line:84%
But he ended the Lucifer
rebellion at that point.

00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:23.750 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
technical end of it.

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:25.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: When was that ended?

00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: It's two
stages of ending it.

00:46:28.170 --> 00:46:32.240 align:middle line:84%
One is when Jesus incarnates
and is confronted by Caligastia,

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:33.910 align:middle line:90%
Satan, and others.

00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And he basically puts them
down, and he says, look,

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:40.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm your creator.

00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:43.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm your father.

00:46:43.090 --> 00:46:45.480 align:middle line:84%
Get you behind me, as
it says in the Bible.

00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:48.260 align:middle line:90%
And they just have to pull back.

00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And then he
technically terminates.

00:46:49.930 --> 00:46:54.430 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, their ability
to invade the minds

00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:58.590 align:middle line:84%
of people, demonic possession
with their rebel spirits.

00:46:58.590 --> 00:47:01.850 align:middle line:84%
So remember, there's rebellious
angels all over the place.

00:47:01.850 --> 00:47:05.200 align:middle line:84%
The planet is full
of rebellious spirits

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:08.890 align:middle line:84%
that are possessing
souls or that

00:47:08.890 --> 00:47:11.590 align:middle line:90%
are making people do things.

00:47:11.590 --> 00:47:14.140 align:middle line:84%
Actually, literally,
whispering to people

00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:17.080 align:middle line:84%
to do things that are dark,
that are manipulative,

00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:18.760 align:middle line:90%
to build power bases.

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:20.570 align:middle line:84%
This is what these
rebel spirits would do.

00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:23.680 align:middle line:84%
So they ended the possibility
of that technically,

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:27.410 align:middle line:84%
by cutting off all the
energetic connections there

00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:30.010 align:middle line:84%
that people-- that they
could make to your mind

00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:32.100 align:middle line:90%
at the moment of Pentecost.

00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:35.610 align:middle line:84%
So at the moment of Pentecost
is when this technically

00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:38.720 align:middle line:84%
was impossible for
demonic possession,

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:42.850 align:middle line:90%
unless you requested it.

00:47:42.850 --> 00:47:43.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:44.200 align:middle line:90%
Unless-- yes.

00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:47.090 align:middle line:84%
On a more conscious level,
you brought that frequency in.

00:47:47.090 --> 00:47:51.060 align:middle line:84%
Then now, I mean, my mind's
kind of hopping all over

00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:52.200 align:middle line:90%
as we're doing this.

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:55.700 align:middle line:84%
So let's say that
that direct interface

00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:58.420 align:middle line:84%
with the human mind
on that demonic level

00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:01.060 align:middle line:90%
was en masse ended back then.

00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:02.680 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:05.900 align:middle line:84%
Today it shows up-- and we
talked about Illuminati.

00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:07.370 align:middle line:90%
We talked about bloodlines.

00:48:07.370 --> 00:48:10.980 align:middle line:84%
We talked about dominion,
domination of the planet

00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:13.250 align:middle line:84%
through all of the
existing systems.

00:48:13.250 --> 00:48:17.060 align:middle line:84%
Now we look at that intrusion
into the mind via media

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:19.710 align:middle line:84%
and those in power and
control and moneyed

00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:21.750 align:middle line:84%
to control the media
and the message.

00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And would you say that's kind
of a Nodite or Nodite invasion

00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:30.810 align:middle line:90%
or expression on the planet?

00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:32.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: You've
got two lines going.

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:37.880 align:middle line:84%
You've got the line of blessing
and the line of Lucifer.

00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:40.660 align:middle line:84%
So after the
incarnation of Christ,

00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:42.970 align:middle line:84%
the Illuminati
bloodlines are still

00:48:42.970 --> 00:48:44.520 align:middle line:84%
quite active in
controlling things.

00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And they took over the Christian
religion, more or less.

00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:49.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
the Vatican and such.

00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:50.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: And et cetera.

00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:57.240 align:middle line:84%
But the pure line Illuminati
have other concerns as well,

00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:59.380 align:middle line:90%
which is wealth and power.

00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:02.820 align:middle line:84%
However, this Holy
Spirit outpouring,

00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:07.640 align:middle line:84%
because Christ incarnated
here, is the perfect antidote

00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:08.140 align:middle line:90%
to that.

00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:12.110 align:middle line:84%
So if you call upon the Holy
Spirit and the other powers,

00:49:12.110 --> 00:49:17.160 align:middle line:84%
the spirit of truth, then
this-- it's no match.

00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:20.220 align:middle line:84%
The influence of
Lucifer and Caligastia

00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:21.970 align:middle line:90%
is no match for that.

00:49:21.970 --> 00:49:25.490 align:middle line:84%
So what these
Illuminati bloodlines

00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:29.280 align:middle line:84%
have to do is become
much more cultish

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:32.520 align:middle line:84%
and to cultivate a
connection to the satanic

00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:34.860 align:middle line:84%
and in much more
deliberate ways,

00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:40.200 align:middle line:84%
in order to box in their
adherence from the influence

00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:42.750 align:middle line:90%
of the Holy Spirit.

00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:47.086 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they do
these dissociative practices

00:49:47.086 --> 00:49:49.374 align:middle line:84%
in these cults, in
these satanic cults.

00:49:49.374 --> 00:49:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Some of this is
written about-- the book's

00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:53.414 align:middle line:84%
going to be coming out
in a couple of months,

00:49:53.414 --> 00:49:55.870 align:middle line:84%
by Barbara Hand Clow, called
"The Ruby Crystal," which

00:49:55.870 --> 00:49:58.370 align:middle line:84%
goes into these
darker practices that

00:49:58.370 --> 00:50:02.874 align:middle line:84%
happened on the darker aspect
of the goings on at the Vatican.

00:50:02.874 --> 00:50:04.040 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: Oh, the Vatican.

00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:05.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, probably the case.

00:50:05.450 --> 00:50:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And certainly in many,
many, many, many locations.

00:50:08.770 --> 00:50:12.990 align:middle line:84%
So these are the nodes
of the Illuminati,

00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:17.690 align:middle line:84%
where they generate Manchurian
candidates, for example.

00:50:17.690 --> 00:50:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how this is
done behind the scenes.

00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:24.749 align:middle line:84%
This is how you can do
false flag operations.

00:50:24.749 --> 00:50:26.040 align:middle line:90%
You have Manchurian candidates.

00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:28.206 align:middle line:84%
You have people doing
assassinations that don't even

00:50:28.206 --> 00:50:29.300 align:middle line:90%
know what they're doing.

00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:31.550 align:middle line:84%
You have-- somebody invades
the parliament of Canada,

00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:33.620 align:middle line:84%
it's probably a
Manchurian Candidate.

00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the cultivation
of this ever more sort

00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:45.590 align:middle line:84%
of painted into a corner
now are those Luciferians.

00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:48.170 align:middle line:84%
But they have a lot
of money, and they

00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:51.000 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of influence in
important places, Washington,

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:51.802 align:middle line:90%
New York, and--

00:50:51.802 --> 00:50:54.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, they must,
because the average person

00:50:54.010 --> 00:50:55.610 align:middle line:90%
feels, what's the point?

00:50:55.610 --> 00:50:57.250 align:middle line:90%
You can't fight them.

00:50:57.250 --> 00:50:59.440 align:middle line:84%
You know, the whole
death and taxes,

00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:00.620 align:middle line:90%
and you don't have any say.

00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:01.745 align:middle line:90%
You don't have any control.

00:51:01.745 --> 00:51:03.070 align:middle line:90%
Politics is corrupt.

00:51:03.070 --> 00:51:06.640 align:middle line:84%
The average person is left
feeling rather defeated

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:08.450 align:middle line:90%
as a result of that.

00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:12.180 align:middle line:84%
So in this-- we
have some time left.

00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:18.180 align:middle line:84%
How would you frame
the resurrection

00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:21.400 align:middle line:84%
of the human spirit
above and beyond all

00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:25.330 align:middle line:84%
of this to essentially
triumph over these darker

00:51:25.330 --> 00:51:28.170 align:middle line:84%
messages, these darker
feelings of hopelessness

00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:33.130 align:middle line:84%
that the vast majority of
people are encumbered with?

00:51:33.130 --> 00:51:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: I say in
my forthcoming book

00:51:35.650 --> 00:51:37.680 align:middle line:84%
that there's a double
default of that,

00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:39.630 align:middle line:90%
of Adam and Eve and Caligastia.

00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:42.960 align:middle line:90%
But there's a triple blessing.

00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:44.400 align:middle line:84%
The first of the
triple blessings

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:48.080 align:middle line:84%
is the incarnation of a
creator being, Christ.

00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:53.080 align:middle line:84%
The second one is the gift
of the Urantia revelation.

00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:56.440 align:middle line:84%
It's not just that book
alone, but its related texts

00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:58.590 align:middle line:90%
like "Course in Miracles."

00:51:58.590 --> 00:52:01.300 align:middle line:84%
These are giftings to
compensate for what

00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:03.810 align:middle line:90%
we lost out in in prehistory.

00:52:03.810 --> 00:52:07.520 align:middle line:84%
There's all this Holy Spirit
energy that's a gifting.

00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:14.780 align:middle line:84%
Then the third great gifting,
the Epochal, is coming now.

00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is called
the Correcting Time.

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:21.520 align:middle line:84%
So this is the post
Urantia revelations.

00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:23.600 align:middle line:84%
So this is controversial
with the Urantia people.

00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:26.820 align:middle line:84%
This is called the Correcting
Time in its umbrella,

00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:29.750 align:middle line:84%
but under it there
are two big missions.

00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:32.530 align:middle line:84%
One mission is known as
the teaching mission,

00:52:32.530 --> 00:52:35.580 align:middle line:84%
and the second mission is known
as the Magisterial Mission.

00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:41.190 align:middle line:84%
The Teaching Mission is
angelic and ascended masters,

00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:43.700 align:middle line:84%
angelic beings and
ascended beings,

00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:46.620 align:middle line:84%
ascended humans,
coming back to teach.

00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And they're teaching
based on the Urantia text.

00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:51.550 align:middle line:84%
So they have the textbook
of "The Urantia Book,"

00:52:51.550 --> 00:52:53.550 align:middle line:84%
and they're teaching
from the text.

00:52:53.550 --> 00:52:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's gone on since
1987, and I published

00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:57.830 align:middle line:90%
a number of the books.

00:52:57.830 --> 00:53:02.220 align:middle line:84%
Secondly is the next phase of
that, which is called, again,

00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:08.620 align:middle line:84%
the Magisterial Mission, which
is a new set of avatars coming

00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:13.460 align:middle line:84%
to teach us the really advanced
things that we should already

00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:14.890 align:middle line:90%
know.

00:53:14.890 --> 00:53:18.792 align:middle line:84%
But along with that is
the unconscious aspect

00:53:18.792 --> 00:53:19.750 align:middle line:90%
of the Correcting Time.

00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:22.700 align:middle line:84%
So the Correcting Time really,
in a sense, has three parts.

00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:24.370 align:middle line:84%
There's the explicit
Teaching Mission,

00:53:24.370 --> 00:53:26.200 align:middle line:84%
the explicit
Magisterial Mission,

00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:28.480 align:middle line:84%
and then there's the
angelic influence

00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:32.910 align:middle line:84%
being tuned up on all
leaders throughout the world,

00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:34.320 align:middle line:90%
on all of us.

00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:35.150 align:middle line:90%
They're tuning up.

00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:38.240 align:middle line:84%
They're actually planting,
all the time, ideas.

00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And take somebody like Gorbachev
is a good example of somebody

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:44.550 align:middle line:84%
who just got this idea,
well, we have to reform.

00:53:44.550 --> 00:53:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's said that he
had angelic appearances,

00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:50.790 align:middle line:84%
and there's a whole
story about this.

00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:54.400 align:middle line:84%
That he was told to do
this by higher forces.

00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And that sort of thing is
what-- and the Correcting Time

00:53:57.380 --> 00:53:59.980 align:middle line:90%
begins when Russia falls.

00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:01.060 align:middle line:90%
When USSR falls.

00:54:01.060 --> 00:54:03.050 align:middle line:84%
That's the beginning
of the Correcting Time.

00:54:03.050 --> 00:54:05.550 align:middle line:90%
So this is a clearing out.

00:54:05.550 --> 00:54:09.630 align:middle line:84%
But there's an
interventionist aspect

00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:12.780 align:middle line:84%
of this, where these
beings announce themselves,

00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:14.880 align:middle line:84%
and they are transmitting
ideas, and they're

00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:17.210 align:middle line:90%
getting ready to incarnate.

00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is much more
preponderant than the power

00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:24.750 align:middle line:84%
of the Illuminati,
which is reducing,

00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:29.860 align:middle line:84%
because the universe-- sort of
the good guys of the universe

00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:34.320 align:middle line:84%
are swarming planet Earth,
so that once and for all,

00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:38.880 align:middle line:84%
this blight can be
overcome through grace,

00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:40.420 align:middle line:90%
through this blessing.

00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And this is where, in our
case, we need a compensation.

00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Because particularly after 9/11,
we were way on the defense.

00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:50.150 align:middle line:84%
We, the good guys,
were on the defensive.

00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Because 9/11 gave them
all the money and power

00:54:52.810 --> 00:54:55.380 align:middle line:84%
they needed for
the war on terror.

00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And so this is when
the signal went up.

00:54:58.370 --> 00:55:00.120 align:middle line:90%
We need even more intervention.

00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Because Illuminati could, for a
time, for a couple generations,

00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:08.390 align:middle line:84%
could really run
this world and throw

00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:12.800 align:middle line:84%
in transhumanist
technologies, mind control,

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:15.426 align:middle line:90%
you name it, biotechnology to--

00:55:15.426 --> 00:55:17.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
the entire population

00:55:17.050 --> 00:55:19.680 align:middle line:84%
was in a trance from
the trauma of it all.

00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:22.322 align:middle line:84%
That's a very good time to
start implanting new messages.

00:55:22.322 --> 00:55:23.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: Yeah.

00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:25.230 align:middle line:84%
So in the fear-- and
this is what they do.

00:55:25.230 --> 00:55:27.940 align:middle line:84%
They foment conflict,
and in the middle

00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:31.550 align:middle line:84%
of the shock of this, the
Shock Doctrine, if you will,

00:55:31.550 --> 00:55:35.070 align:middle line:84%
that's when they put their
backward-- their regressive

00:55:35.070 --> 00:55:38.410 align:middle line:84%
notions of unfettered
capitalism,

00:55:38.410 --> 00:55:40.940 align:middle line:90%
of dictatorships of some kind.

00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:43.690 align:middle line:84%
So they shock us
into submission.

00:55:43.690 --> 00:55:48.830 align:middle line:84%
But the blessing blesses
us into empowerment.

00:55:48.830 --> 00:55:51.470 align:middle line:90%
So you've got these two forces.

00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And right now, it
looks like they're not

00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:55.380 align:middle line:90%
sure who is going to win.

00:55:55.380 --> 00:56:01.547 align:middle line:84%
Because the blessing is not
intrusive like the dark side.

00:56:01.547 --> 00:56:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The control, the
explicit control, yeah.

00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: It
violates old laws,

00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:08.650 align:middle line:84%
universe laws, free will,
mind control, all the stuff,

00:56:08.650 --> 00:56:11.860 align:middle line:84%
satanic cult. I mean, that
stuff is all manip-- so it looks

00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:14.580 align:middle line:84%
like you can't win, because
they have all the tools and all

00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:15.690 align:middle line:90%
the money.

00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:18.050 align:middle line:84%
So this is being
shown to the universe.

00:56:18.050 --> 00:56:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And we're told in
recent transmissions,

00:56:21.110 --> 00:56:24.340 align:middle line:84%
planets all over the
universe and higher worlds

00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:28.570 align:middle line:84%
are watching Earth to see
how this drama plays out.

00:56:28.570 --> 00:56:33.380 align:middle line:84%
Because there rarely is a
place like planet Earth, where

00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:36.402 align:middle line:84%
the first intervention's
completely defaulted.

00:56:36.402 --> 00:56:37.860 align:middle line:84%
Where the things
that were supposed

00:56:37.860 --> 00:56:40.490 align:middle line:84%
to happen for building of
the arts of civilization

00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:45.770 align:middle line:84%
and for the genetic pool, those
things were lost and diluted.

00:56:45.770 --> 00:56:48.630 align:middle line:84%
So then you just basically--
you're winging it.

00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:52.980 align:middle line:84%
So that's why these blessings--
and so the final big blessing,

00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:58.680 align:middle line:84%
and what I call the third
blessing, is just ramping up.

00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why
I feel it's a gift

00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:03.800 align:middle line:84%
to be here to talk about
"The Urantia Book," which

00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:06.440 align:middle line:84%
is the underlying text, but
it's not the whole story

00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:07.410 align:middle line:90%
in "The Urantia Book."

00:57:07.410 --> 00:57:10.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it sounds like,
with these three blessings,

00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:13.330 align:middle line:84%
that is a return to what
many call the Golden Age,

00:57:13.330 --> 00:57:15.830 align:middle line:84%
although, we can't expect this
is going to happen overnight.

00:57:15.830 --> 00:57:19.150 align:middle line:84%
Over time, a return to what
was called the Golden Age.

00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:23.640 align:middle line:84%
What was-- a return to what we
could call the Garden of Eden

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:27.450 align:middle line:84%
or the garden of Atlantis
in its highest culture,

00:57:27.450 --> 00:57:31.010 align:middle line:84%
before, as you say, the
intermingling of not just

00:57:31.010 --> 00:57:32.680 align:middle line:90%
blood, but of agendas.

00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:35.127 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: Well, it's
just like Joni Mitchell

00:57:35.127 --> 00:57:37.210 align:middle line:84%
singing about we've got
to get back to the garden.

00:57:37.210 --> 00:57:38.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We've gotta
get back to the garden.

00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:41.096 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: And this is what
the hippies were dreaming of,

00:57:41.096 --> 00:57:42.472 align:middle line:84%
getting back to
this Eden utopia.

00:57:42.472 --> 00:57:44.096 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to be
on a much higher--

00:57:44.096 --> 00:57:45.340 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be planet-wide.

00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:47.715 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So people that want
to go start exploring this,

00:57:47.715 --> 00:57:51.190 align:middle line:84%
you say a lot of the
evidence is, physically,

00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:53.176 align:middle line:90%
off the coast of Cyprus.

00:57:53.176 --> 00:57:54.300 align:middle line:90%
That's where some of it is.

00:57:54.300 --> 00:57:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And then in other
lure, it's still also

00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:59.260 align:middle line:84%
further out to the west,
out into the Atlantic.

00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:02.455 align:middle line:84%
And it may be all of
the above are true.

00:58:02.455 --> 00:58:04.705 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk just a little
bit about that archaeology?

00:58:04.705 --> 00:58:09.530 align:middle line:84%
We got into the
humanistic element of it.

00:58:09.530 --> 00:58:12.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: Our group put
together two expeditions

00:58:12.740 --> 00:58:15.280 align:middle line:84%
to the site, which
is underwater now.

00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:17.240 align:middle line:10%
So this is the
land, the peninsula

00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:19.950 align:middle line:10%
that joins Syria to Cyprus.

00:58:19.950 --> 00:58:22.990 align:middle line:10%
And we now know from
research that-- and this is

00:58:22.990 --> 00:58:26.040 align:middle line:10%
academic research-- that
this is a sunken continent.

00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:29.040 align:middle line:10%
It's a small continent
that sunk one mile down.

00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:30.610 align:middle line:84%
So if "The Urantia
Book" is right,

00:58:30.610 --> 00:58:33.860 align:middle line:84%
there should be artifacts
and walls down there, even

00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:37.360 align:middle line:84%
though it's a lot
of silt. I think

00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:40.800 align:middle line:84%
they said 10 miles
of silt above it.

00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:42.300 align:middle line:84%
So you're not going
to see too much.

00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:45.280 align:middle line:84%
So you need to have special
digital devices that

00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:51.480 align:middle line:84%
are called side scan sonars
and sub-bottom profilers.

00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And these are new things
used in oil exploration.

00:58:54.720 --> 00:59:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And we found artifacts that
can't possibly be explained.

00:59:00.770 --> 00:59:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And this was covered all over
the world in 2004, 2005, 2006.

00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:07.380 align:middle line:84%
That what looks like
a wall that's straight

00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:10.720 align:middle line:84%
that goes a mile
and a half is there

00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:16.730 align:middle line:84%
next to this Temple Mount,
we call it, Acropolis Hill,

00:59:16.730 --> 00:59:18.310 align:middle line:90%
as Plato called it.

00:59:18.310 --> 00:59:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's impossible to be
anything but a human formation.

00:59:21.390 --> 00:59:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's one mile down, and
this is where "The Urantia

00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:24.800 align:middle line:90%
Book" said it would be.

00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:28.142 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there, exactly
where it said it would be,

00:59:28.142 --> 00:59:29.830 align:middle line:90%
would be this wall.

00:59:29.830 --> 00:59:35.230 align:middle line:84%
But now we think that the wall
is not exactly this location,

00:59:35.230 --> 00:59:37.730 align:middle line:84%
but this is actually
a-- now, this

00:59:37.730 --> 00:59:39.500 align:middle line:90%
is not as glorious sounding.

00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:45.930 align:middle line:84%
We think this is a conduit of a
sewage conduit out of the city.

00:59:45.930 --> 00:59:48.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
read that. [LAUGHS]

00:59:48.010 --> 00:59:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: And because it says
there was a very long sewage--

00:59:52.180 --> 00:59:55.340 align:middle line:84%
covered sewage conduit
that went all the way out

00:59:55.340 --> 00:59:59.220 align:middle line:84%
toward Syria into the
river outside the walls

00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:01.319 align:middle line:90%
of Eden/Atlantis.

01:00:01.319 --> 01:00:03.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this was
through Solon's work

01:00:03.110 --> 01:00:06.210 align:middle line:84%
and the various clues that
were left behind by Plato.

01:00:06.210 --> 01:00:08.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: Plato-- no, this
now does not match Plato.

01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:09.810 align:middle line:90%
This matches Urantia.

01:00:09.810 --> 01:00:10.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Urantia, OK.

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: Urantia
said it had these roads.

01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:13.724 align:middle line:90%
It had these canals.

01:00:13.724 --> 01:00:15.640 align:middle line:84%
Plato said there were
canals, but Plato didn't

01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:18.110 align:middle line:90%
say there was a sewage canal.

01:00:18.110 --> 01:00:19.280 align:middle line:90%
But it's a canal.

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And so this thing
is so straight,

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:24.236 align:middle line:90%
and it turns at a right angle.

01:00:24.236 --> 01:00:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's where
"The Urantia Book"

01:00:25.610 --> 01:00:27.565 align:middle line:90%
said these things would be.

01:00:27.565 --> 01:00:28.649 align:middle line:90%
And so it fits--

01:00:28.649 --> 01:00:30.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there is some
sophisticated, ancient

01:00:30.690 --> 01:00:32.840 align:middle line:90%
civilization down there.

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:34.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS:
Something's down there.

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:34.530 align:middle line:90%
And--

01:00:34.530 --> 01:00:36.654 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We don't know if
we can call it Atlantis,

01:00:36.654 --> 01:00:39.530 align:middle line:84%
but maybe, from some of
those clues left behind.

01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:41.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: It's logical to
associate it with the Urantia

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:45.150 align:middle line:84%
version, since that's where they
said it-- so they call it Eden.

01:00:45.150 --> 01:00:48.640 align:middle line:84%
So let's just call it Garden
of Eden, which was abandoned,

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:50.760 align:middle line:90%
because of the war they had.

01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:55.076 align:middle line:84%
But these artifacts had been
constructed for over a period

01:00:55.076 --> 01:00:56.350 align:middle line:90%
of hundreds of years.

01:00:56.350 --> 01:00:58.200 align:middle line:90%
So they're pretty elaborate.

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:00.650 align:middle line:84%
So if we could get a
submarine down there,

01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:03.650 align:middle line:84%
then we'll have the
oldest archaeological site

01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:06.140 align:middle line:90%
in the world will be excavated.

01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:08.140 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it will
be underwater.

01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And so this is what we're saying
is the archaeological evidence.

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:13.135 align:middle line:84%
There's one other
item, if we have time.

01:01:13.135 --> 01:01:14.325 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's go ahead.

01:01:14.325 --> 01:01:17.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: Adam and Eve
were injecting their DNA

01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:19.240 align:middle line:90%
into the gene pool.

01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:22.640 align:middle line:84%
It is now known that there
was an upgrade, significant

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:28.380 align:middle line:84%
upgrade, in brain
genetics 37,000 years ago,

01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:31.390 align:middle line:84%
and this is called the
microcephalin gene.

01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:34.710 align:middle line:84%
This was discovered by
very advanced geneticists

01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:36.850 align:middle line:90%
at the University of Chicago.

01:01:36.850 --> 01:01:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And it was very--
almost scandalous,

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:44.890 align:middle line:84%
because it said that certain
groups got this gene and others

01:01:44.890 --> 01:01:45.950 align:middle line:90%
didn't.

01:01:45.950 --> 01:01:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And we know from
"The Urantia Book"

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:51.860 align:middle line:84%
that these Andites that I
mentioned, who had this gene,

01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:54.720 align:middle line:84%
went throughout the
world and intermarried.

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:56.750 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't get
into certain locations.

01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:59.840 align:middle line:84%
So this research was shut
down at University of Chicago.

01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:01.340 align:middle line:84%
But it was definitive,
and it showed

01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:04.530 align:middle line:84%
that the source of this
gene, the single gene which

01:02:04.530 --> 01:02:07.430 align:middle line:84%
causes the brain
to get bigger, is

01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:13.450 align:middle line:84%
a single source, a single
person, 37,000 years ago

01:02:13.450 --> 01:02:16.050 align:middle line:90%
in Mesopotamia.

01:02:16.050 --> 01:02:19.660 align:middle line:84%
So this correlates
perfectly with Adam and Eve.

01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:21.620 align:middle line:84%
Actually, a couple
rather than one person.

01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:23.500 align:middle line:90%
So statistically, it's the same.

01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:27.270 align:middle line:84%
So this is a source-- this
is an objective scientific

01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:29.590 align:middle line:84%
corroboration of a
genetic enhancement that

01:02:29.590 --> 01:02:33.460 align:middle line:84%
was significant for
improved cognition.

01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:36.120 align:middle line:84%
So we have two pieces
of scientific evidence.

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:39.959 align:middle line:84%
And this is why the History
Channel picked this up.

01:02:39.959 --> 01:02:42.250 align:middle line:84%
Because you need to have
something other than channeled

01:02:42.250 --> 01:02:42.924 align:middle line:90%
works.

01:02:42.924 --> 01:02:43.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, you do.

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:46.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is the convergence
of the two right now,

01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:47.900 align:middle line:90%
and I go with both.

01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:50.360 align:middle line:84%
Bring it all in and let
everybody make their own minds

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:51.500 align:middle line:90%
up on this.

01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And as far as what
you're talking

01:02:52.910 --> 01:02:55.820 align:middle line:84%
about in this upgrade to the
brain and all of the Urantia

01:02:55.820 --> 01:02:59.180 align:middle line:84%
work around the various races
and genetics and so forth,

01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:03.280 align:middle line:84%
I think we have to mature a
little bit, both emotionally

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:06.690 align:middle line:84%
and politically, before most
people can really start delving

01:03:06.690 --> 01:03:08.759 align:middle line:90%
in and embracing this work.

01:03:08.759 --> 01:03:10.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: It gets-- because--

01:03:10.050 --> 01:03:12.008 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It becomes
judgemental at face value,

01:03:12.008 --> 01:03:14.352 align:middle line:84%
but there is no
judgment in any of it.

01:03:14.352 --> 01:03:16.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: We're not-- that's
a really good point, Regina.

01:03:16.810 --> 01:03:18.610 align:middle line:84%
Because we're not
really-- I mean,

01:03:18.610 --> 01:03:21.020 align:middle line:84%
the Urantia thing itself
has been basically shut out

01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:23.090 align:middle line:90%
of the media, for example.

01:03:23.090 --> 01:03:25.560 align:middle line:84%
Because either people
emotionally can't handle this--

01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:26.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not
politically correct.

01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:27.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: --or it's
not politically correct,

01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:29.730 align:middle line:84%
or the Illuminati are
acting to shut it down.

01:03:29.730 --> 01:03:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And we know that we
were under surveillance

01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:36.020 align:middle line:84%
when we did the expeditions,
and that's a whole nother story.

01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:40.640 align:middle line:84%
So we have to be gentle
with putting this--

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:42.160 align:middle line:90%
and not dogmatic.

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:43.370 align:middle line:90%
And I try not to be.

01:03:43.370 --> 01:03:45.630 align:middle line:84%
I get passionate
and fervent, but we

01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:49.310 align:middle line:84%
have to allow that we may be
wrong, because there's so much

01:03:49.310 --> 01:03:51.390 align:middle line:90%
inconsistency in these stories.

01:03:51.390 --> 01:03:52.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
why again, I see

01:03:52.890 --> 01:03:55.760 align:middle line:84%
it as a-- doing my
interviews, I see

01:03:55.760 --> 01:04:00.430 align:middle line:84%
is essentially creating a
mosaic of various reflections,

01:04:00.430 --> 01:04:05.270 align:middle line:84%
both scientifically and divinely
inspired or however inspired,

01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:07.510 align:middle line:84%
so that people can
start connecting

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:08.640 align:middle line:90%
the dots for themselves.

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:11.197 align:middle line:84%
And you've added a
really big piece to that.

01:04:11.197 --> 01:04:13.780 align:middle line:10%
>>BELITSOS: The researchers out
there that are younger than us

01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:15.415 align:middle line:10%
who will, in the
next generation--

01:04:15.415 --> 01:04:16.290 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

01:04:16.290 --> 01:04:16.990 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
stumble on great stuff.

01:04:16.990 --> 01:04:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: --and they're
going to-- this stuff

01:04:18.010 --> 01:04:18.850 align:middle line:84%
that we're putting
out there, they're

01:04:18.850 --> 01:04:20.540 align:middle line:84%
going to connect the
dots, and they're

01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:22.940 align:middle line:84%
going to call it something
other than ancient astronauts.

01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:23.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

01:04:23.690 --> 01:04:26.960 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And that's the
point, to pass it on.

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:28.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've been
all over the map,

01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:31.477 align:middle line:90%
literally, in this conversation.

01:04:31.477 --> 01:04:32.810 align:middle line:90%
And I want to thank you so much.

01:04:32.810 --> 01:04:34.415 align:middle line:90%
Once again, very intriguing.

01:04:34.415 --> 01:04:36.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: It's been
great to be here.

01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:37.123 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Regina.

01:04:37.123 --> 01:04:38.267 align:middle line:90%
What a pleasure.

01:04:38.267 --> 01:04:40.350 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: To learn more
about the ancient accounts

01:04:40.350 --> 01:04:43.510 align:middle line:10%
of Eden/Atlantis, you can
find the book the "Discovery

01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:46.930 align:middle line:10%
of Atlantis; the Startling
Case for the Island of Cyprus"

01:04:46.930 --> 01:04:51.780 align:middle line:10%
through any major bookseller
and through evolving-souls.org.

01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:55.530 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
