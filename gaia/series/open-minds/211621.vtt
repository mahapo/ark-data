00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.420 align:middle line:84%
>>THERESA CHEUNG: The
fact that you dream shows

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.695 align:middle line:90%
that you are a psychic being.

00:00:12.695 --> 00:00:13.695 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:16.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Even if the dream is
just nonsense or nightmarish,

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm just so happy
because I think,

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.940 align:middle line:90%
I haven't given up on me.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.820 align:middle line:84%
Keep a dream journal,
please, everyone.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.800 align:middle line:84%
It really is the
most sensational book

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.600 align:middle line:90%
you will ever read.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's pretty amazing.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.415 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: You can
influence your unconscious.

00:00:29.415 --> 00:00:33.040 align:middle line:84%
You are influencing what
you believe about yourself.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.290 align:middle line:84%
We're all so interesting,
every person,

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.200 align:middle line:84%
and dreamwork
reminds them, there's

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.570 align:middle line:90%
so much that lies beneath.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.000 align:middle line:84%
It's being shown that
time and time again,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.830 align:middle line:84%
the dreaming mind
just seems to sense

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.310 align:middle line:90%
what's coming in the future.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.430 align:middle line:84%
But it's not
necessarily an event.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.690 align:middle line:90%
It's an emotion.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.950 align:middle line:84%
People who are observed when
doing a task perform better.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.115 align:middle line:84%
You are being observed all the
time by your future memory.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One of the silver
linings of the pandemic

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.830 align:middle line:84%
is that people were cloistered
at home sleeping longer hours.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.560 align:middle line:84%
As a result, dream
research exploded.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.120 align:middle line:84%
People were having
powerful dreams

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.130 align:middle line:84%
and remembering them
because they didn't have

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.660 align:middle line:90%
to be at work the next morning.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.390 align:middle line:10%
One person that became really
hot in demand at that time

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.520 align:middle line:10%
was Theresa Cheung,
author of countless books

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.140 align:middle line:10%
on dreams and intuition.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.870 align:middle line:10%
We're going to talk
about both today.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Hello, Regina.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:25.828 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Welcome back.

00:01:25.828 --> 00:01:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned the pandemic
when I was introducing you.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.440 align:middle line:84%
So you say that there
was an explosion of it.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.950 align:middle line:84%
Also, a kind of
dominant theme to dreams

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.350 align:middle line:84%
that was happening at
this time, as researchers

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.940 align:middle line:84%
were really taking
on dream time.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Yeah, it was
unprecedented for dream

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.280 align:middle line:90%
research.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Makes sense.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.070 align:middle line:90%
You don't have an alarm clock.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.400 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to hurry.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.430 align:middle line:84%
You have time to loll
and remember your dreams.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.475 align:middle line:90%
It makes perfect sense.

00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:49.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Absolutely.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.790 align:middle line:10%
And you're getting more REM,
rapid eye movement, sleep,

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.580 align:middle line:10%
which is the stage
most dream happens,

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.600 align:middle line:10%
and you've got slower mornings,
so you can mull over them.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And dreams, of course,
during the pandemic

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.808 align:middle line:84%
were doing what
they do best, which

00:01:59.808 --> 00:02:02.425 align:middle line:84%
is try to help make sense
of a crazy new situation

00:02:02.425 --> 00:02:03.675 align:middle line:90%
that we were all dealing with.

00:02:03.675 --> 00:02:05.925 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so, what was
the nature of those dreams?

00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:08.350 align:middle line:10%
>>CHEUNG: A lot of them
were unfinished tasks,

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.360 align:middle line:10%
feeling threatened.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.580 align:middle line:10%
That was a big, big theme.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.440 align:middle line:10%
But we've got to
remember also that this

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.960 align:middle line:10%
was a global event
where people were

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.030 align:middle line:10%
reporting dreaming globally.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And this has not
happened before.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, after a big event that
shook the world like 9/11,

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.420 align:middle line:90%
it was reported in America.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.460 align:middle line:84%
But this was the
first time globally,

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.440 align:middle line:84%
and you have to look at social
media playing a part in that.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And that people
were posting online.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And so COVID dreams,
lockdown dream phenomenon

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.420 align:middle line:84%
started to become key words
that people kept on typing in.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.410 align:middle line:90%
And it just exploded.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And then you got
Harvard University,

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.300 align:middle line:84%
"British Medical Journal"
publishing studies showing,

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.410 align:middle line:84%
yes, people are having these
really bizarre, vivid dreams.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And for me, forgive
the pun, I do

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.670 align:middle line:84%
love saying this-- it was a
dream come true because I've

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.660 align:middle line:84%
devoted my life to writing
about dreams, and trying to say,

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.780 align:middle line:90%
they are important.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:00.580 align:middle line:90%
They matter.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And all the research right now
is showing that sleep and dream

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.660 align:middle line:84%
researchers are showing
that dreams can really

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.340 align:middle line:84%
help you evolve, learn about
yourself, regulate your mood,

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.450 align:middle line:84%
be cathartic, and potentially,
also, be your inner psychic,

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:17.920 align:middle line:90%
sense the future.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.908 align:middle line:90%
And I'm kind of--

00:03:18.908 --> 00:03:20.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Your inner therapist?

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.210 align:middle line:84%
You save a little
money there, perhaps?

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.793 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: I think
it's the same thing.

00:03:23.793 --> 00:03:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And a therapist and a psychic,
they're interchangeable for me

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.170 align:middle line:84%
because they're both your
unconscious trying to help

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.340 align:middle line:90%
you understand yourself better.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what about the
notion of non-linear time?

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes,
people get tripped up

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.130 align:middle line:84%
over the timing and sequence
of things in dreams.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And you and I were
talking a month or so ago

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.270 align:middle line:84%
about the notion that if we
can truly accept that time

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.120 align:middle line:84%
itself is non-linear,
then dreams can

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.650 align:middle line:90%
take a new role in our lives.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.045 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Absolutely.

00:03:52.045 --> 00:03:54.880 align:middle line:84%
In the dream state, you
transcend time and space.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.120 align:middle line:90%
You step outside that.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And precognitive dreams
offer evidence of that.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.520 align:middle line:90%
You can travel anywhere.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.340 align:middle line:90%
Be any time.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.200 align:middle line:84%
There isn't any real concept
of time in a dream at all.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.310 align:middle line:90%
And yes, it's right.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.930 align:middle line:84%
At the moment, in
quantum physics,

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.160 align:middle line:84%
there's considerable debate
about the nature of time.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.160 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: What is it?

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And there is a school of thought
that past, present, and future

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.340 align:middle line:90%
are happening simultaneously--

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: --and
that our minds just

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.473 align:middle line:84%
have linear time because
that's the only way

00:04:20.473 --> 00:04:22.970 align:middle line:84%
we can make sense of
it in our human form.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.230 align:middle line:90%
I love this idea.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:25.610 align:middle line:90%
I absolutely love this idea.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And in the dream state,
you can connect to it.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.090 align:middle line:84%
A kind of a long self,
your long body over time

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.920 align:middle line:84%
that is you in all ages
and stages of your life,

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.190 align:middle line:84%
and if you believe in life
after death, if you believe

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.950 align:middle line:90%
in reincarnation, as well.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.350 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, this is
absolutely fascinating.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
dream state, you can

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.720 align:middle line:84%
tap into that, this
understanding of yourself

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.600 align:middle line:84%
as being bigger than
the here and now,

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.420 align:middle line:84%
and existing all
aspects of yourself.

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's in its infancy
at the moment, this research.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.723 align:middle line:84%
But it is stunning, and I'm so
excited to be championing it.

00:04:59.723 --> 00:05:01.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So with
precognitive dreaming,

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:07.030 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about that being
the holy grail for millennia.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.150 align:middle line:84%
Kings and queens hiring
dreamers and seers,

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.150 align:middle line:84%
bringing them into the court to
get a fix on what's coming up,

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.230 align:middle line:90%
what's going to happen.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Military leaders
looking at precognitive

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.690 align:middle line:84%
dreams to get an advantage
in a strategic war situation.

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.140 align:middle line:84%
So that's always kind
of been the holy grail

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.210 align:middle line:84%
of dreaming is the
precognitive portion of it.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.090 align:middle line:84%
So let's focus on
that for a little bit.

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.310 align:middle line:84%
Because off camera, when
you're having your makeup,

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.160 align:middle line:84%
you told us a funny
story about waking up,

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.040 align:middle line:84%
and you were ready to go
on ITV in England, right?

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.523 align:middle line:90%
And was it the morning show?

00:05:37.523 --> 00:05:38.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: It was, yes.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The morning
show, and you had a dream.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.727 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Well, I had
a dream that I was

00:05:41.727 --> 00:05:43.180 align:middle line:90%
being handed some pink daisies.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.587 align:middle line:84%
And I always tell people
that I do dreamwork with,

00:05:45.587 --> 00:05:47.170 align:middle line:84%
that you pay attention
to your dreams,

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.128 align:middle line:84%
because your dreams want
to be taken seriously.

00:05:49.128 --> 00:05:50.890 align:middle line:84%
So if a color appears
in your dream,

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.770 align:middle line:84%
wear that color the next day,
to show your dreaming mind

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.690 align:middle line:90%
that you're taking note.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.760 align:middle line:84%
So I decided-- because I
was going to wear green.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.920 align:middle line:84%
I was going to be
a vision in green.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.740 align:middle line:84%
But I decided, no,
I've had this dream.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.590 align:middle line:84%
It was very strong
pink theme there.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:05.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to wear pink.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.300 align:middle line:84%
So I went in, and did
the call in for the UK

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.490 align:middle line:84%
that I do where viewers call
into ITV "This Morning."

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.960 align:middle line:84%
It's one of their most loved
entertainment and news shows.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.850 align:middle line:84%
It runs five days a
week in the morning.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And I've been their regular
dream expert for a while now.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.150 align:middle line:84%
So I went in, in hot pink,
which is not really, really me.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And it was amazing because
they decided that day

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.690 align:middle line:90%
to trail the Barbie movie.

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:28.925 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:06:28.925 --> 00:06:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
had a Barbie--

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: I had a Barbie box.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you got to
pose in the Barbie box.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:36.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is all
perfectly in your pink.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.630 align:middle line:90%
This is really cute.

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: It made me so
happy because in my dream

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:43.020 align:middle line:84%
is what I was being given
pink daisies by a child.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And Barbie, it's all about
nostalgia, childhood.

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:48.750 align:middle line:84%
A lot of children
played with Barbie.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:49.890 align:middle line:90%
And I got the experience.

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.932 align:middle line:84%
I said to the producer,
can I just go in the box?

00:06:51.932 --> 00:06:53.820 align:middle line:84%
So I just went in the
box because they had it

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.370 align:middle line:84%
there in preparation for the
movie, and I went inside.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:57.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you got
to be the Barbie doll.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:58.340 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: I did.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.880 align:middle line:90%
I got a dream come true.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.380 align:middle line:84%
Now you could say that's all
very trivial and nonsense,

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.690 align:middle line:90%
and what's the point of that?

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.820 align:middle line:84%
But what it is, it's
just a wake-up call

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.950 align:middle line:84%
that your dreaming mind
knows things, right?

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:11.950 align:middle line:90%
And it's a power point--

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:13.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Beyond
time and space, yeah.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.282 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Yeah, and it's
a kind of a power point.

00:07:15.282 --> 00:07:16.750 align:middle line:84%
It's just saying,
Theresa, there's

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.370 align:middle line:84%
something I know that
you need to know.

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And this is an important
moment for you.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.618 align:middle line:84%
It's also a moment of self-care
and to do something that's fun.

00:07:24.618 --> 00:07:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes, in my work,
it can get very, very serious.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.690 align:middle line:84%
I work with a lot of
people who are not

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:30.910 align:middle line:84%
dealing with their nightmares
and their shadow side.

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was just a moment
of laughter and pure joy,

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.560 align:middle line:84%
and the reaction I
got because of it.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And it was because
I followed my dream.

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And I tell people, follow
your dream-- within reason.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.748 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes,
dreams are insane,

00:07:42.748 --> 00:07:45.040 align:middle line:84%
and that's where we need to
talk about how to interpret

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.050 align:middle line:84%
your dreams, which again,
I've devoted my life

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:47.985 align:middle line:90%
to helping people understand.

00:07:47.985 --> 00:07:48.785 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You have.

00:07:48.785 --> 00:07:50.560 align:middle line:84%
How many books have
you written on dreams?

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: I'm a serial--

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Dozens.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.620 align:middle line:84%
You're a serial
writer, goodness.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: I've got two more
coming out next year, as well.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:56.260 align:middle line:90%
I feel blessed.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I just
want to go ahead and stay

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.150 align:middle line:84%
on the subject for one
moment, more about color.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:02.080 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.082 align:middle line:84%
When people do their
vision boards or whatever,

00:08:04.082 --> 00:08:06.040 align:middle line:84%
if you're doing it in a
way where you're really

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.650 align:middle line:84%
tapping into the
unconscious, then you'll

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:11.050 align:middle line:84%
find, oftentimes, if
you've done a board,

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:14.650 align:middle line:84%
that it'll pop up in any
given year with a color theme.

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:16.570 align:middle line:90%
Same thing in dreams can happen.

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:19.090 align:middle line:84%
Because that frequency
is-- usually,

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:22.090 align:middle line:84%
some frequency, that
color frequency band

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:24.520 align:middle line:84%
is something needed
by your being

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.290 align:middle line:90%
for healing on some level.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And like you said,
you needed to bring it

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.718 align:middle line:84%
out this childlike
playful side of yourself.

00:08:30.718 --> 00:08:33.010 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't have been wearing
a better color than pink

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:34.059 align:middle line:90%
for that to do that show.

00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:35.559 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: It was
what it was saying.

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:37.429 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You didn't know it was
going to be in that background.

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:38.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Yeah, you're
absolutely right.

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And I always say, when
a color appears strongly

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:46.450 align:middle line:84%
in someone's dream, go research
all the spiritual associations

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:48.670 align:middle line:84%
with it, the mystical
associations,

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.770 align:middle line:84%
and see what it's
got to teach you.

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:54.610 align:middle line:84%
Because every single dream
has a message for you.

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:55.655 align:middle line:90%
Every single dream--

00:08:55.655 --> 00:08:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everything
is frequency, too.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:57.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yes.

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's all about that.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yes.

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a feeling,
or a tone of the way someone

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.670 align:middle line:84%
said something,
something or a color,

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:05.325 align:middle line:84%
it's all important
subtle information.

00:09:05.325 --> 00:09:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: And it
was interesting,

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.160 align:middle line:84%
you know, you were
drawing the conversation

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.328 align:middle line:84%
to precognitive dreaming,
which, back in time,

00:09:12.328 --> 00:09:13.870 align:middle line:84%
that was how dreams
were interpreted.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:15.820 align:middle line:84%
We've got "Joseph
and the Dreamcoat."

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And then dream interpretation
went through various stages.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.790 align:middle line:84%
It became more
psychological and self-help,

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:23.020 align:middle line:90%
which is where I'm still at.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:24.730 align:middle line:90%
A lot of my work is with that.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.520 align:middle line:84%
But what's happened now is
it's kind of swung back.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And there is a growing
body of research

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:33.730 align:middle line:84%
into precognitive dreaming,
research done by scientists.

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And they're beginning to show
that this is the norm, not

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:37.990 align:middle line:90%
the exception.

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:40.630 align:middle line:84%
That a lot of people
are having dreams

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:42.940 align:middle line:84%
that two or three days
later, they have a déjá vu--

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:46.630 align:middle line:84%
or it should be déjá révé,
which is a dream remembered.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's a stunning
moment when that happens.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:54.490 align:middle line:84%
Often, it is very trivial,
like my pink daisy dream.

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And you think,
what is the point?

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:58.780 align:middle line:84%
Why won't my dreaming mind
do something much more

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:00.890 align:middle line:90%
dramatic for me and helpful?

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:03.910 align:middle line:84%
But what it is, it's
just a moment for you

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:06.940 align:middle line:84%
to stop and reflect,
and understand

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.300 align:middle line:84%
that there's more to
you than meets the eye,

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:14.140 align:middle line:84%
that you are more than
your body and your mind.

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:15.787 align:middle line:90%
You are not your thoughts.

00:10:15.787 --> 00:10:16.870 align:middle line:90%
You are not your emotions.

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:20.200 align:middle line:84%
There's a part of you that
exists independent of that

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.210 align:middle line:90%
and sees the bigger picture.

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's just really a
beautiful goosebumpy moment.

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:28.210 align:middle line:90%
I love that term, goosebumps.

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:31.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So déjá vu
is simply something

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.278 align:middle line:84%
you have already dreamt and
experienced in dream time.

00:10:34.278 --> 00:10:35.320 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: It's déjá révé.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.362 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, déjá révé.

00:10:36.362 --> 00:10:38.470 align:middle line:84%
So you're just
remembering it as it's now

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:41.757 align:middle line:84%
playing out, timeline-wise, in
what appears to be the present.

00:10:41.757 --> 00:10:42.557 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yeah.

00:10:42.557 --> 00:10:43.357 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:43.357 --> 00:10:44.692 align:middle line:90%
And it's just a wow moment.

00:10:44.692 --> 00:10:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And we all need those wow
moments, because sometimes,

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:48.220 align:middle line:90%
life is tough.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And I know when I'm
going through rough times

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:54.280 align:middle line:84%
or things aren't working out,
and I wake up in the morning

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:57.880 align:middle line:84%
and I've got a dream on my
mind, I just feel so happy.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.460 align:middle line:84%
Even if the dream is just
nonsense or nightmarish,

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:03.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm just so happy,
because I think,

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:04.940 align:middle line:90%
I haven't given up on me.

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:06.290 align:middle line:90%
There's something there.

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:08.250 align:middle line:84%
My unconscious is
trying to talk to me.

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:13.250 align:middle line:84%
So I write it down, and it
gives me great sustenance

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:15.620 align:middle line:84%
during the day and in
the days that come.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.600 align:middle line:84%
Because I can go and
refer back, and say,

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.910 align:middle line:84%
what was my unconscious
trying to tell me?

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:21.860 align:middle line:90%
I have got my own back.

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.480 align:middle line:84%
There's something
I need to know.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And I will carry on
decoding and decoding it

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.120 align:middle line:84%
until I get that aha
moment of illumination.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.960 align:middle line:84%
But also, you've got to do your
dreams in a series, not just

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.070 align:middle line:90%
one dream.

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:37.370 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes, one dream is
just, I don't understand this.

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:38.630 align:middle line:90%
Tune in the following--

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:38.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah--

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:39.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: --night.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:39.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --right.

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Yeah, tune
in the following night

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:42.600 align:middle line:84%
for the next thrilling
installment of you.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [CHUCKLES]

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: And just keep on.

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:49.340 align:middle line:84%
Keep a dream journal,
please, everyone

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:50.930 align:middle line:90%
listening to this interview.

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:53.970 align:middle line:84%
It really is the
most sensational book

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:54.770 align:middle line:90%
you will ever read.

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:55.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
pretty amazing when

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:58.430 align:middle line:84%
you go back, especially years
later, and look at things

00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:59.510 align:middle line:90%
and think, oh, my God.

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:01.010 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes,
what it's showing

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:03.670 align:middle line:84%
you takes a long time to
play out in real life, too.

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:04.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: It does.

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:06.595 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then you see
what that was all about.

00:12:06.595 --> 00:12:08.842 align:middle line:84%
And not that you could have
changed it in the moment,

00:12:08.842 --> 00:12:10.800 align:middle line:84%
but it's very interesting
to see it was already

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.620 align:middle line:84%
in the works in that
moment, and may take time

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:16.063 align:middle line:90%
to manifest in our dimension.

00:12:16.063 --> 00:12:17.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: I mean, I
kept a dream journal

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.010 align:middle line:84%
since I was very young,
because I grew up

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:22.830 align:middle line:84%
in a family of traveling
spiritualists and dream

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:27.020 align:middle line:84%
decoding, and astrology was our
life, and psychic abilities,

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:27.820 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:31.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's something that was just
in me, keep a dream journal,

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.790 align:middle line:84%
because we talk
about our dreams.

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:33.690 align:middle line:90%
They matter.

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:35.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that's so wonderful

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:36.500 align:middle line:90%
to do it as a family practice.

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:37.300 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yes.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How fun would that be,
and how revealing as a family

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.110 align:middle line:90%
to each other?

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:43.735 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a great thing, as
soon as little kids can write,

00:12:43.735 --> 00:12:45.240 align:middle line:84%
to have them start
talking about it

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.650 align:middle line:84%
and write a few
little notes for them.

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Well, I found when my
kids were teenagers, as well--

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:51.170 align:middle line:84%
and you know teenagers,
they do distance themselves.

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And I could get very
intimate with them

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:57.975 align:middle line:84%
and have a wonderful connection
when I-- they would come to me

00:12:57.975 --> 00:12:59.100 align:middle line:90%
to talk about their dreams.

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.470 align:middle line:84%
Because that was a kind of
like a safe way for them,

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:02.680 align:middle line:90%
and we could talk.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.020 align:middle line:90%
I loved it.

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:07.506 align:middle line:84%
Their own life, they needed
to find out who they were.

00:13:07.506 --> 00:13:10.350 align:middle line:84%
They want a distance from mom,
of course, that's growing up.

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:13.210 align:middle line:84%
But it was wonderful, because
I would go for the dream talk.

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:16.470 align:middle line:84%
I am on a mission to get
everybody dream journaling,

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:20.560 align:middle line:84%
to fall in love with themselves
through their dreaming mind.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.060 align:middle line:90%
And it does happen.

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:23.550 align:middle line:84%
I've seen people's
lives transform.

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:26.008 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting what you're
talking about skill practicing

00:13:26.008 --> 00:13:26.820 align:middle line:90%
in the dream state.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.782 align:middle line:84%
And also, it's threat
rehearsal, as well.

00:13:28.782 --> 00:13:30.240 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, people
say, well, why do

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.340 align:middle line:84%
I have so many anxious
dreams and nightmares?

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:34.830 align:middle line:84%
It's because you're
dreaming mind takes you

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:36.970 align:middle line:90%
to the worst-case scenario.

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:39.490 align:middle line:84%
So that you've
been there before.

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:40.290 align:middle line:90%
You've survived.

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:41.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Helping prepare you.

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:42.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Yeah, it's
threat rehearsal.

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:43.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But see,
a lot of people

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:44.772 align:middle line:84%
don't want to write
their dreams down

00:13:44.772 --> 00:13:46.650 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
want to bring back

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:49.590 align:middle line:84%
into view nightmares and
uncomfortable things.

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:51.240 align:middle line:90%
It's like, no, leave that alone.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.470 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of people
avoid it for that reason.

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:54.270 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yeah.

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:56.110 align:middle line:90%
But you have to face your fears.

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And this is shadow work
we're talking about here,

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.120 align:middle line:90%
which is very important.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.980 align:middle line:84%
Because if you
repress and deny what

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:04.050 align:middle line:84%
is disturbing and
troubling you, it's

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:06.950 align:middle line:84%
going to erupt in
some unhealthy way.

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:07.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:08.970 align:middle line:90%
I think it's a good idea.

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: And dreamwork
is a very safe way

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:15.720 align:middle line:84%
to explore your shadow
side, because it's a dream.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And you can't harm yourself
in the dream state.

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:18.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're not
going to hit the bottom

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:20.220 align:middle line:84%
and be dead at the
end of the dream.

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:21.630 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: You can write
down your nightmare,

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:23.755 align:middle line:84%
and then you can do this
wonderful technique called

00:14:23.755 --> 00:14:24.780 align:middle line:90%
rescripting nightmares.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And studies have been
done to show this works.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:29.500 align:middle line:84%
If you're having recurring
nightmares, for example,

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:33.600 align:middle line:84%
in the day, close your eyes,
re-enter that nightmare,

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.750 align:middle line:84%
visualize it, see it,
and then re-script it.

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:38.940 align:middle line:90%
Turn monsters into butterflies.

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:41.400 align:middle line:84%
And what you're
doing there is you're

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:44.940 align:middle line:84%
telling your unconscious,
look, hey, I'm in charge here.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a helpless victim.

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And when you can start
letting your unconscious know

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:51.810 align:middle line:84%
that you can shape
it, that's when

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:53.130 align:middle line:90%
the magic starts to happen.

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:55.710 align:middle line:84%
You start understanding that
you are the power of choice

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:56.550 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:58.170 align:middle line:90%
Things don't happen to you.

00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:00.150 align:middle line:90%
Nightmares don't happen to you.

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:01.720 align:middle line:90%
Life doesn't happen to you.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.790 align:middle line:84%
You do have a certain
ability to manage it,

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:08.990 align:middle line:84%
and it's exactly the
same with your dreams.

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:11.690 align:middle line:84%
If you can influence
your unconscious,

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:15.380 align:middle line:84%
you are influencing what
you believe about yourself.

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, this isn't
repressing or denying

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.850 align:middle line:84%
what's ugly and toxic,
because we all have that.

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:22.110 align:middle line:84%
It is day and night,
it's all in us.

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:24.080 align:middle line:90%
It is understanding it's there.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to
understand it, but I'm

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:29.380 align:middle line:84%
going to choose not to
indulge it in waking life.

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:31.130 align:middle line:84%
But if you can influence
your unconscious,

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:34.250 align:middle line:84%
you can influence your
beliefs about yourself.

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And as we all know,
what you believe

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:39.110 align:middle line:84%
about yourself is who
you are, and who you are

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:40.400 align:middle line:90%
is what you attract.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And dreamwork is one of the
most neglected manifesting tools

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:45.440 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:45.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Totally.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: It really is.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:49.950 align:middle line:84%
Because if you can start
understanding your dreams,

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:52.160 align:middle line:84%
looking at what your
unconscious is reflecting

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.500 align:middle line:84%
to you every night, you will
get a real understanding

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.870 align:middle line:84%
of why, perhaps, you
are not manifesting

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:58.040 align:middle line:90%
what you want in your life.

00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.665 align:middle line:84%
And you're doing all
your affirmations,

00:15:59.665 --> 00:16:03.560 align:middle line:84%
and you're meditating for hours,
but your dreams don't lie.

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:07.160 align:middle line:84%
They take you
right to the truth.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:11.850 align:middle line:84%
But they do it in this
very surreal, symbolic way.

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's where people fall
down, because they think,

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:16.167 align:middle line:90%
I just don't understand.

00:16:16.167 --> 00:16:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that's the thing, too.

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:21.620 align:middle line:84%
With symbolism, so much
of it is so individual.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And how do they learn the
keys to their own symbolism,

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:27.680 align:middle line:84%
versus going to a dream
book where a goose always

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.000 align:middle line:84%
means something, the
same thing for everybody.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.010 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't.

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:33.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: I've written
a dream dictionary,

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.000 align:middle line:84%
which I'm blessed
it's been in print--

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that
the "A to Z" book?

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yes.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:36.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:37.310 align:middle line:90%
It's a bible.

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:39.685 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: It's been reissued
again, and again, and again.

00:16:39.685 --> 00:16:43.077 align:middle line:84%
And I do there the
universal interpretation.

00:16:43.077 --> 00:16:44.660 align:middle line:84%
For example, a cross,
for most people,

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:45.800 align:middle line:90%
it's a symbol of religion.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.660 align:middle line:84%
I do the colors, I do the
numbers, I do as many animals

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:49.460 align:middle line:90%
as I can.

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:52.590 align:middle line:84%
Clothes, nudity, cheating,
all these really common dream

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:53.390 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:56.030 align:middle line:84%
Teeth falling out, hair
falling out, flying, falling,

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:57.920 align:middle line:90%
monsters, et cetera, apocalypse.

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.570 align:middle line:84%
I give the common
interpretation.

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:03.960 align:middle line:84%
But I always tell people,
the very first interpretation

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.680 align:middle line:84%
you go for is your
own gut instinct.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:06.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: You will know--

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:08.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
that symbol may

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.050 align:middle line:84%
be something positive
for one person,

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:11.790 align:middle line:84%
and a very fearful
negative for another.

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:12.359 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:14.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Go for your own
personal interpretation first.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.910 align:middle line:84%
If nothing comes through,
go for the first word.

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:19.530 align:middle line:90%
That's free association.

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:23.550 align:middle line:84%
Nothing comes through, then
move to all the symbolic,

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:25.410 align:middle line:84%
and universal,
and common things,

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:28.377 align:middle line:84%
and see what triggers
something in you.

00:17:28.377 --> 00:17:30.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: See your
emotional response to it.

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:32.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Something
will resonate.

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:35.160 align:middle line:84%
It will be your
emotional response.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.910 align:middle line:84%
Because the language
of dreams is emotion.

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:37.711 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:37.711 --> 00:17:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: So it will be your
emotional response, and then

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:41.940 align:middle line:90%
just work with that.

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And don't be in a rush
to have-- everybody

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:45.450 align:middle line:90%
wants instant solutions.

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:48.240 align:middle line:84%
Part of the joy of
life is the puzzle.

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.740 align:middle line:90%
We all want to solve ourselves.

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:51.310 align:middle line:90%
Find out who we are.

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:52.750 align:middle line:90%
But that's not why we're here.

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:56.460 align:middle line:84%
We're here to experience
all facets of ourselves

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:59.220 align:middle line:84%
in all these beautifully
complicated ways.

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:01.260 align:middle line:90%
We're all so interesting.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:06.690 align:middle line:84%
Every person is a story with
so many facets to themselves.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And dreamwork reminds them
that they are infinite.

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.330 align:middle line:90%
They're fascinating.

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:15.330 align:middle line:84%
There's so much
that lies beneath.

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:16.710 align:middle line:90%
Don't try and solve yourself.

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:18.300 align:middle line:90%
Just enjoy being an enigma.

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:19.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Enjoy the mystery.

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:21.330 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy not knowing.

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:23.220 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people want to know.

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:24.180 align:middle line:90%
They want certainty.

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, there is really
nothing that's certain.

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:28.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: It's the adventure.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:28.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:30.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: And I was doing
it actually on the plane,

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:32.340 align:middle line:84%
because I had a
lot of plane time.

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.200 align:middle line:84%
For you, anything,
because you-- by the way,

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.200 align:middle line:90%
thank you for having me.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm so overjoyed to be here.

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --going
through all that.

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:38.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: But I was
closing my eyes,

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:41.550 align:middle line:84%
and all these beautiful shapes
were forming behind my eyes,

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:44.008 align:middle line:84%
as they tend to do when it's
dark, and you close your eyes.

00:18:44.008 --> 00:18:46.358 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking, this
looks like a starry night.

00:18:46.358 --> 00:18:48.150 align:middle line:84%
When you close your
eyes, behind your eyes,

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:50.100 align:middle line:90%
it does little bits of light.

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And we all try to go to
outer space for adventure.

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:55.870 align:middle line:90%
People go to the moon.

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:57.547 align:middle line:90%
But it's that inner space--

00:18:57.547 --> 00:18:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what we're composed--

00:18:59.130 --> 00:18:59.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yes.

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:01.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --of,
those teensy sparks

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:03.760 align:middle line:90%
in the vast sea of openness.

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:04.560 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yeah.

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:05.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The void.

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:08.350 align:middle line:84%
Those tiny, tiny sparks
are our atomic reality.

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:09.150 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Exactly.

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:10.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's all we are.

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.557 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: And every
time you close

00:19:11.557 --> 00:19:16.240 align:middle line:84%
your eyes, behind your eyes, it
is where you should be seeking.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And if you do feel lost,
and life's difficult,

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.980 align:middle line:84%
please remember, you have
to be lost before you

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:23.300 align:middle line:90%
can start finding your way.

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:25.180 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing wrong
with being lost.

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:28.150 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's often, when you're
lost, out of your comfort zone,

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:30.520 align:middle line:84%
going through pain
and trauma, that's

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.130 align:middle line:84%
when the learning and
the wisdom happens.

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And you start valuing what
really matters in your life.

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And it is so sad that
these days, so many people

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:43.060 align:middle line:90%
have externalized everything.

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:45.640 align:middle line:84%
That their happiness comes
from their career, how

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.742 align:middle line:84%
they look, how popular
they are, the mark

00:19:48.742 --> 00:19:49.700 align:middle line:90%
they make on the world.

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:50.617 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's important.

00:19:50.617 --> 00:19:55.360 align:middle line:84%
We're here on this Earth to
learn through human experience.

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.090 align:middle line:84%
But what's missing
is the balance.

00:19:58.090 --> 00:19:59.088 align:middle line:90%
You need both.

00:19:59.088 --> 00:20:00.880 align:middle line:84%
You need the material
lessons, but you also

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.520 align:middle line:84%
need the intuitive, and the
creative, and the dreamy.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.115 align:middle line:84%
And that's where dreamwork is
such an instantly accessible

00:20:06.115 --> 00:20:07.240 align:middle line:90%
way to bring that balance--

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:07.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree--

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: --back into your life.

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:09.985 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --but it's
been totally invalidated

00:20:09.985 --> 00:20:13.120 align:middle line:84%
by academia and the rest of
the world now for, what, 200,

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.510 align:middle line:90%
300 years.

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:17.680 align:middle line:84%
So people have to start
reclaiming it, and just saying,

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:21.330 align:middle line:84%
look, I don't have to cave to
what is considered societally

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:22.290 align:middle line:90%
acceptable anymore.

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:24.658 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately, we're
in an era now where

00:20:24.658 --> 00:20:25.950 align:middle line:90%
it's getting better and better.

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:28.357 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people, if
you even 10 years ago,

00:20:28.357 --> 00:20:30.690 align:middle line:84%
20 years ago, if you went to
your family in the morning,

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:32.340 align:middle line:84%
oh, I just had
this amazing dream.

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:34.330 align:middle line:84%
It's like, ugh,
there she goes again.

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:34.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Oh.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.070 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] It's not
happening anymore.

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:37.153 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not your family.

00:20:37.153 --> 00:20:38.170 align:middle line:90%
Not happening anymore.

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:40.590 align:middle line:84%
So you say that all
psychic phenomena

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:42.540 align:middle line:90%
is a form of precognition?

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.427 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: There is a
school of thought that's

00:20:44.427 --> 00:20:45.510 align:middle line:90%
heading in that direction.

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And actually, it's the
term that scientists

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:50.250 align:middle line:84%
use when they are
researching psychic ability.

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:53.250 align:middle line:84%
It tends to be sort
of an umbrella term.

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:55.770 align:middle line:84%
Yes, precognition
is where the future

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:59.790 align:middle line:84%
of scientific research into
psychic abilities is going.

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:02.220 align:middle line:84%
It's the most easy
to prove, as well.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:04.410 align:middle line:10%
Somebody can keep
a dream journal,

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:06.340 align:middle line:10%
or have a waking
hunch, because that's

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:08.340 align:middle line:10%
the same-- that's kind
of the daydreaming state,

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:09.580 align:middle line:10%
and it plays out.

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:12.150 align:middle line:90%
So you've got instant proof.

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:13.020 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:15.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's the easiest to
test scientifically.

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And what's exciting,
when it is being tested,

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.870 align:middle line:84%
it's being shown that
time and time again,

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:23.730 align:middle line:84%
the dreaming mind
just seems to sense

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:25.210 align:middle line:90%
what's coming in the future.

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:27.660 align:middle line:84%
But it's not
necessarily an event

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:28.980 align:middle line:90%
that the dreaming mind sense.

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:31.530 align:middle line:84%
It's an emotion,
as you were saying.

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:32.760 align:middle line:90%
It's a mindset.

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:33.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: And it's offering
you potential futures.

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:38.400 align:middle line:84%
So what you're
dreaming mind will do

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.550 align:middle line:84%
is it will showcase,
in my humble opinion,

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:43.470 align:middle line:90%
potential futures.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And this is wonderful,
because if you wake up and you

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:50.520 align:middle line:84%
don't like the
future it showcased,

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:53.170 align:middle line:84%
your dreaming mind is-- again,
your best friend is saying,

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:55.200 align:middle line:84%
look, right now, in the
here and now, you can--

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:55.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is what you're--

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:55.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: --change that.

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:57.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --signing

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:57.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Change it.

00:21:57.690 --> 00:21:58.650 align:middle line:90%
Course correct.

00:21:58.650 --> 00:21:58.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:59.310 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:00.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Again,
you're not a victim.

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:02.370 align:middle line:84%
Your dreaming mind
will showcase,

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:03.870 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, look,
if you continue

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:06.510 align:middle line:84%
acting and thinking and feeling
the way you are right now,

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:09.930 align:middle line:84%
this may be where you're
heading emotionally.

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:13.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Again, the dreaming
mind is so mysterious.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.868 align:middle line:84%
Occasionally, dreams
can be literal, too.

00:22:15.868 --> 00:22:16.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, they can.

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:20.440 align:middle line:84%
So the whole notion
that you can be awake--

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.690 align:middle line:84%
kind of awake-- go
into a meditation

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:24.670 align:middle line:84%
where you're not
asleep, but you also

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:27.790 align:middle line:84%
have these similar experiences
of precognition of events

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:28.930 align:middle line:90%
that are going to form.

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:33.040 align:middle line:84%
First of all, for your
average person that's

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:36.520 align:middle line:84%
relatively intuitive, just
dropping into an alpha

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:40.570 align:middle line:84%
or delta state is sufficient
to have the equivalent of dream

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:41.375 align:middle line:90%
time function?

00:22:41.375 --> 00:22:43.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Yeah, daydreaming
is just another day to dream.

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And people who are
struggling with dream recall.

00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot of people,
sometimes, for medical reasons,

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:51.400 align:middle line:84%
or because their life
is incredibly stressful,

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:54.640 align:middle line:90%
dream recall takes a back seat.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And then, I always
say, day dream

00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:01.370 align:middle line:90%
is just another way to dream.

00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:02.590 align:middle line:90%
It's exactly the same.

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:04.960 align:middle line:90%
You're just more conscious.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And some
of it is almost--

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.200 align:middle line:84%
then it slips over
the line almost

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.990 align:middle line:84%
into, I guess you could say,
a type of remote viewing,

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:12.610 align:middle line:90%
or a type of future viewing.

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: And the way
to start triggering that

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:17.440 align:middle line:84%
is to simply start taking
your dreams seriously.

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:18.590 align:middle line:90%
Write them down.

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:19.705 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be a
running theme for me.

00:23:19.705 --> 00:23:20.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, you've said that.

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:20.980 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yeah.

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:21.340 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:22.673 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You've mentioned that.

00:23:22.673 --> 00:23:26.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Read lots, get
curious, spend time in nature,

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:31.180 align:middle line:84%
listen to music that
inspires dream so much.

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:33.418 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're
listening to music,

00:23:33.418 --> 00:23:34.960 align:middle line:84%
there's one part of
your brain that's

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.370 align:middle line:90%
making sense of the notes.

00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:38.320 align:middle line:84%
That's the ego,
the consciousness.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And the other part of your
brain is free to daydream.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, it occupies it.

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:44.485 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: You get the
two walking in harmony.

00:23:44.485 --> 00:23:45.285 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:45.285 --> 00:23:46.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: And that
actually is what

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.250 align:middle line:90%
research is starting to show.

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:51.550 align:middle line:84%
Because there are studies to
show that anxiety and stress

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:55.030 align:middle line:84%
are the biggest enemy of
any kind of psychic ability.

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:56.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:58.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: And so what you
need to do is first of all,

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:02.140 align:middle line:84%
be calm, and also
believe in yourself.

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And get that balance,
again, between the material

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:06.070 align:middle line:90%
and the intuitive.

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:07.778 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I was going to say.

00:24:07.778 --> 00:24:09.280 align:middle line:90%
That belief alone is huge.

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:11.657 align:middle line:84%
Understanding you're
perfectly capable of this.

00:24:11.657 --> 00:24:12.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yeah, of course.

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:13.540 align:middle line:90%
Everybody.

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:15.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Everybody is capable.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.903 align:middle line:84%
Because I used to be surprised
where I'd go into those states

00:24:17.903 --> 00:24:20.570 align:middle line:84%
when I was out in the field here
and there, how accurate it was.

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:22.280 align:middle line:84%
Like boom, boom,
boom, every night.

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.910 align:middle line:84%
I was seeing what
was going to happen.

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:26.480 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, that's
just because I gave myself

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:27.560 align:middle line:90%
permission.

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:30.050 align:middle line:84%
I normally wouldn't sit around
at night, out in the yard,

00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:31.140 align:middle line:90%
and do such a thing.

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:32.100 align:middle line:90%
But we can.

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:32.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yes.

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:34.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The point is we can.

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And then you can recall
because you're not asleep.

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:37.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Well,
studies, again, show

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:40.880 align:middle line:84%
what are the traits for people
who are psychic precognitive.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And the number one
trait is belief,

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:44.570 align:middle line:84%
that they are psychic
and precognitive.

00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:46.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
acceptance of that.

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:47.487 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: It's
acceptance of that.

00:24:47.487 --> 00:24:49.040 align:middle line:90%
You have to believe in it first.

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And basically, believing
you are psychic

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:55.370 align:middle line:84%
is exactly the same as
believing in yourself.

00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:57.800 align:middle line:84%
Because it means
you have the ability

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:01.730 align:middle line:84%
to sense the right
decisions, to be empathetic,

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:03.510 align:middle line:90%
to be intuitive and creative.

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:05.840 align:middle line:84%
We all have that
to various degrees.

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:07.520 align:middle line:84%
There are some
people who are born

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:10.160 align:middle line:84%
with highly sensitive
potential, and they

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:13.960 align:middle line:84%
tend to find intuition
and empathy much easier.

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And then there are
people lower down

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:20.380 align:middle line:84%
the scale who are more
logical, more rational.

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:22.990 align:middle line:84%
But what I found fascinating is
that research shows that when

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:25.420 align:middle line:84%
people who are lower
down the scale, just

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:27.340 align:middle line:84%
do a simple course
of meditation,

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.255 align:middle line:84%
it unlocks the part
of their brain--

00:25:29.255 --> 00:25:30.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: --and they actually
get better psychic hits.

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:35.020 align:middle line:90%
I call them psychic hits.

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Because when the psychic
information comes through,

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:40.750 align:middle line:90%
it's clearer.

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:42.490 align:middle line:90%
The problem with people--

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:44.000 align:middle line:90%
maybe you're like this, Regina.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:44.800 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.960 align:middle line:84%
If you're very highly intuitive,
you get so much information

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:48.760 align:middle line:90%
coming in.

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:52.510 align:middle line:84%
You don't know what's worth
running with, and what isn't.

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:54.440 align:middle line:90%
What is too much.

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:55.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I tend to block it.

00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:59.390 align:middle line:84%
I tend to-- if I want
to know something,

00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:03.100 align:middle line:84%
I will actually clear
the slate, and ask.

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And say, show me if
it's for me to see.

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:06.560 align:middle line:90%
I will not watch the rest of it.

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:09.280 align:middle line:84%
That's just like soup
all around all the time.

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:10.270 align:middle line:90%
It's distracting.

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:11.770 align:middle line:84%
So I don't just
randomly see things.

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:12.910 align:middle line:90%
I choose to see.

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:14.500 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yeah, exactly.

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.290 align:middle line:84%
So you've got that
logic going, as well.

00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:17.290 align:middle line:90%
You've got that ability.

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:18.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And then it's there.

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:20.758 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: But some people
find it quite overwhelming,

00:26:20.758 --> 00:26:23.425 align:middle line:84%
that they get so many
messages, and they don't know.

00:26:23.425 --> 00:26:26.830 align:middle line:84%
Is this really psychic ability,
or is it wishful thinking,

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:28.030 align:middle line:90%
or is it negative thinking?

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:28.930 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:29.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:32.050 align:middle line:84%
Are you just open and
seeing fields bleed through?

00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:32.500 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yeah.

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:33.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:34.695 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm trying
to say is, wherever

00:26:34.695 --> 00:26:37.803 align:middle line:84%
you are on the scale of psychic
sensitivity, you've got it.

00:26:37.803 --> 00:26:39.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah,
everybody can do it.

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:42.790 align:middle line:84%
In fact, to validate your point,
at Stanford Research Institute,

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:45.830 align:middle line:84%
the famous spy programs
under Russell Targ and such,

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:49.120 align:middle line:84%
their top viewers had
seemingly-- not necessarily

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:52.450 align:middle line:84%
any psychic ability to begin
with, and they trained them,

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:55.210 align:middle line:84%
and they ended up-- a
couple of them being

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:57.940 align:middle line:90%
some of the top seers ever.

00:26:57.940 --> 00:26:59.260 align:middle line:90%
And I know that they do this.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:03.880 align:middle line:84%
They train people who have no
background in psychic ability,

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:07.210 align:middle line:84%
and other fields of
remote viewing as well.

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:08.080 align:middle line:90%
So you're right.

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.900 align:middle line:84%
It seems that it's
within everybody.

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:13.240 align:middle line:90%
If you care to do it.

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.212 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Anyone who
dreams is psychic,

00:27:15.212 --> 00:27:16.420 align:middle line:90%
that's what I'm going to say.

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:18.045 align:middle line:84%
If you have had a
dream, you will have,

00:27:18.045 --> 00:27:20.670 align:middle line:84%
at some point of your life, even
if you're, of course, not good

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:21.520 align:middle line:90%
now, you will have--

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:24.670 align:middle line:84%
as a child, if you--
the fact that you dream

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:27.430 align:middle line:84%
shows that you are a
psychic being having

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:28.330 align:middle line:90%
a human experience.

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:31.683 align:middle line:84%
Because what on Earth is going
on in this surreal world?

00:27:31.683 --> 00:27:33.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you can't
make a lot of that stuff up.

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:34.105 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: No.

00:27:34.105 --> 00:27:34.360 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:35.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're out somewhere.

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.533 align:middle line:90%
You're bringing back something--

00:27:36.533 --> 00:27:38.150 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's talk about the past.

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:38.950 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yeah.

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:41.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it possible--
since time and space

00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:44.560 align:middle line:84%
is non-linear, is it possible
that one can go into a dream

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:48.040 align:middle line:84%
of the past and
effect healing that

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:51.860 align:middle line:84%
flows through into the
present, or even the future?

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:53.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: There are
studies, it's retrocausality

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:54.650 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about here--

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:57.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: --where the future
can influence the past.

00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it can
happen in the dream state.

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.790 align:middle line:90%
And I would encourage anyone.

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:05.000 align:middle line:84%
A lot of us have grown up
with traumas and problems.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And going back to heal your
past self, your child self,

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:10.940 align:middle line:84%
I would encourage that
both in the dream state

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:14.000 align:middle line:84%
and in the waking
state, that you go back

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.620 align:middle line:84%
and be the parent, the carer,
the nurturer to yourself

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:19.670 align:middle line:90%
when you needed it most.

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:21.740 align:middle line:84%
It's a very powerful
exercise to do that,

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:24.512 align:middle line:84%
to reconnect to the
trauma of your past.

00:28:24.512 --> 00:28:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And it can happen in the
dream state, too, sometimes.

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.180 align:middle line:84%
That's why we're pulled back
to childhood in our dreams.

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:32.030 align:middle line:84%
It's our dreaming mind trying
to heal these bits of ourselves

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:35.203 align:middle line:84%
that are broken, and doing
it in the only way it can.

00:28:35.203 --> 00:28:36.620 align:middle line:84%
But I would encourage
people to do

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:37.196 align:middle line:90%
that if it's not too painful.

00:28:37.196 --> 00:28:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well if you
have an intention, right?

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:40.910 align:middle line:84%
You have to set your
intention, this part of me I've

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:43.760 align:middle line:84%
dreamt of before, I would
like to go back and find

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.500 align:middle line:84%
reconciliation in
that period of time.

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:47.300 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yeah.

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:48.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:51.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: But to make
this even more expansive,

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:53.900 align:middle line:84%
just as you can go back
in time and be there

00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:55.930 align:middle line:84%
for yourself in the
past, you've created,

00:28:55.930 --> 00:28:57.260 align:middle line:90%
it's a living memory there.

00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:58.647 align:middle line:90%
You can also go in the future.

00:28:58.647 --> 00:29:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
where I'm going next.

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: We're going to have
our future selves hovering

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:02.840 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about that, and I'd

00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:06.290 align:middle line:84%
like to know for you,
personally, if you've

00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:09.560 align:middle line:90%
had some future self dreams.

00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:10.430 align:middle line:90%
Collectively--

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yes.

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:12.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Either
collectively or individually.

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Well, I tend to have
ones that are fairly trivial,

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:16.770 align:middle line:90%
as I say, like the pink--

00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:17.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Barbie.

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:18.528 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: --Barbie one.

00:29:18.528 --> 00:29:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And I've had it when
I've done big interviews.

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:24.800 align:middle line:90%
I had one recently where--

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.980 align:middle line:84%
for the BBC, actually,
I had a dream

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:31.640 align:middle line:84%
of a lead presenter
there, Nicky Campbell.

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know why
I dreamt about him.

00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:38.685 align:middle line:84%
And then the following
morning, my radio in my car

00:29:38.685 --> 00:29:40.310 align:middle line:84%
wasn't working, and
I switched channel,

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:42.740 align:middle line:84%
and it was "BBC 5 Live,"
and he was talking.

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And he was saying
to his listeners--

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:48.110 align:middle line:84%
it was when "Rings
of Power" came out--

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:51.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand, why are
we all obsessed with elves,

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.730 align:middle line:90%
and fairies, and fantasy?

00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:55.220 align:middle line:84%
I can't watch these things
like "Game of Thrones."

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:56.300 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand it.

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:58.940 align:middle line:84%
Is there anyone
listening who could just

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:02.813 align:middle line:84%
text, call in, and
explain to me what

00:30:02.813 --> 00:30:05.480 align:middle line:84%
is this obsession with "Rings of
Power" and "Lord of the Rings,"

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:06.280 align:middle line:90%
et cetera?

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I am a
"Lord of the Rings" geek.

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:10.530 align:middle line:84%
My podcast is called
"White Shores" in honor--

00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:11.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:14.007 align:middle line:90%


00:30:14.007 --> 00:30:16.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Something said to
me, I'm following the dream.

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:18.995 align:middle line:84%
I texted in, and
basically, it ended up

00:30:18.995 --> 00:30:20.120 align:middle line:90%
being the call of the week.

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:21.650 align:middle line:84%
Because I was
instructing him about--

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:22.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I'm sure.

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:24.078 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: And then a
few months later, he

00:30:24.078 --> 00:30:28.130 align:middle line:84%
invited me on to his podcast
for "BBC 5 Live," and all

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:30.313 align:middle line:90%
about creativity and intuition.

00:30:30.313 --> 00:30:31.355 align:middle line:90%
And it was kind of like--

00:30:31.355 --> 00:30:32.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You set
it up in advance.

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:34.385 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: But I don't
mean-- he's not someone

00:30:34.385 --> 00:30:36.800 align:middle line:90%
that factors in my awareness.

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.460 align:middle line:84%
I know who he is, but why
that presenter, and why--

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:40.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In your dream.

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: So that's again kind
of leading me forward to a path

00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:44.210 align:middle line:90%
I needed to go.

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:45.418 align:middle line:90%
And he found it very helpful.

00:30:45.418 --> 00:30:46.670 align:middle line:90%
He was very open-minded.

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:48.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is
the BBC, as well.

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:51.740 align:middle line:84%
With dreamwork, they tend
to tie it in with sleep.

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:54.800 align:middle line:84%
But they're getting much more
interested in dream decoding.

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:56.660 align:middle line:84%
I've done quite a
lot for BBC radio.

00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:58.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you do a lot
on the media to the mainstream.

00:30:58.650 --> 00:30:58.980 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yes.

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:00.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it shows the
times, times are changing.

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:01.420 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: When people
call in with a dream,

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:09.030 align:middle line:84%
and I just try and help them in
a very gentle, non woo woo way,

00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:11.100 align:middle line:84%
how is this going
to help this person?

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:13.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm always very aware
when someone calls in.

00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:16.260 align:middle line:84%
How what am I going to
say is going to help them?

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And also, the people
listening at home,

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:21.030 align:middle line:84%
how is it going to help
them interpret their dreams?

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Can I give some basic
tools here, again,

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:26.910 align:middle line:84%
to get them to fall in
love with their dreams,

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:27.985 align:middle line:90%
a.k.a. themselves?

00:31:27.985 --> 00:31:29.610 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
they don't realize,

00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:31.200 align:middle line:90%
they're dreaming themselves.

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.660 align:middle line:84%
But I've also had
more difficult dreams

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:38.530 align:middle line:84%
where I had a dream
of a childhood friend

00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:39.870 align:middle line:90%
I hadn't seen for years.

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:43.963 align:middle line:84%
And in the dream, she
had butterfly wings.

00:31:43.963 --> 00:31:45.630 align:middle line:84%
It was very weird,
but dreams are weird.

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:46.830 align:middle line:90%
I mean, crazier.

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:49.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was
about a week later,

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:54.180 align:middle line:84%
I found through a Facebook
feed, this friend was mentioned.

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:57.760 align:middle line:84%
She had passed away in
a motorbike accident.

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And it coincided about
the time of my dream.

00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:04.527 align:middle line:84%
Now that was very difficult.
Because a part of me

00:32:04.527 --> 00:32:06.860 align:middle line:84%
thought, well, should I have
reached out to this person,

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:10.020 align:middle line:84%
and say, look,
I've dreamt of you?

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:11.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:12.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Or the family?

00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:15.070 align:middle line:84%
I left it because
this is too sensitive.

00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:17.080 align:middle line:90%
But things like that happen.

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And I am actually starting
to get braver now.

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:20.820 align:middle line:84%
When I dream of someone
out of the blue,

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:22.890 align:middle line:84%
I make a conscious effort
to connect with them,

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:25.980 align:middle line:90%
kind of live the dream.

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:27.823 align:middle line:84%
I'll say it in a very
fun way, if the person

00:32:27.823 --> 00:32:28.740 align:middle line:90%
doesn't want to reply.

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:30.970 align:middle line:84%
I had a dream about
you, are you OK?

00:32:30.970 --> 00:32:31.880 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:33.435 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you don't
have to say, and you died.

00:32:33.435 --> 00:32:34.235 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:32:34.235 --> 00:32:35.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: No, no, no, no, no.

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:38.430 align:middle line:84%
First of all, though,
I will look at why am I

00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:39.990 align:middle line:90%
dreaming up this person?

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:41.880 align:middle line:90%
What is it about them?

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:44.845 align:middle line:84%
What trait do I
need to integrate?

00:32:44.845 --> 00:32:45.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good point.

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:46.918 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Right, as well.

00:32:46.918 --> 00:32:48.960 align:middle line:84%
But if someone persistently
appears in my dreams,

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:52.272 align:middle line:84%
and I can't work it out, I do
now start living the dream.

00:32:52.272 --> 00:32:53.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
reaching out to them.

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:54.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Reaching out.

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:56.637 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a good
message for all of us.

00:32:56.637 --> 00:32:58.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: It's a beautiful
thing to do, actually.

00:32:58.830 --> 00:32:59.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've
been on my mind.

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:00.900 align:middle line:90%
I keep dreaming about you.

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:01.470 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:02.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yeah, yeah.

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:03.445 align:middle line:84%
And it's a beautiful
thing to do.

00:33:03.445 --> 00:33:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And often, you will find, when
I have done this in the past,

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:08.100 align:middle line:90%
that something is going on.

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:11.070 align:middle line:84%
You've picked up on
something unconsciously.

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, I would
encourage people to start--

00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:18.900 align:middle line:84%
but not the insane
Wondery or a serial killer

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:20.160 align:middle line:90%
or the blood and gore.

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:23.815 align:middle line:84%
That is just your dreaming
mind using shock, again,

00:33:23.815 --> 00:33:24.815 align:middle line:90%
because you've ignored--

00:33:24.815 --> 00:33:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To get your attention.

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:25.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: --it.

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:27.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it wants your attention.

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:29.278 align:middle line:84%
And it knows that
blood and gore--

00:33:29.278 --> 00:33:30.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It will
get your attention.

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:32.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: --you're
going to think about it.

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:33.520 align:middle line:84%
You're going to talk to
your friends about it.

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:34.870 align:middle line:90%
You're going to go online.

00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:36.280 align:middle line:90%
You're going to search about it.

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:37.570 align:middle line:90%
You're going to mull it over.

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:39.310 align:middle line:84%
That's all your
dreaming mind wants.

00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:40.322 align:middle line:90%
It wants you to reflect.

00:33:40.322 --> 00:33:42.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It wants
your attention.

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:45.010 align:middle line:84%
You talk about, sometimes,
some methods for meeting

00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:47.320 align:middle line:84%
with your future
self in dream time.

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:48.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Oh, yes.

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, one thing I'd
like people to do

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:55.120 align:middle line:84%
is to think about themselves
watching the next episode,

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:56.390 align:middle line:90%
the next guest.

00:33:56.390 --> 00:33:57.190 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:58.700 align:middle line:90%
Whoever that may be.

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And to say hello to
that person right now.

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:04.210 align:middle line:84%
Also go back in time and
think the episode previous

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:05.020 align:middle line:90%
to this one.

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:05.920 align:middle line:90%
Where were you?

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:07.150 align:middle line:90%
Stand by yourself.

00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:08.380 align:middle line:90%
Give yourself a hug.

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:10.177 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what is
the purpose of that?

00:34:10.177 --> 00:34:12.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: The purpose
of that is to give you

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:15.760 align:middle line:84%
a sense that you are more
than just the here and now.

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:18.460 align:middle line:90%
You are expansive across time.

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And it is a wonderful
thing to know.

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:23.199 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of us,
sometimes, feel very alone.

00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And knowing that your future
self is there already--

00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:29.840 align:middle line:90%
I believe my future self.

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:33.980 align:middle line:84%
I know when I go fly back in a
couple of days' time to the UK,

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:36.250 align:middle line:84%
I will be reflecting
on this moment.

00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:38.030 align:middle line:90%
I will be back here.

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:39.820 align:middle line:90%
So I'm already here.

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:40.939 align:middle line:90%
So hello, Theresa.

00:34:40.939 --> 00:34:41.739 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:41.739 --> 00:34:44.199 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: And it's a
lovely thing to do.

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:46.860 align:middle line:84%
You never feel alone
because you know

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:49.910 align:middle line:84%
that when you go into the
future, you create a memory.

00:34:49.910 --> 00:34:50.710 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:52.929 align:middle line:84%
Lewis Carroll once said,
"It's a poor sort of memory

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:54.760 align:middle line:90%
that only works backwards."

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:56.380 align:middle line:84%
Your memory can work
forwards as well.

00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:58.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talking
about future memory.

00:34:58.170 --> 00:34:59.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Future memory.

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:00.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're going
to get into that right

00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:02.740 align:middle line:84%
now, about what that
does to the brain.

00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:04.187 align:middle line:90%
Because you were telling me--

00:35:04.187 --> 00:35:05.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Yes, I
found this research--

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:07.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --the brain--
yeah, tell us about it,

00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:10.360 align:middle line:84%
where the brain fires up in
a totally different way--

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:11.160 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yes.

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:13.687 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --if you
create a future memory.

00:35:13.687 --> 00:35:16.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Well, actually, it's
called episodic future thinking

00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:18.772 align:middle line:84%
in scientific terms,
when they study it.

00:35:18.772 --> 00:35:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
is, when someone's

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:23.350 align:middle line:84%
thinking about the
present, or the past,

00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:27.610 align:middle line:84%
they study what parts of
the brain are lighting up.

00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:29.890 align:middle line:84%
Then when somebody is
asked to take themselves

00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:33.850 align:middle line:84%
into the future, say, I want
you to now, two days from now,

00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:37.140 align:middle line:84%
where will you be,
what will you be doing?

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:39.958 align:middle line:90%
The brain just goes wild.

00:35:39.958 --> 00:35:41.625 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
it's in creative mode.

00:35:41.625 --> 00:35:42.425 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yes.

00:35:42.425 --> 00:35:46.020 align:middle line:84%
It's highly creative, and
it's creating a living memory.

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's been shown, this
is great for brain health.

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:51.430 align:middle line:90%
It's great for mood regulation.

00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:54.390 align:middle line:84%
It's great for positive
thinking and helping

00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:57.600 align:middle line:84%
you believe in yourself,
and actually creating

00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:01.050 align:middle line:84%
this future self, at
the moment, the person

00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:03.450 align:middle line:84%
you want to be, the
person you aspire to be.

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:05.730 align:middle line:84%
Your higher self, for
want of a better word.

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:09.000 align:middle line:90%
It's a really powerful exercise.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.890 align:middle line:84%
I have visualized
this conversation,

00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:13.350 align:middle line:90%
and I hope it's playing out.

00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:16.200 align:middle line:90%
To make sure that--

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:17.020 align:middle line:90%
sort of fill in.

00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:21.020 align:middle line:84%
So when I come, I'm kind
of filling in the blanks.

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And as I say, research
shows it's very good news

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:24.340 align:middle line:90%
for the brain.

00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:25.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the
antithesis would

00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:27.900 align:middle line:84%
have to be sitting around
and constantly thinking

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:29.110 align:middle line:90%
about the past.

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:29.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yes.

00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:30.270 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:31.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The brain doesn't
light up in the same way.

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:32.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: No, it doesn't.

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:33.967 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's
nothing creative

00:36:33.967 --> 00:36:35.220 align:middle line:90%
about mulling over the past.

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:37.887 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Unless your future
self goes back into the past,

00:36:37.887 --> 00:36:38.970 align:middle line:90%
and gives your past a hug.

00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:40.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like what we
talked about earlier.

00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:41.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: We get the
whole brain activity.

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:42.630 align:middle line:90%
This is--

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:44.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Reimagining
what happened

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:47.220 align:middle line:84%
in the past to a higher outcome,
then you have it lighting up

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:48.020 align:middle line:90%
again, right?

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:48.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yes.

00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:49.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like you just said,
because all the creativity is

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:50.440 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:52.100 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: It's a
future simulation.

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:54.790 align:middle line:84%
And now, every day, I
greet my future self.

00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:56.500 align:middle line:90%
I say, hello, my old friend.

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:57.580 align:middle line:90%
You're here already.

00:36:57.580 --> 00:37:00.100 align:middle line:84%
Because I know-- because I'm
a very reflective person,

00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:03.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go
back and reflect.

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:04.607 align:middle line:90%
I know I'm going to do that.

00:37:04.607 --> 00:37:06.398 align:middle line:84%
Similarly when I write
in my dream journal,

00:37:06.398 --> 00:37:08.630 align:middle line:84%
I know my future self, later
in the day or tomorrow,

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:10.170 align:middle line:90%
is going to read it.

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:13.070 align:middle line:84%
So I'm conscious that I'm
already present there,

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:14.360 align:middle line:90%
across time.

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:16.580 align:middle line:90%
But it's not-- you could say--

00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:19.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's different than
habitual dwelling in the past.

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:20.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yes.

00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:21.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, very different.

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted you to
make the distinction--

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:24.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yeah, absolutely.

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:24.740 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:26.573 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --the distinction
between the two.

00:37:26.573 --> 00:37:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: You go back in
the past to understand it,

00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:31.730 align:middle line:84%
and to be caring and
compassionate towards yourself,

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:35.450 align:middle line:84%
and to be whatever you needed
to be to yourself at the time.

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:36.770 align:middle line:90%
Because you were too young.

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:39.620 align:middle line:84%
When you're young, you
haven't got the knowledge.

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:42.710 align:middle line:84%
But when you get older, you
start getting the wisdom.

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And you can go back and give
that young child your wisdom.

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:48.230 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:49.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:51.710 align:middle line:84%
You say, in fact,
it's a good exercise

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:55.790 align:middle line:84%
to spin out in your mind where
you will be in three months

00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:56.820 align:middle line:90%
time, for example.

00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:57.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Yes.

00:37:57.620 --> 00:37:57.890 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:57.890 --> 00:38:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so some people
would say, why waste your time?

00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:02.450 align:middle line:84%
It's just fantasy
and imagination.

00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:04.710 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: It's not, because--

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:06.220 align:middle line:84%
I would urge people,
first of all,

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:08.100 align:middle line:90%
to do it for tomorrow morning.

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
that's more predictable.

00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:10.125 align:middle line:84%
You kind of know what
you're going to do.

00:38:10.125 --> 00:38:10.925 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: Well, no.

00:38:10.925 --> 00:38:12.930 align:middle line:84%
Do things like, what time
am I going to wake up?

00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:13.590 align:middle line:90%
What will I be wearing?

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So guess what
time you might be waking up?

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:16.470 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Will it be
light or dark outside?

00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:18.803 align:middle line:84%
A series of questions, will
it be light or dark outside?

00:38:18.803 --> 00:38:21.300 align:middle line:84%
Will I be woken by
alarm or naturally?

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:23.550 align:middle line:84%
You try these things, and
you write down your answer,

00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:25.950 align:middle line:84%
and see how accurate
you are over time.

00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:29.560 align:middle line:84%
But then do it like
three months in advance.

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Because now, you're going
to have to-- your mind

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:32.643 align:middle line:90%
is a bit like a simulator.

00:38:32.643 --> 00:38:35.880 align:middle line:90%
You've got to create a future.

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:39.240 align:middle line:90%
Predict where it's going to be.

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:41.640 align:middle line:84%
What you want to
see for yourself?

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:44.310 align:middle line:84%
Be realistic, we live
in the material world.

00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:47.790 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to be a rocket
scientist in three months.

00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:53.910 align:middle line:84%
Be realistic, a scenario
that's doable, how will you be?

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:54.930 align:middle line:90%
Write it down.

00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:59.258 align:middle line:84%
And then when that time comes,
just see how on point you are.

00:38:59.258 --> 00:39:00.175 align:middle line:90%
It's a very powerful--

00:39:00.175 --> 00:39:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
go further out.

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:03.215 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Yeah, keep
going further out.

00:39:03.215 --> 00:39:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And every time you do it, your
brain is loving you for it.

00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:11.010 align:middle line:84%
Your brain loves
episodic future thinking.

00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:13.380 align:middle line:84%
It's also a very
exciting way to live,

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:16.110 align:middle line:84%
to know that your future
self is watching you.

00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And also, now knowing your
future self is watching you,

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.010 align:middle line:84%
I want to impress my
future self right now.

00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:21.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:24.435 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: I want my future
to say, well done, Theresa.

00:39:24.435 --> 00:39:26.190 align:middle line:90%
You got the points across.

00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:28.530 align:middle line:90%
I want to do that.

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Because studies again show that
people who are observed when

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:35.100 align:middle line:90%
doing a task perform better.

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:39.223 align:middle line:84%
You are being observed all the
time by your future memory.

00:39:39.223 --> 00:39:40.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:41.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: That will
raise your game.

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:43.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
very interesting.

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:44.538 align:middle line:84%
And I really thank
you for bringing

00:39:44.538 --> 00:39:48.690 align:middle line:84%
that in, that the brain,
itself, has now been witnessed

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:52.650 align:middle line:84%
in action in response to
these future pacing events,

00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:54.910 align:middle line:90%
these future memories.

00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:57.180 align:middle line:84%
It's starting to
really be upheld even

00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:58.410 align:middle line:90%
in the scientific realms now.

00:39:58.410 --> 00:39:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Episodic
future thinking.

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:00.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
that's what we want.

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:02.430 align:middle line:84%
We want our brain to be
lit up because it also

00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:03.600 align:middle line:90%
keeps the brain alive.

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:06.330 align:middle line:84%
It keeps your life moving
in unexpected wonderful

00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:07.230 align:middle line:90%
directions.

00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:08.610 align:middle line:90%
There's every reason to do it.

00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:10.360 align:middle line:84%
Where are you going
to be in three months?

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:11.160 align:middle line:90%
What do you see?

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:12.330 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:40:12.330 --> 00:40:15.600 align:middle line:90%
Back here, where?

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, I see myself in
England next month,

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:18.360 align:middle line:90%
and we'll have tea together.

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:19.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: We will have tea.

00:40:19.530 --> 00:40:20.520 align:middle line:90%
I loved having tea.

We have cream tea.

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:24.455 align:middle line:84%
And you put the cream on
first, and then the jam.

00:40:24.455 --> 00:40:26.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
put the jam on first.

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Of course, that's the
logical way to do it, Regina.

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:29.160 align:middle line:90%
Really.

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:30.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But see,
in the US, it usually

00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:31.492 align:middle line:90%
doesn't start with cream.

00:40:31.492 --> 00:40:33.480 align:middle line:84%
It starts with
butter, and then jam.

[LAUGHING]

00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:37.120 align:middle line:84%
OK, on that, I want
to thank you so much.

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:40.740 align:middle line:84%
Any final thoughts besides, keep
a dream journal, absolutely?

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:44.190 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: Final
thoughts is, most people

00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:46.920 align:middle line:84%
who are into dreamwork,
write down their dreams,

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:48.970 align:middle line:84%
and then start
interpreting them.

00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:51.990 align:middle line:84%
But what they miss out on
is that third and vital step

00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:54.900 align:middle line:84%
is going back, and
looking back several weeks

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:58.110 align:middle line:84%
behind to see if there's
any theme or pattern.

00:40:58.110 --> 00:41:02.490 align:middle line:84%
Now after this interview,
you know that your dreams

00:41:02.490 --> 00:41:04.110 align:middle line:90%
are potentially precognitive.

00:41:04.110 --> 00:41:07.710 align:middle line:84%
They have that ability to
showcase potential futures.

00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:10.140 align:middle line:84%
All you need is to go
back in your dream journal

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:14.410 align:middle line:84%
and see one precognitive
hit, to know it's possible.

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And when you know something's
possible, you can do it.

00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:20.130 align:middle line:84%
What you need to do is
you need to gather data.

00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:23.580 align:middle line:84%
You need to prove to yourself,
be like a citizen scientist,

00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:26.310 align:middle line:84%
that you are a
precognitive being having

00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:27.840 align:middle line:90%
a human experience.

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And when you do
that, I guarantee,

00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:31.210 align:middle line:84%
your life will
never be the same.

00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:32.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:36.120 align:middle line:84%
Validation, self-validation,
is everything to opening up

00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:37.350 align:middle line:90%
your psychic powers.

00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:40.530 align:middle line:84%
I know years ago, I'd think,
oh, did I really see that?

00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:43.500 align:middle line:84%
As the years went on, with
each hit that was validated,

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:45.960 align:middle line:84%
it got to where,
just relax, and then

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:47.518 align:middle line:90%
it just flows in so much easier.

00:41:47.518 --> 00:41:48.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: It's that letting go.

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:50.580 align:middle line:10%
Because when you
let go of things,

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:55.860 align:middle line:10%
you open up for something
better new to come in.

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:58.910 align:middle line:84%
Too many of us hold on to things
that we want, and try and force

00:41:58.910 --> 00:41:59.710 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:02.550 align:middle line:10%
And by doing that, you're
blocking what is right for you

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:03.353 align:middle line:10%
to come in.

00:42:03.353 --> 00:42:04.520 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Have to let it go.

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:05.480 align:middle line:10%
>>CHEUNG: Yeah.

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:06.740 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Beautiful message.

00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:08.448 align:middle line:84%
I think you've encouraged
a lot of people

00:42:08.448 --> 00:42:09.593 align:middle line:90%
to write down their dreams.

00:42:09.593 --> 00:42:11.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEUNG: And remember,
your dreams don't lie.

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:13.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Remember,
your dreams don't lie.

00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And validate yourself
because you're the exercise.

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:18.300 align:middle line:90%
Loving yourself is the exercise.

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:19.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEUNG: It is.

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you
so much, Theresa.

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:21.470 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful to see you.

as a gift to someone wanting

00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:34.595 align:middle line:84%
new to it, is her
beautifully illustrated book,

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:37.010 align:middle line:90%
