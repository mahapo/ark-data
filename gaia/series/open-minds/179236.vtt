00:00:20.995 --> 00:00:22.370 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Maria Wheatley

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.410 align:middle line:10%
has been dowsing
since she was a child,

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.360 align:middle line:10%
having been taught
by her father, who

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.920 align:middle line:10%
was a legend in the field.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.660 align:middle line:10%
She's able to check
into everything

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.970 align:middle line:10%
from the characteristics
of sacred sites

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.620 align:middle line:10%
to human intention.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.900 align:middle line:84%
But one of her favorite
topics is the mysteries

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.370 align:middle line:90%
of the human species.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.870 align:middle line:84%
In this conversation,
we're going

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.230 align:middle line:84%
to take a look at the little
known elongated skulls

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.780 align:middle line:90%
from the area around Stonehenge.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:45.804 align:middle line:90%
Maria, welcome.

00:00:45.804 --> 00:00:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MARIA WHEATLEY: Thank you.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What an incredibly
useful tool to have passed down

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.430 align:middle line:90%
from father to daughter.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.670 align:middle line:84%
But dowsing, to be able to
look into the world of energy

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.350 align:middle line:84%
and have it reflect back
information from the field

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.150 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Talk about this
a little bit when

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.330 align:middle line:84%
you were a little
girl with your father

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.750 align:middle line:84%
and when he first taught
you to dowse and all that.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.860 align:middle line:10%
>>WHEATLEY: Yeah, it
is a wonderful skill.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.800 align:middle line:10%
It's an extension
of our sixth sense.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.930 align:middle line:10%
And I'm really
passionate about dowsing.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.270 align:middle line:10%
Because where I got
taught at a very young age

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.960 align:middle line:10%
by my late father at ancient
sites such as Avebury

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.180 align:middle line:10%
and Stonehenge,
everybody else was

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.830 align:middle line:10%
playing with balls and yoyos and
there I was, you know, dowsing.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.740 align:middle line:10%
And realizing that there
was something in the earth.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And that Gaia's energies
and voltages and her being,

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.150 align:middle line:84%
her consciousness reflects
through ancient sites.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.600 align:middle line:84%
So for me, dowsing is
about understanding

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.280 align:middle line:84%
not just the ancient
sites, but about Gaia

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.370 align:middle line:84%
and reconnecting
back to our past

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.680 align:middle line:84%
so that we can look
forward to our future.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So did
your dad start you

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.890 align:middle line:84%
out dowsing for
water and so forth?

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.850 align:middle line:84%
Did you use dowsing rods
or did you use a pendulum

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.770 align:middle line:84%
or what kind of
tools did he give you

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.160 align:middle line:84%
and what were the very
first things you dowsed?

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: That's a
really good question.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.460 align:middle line:84%
Yes, the first thing I
dowsed was with L-rods.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's your standard
L-shaped copper and nickel

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.380 align:middle line:90%
rod for water.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's so easy for
anybody to find water.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.390 align:middle line:84%
It is so ingrained in our
kind of DNA from our ancestors

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.010 align:middle line:90%
that we can find it everywhere.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.050 align:middle line:84%
So I find it really
strange that you

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.790 align:middle line:84%
know, some countries
such as South Africa,

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.720 align:middle line:84%
for example, say they're going
to be running out of water.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.640 align:middle line:84%
Because a really
good water diviner

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.620 align:middle line:90%
can find water anywhere.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Because water is born with
inside the Earth as well as

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.360 align:middle line:90%
rainfall.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.484 align:middle line:90%
So I started off with water.

00:02:34.484 --> 00:02:35.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.760 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know until
just a few years ago

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.700 align:middle line:84%
that on our family's
farm property

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.150 align:middle line:84%
my father had actually
hired a dowser to find out

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.370 align:middle line:90%
where to drill the well.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.200 align:middle line:84%
I found out all kinds
of interesting things

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.390 align:middle line:84%
about him as he's
become quite elderly.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.240 align:middle line:84%
He was open at that time--
this was in the '70s,

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.490 align:middle line:84%
so a number of years ago--
he was open to this subject

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.220 align:middle line:84%
that I had no idea
of at the time.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.100 align:middle line:84%
Because most people in America
still don't know what dowsing

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.420 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.350 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Yes.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.910 align:middle line:90%
It can find water.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.490 align:middle line:84%
It can find any
substance, really.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And it can even allow us to
find our energies in our home.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.180 align:middle line:84%
So dowsing is
very, very diverse.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.980 align:middle line:84%
It can really help
humanity move on

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.670 align:middle line:84%
and to live in
harmony with Gaia.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
my passion lies is

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.390 align:middle line:84%
about understanding
the energies,

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.230 align:middle line:84%
decoding a hotel like
this, decoding Stonehenge,

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.570 align:middle line:84%
and allowing us
to really resonate

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.600 align:middle line:84%
with the frequencies
of the earth.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And your father,
too, he was noted in his field.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.990 align:middle line:84%
He had one of the
largest bodies of work

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.905 align:middle line:84%
in terms of geodetic
knowledge in England, right?

00:03:41.905 --> 00:03:43.030 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: That's correct.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.863 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about that a little bit

00:03:44.863 --> 00:03:46.790 align:middle line:84%
about what he
contributed before we

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.670 align:middle line:84%
start going into this
incredibly fascinating story

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.080 align:middle line:90%
about the skulls.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.100 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Sure.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.490 align:middle line:84%
My late father inherited a
lot of work by a master dowser

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.390 align:middle line:90%
called Guy Underwood.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And Guy Underwood was
around in the sort

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.260 align:middle line:90%
of 1930s and the 1940s.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And he was at a very good
stage looking at ancient sites,

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.730 align:middle line:84%
because this was before
the Second World War.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.160 align:middle line:10%
So Stonehenge had different
monuments surrounding it that

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.242 align:middle line:10%
got plowed out in the 1940s.

00:04:15.242 --> 00:04:16.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.130 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: So he recorded
the ancient landscape

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.580 align:middle line:84%
and surveyed it and
connected to the energies

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.120 align:middle line:84%
there, because he created
his own type of dowsing rod.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.350 align:middle line:90%
He was quite unique.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.670 align:middle line:10%
It's a bit difficult to use.

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.650 align:middle line:10%
But that allowed
very fine tuning

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.550 align:middle line:10%
to all different types
of frequencies at places

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.270 align:middle line:10%
like Stonehenge,
Malta, Egypt, Greece.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.970 align:middle line:84%
This man, Guy Underwood,
was on a mission

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.570 align:middle line:84%
to find our ancient
sites around the world.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And my late father
inherited all of that work,

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.660 align:middle line:90%
of which I've inherited.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, lucky you.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.299 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Definitely.

00:04:50.299 --> 00:04:51.098 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:04:51.098 --> 00:04:52.100 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to Stonehenge.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.680 align:middle line:90%
Let's go post-World War II.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about military
installations in that region,

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.250 align:middle line:84%
because nobody thinks of that
when they think of Stonehenge.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:07.940 align:middle line:84%
But so much has been
basically tracked over

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.440 align:middle line:84%
by tanks and other kinds of
military-- in military games

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.450 align:middle line:84%
and in wartime
and such that much

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.040 align:middle line:84%
has been disturbed
and destroyed.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.230 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the
military presence in that region

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.150 align:middle line:84%
and some of the
alterations that have

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.180 align:middle line:84%
happened as a result
of its presence there.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: Stonehenge
is surrounded

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.830 align:middle line:84%
by military establishment
after military establishment.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.310 align:middle line:84%
It's on what's called
the Salisbury Plain.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And the Salisbury Plain is
literally owned and managed

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.320 align:middle line:84%
by the military, the MOD
as we call it in the UK.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And there, Stonehenge is
at kind of near center.

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.180 align:middle line:84%
So if you imagine 26
miles around Stonehenge

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.590 align:middle line:90%
of controlled military activity.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.410 align:middle line:84%
But our ancient ancestors
knew, as did the military,

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.840 align:middle line:84%
that there was something
so unique and so special

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.670 align:middle line:84%
about the Salisbury
Plain because you

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.250 align:middle line:84%
find more concentration
of ancient sites

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.120 align:middle line:84%
on Salisbury Plain than anywhere
else in the British Isles.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.470 align:middle line:84%
Our ancestors created
up to 2,500 monuments

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.940 align:middle line:84%
alone in that 26
by 26 mile zone.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.430 align:middle line:84%
And you can't have access to
some parts of the Salisbury

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:16.230 align:middle line:90%
Plain.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.790 align:middle line:10%
So I've often
likened it to Area 51

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:23.320 align:middle line:10%
in America, because it's denied
passage for the average person

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.760 align:middle line:10%
to go there.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And within this
military zone, you

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.920 align:middle line:84%
have some of the most
unusual monuments

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.370 align:middle line:84%
that house the most unusual
people in the landscape.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:35.470 align:middle line:90%
Cannot be coincidental.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.110 align:middle line:84%
Nor can it be coincidental
that Stonehenge, for example,

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.240 align:middle line:90%
is on a ley line.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.640 align:middle line:84%
That's a kind of
energy line that links

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.850 align:middle line:90%
Stonehenge to our top bio--

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.370 align:middle line:84%
well, it's a place where you
make kind of nuclear weapons

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.410 align:middle line:84%
and you can make a kind of
chemicals and warfare stuff.

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.960 align:middle line:90%
And it's called Porton Down.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.310 align:middle line:84%
So in Porton Down you have a lot
of chemicals made for warfare.

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.720 align:middle line:90%
And bang, its on an energy line.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.290 align:middle line:84%
So I really do feel that
the military have a control

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:07.360 align:middle line:90%
over Stonehenge to a degree.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.390 align:middle line:84%
But I also feel
that Stonehenge can

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:13.420 align:middle line:84%
be activated by people like
ourselves that go there

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.419 align:middle line:84%
and raise our
consciousness there.

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:16.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know,
it's interesting.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.290 align:middle line:84%
Because in Sedona, where
I've lived since 2000,

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.030 align:middle line:84%
basically, took a little
break for a while,

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:26.170 align:middle line:90%
but it's been said--

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:27.880 align:middle line:84%
I remember one
evening I was told

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.870 align:middle line:84%
by a man who was working
in exotic technology

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.060 align:middle line:84%
development for the
military, he told

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.240 align:middle line:84%
me there were six military
bases within a 30 mile

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.020 align:middle line:90%
radius of Sedona.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.700 align:middle line:84%
Again, one of these sacred sites
with very powerful energies

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.270 align:middle line:90%
emanating from it.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And then I think of
the ancient city of Ur.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:52.490 align:middle line:84%
The US went in to Iraq
and immediately took over,

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:54.970 align:middle line:84%
which is by William
Henry's work,

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:59.230 align:middle line:84%
I think considered to be one of
the star gates on the planet.

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:00.820 align:middle line:90%
We took over that area.

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:04.780 align:middle line:84%
We built a US Embassy
apparently around it,

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.640 align:middle line:90%
surrounding it or something.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.500 align:middle line:84%
So the public no
longer has access

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.010 align:middle line:84%
to this incredibly ancient
sacred site in Iraq.

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:15.940 align:middle line:84%
So there seems to be
an interesting alliance

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.040 align:middle line:84%
between military
and sacred sorts

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:21.870 align:middle line:84%
in a kind of
distorted way, right?

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:23.159 align:middle line:90%
They're looking for something.

00:08:23.159 --> 00:08:24.700 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: That's
really interesting

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.860 align:middle line:84%
that you've made
the analogy to Ur.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Because when we look to the
ancient writings of Claudius

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:34.150 align:middle line:84%
Ptolemy, he was an
astrologer at around about 1

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:37.270 align:middle line:84%
AD that was studying at
the Alexandrian Library

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:39.789 align:middle line:90%
in Egypt, which is world famous.

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:42.309 align:middle line:84%
He read some ancient
books on astrology.

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And according to the Egyptians
then, the center of the world,

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:50.260 align:middle line:84%
as they saw it, was
a very sacred place.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.690 align:middle line:84%
It's where two
major lines crossed.

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And you can even read
this today in his book.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:56.320 align:middle line:90%
It's still in print.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.530 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:59.988 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again, the name of
the book and the author again.

00:08:59.988 --> 00:09:01.430 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: It's
Claudius Ptolemy.

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:02.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, yes.

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:04.660 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: And he wrote a
book called "Tetrabiblos."

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And within
"Tetrabiblos," he said

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:08.920 align:middle line:84%
there's two large
energy lines that divide

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.620 align:middle line:90%
the world into four quarters.

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:13.685 align:middle line:84%
Sort of North,
South, West, East.

00:09:13.685 --> 00:09:14.485 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:14.485 --> 00:09:17.280 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: And that
center is Aleppo.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:20.180 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely fascinating.

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.900 align:middle line:10%
I mean, again, now an
epicenter for such strife.

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.240 align:middle line:84%
But again, these
parallels that you

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.660 align:middle line:84%
have the light and the
dark existing side by side.

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
I find fascinating.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.850 align:middle line:84%
When you come to these
sacred sites, oftentimes

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:35.620 align:middle line:84%
some of the most
sacred sites, Sedona

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:39.550 align:middle line:84%
included, have some of the
darkest activity going on

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:43.330 align:middle line:84%
almost beneath the surface, even
if it's not beneath the ground.

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:48.610 align:middle line:84%
Where you have cults and
you have satanic cults even,

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:49.721 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:09:49.721 --> 00:09:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And then on the
other hand, you have

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:54.940 align:middle line:84%
these absolutely amazing
kinds of people and groups

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.730 align:middle line:84%
and gatherings of generosity
and love and light.

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And I assume it's the same
around Stonehenge, Glastonbury,

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:03.490 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of these
places in England.

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:07.330 align:middle line:84%
You're going to find these
polarized experiences

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.980 align:middle line:84%
because they're all drawn
for the same reason, right.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:10.780 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Yeah.

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.330 align:middle line:84%
I think you're
very correct there.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:17.740 align:middle line:84%
You do have light and dark
entwined at these sites,

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.030 align:middle line:90%
you really do.

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:22.740 align:middle line:84%
But I also feel that, you
know, we with our consciousness

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.740 align:middle line:84%
and with our enlightenment
and with our awareness,

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.660 align:middle line:84%
we can interact
with the energies

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:31.330 align:middle line:84%
there, what we call as
Druids the spirits of place

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:35.400 align:middle line:84%
and the ancestors to raise our
own consciousness and hopefully

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.710 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness of
our brothers and sisters

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:38.670 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:42.160 align:middle line:84%
So they are key places
that can change.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.227 align:middle line:90%
They're game changers.

00:10:43.227 --> 00:10:44.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.470 align:middle line:90%
Because it's just raw energy.

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And you can take it
up and suck it upward

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:50.550 align:middle line:90%
or you can take it downward.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:53.790 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's just power,
raw power, raw energy, right.

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And so in this
area, the ancestors

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.770 align:middle line:84%
were obviously drawn
to it for a reason.

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:01.800 align:middle line:84%
And you have some ancestors in
what are called long barrows,

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.710 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of these military
vehicles and tanks and such

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:08.520 align:middle line:84%
have basically run over
and razed, so to speak.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:13.170 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about the long barrows
and what they represent

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.720 align:middle line:84%
in terms of burial
chambers normally

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:19.380 align:middle line:84%
compared to what you're talking
about and have discovered here.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.180 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Yes.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.740 align:middle line:84%
So a long barrow,
especially the long barrows

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.320 align:middle line:84%
on Salisbury Plain, are very
different to long barrows

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.550 align:middle line:90%
anywhere else in the country.

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:29.470 align:middle line:84%
So that makes them
very, very unique.

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And if we imagine that
some of these long barrows

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:38.610 align:middle line:84%
can be up to 390 feet long,
made of earth and chalk brick.

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:41.370 align:middle line:84%
So if you imagine like
a brick house in the UK,

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:45.570 align:middle line:84%
you get that chalk effect
and then a very low mound.

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:48.840 align:middle line:84%
At one end you have
a kind of dip down

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.300 align:middle line:84%
section of the barrow,
which is where you have

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.550 align:middle line:90%
what's called internal chambers.

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And these internal chambers
can be about four feet high.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Some of them can be five feet
high on the Salisbury Plain

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:02.730 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes a
little bit lower.

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:07.110 align:middle line:84%
Originally, they were designed
to be initiation chambers,

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:10.680 align:middle line:84%
places where you would
go for ceremony or ritual

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.990 align:middle line:84%
or to change one's
consciousness.

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:15.360 align:middle line:84%
That was called
their primary use.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:19.800 align:middle line:84%
Then their secondary use was
to be used as burial chambers.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.700 align:middle line:10%
And that was when the skulls
and the long bones, that's

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.770 align:middle line:10%
like the leg bone, and
some of the vertebrae bones

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:28.980 align:middle line:10%
of the spine were placed
within these chambers.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:33.090 align:middle line:84%
So archaeologists have now
labeled all long barrows burial

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:34.020 align:middle line:90%
chambers.

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:37.140 align:middle line:84%
But originally, they had
nothing to do with death.

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And slowly, the
archaeological community

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.520 align:middle line:84%
is changing their minds and
calling them tomb shrines.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.730 align:middle line:84%
So we need to think that
originally these were literally

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:49.900 align:middle line:90%
conscious changing spacings.

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:50.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hm-mm.

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.800 align:middle line:84%
They were used for
initiations of various kinds.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:53.670 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Exactly.

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it was
Tilshead, right, the Tilshead

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:56.640 align:middle line:90%
long barrow.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Yes.

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:58.894 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is
the one in particular

00:12:58.894 --> 00:13:00.990 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to be
talking about, right.

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:03.060 align:middle line:90%
And this was one of the--

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:07.260 align:middle line:84%
first of all, as I
recall in your book,

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.140 align:middle line:84%
normally a barrow
would have a number

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:13.737 align:middle line:84%
of people buried in it if it had
become a burial chamber, right.

00:13:13.737 --> 00:13:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
what you would normally

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:16.815 align:middle line:90%
find in one of these.

00:13:16.815 --> 00:13:17.940 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: That's correct.

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:20.660 align:middle line:84%
In an average long
barrow on Salisbury Plain

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:24.120 align:middle line:84%
or anywhere in the British
Isles and Northwest Europe,

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.840 align:middle line:84%
you would have a long barrow
used for lots of people,

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.460 align:middle line:90%
sometimes up to 49.

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:32.180 align:middle line:84%
If we turn to Wales,
you have one long barrow

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:35.340 align:middle line:84%
that had up to 1,000
people interned.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:38.850 align:middle line:84%
So the Old Ditch
Barrow, Tilshead Barrow

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:42.380 align:middle line:84%
on the Salisbury Plain being
the largest in the area

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:43.740 align:middle line:90%
of Northwest Europe.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.145 align:middle line:90%
Its huge, colossal.

00:13:45.145 --> 00:13:47.145 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's the largest
in Britain, isn't it?

00:13:47.145 --> 00:13:49.320 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: The largest in
Britain and Northwest Europe.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.197 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK.

00:13:50.197 --> 00:13:51.780 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: It is
huge, it's colossal.

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:54.565 align:middle line:84%
It's like a serpent
across the landscape.

00:13:54.565 --> 00:13:56.940 align:middle line:84%
You know, you have-- if you
want to take a picture of it,

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:00.700 align:middle line:84%
you have to stand back a long
way to get it into focus.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:01.500 align:middle line:90%
So why not--

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:02.916 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do people,
first of all,

00:14:02.916 --> 00:14:05.280 align:middle line:84%
does the public have
access to this area?

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.450 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Sometimes.

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:08.850 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you have
access to different parts

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:10.350 align:middle line:90%
of the Salisbury Plain.

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.090 align:middle line:90%
So sometimes yes, you can.

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:13.710 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes no you can't.

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:16.850 align:middle line:84%
If they're doing a military
exercise in the area

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:18.210 align:middle line:90%
it's a no go zone.

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:19.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so what
would the closest

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:23.754 align:middle line:84%
stop be if you were traveling
around by train, for example?

00:14:23.754 --> 00:14:25.170 align:middle line:10%
>>WHEATLEY: The
closest stop would

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:28.290 align:middle line:10%
be a place called Tilshead,
which is a village not far

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:31.600 align:middle line:10%
from the barrow, which is
completely kind of military.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.680 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of military
activity in the area,

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:37.360 align:middle line:84%
and you know, barracks
and establishments.

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:40.530 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this barrow is very
unique and very special

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:43.530 align:middle line:84%
because it's the largest
and it didn't contain

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:47.220 align:middle line:84%
a colossal amount of people
of the Salisbury Plain, which

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:51.650 align:middle line:84%
is what I was expecting to find
by reading antiquarian reports.

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And when I studied
the barrow, it

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:59.820 align:middle line:84%
came to light that this was made
for one person and one person

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:00.850 align:middle line:90%
alone.

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:03.080 align:middle line:90%
And this person was a woman.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And you hardly ever hear of
women in prehistoric Britain

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:11.070 align:middle line:84%
except for one very famous lady,
who has a statue here in London

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:15.540 align:middle line:84%
called Boudica, who was
an Iceni Iron Age queen.

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.590 align:middle line:10%
But apart from her,
you hear nothing

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:20.920 align:middle line:10%
of the British
prehistoric womanhood.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And so when I discovered
that, I thought that is truly

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:26.286 align:middle line:90%
an incredible moment.

00:15:26.286 --> 00:15:27.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:31.510 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk a little bit about
her and about her features.

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:34.270 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about how
it appeared she died,

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:36.220 align:middle line:84%
the uniqueness of
having been buried

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.200 align:middle line:84%
after that under
such circumstance

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.780 align:middle line:90%
and this very kind of royal way.

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll start going
into society at that time.

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:45.620 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Sure.

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:46.720 align:middle line:90%
Well, the one thing--

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just
tell us the story.

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:48.390 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Yeah.

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:52.000 align:middle line:84%
The story starts off on
a very cold February day.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And I was kind of drawn to
look at a map of the Stonehenge

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:57.550 align:middle line:90%
environs.

00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:58.720 align:middle line:90%
I love Stonehenge.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:15:59.920 align:middle line:90%
I love ancient sites.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And you think, you know, after
going to Stonehenge 101 times

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:03.820 align:middle line:90%
I'd be bored of it.

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:04.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm not.

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:07.400 align:middle line:84%
I know there's more and
more to be discovered.

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.070 align:middle line:84%
So I had a map of
Stonehenge and I

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:12.124 align:middle line:84%
did a dowsing technique
called the two point fix.

00:16:12.124 --> 00:16:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you take
a pendulum along the top--

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sounds
like a card game.

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:17.570 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Yeah.

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:19.444 align:middle line:84%
And then you take a
pendulum along the bottom

00:16:19.444 --> 00:16:20.680 align:middle line:90%
and you draw two lines.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And where X marks
the spot, bingo,

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.400 align:middle line:84%
you should have
something quite special.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's what most
dowsers use to find things.

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:30.490 align:middle line:84%
I decided to do
something very different.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:34.420 align:middle line:84%
I decided to spiritualize
this dowsing process.

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.490 align:middle line:84%
Instead of me
asking the question,

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:40.690 align:middle line:84%
I asked the landscape of
Stonehenge, tell me your story

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:42.970 align:middle line:84%
and I'll try and find
out a bit about it

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:44.470 align:middle line:90%
and I will be your voice.

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of did that in
a prayer sort of moment.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And then I did the two point
fix and it was on that barrow.

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:54.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I went to that
barrow in the first place.

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:57.760 align:middle line:84%
I try to utilize
all of my skills,

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:00.250 align:middle line:84%
you know, my sensitive
side as well.

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And I went on a very
cold February morning.

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.079 align:middle line:90%
And I laid on the barrow.

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:08.800 align:middle line:84%
I just laid on the barrow and
said, let me hear your story.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.599 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
the research began.

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And I researched,
it was the lady.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:17.109 align:middle line:84%
And then I researched that she
was in Cambridge University.

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:19.060 align:middle line:90%
And that was after much ado.

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:21.069 align:middle line:84%
Because I had
phoned up Cambridge,

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:24.190 align:middle line:84%
because I looked it up
on an antiquarian report.

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:28.569 align:middle line:84%
Her skull was sent in the
1800s to Cambridge University.

00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:30.070 align:middle line:90%
So I called them, you know.

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you know, you've got
this skull here from Tilshead

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:34.840 align:middle line:90%
long barrow.

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:37.450 align:middle line:84%
Please may I investigate
it, research it?

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, you have
to have the catalog number.

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:40.480 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.010 align:middle line:84%
Could you give me
the catalog number?

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:42.610 align:middle line:90%
Well, no.

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:43.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:44.680 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: You have to find it.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.510 align:middle line:90%
So that was much ado.

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:47.450 align:middle line:90%
But I did--

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:48.786 align:middle line:90%
I'm very--

00:17:48.786 --> 00:17:49.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Persistent.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:52.243 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: Persistent, that's
a fantastic way to describe me,

00:17:52.243 --> 00:17:53.560 align:middle line:90%
actually, it really is.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And so I ended up at
Cambridge University gloved up

00:17:58.450 --> 00:17:59.310 align:middle line:90%
with special gloves.

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:02.680 align:middle line:84%
You go into an air
conditioned environ.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And there she was,
presented to me on a desk,

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:09.370 align:middle line:90%
literally, in a big warehouse.

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:13.180 align:middle line:84%
I looked to my right, and all
I could see for about 20 feet

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:17.610 align:middle line:84%
high by 40 feet long were
cardboard boxes with Abydos

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:20.860 align:middle line:84%
male, Abydos female
all along one side.

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
side a lot of skulls

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.420 align:middle line:84%
from the British
Isles and Ireland.

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And these have never been
seen for many, many decades.

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And I was really
surprised when I

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:34.010 align:middle line:84%
looked at the last time
this skull had been seen on

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:36.100 align:middle line:84%
like an old fashioned
library card--

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.590 align:middle line:84%
you'd think Cambridge University
would have gone digital--

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:41.140 align:middle line:84%
but you signed in and
looked at his old card.

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:44.200 align:middle line:90%
And it said about the 1930s.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.240 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized
when I looked at her,

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.440 align:middle line:90%
you know, goodness me.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.940 align:middle line:90%
She has a long skull.

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.830 align:middle line:90%
She has an elongated skull.

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:55.920 align:middle line:90%
She is different to you and I.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And the way she died.

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And then starting to look at
other similar elongated skulls

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:07.240 align:middle line:84%
in the regions and that
region and the way they died,

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.780 align:middle line:84%
it becomes also an
interesting story.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:13.629 align:middle line:84%
Who were these people
with the elongated skulls?

00:19:13.629 --> 00:19:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And of course, when we
think of elongated skulls,

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:17.320 align:middle line:84%
we think of two
things immediately.

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:22.420 align:middle line:84%
We either think of the skulls
in Peru or we think Egypt--

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.690 align:middle line:84%
Tutankhamun,
Nefertiti, Akhenaten,

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:27.760 align:middle line:84%
their family with that
elongated skull, which you also

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:32.036 align:middle line:84%
liken to that skull through some
of the pictures in your book.

00:19:32.036 --> 00:19:33.160 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: That's correct.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:36.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we do think of
Paracas straight away

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:38.700 align:middle line:84%
and the cone heads,
as often they've

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.840 align:middle line:90%
be coined, with red hair.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:41.740 align:middle line:90%
And we do.

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:43.960 align:middle line:84%
We have nobody prior
to this research

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.820 align:middle line:84%
had even thought about elongated
skulls in the British Isles.

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:47.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:48.760 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: They do now.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.290 align:middle line:90%
But prior to that, no.

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:54.490 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like
from the 1920s onwards

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:56.650 align:middle line:84%
nobody had gone to
Cambridge University

00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:58.300 align:middle line:90%
and looked in these boxes.

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:01.210 align:middle line:84%
I truly think there are
far, far more discoveries

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:03.350 align:middle line:90%
in Cambridge and Oxford.

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:04.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm sure.

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:05.258 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Absolutely.

00:20:05.258 --> 00:20:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And I've studied the Oxford
University archeology

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:09.670 align:middle line:84%
and I know in their
Bodleian Library

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:12.629 align:middle line:84%
there are a lot of
gifts for humanity

00:20:12.629 --> 00:20:14.420 align:middle line:84%
if we could find out
the information there.

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.336 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you could
get the catalog number.

00:20:16.336 --> 00:20:18.880 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: If you could get
the catalog number, precisely.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:21.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh my god, it's
almost a riddle of some kind

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:22.950 align:middle line:90%
to be kept away from people.

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:25.530 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the manner of her death

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:28.470 align:middle line:84%
and then let's talk about
some of the other barrows

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:30.700 align:middle line:84%
and elongated skulls
in the region.

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:31.500 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Yes.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:34.440 align:middle line:90%
She died very suddenly.

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:38.340 align:middle line:84%
She had been murdered,
probably to a very strong blow

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:42.250 align:middle line:84%
by a right handed assailant
to the back of her head.

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:44.070 align:middle line:90%
She was quite short.

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:46.560 align:middle line:84%
We know this because of
the long bone measurements.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.600 align:middle line:84%
You can easily ascertain the
height and the probable weight

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.400 align:middle line:90%
of somebody.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what would
her height have been?

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:53.370 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: About 5 foot 4.

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:54.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:55.110 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: So
they weren't tall.

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: My height, yeah.

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:56.640 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Yeah.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.280 align:middle line:90%
It's a good height.

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:58.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They weren't giants.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:58.960 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Right.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.000 align:middle line:90%
She wasn't a giant.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.180 align:middle line:84%
But I really do feel with the
shape of her head being long

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:08.340 align:middle line:84%
skulled, these people, they
were the first to really look

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:12.510 align:middle line:84%
into the energy system of ley
lines and of earth energies.

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:13.830 align:middle line:90%
Why do I say that?

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:17.160 align:middle line:84%
It's because the long barrows,
causewayed enclosures,

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:20.940 align:middle line:84%
cursus monuments, the
Neolithic monument of her era,

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:23.180 align:middle line:84%
the earliest in
the United Kingdom,

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:25.630 align:middle line:90%
were laid out in straight lines.

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:28.700 align:middle line:10%
So perhaps their
sensitivity of their skull

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.310 align:middle line:10%
shape, they had larger
brain capacities,

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:33.810 align:middle line:10%
this has been shown
in report after report

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:37.410 align:middle line:10%
from Paracas for example,
the same as for the UK,

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:38.820 align:middle line:10%
these large brain capacities.

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:42.720 align:middle line:10%
But moreover, what about
a metaphysical sensitivity

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.910 align:middle line:10%
to the land could
have prevailed,

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:48.420 align:middle line:10%
which allowed them to see
these highly energetic areas.

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:51.690 align:middle line:84%
But sadly, when I looked to
the other barrows in the area

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:54.510 align:middle line:84%
surrounding hers
at Stonehenge, it

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:57.150 align:middle line:84%
came to light that
it wasn't just

00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:00.630 align:middle line:84%
this lady who I call the high
queen or the high priestess

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:02.940 align:middle line:90%
of Stonehenge that got murdered.

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:06.720 align:middle line:84%
All the long skulled
elongated sculled people

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.060 align:middle line:84%
in the Stonehenge
environs also had

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:13.380 align:middle line:84%
been murdered, mostly to a
blow to the back of the head

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:16.782 align:middle line:90%
by a right hand assailant.

00:22:16.782 --> 00:22:18.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, in
a moment we'll get

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.810 align:middle line:84%
into who those assailants may
have been or it appeared were.

00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:23.490 align:middle line:84%
But you know, it's
interesting as you

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:27.690 align:middle line:84%
talk about the elongated skulls
and their particular abilities

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:29.820 align:middle line:84%
or sensitivities these
people may have had.

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:32.220 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're talking
about elongated skull,

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:34.590 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about enhanced
parietals and occipital,

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:36.690 align:middle line:90%
right, function in the brain.

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the more, I guess,
reflective intuitive kinds

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:46.720 align:middle line:84%
of abilities come off of
this region in the parietals.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And so interesting
that they have these

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:53.700 align:middle line:84%
enhanced proportions
to the brain.

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:55.530 align:middle line:84%
So there may have
had a higher degree

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:57.900 align:middle line:84%
of perhaps like
telepathic abilities

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.110 align:middle line:84%
or even intellectual
capacities as well.

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:02.400 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: I agree.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.050 align:middle line:90%
I really do agree with that.

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:07.170 align:middle line:84%
Because I think
their skull shape

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:09.990 align:middle line:84%
was apparently very
different to ours.

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And I do feel it increased
their sensitivity.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And there was one
researcher who I

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.250 align:middle line:84%
think it was back
in the 1980s made

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:20.880 align:middle line:84%
a very good point about
mankind's evolution

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.340 align:middle line:84%
maybe through the Neolithic,
maybe a little bit earlier

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:27.480 align:middle line:84%
in what's called the Mesolithic
period, which is about 10,000,

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.580 align:middle line:90%
you know, 15,000 years ago.

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:33.360 align:middle line:84%
It could be that at some point
in their evolutionary history

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.310 align:middle line:90%
that their senses crossed over.

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:39.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, our prevalent senses
now our sight and hearing.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And maybe for these
ancient people

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:44.370 align:middle line:84%
it could have been
smell and sight.

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And when it crossed
over to the senses that

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:51.660 align:middle line:84%
prevail for us today, maybe
they could have seen and heard

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:53.100 align:middle line:90%
color, for example.

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.610 align:middle line:90%
They could have heard color.

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:56.402 align:middle line:84%
And their senses could
have crossed over.

00:23:56.402 --> 00:23:58.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Makes sense,
because occipitals

00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:59.580 align:middle line:90%
are responsible for sight.

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:03.330 align:middle line:84%
Yes, that makes perfect sense
if they're enhanced or enlarged.

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:07.210 align:middle line:84%
So these people also,
as you say in your book,

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:11.790 align:middle line:84%
there's evidence they had a more
preferred diet, for example,

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:15.000 align:middle line:84%
a better diet than the
surrounding people that

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.540 align:middle line:84%
populated the area afterward
or a more superior diet.

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:20.230 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:21.030 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Yes.

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:23.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the way they grew
their food, if we start

00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:26.540 align:middle line:84%
looking at the layout of
ancient field systems,

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:29.040 align:middle line:84%
it's a quite a boring
topic, because it's not

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.710 align:middle line:84%
exotic like looking at
a pyramid, for example.

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:35.380 align:middle line:84%
But if we look at that kind
of practical everyday life,

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:38.790 align:middle line:84%
then they laid the field
systems out just like a temple,

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:41.700 align:middle line:84%
like facing the summer
solstice, facing the equinox.

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And that would be called a
co-axial line of the fields.

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And then they would align
them to different types

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:48.570 align:middle line:90%
of earth energy.

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that made a
better crop grow faster.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.790 align:middle line:84%
It was recorded in
ancient Greece--

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:56.070 align:middle line:90%
England had a good climate then.

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:57.360 align:middle line:90%
They had perfect climate.

00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:58.600 align:middle line:90%
Unbelievable today.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:24:59.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:01.091 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: They
had a better climate

00:25:01.091 --> 00:25:03.090 align:middle line:84%
and they would grow in
food for two harvests

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:05.730 align:middle line:90%
a year to supply ancient Greece.

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:07.020 align:middle line:90%
How are they achieving that?

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:09.750 align:middle line:84%
I think they were aligning
their fields to earth energies.

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And if only we could
turn back the clock

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:14.353 align:middle line:84%
and not have so many
chemicals on our food

00:25:14.353 --> 00:25:17.460 align:middle line:84%
now and look into these
old ways of growing food,

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:19.940 align:middle line:84%
I think our children
and ourselves

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:21.226 align:middle line:90%
would be far healthier.

00:25:21.226 --> 00:25:22.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:25.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, those movements do
exist, the organic movements.

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:28.820 align:middle line:84%
But also biodynamic
and anthroposophical

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:30.990 align:middle line:90%
gardening as well.

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:34.910 align:middle line:84%
These are fairly available,
you know, to study,

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:37.310 align:middle line:84%
if one wishes to grow a
garden in the old way,

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:39.140 align:middle line:84%
you know, with
the old knowledge.

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:40.790 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
you also say is

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:42.800 align:middle line:84%
that in the burial
chamber itself,

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:47.960 align:middle line:84%
it had layered materials, almost
an orgone type of energy that

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.362 align:middle line:90%
was emanating from there.

00:25:49.362 --> 00:25:50.570 align:middle line:90%
Talk about this a little bit.

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:52.820 align:middle line:84%
Because they would have been the
ones that had established that,

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:53.690 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:54.523 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Exactly.

00:25:54.523 --> 00:25:57.530 align:middle line:84%
The Neolithic people
for about 5 and 1/2

00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:00.220 align:middle line:84%
thousand years ago, if
we use orthodox dating--

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:02.182 align:middle line:84%
I actually put the clock
back a bit further.

00:26:02.182 --> 00:26:04.640 align:middle line:84%
There's new evidence coming
out from Oxford University that

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.000 align:middle line:84%
will put the clock
back to Mesolithic.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:06.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How much further?

00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:08.312 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: Probably
about 10,000 BC.

00:26:08.312 --> 00:26:09.111 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:26:09.111 --> 00:26:10.026 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:26:10.026 --> 00:26:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: That will come
out quite soon, actually.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.529 align:middle line:84%
As soon as one report
is out there, bingo,

00:26:13.529 --> 00:26:15.320 align:middle line:84%
everything's going to
change in time lines.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:15.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.336 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: By a
very simple piece

00:26:17.336 --> 00:26:19.490 align:middle line:84%
of evidence which I'm not
prepared to say today,

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:22.073 align:middle line:84%
because the paper has got to be
written by the archaeologists.

00:26:22.073 --> 00:26:24.650 align:middle line:90%
But it will change everything.

00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:28.700 align:middle line:84%
So I really do feel that
these elongated skulled people

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:33.230 align:middle line:84%
with the layout of their
food systems and their mounds

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:35.400 align:middle line:84%
that they created
were very special.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:38.480 align:middle line:84%
They would place the mound on a
particular earth energy point.

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:39.650 align:middle line:90%
It could be a ley line.

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:42.380 align:middle line:84%
More often than not, very
deep underground water

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:46.350 align:middle line:84%
mixed with earth currents
that release voltages.

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:48.930 align:middle line:84%
So an earth current
can release a voltage.

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:51.890 align:middle line:84%
Now they used to structure
their mounds in a particular way

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:53.050 align:middle line:90%
that you mentioned.

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's they would create
a layer of organic material,

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:58.820 align:middle line:90%
inorganic material, and so on.

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:00.320 align:middle line:90%
And they would layer that up.

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:03.890 align:middle line:84%
The finest example of
which is a later monument

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:07.490 align:middle line:84%
in the Bronze Age built
by the Bronze Age people,

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:08.630 align:middle line:90%
but that's Silbury Hill.

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:11.330 align:middle line:10%
And that's a huge
orgone generator.

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:15.020 align:middle line:10%
Because every single layer
there goes organic, inorganic.

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:19.100 align:middle line:84%
And when I did some tests with
a chap called David Webb who's

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:22.490 align:middle line:84%
an engineer, we took
the electrostatic field

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:25.280 align:middle line:84%
at the bottom and compared
it to the electrostatic field

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:28.850 align:middle line:84%
at the top, and it was
1,000 times greater.

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:31.880 align:middle line:84%
So Silbury Hill kicks
out energy, basically.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:32.990 align:middle line:90%
You can't see it.

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:34.572 align:middle line:90%
Some people can feel it.

00:27:34.572 --> 00:27:36.155 align:middle line:84%
It kind could give
you some goosebumps

00:27:36.155 --> 00:27:38.420 align:middle line:90%
if you're on top of the mound.

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And the long skulled people
were the first to create

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:43.790 align:middle line:84%
that technology in
the ancient landscape.

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:45.290 align:middle line:84%
So when we look at
a barrow, we need

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:46.956 align:middle line:84%
to think it's not
just a burial chamber.

00:27:46.956 --> 00:27:49.160 align:middle line:84%
It's not just an
initiation chamber.

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.400 align:middle line:84%
It's an energy capsule,
to a certain degree,

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:56.290 align:middle line:84%
that can enhance the earth
energies upon which it's sited.

00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:57.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hmm, interesting.

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.030 align:middle line:90%
Now a lot of these--

00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:04.619 align:middle line:84%
a lot of these bones and skulls
were dug up by John Thurnam.

00:28:04.619 --> 00:28:05.660 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: That's right.

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:09.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Dr. John Thurnam,
right, and spirited away.

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:11.600 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have
access to a lot of it.

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:15.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in earlier times, in
earlier archaeological digs,

00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:17.840 align:middle line:84%
it sounds as though
the archaeologists were

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:21.150 align:middle line:84%
respectful of the fact
that this is a burial place

00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:22.710 align:middle line:84%
and would often
leave things intact.

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:24.650 align:middle line:84%
They would check into
it and leave it intact.

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:26.090 align:middle line:84%
But this man was
rather aggressive

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:28.760 align:middle line:84%
in his cataloging and
collecting, right?

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:29.750 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Yes.

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what is
the implication of that?

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:32.840 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Yes.

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:34.310 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:37.640 align:middle line:84%
Because when you had the
turn of the 19th century,

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:40.190 align:middle line:84%
basically, if you had a lot of
money and you were a landowner

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:43.760 align:middle line:84%
and you had a shovel, you
could dig where you wanted to.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:44.810 align:middle line:90%
But they were respectful.

00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And that was Sir Richard Colt
Hoare and William Cunnington.

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And what they did they
would do the finds

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:52.736 align:middle line:84%
like the Neolithic high
queen on Salisbury Plain,

00:28:52.736 --> 00:28:53.860 align:middle line:90%
and they would put it back.

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:55.520 align:middle line:84%
And they would put
a coin of their era

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.880 align:middle line:84%
by it to say this was
the year it was dug.

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:02.750 align:middle line:84%
Along came John Thurnam and
he was very disrespectful

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:04.700 align:middle line:90%
and some would say obsessive.

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:07.950 align:middle line:84%
Because he started to hoard
skull after skull after skull

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:08.750 align:middle line:90%
after skull.

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:10.910 align:middle line:90%
And his collection was immense.

00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:13.280 align:middle line:84%
It contained all of
the Stonehenge environs

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:17.060 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of the long
barrow finds from the whole

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:19.010 align:middle line:90%
of the southwest of England.

00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:21.620 align:middle line:84%
So he had an extensive
archive which

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:23.870 align:middle line:84%
he dedicated to,
after his death,

00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:26.285 align:middle line:84%
incidentally, to
Cambridge University.

00:29:26.285 --> 00:29:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going to say, so
that is where it's housed now.

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:31.640 align:middle line:84%
Have they ever done
any DNA testing?

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:32.750 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: No.

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:34.996 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What the heck?

00:29:34.996 --> 00:29:37.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is the one thing
that comes up in this field

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:38.920 align:middle line:90%
over and over again.

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:41.390 align:middle line:84%
You find these anomalies
and they say, oh well,

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:43.500 align:middle line:84%
nobody's bothered
having the DNA tested.

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.080 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:47.400 align:middle line:90%
That makes no sense.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:50.780 align:middle line:10%
>>WHEATLEY: It makes no sense
because maybe DNA testing would

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:53.090 align:middle line:10%
be somewhat problematic
to a certain degree

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:57.590 align:middle line:10%
on the Neolithic high queen
because during transportation

00:29:57.590 --> 00:30:01.370 align:middle line:10%
in the 19th century she
got a little bit battered

00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:04.850 align:middle line:10%
and part of her skull broke and
she was glued back together.

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:06.980 align:middle line:90%
So that is called contaminated.

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:09.560 align:middle line:84%
But you could go into her
teeth and her isotopes

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:11.690 align:middle line:84%
and take isotope
samples and find out

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:14.060 align:middle line:84%
where she was, you know,
first drinking her water,

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:18.250 align:middle line:84%
eating her food, that type of
thing to build up a picture.

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:20.820 align:middle line:84%
But Cambridge University,
when I asked, you know,

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:25.510 align:middle line:84%
I asked for DNA because I know
other researchers are looking

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:26.950 align:middle line:90%
to the skulls of Paracas.

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And you've interviewed
Andy Collins,

00:30:29.050 --> 00:30:34.560 align:middle line:84%
he's looked into the tall
people of Europe and beyond.

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:35.590 align:middle line:90%
And yes, they do.

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:37.220 align:middle line:90%
But no, Cambridge won't do that.

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:39.260 align:middle line:90%
They don't want the DNA testing.

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:42.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's now
talk about the lifestyle

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:44.440 align:middle line:90%
in the day of these people.

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:48.400 align:middle line:84%
They had this more advanced
agricultural practices

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:49.490 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:53.230 align:middle line:84%
But there were concurrently
another species

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:54.670 align:middle line:90%
with round skulls.

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And you find these in the
rounded mountains or barrows,

00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:58.970 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:01.180 align:middle line:84%
The burials are in
round one rather than

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:04.750 align:middle line:84%
these elongated barrows
for the elongated skulls.

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:07.270 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what you
know of the other people.

00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:11.650 align:middle line:90%
And what do you know of them?

00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:15.280 align:middle line:84%
What do you know of them maybe
even on a DNA or genetic level?

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And what do you know
of how they were living

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:21.220 align:middle line:84%
and if they were the ones that
murdered the elongated skulls?

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:25.761 align:middle line:84%
And have people pieced this
together kind of historically?

00:31:25.761 --> 00:31:27.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: Historically,
nobody has pieced this

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:30.070 align:middle line:84%
together except a
researcher, you know,

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:33.690 align:middle line:84%
such as myself that I had looked
into the antiquarian reports

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:35.470 align:middle line:90%
through the moment of dowsing.

00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:38.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and yet, Cambridge
University, like I say,

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:39.070 align:middle line:90%
ignored it.

00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:39.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:41.531 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: But
during that research,

00:31:41.531 --> 00:31:45.610 align:middle line:84%
one barrow stood out as quite
a kind of research gold.

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:47.710 align:middle line:84%
It's called Belas
Knap long barrow.

00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's situated in a beautiful
county in the Cotswolds

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.570 align:middle line:84%
in England called
Gloucestershire.

00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:54.880 align:middle line:84%
It is very nice, and I'd
recommend anyone listening

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:58.189 align:middle line:84%
to this show Google it, you will
go there and it's fantastic.

00:31:58.189 --> 00:31:59.605 align:middle line:84%
It's what's called
a horned barrow

00:31:59.605 --> 00:32:03.020 align:middle line:84%
and very different from the
Salisbury Plain long barrows.

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:05.050 align:middle line:84%
It's like a kind
of tureen shape,

00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:07.570 align:middle line:84%
you know, with these horns
that come out like this.

00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:09.370 align:middle line:90%
It's very beautiful.

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:11.800 align:middle line:84%
Now an archaeologist
was reevaluating

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:13.510 align:middle line:90%
the finds of Belas Knap.

00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And he found at what's
called the false entrance you

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:19.930 align:middle line:84%
have these huge kind of earthen
horns with a false entrance.

00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:22.210 align:middle line:84%
Why the ancients did
that is still a mystery,

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:24.100 align:middle line:84%
because you had
chambers at the side

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:26.590 align:middle line:84%
with this huge false
entrance front.

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:30.340 align:middle line:84%
But placed side by side in
this false entrance wall

00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:34.930 align:middle line:84%
was an elongated skull
next to a round skull.

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And at first the
archaeologists thought,

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.440 align:middle line:90%
oh, it's a later edition.

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.960 align:middle line:84%
The round skull went
in much, much later.

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.750 align:middle line:84%
But it turned out
through radiocarbon

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:46.210 align:middle line:84%
dating that they
were contemporary.

00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:50.020 align:middle line:84%
So these people, at one point,
were cohabiting, living side

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:52.480 align:middle line:90%
by side in the British Isles.

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:55.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What was the stature
of the round skulled people,

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:56.440 align:middle line:90%
roughly?

00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Were they the same height
and the same height

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.720 align:middle line:84%
range as the elongated
skulled people?

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:03.670 align:middle line:90%
Or with they larger, smaller?

00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:06.730 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: They were probably
larger, it is thought.

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:10.600 align:middle line:10%
Because when you start to
look at the finds in the round

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:12.670 align:middle line:10%
barrows that
surround Stonehenge,

00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:15.010 align:middle line:10%
especially a place
called Woodyates,

00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:18.460 align:middle line:10%
which is a huge round
barrow cemetery, that you

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:21.210 align:middle line:10%
find very, very tall people.

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:23.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking beyond six foot six.

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Some could be reaching
seven feet and beyond that.

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:28.870 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one barrow
from Stonehenge,

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:34.780 align:middle line:84%
someone that had a stature of
13 feet came out of the ground.

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:36.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:38.860 align:middle line:90%
So these were larger people.

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:43.720 align:middle line:84%
And they murdered a lot of
the elongated skulled people,

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:46.240 align:middle line:84%
as you found in your
research, with cracked skulls,

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.500 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:49.870 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds as though if
they were of larger stature,

00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:52.180 align:middle line:84%
that would not have been
difficult to accomplish.

00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:56.560 align:middle line:84%
So has anyone looked
into it intuitively even

00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:01.900 align:middle line:84%
to see what the elongated
people were bringing

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:05.440 align:middle line:84%
to the equation that was
threatening to the others

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:08.739 align:middle line:84%
that they would had to have been
murdered by the round skulled

00:34:08.739 --> 00:34:10.540 align:middle line:90%
taller people of the day?

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:12.520 align:middle line:84%
Was it just that
they were different?

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Did they possess something
that others wished to possess?

00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:19.100 align:middle line:90%
Or what was it, do you think?

00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:23.889 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: I think one
important fact is lifestyle.

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:27.639 align:middle line:84%
The elongated people
were more communal.

00:34:27.639 --> 00:34:30.219 align:middle line:90%
They would live more together.

00:34:30.219 --> 00:34:31.810 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have land ownership.

00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:35.889 align:middle line:84%
In England in the Neolithic, you
didn't have land ownership, OK.

00:34:35.889 --> 00:34:37.960 align:middle line:84%
So you didn't have
fenced off fields.

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.030 align:middle line:90%
You didn't have this is my land.

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:43.719 align:middle line:84%
When it came to the Bronze Age
and the building of the round

00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:47.199 align:middle line:84%
barrows by the round skulled
people they started to dominate

00:34:47.199 --> 00:34:48.580 align:middle line:90%
and divide the land up.

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:51.050 align:middle line:90%
This is my part of the land.

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:54.949 align:middle line:84%
So it was a completely
different lifestyle and culture.

00:34:54.949 --> 00:34:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it must've been
a really big thing for them

00:34:57.530 --> 00:34:58.330 align:middle line:90%
in the day.

00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:00.190 align:middle line:84%
Because if you are
used to a culture

00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:01.750 align:middle line:84%
and another culture
comes in and says

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:03.850 align:middle line:84%
this isn't happening
anymore, it is

00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:07.180 align:middle line:84%
going to either lead to
conflict or resolving.

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:10.280 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think it resolved
in the Stonehenge environs.

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:12.640 align:middle line:84%
So I think the first
thing was the land

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:17.050 align:middle line:84%
no longer was belonged by all,
it was belonged by the few.

00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:20.990 align:middle line:84%
And we find, when we look into
the round barrows of especially

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:25.910 align:middle line:84%
the Late and Middle Bronze Age,
that you have masses of wealth.

00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And personalized,
one person would

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:32.740 align:middle line:84%
go into the round barrows
full of wealth, gold, finds,

00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:33.740 align:middle line:90%
and things like that it.

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:36.950 align:middle line:84%
It was a case of the ego
grew more and more and more

00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:37.910 align:middle line:90%
in the Bronze Age.

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And you had more and more
what's called ranch boundaries.

00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:44.360 align:middle line:84%
That's huge land division
crossing the Salisbury

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:48.350 align:middle line:90%
Plain for up to 20 miles.

00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:50.331 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, I
find this fascinating.

00:35:50.331 --> 00:35:52.580 align:middle line:84%
And most of your countrymen
aren't aware of this story

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:53.190 align:middle line:90%
either, I assume.

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:53.990 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: No.

00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is still
very little known.

00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:56.580 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:58.050 align:middle line:84%
So we had these
ancient cultures.

00:35:58.050 --> 00:36:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And it will remain a
mystery until DNA testing

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:05.420 align:middle line:84%
is done as to who the elongated
skulled smaller people were.

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And so is there
anything else you'd

00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:09.510 align:middle line:84%
like to pass on
regarding that story

00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:13.130 align:middle line:84%
before we go on to ley lines and
some more general information

00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:16.190 align:middle line:84%
about male and female,
Mary and Michael lines

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:18.390 align:middle line:90%
and sacred sites and the like?

00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:21.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: I'd just like to say
there was one DNA testing done

00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:23.300 align:middle line:90%
of what's called Cheddar Man.

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And Cheddar Man comes
from Somerset in the UK.

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And they did some DNA
testing recently on him.

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:35.580 align:middle line:84%
He had a good surviving amount
in his skull and in his teeth.

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:39.290 align:middle line:84%
And what they found was he
was very dark skinned, very

00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:41.591 align:middle line:84%
Mediterranean, but
with blue eyes.

00:36:41.591 --> 00:36:43.590 align:middle line:84%
So he would have been
quite striking to look at.

00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:45.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was this a
round skulled person?

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.064 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: Well, it
was an in between.

00:36:47.064 --> 00:36:49.100 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't elongated,
it wasn't round.

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:52.235 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very famous
find called Cheddar Man.

00:36:52.235 --> 00:36:53.306 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:53.306 --> 00:36:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: But
at Oxford, that's

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:57.080 align:middle line:90%
what they released to the media.

00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:59.510 align:middle line:84%
But behind the scenes
in nature magazine

00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:01.730 align:middle line:84%
and journals that
you subscribe to,

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:03.524 align:middle line:84%
they were saying
one step further.

00:37:03.524 --> 00:37:05.690 align:middle line:84%
Not only could he have been
very dark Mediterranean,

00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:07.730 align:middle line:90%
he could have even been black.

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:11.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were there other
remains found like Cheddar Man

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:16.064 align:middle line:84%
or was he a sole person who
wandered into this region?

00:37:16.064 --> 00:37:17.480 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: It's
difficult to say,

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:20.810 align:middle line:84%
because he died within the
cave system in Somerset,

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:23.320 align:middle line:90%
so he was a lone find.

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:28.100 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, his DNA is
challenging the perception

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:30.200 align:middle line:90%
of the ancient Britons.

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:31.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I suppose
it is, especially

00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:36.410 align:middle line:84%
with all your strawberries and
rosy cheeks now and everything.

00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:39.950 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's move on to the system
of ley lines and the notion

00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:42.380 align:middle line:84%
that animals know to
follow these lines, even.

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:46.110 align:middle line:84%
They instinctively know
where these energy lines are.

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:47.804 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
ley lines a bit.

00:37:47.804 --> 00:37:49.970 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: Yeah, you've
got lots of different types

00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:51.800 align:middle line:90%
of leys, for example.

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.770 align:middle line:84%
But one that you've
just cited, an example,

00:37:53.770 --> 00:37:57.680 align:middle line:84%
the ones that animals follow,
we call them track lines.

00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
thing about track lines

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:03.770 align:middle line:84%
is we feel as dowsers that
certain animals seem to follow

00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:05.070 align:middle line:90%
them more than others.

00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:09.590 align:middle line:84%
So for example, sheep,
horses, cows, wildebeests,

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:11.180 align:middle line:90%
they seem to follow track lines.

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And they can go for mile after
mile after mile without tiring,

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:18.030 align:middle line:84%
so we think it energizes
the physical body.

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:21.590 align:middle line:84%
So when ancient man
created these roadways,

00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:24.350 align:middle line:84%
which we call in
the UK ridgeways,

00:38:24.350 --> 00:38:25.230 align:middle line:90%
they're very ancient.

00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:28.940 align:middle line:84%
They go back 10,000, 15,000
years ago, ancient man

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:32.270 align:middle line:84%
was creating these road systems,
they follow track lines.

00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:35.910 align:middle line:84%
So you could walk or
ride horses or whatever

00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:38.215 align:middle line:90%
for a long, long distance.

00:38:38.215 --> 00:38:39.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
it makes sense.

00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:41.960 align:middle line:84%
You would follow a trail
that's already been partially

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.630 align:middle line:84%
laid, on one hand,
just that ease in terms

00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:46.430 align:middle line:90%
of clearing of anything.

00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:49.160 align:middle line:84%
But did they also understand
that those animals

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:51.500 align:middle line:84%
were following this pathway
with their own intelligence

00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:53.130 align:middle line:90%
for a reason?

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:55.220 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: It could well
be the case, actually.

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:58.040 align:middle line:84%
But what we do know
through dowsing,

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:01.130 align:middle line:84%
these energies such as
the ridgeways and leys,

00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:03.080 align:middle line:84%
they give off one
particular pattern

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:05.450 align:middle line:84%
of three lines and
then three lines.

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:07.620 align:middle line:84%
We call it a double
triad line, if you're

00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:10.980 align:middle line:84%
using dowsing terminology,
which is not necessary.

00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:14.040 align:middle line:84%
But it really does show you
that these lines of a ley

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:17.660 align:middle line:84%
line rather than-- it sounds so
singular when you say ley line.

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:20.450 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually constructed
of various different lines

00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:23.759 align:middle line:84%
that give it a kind of
force in the landscape.

00:39:23.759 --> 00:39:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then you also have
intersection points as well,

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:29.180 align:middle line:84%
these vector points where
these lines cross and meet,

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:30.840 align:middle line:90%
which we'll talk about as well.

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that
was known even the famous John

00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:38.570 align:middle line:84%
Dee, royal astrologer,
mathematician of the day,

00:39:38.570 --> 00:39:40.340 align:middle line:84%
he talked about ley
lines back then.

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:42.590 align:middle line:84%
So it was understood
a while back.

00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:44.660 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a modern
phenomenon, a new age

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:45.756 align:middle line:90%
phenomenon.

00:39:45.756 --> 00:39:46.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: No, not at all.

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:50.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he wrote that in a book
called "Mathematical Preface."

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And he pointed out there was the
immortal beams and the energy

00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:55.190 align:middle line:90%
lines.

00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And if you even go
to Kenilworth Castle,

00:39:57.950 --> 00:40:00.980 align:middle line:84%
for example, in the north
of England where Doctor John

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:05.000 align:middle line:84%
Dee made the chambers
for Queen Elizabeth I,

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.790 align:middle line:84%
then you will find those
are on energy lines, too.

00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:08.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, of course.

00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And so the energy
lines are laid out

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:14.870 align:middle line:84%
in your world in male
and female energy lines.

00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And the Knight
Templar, you say, were

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:19.450 align:middle line:84%
aware of these lines in
these intersection points.

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And certain sacred sites were
consecrated on those vector

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:25.640 align:middle line:90%
points or on particular lines.

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
Mary and Michael lines.

00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:31.880 align:middle line:10%
>>WHEATLEY: Well,
Mary and Michael lines

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:35.960 align:middle line:10%
were discovered in the 1980s
by a wonderful, very competent

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:38.450 align:middle line:10%
dowser called Hamish
Miller, who I've worked with

00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:41.270 align:middle line:10%
and he forwarded one of
my books, for example.

00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:44.820 align:middle line:10%
He realized that a ley
line isn't just a line.

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And this was a seminal
discovery then.

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:49.430 align:middle line:84%
Because he looked to
the St. Michael ley line

00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:54.320 align:middle line:84%
and realized there was two
currents coiling around it,

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:56.480 align:middle line:84%
you know, like the
caduceus figure.

00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:00.230 align:middle line:84%
If you project back that the
landscape that's a ley system.

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And it has living
sentient earth energies

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:04.250 align:middle line:90%
coiling around the ley.

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:06.290 align:middle line:84%
The energies that
coil around the ley

00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:10.010 align:middle line:84%
are really very, very
powerful, even so more powerful

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:10.970 align:middle line:90%
than the ley.

00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:13.640 align:middle line:84%
I pointed out to Hamish
and some other dowsers

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:17.270 align:middle line:84%
the reason why I think those
energies coil around the ley

00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:19.940 align:middle line:84%
is the ley is anchoring
in those energies,

00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:23.610 align:middle line:84%
because they're never more than
five miles apart from the ley.

00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:26.990 align:middle line:84%
So the sophistication of
the understanding of leys

00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:30.500 align:middle line:84%
and the earth currents, our
ancestors had that knowledge.

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And we're kind of
rediscovering that knowledge.

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:34.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk about
some of the sacred sites

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:39.455 align:middle line:84%
you would find, say, along
a particularly female line,

00:41:39.455 --> 00:41:42.840 align:middle line:90%
a Mary line or a Michael line.

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:46.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: Along the
female earth current--

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:48.890 align:middle line:84%
it's coined the Mary
line, but we imagine it

00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:51.712 align:middle line:84%
as a river of
scintillating blue light.

00:41:51.712 --> 00:41:53.253 align:middle line:84%
That's how all
dowsers and geomancers

00:41:53.253 --> 00:41:55.910 align:middle line:90%
see the Mary current.

00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:58.010 align:middle line:84%
The Mary current
goes to low ground.

00:41:58.010 --> 00:42:00.145 align:middle line:84%
She will go to the
water, to springs.

00:42:00.145 --> 00:42:02.120 align:middle line:90%
She'll follow a river.

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:05.460 align:middle line:84%
She'll go around low almost
like breast-shaped hills.

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:07.100 align:middle line:90%
Very feminine.

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:12.740 align:middle line:84%
Then the Knights Templar and
the secret societies and Masons,

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:15.410 align:middle line:84%
they built churches
on the female earth

00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:17.820 align:middle line:90%
currents dedicated to a female.

00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:21.530 align:middle line:84%
In Mary's instant,
for example, it's

00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:23.220 align:middle line:90%
dedicated to Mary Magdalene.

00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:24.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:24.785 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Or the Virgin Mary.

00:42:24.785 --> 00:42:25.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:27.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: So we can
understand the nature

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:30.080 align:middle line:84%
of an earth current
in a church by whom

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.910 align:middle line:90%
the church is dedicated.

00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:33.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about the Michael line.

00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And then let's talk
about Rosslyn Chapel,

00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:38.042 align:middle line:90%
just for kicks, OK.

00:42:38.042 --> 00:42:39.000 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Yeah, sure.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.374 align:middle line:84%
Well, Michael, on
the other hand,

00:42:40.374 --> 00:42:41.750 align:middle line:90%
is very different to Mary.

00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:45.860 align:middle line:10%
He will sort out the very high
places like Glastonbury Tor.

00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:47.960 align:middle line:10%
And he will go to
the tops of mountains

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:50.420 align:middle line:10%
and he'll go to very
phallic shaped stones,

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:53.360 align:middle line:10%
for example,
targeting male energy.

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And sited upon the St.
Michael current you

00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:59.510 align:middle line:84%
have churches dedicated
to dragon slayers

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:02.090 align:middle line:90%
like St. Michael and St. George.

00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:05.360 align:middle line:84%
So it's interesting to know
that the early Christians,

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:07.460 align:middle line:84%
the Culdees, as
they're often called,

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:10.800 align:middle line:84%
which was a crossover of
Druidism to Christianity

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:16.070 align:middle line:84%
knew this science and
dedicated the churches to them.

00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:17.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's fascinating.

00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:20.880 align:middle line:84%
Now let's go to Rosslyn
Chapel in Scotland, OK.

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And what do we have there
in terms of ley lines?

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.340 align:middle line:84%
Because that's-- well, it's
become popularized for sure.

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:27.960 align:middle line:10%
But it's a very
interesting place

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:31.130 align:middle line:10%
when you look at the
artwork and carvings

00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:33.020 align:middle line:10%
on the inside of
the pagan Green Man

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:37.501 align:middle line:10%
to the very kind of strict
Christian iconography of today.

00:43:37.501 --> 00:43:39.500 align:middle line:10%
>>WHEATLEY: Yes, I think
it's a gem of Scotland.

00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:40.300 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I do too.

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:41.340 align:middle line:10%
I love it.

00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:43.760 align:middle line:10%
>>WHEATLEY: It's a real gem
for anybody to go and visit.

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:45.371 align:middle line:90%
And it's very intriguing.

00:43:45.371 --> 00:43:47.870 align:middle line:84%
It's very intriguing from the
moment you go through the door

00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:48.950 align:middle line:90%
to the moment you leave.

00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:49.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: Now the one
thing that really marks out

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:55.640 align:middle line:84%
the chapel is you have a
huge line marking the access

00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:57.590 align:middle line:90%
line from east to west.

00:43:57.590 --> 00:44:00.380 align:middle line:84%
What the Christians
did, the pagans,

00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:02.240 align:middle line:84%
to try understand
this concept fully,

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:04.446 align:middle line:84%
the pagans loved
everything circular.

00:44:04.446 --> 00:44:05.320 align:middle line:90%
They would look for--

00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:06.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Feminine.

00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:08.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: Feminine and
circular earth energies

00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:10.970 align:middle line:84%
that are kind of
the harmonic surface

00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:12.390 align:middle line:90%
pattern of underground water.

00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:14.777 align:middle line:84%
It generates a
circle and a spiral.

00:44:14.777 --> 00:44:16.610 align:middle line:84%
The Christians came
along and thought, well,

00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:18.470 align:middle line:84%
we don't want that
kind of pagan stuff.

00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:20.900 align:middle line:84%
We'll look for the
geocross in the land.

00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And the geocross in the
land is like one ley

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:26.140 align:middle line:84%
going one way and a
cross going the other.

00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:30.350 align:middle line:84%
It's a Christian symbol that
gives sanctity to that church.

00:44:30.350 --> 00:44:34.070 align:middle line:84%
So when we go to places like the
chapel, that wonderful chapel,

00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:36.890 align:middle line:84%
they have that crossing
point of those two leys.

00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:38.780 align:middle line:90%
It's the cross in the land.

00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And too, kind of the
Culdees, I mentioned,

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:45.620 align:middle line:84%
which was the crossover of
Christianity from Druidism,

00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:47.750 align:middle line:84%
they would look
at these energies

00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:51.330 align:middle line:84%
and they would look at it as a
kind of body in the landscape.

00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:54.830 align:middle line:84%
So if you imagine that on
this ley crossing system

00:44:54.830 --> 00:44:57.890 align:middle line:84%
you project a body, that
the head of that body

00:44:57.890 --> 00:44:59.490 align:middle line:90%
is at the altar.

00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:01.700 align:middle line:90%
The feet are at the end.

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:04.947 align:middle line:84%
And then the hands are laid out
just like Jesus on the cross.

00:45:04.947 --> 00:45:06.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:07.530 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: That's
their perception.

00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:10.970 align:middle line:84%
Then the metaphysical
perception of that is it's

00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:13.610 align:middle line:90%
the crown chakra at the top.

00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's very
interesting to know,

00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:19.450 align:middle line:84%
as you walk up any
medieval church or chapel,

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:22.000 align:middle line:84%
you go from the bottom, you
walk along the axis line,

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.270 align:middle line:84%
you will go up a step to
where the choir sings.

00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:26.290 align:middle line:90%
We would recognize that.

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:28.420 align:middle line:90%
That's the throat chakra.

00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:31.720 align:middle line:84%
Then you go up another
level, you go up another step

00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:34.350 align:middle line:84%
and you'll reach the
third eye chakra point.

00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll
go up another step

00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:37.840 align:middle line:84%
and you'll reach
the crown chakra.

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:39.940 align:middle line:84%
The steps are there
to say this is raising

00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:45.152 align:middle line:84%
your consciousness to the altar,
altered state of consciousness.

00:45:45.152 --> 00:45:46.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you for that.

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:48.610 align:middle line:84%
I just-- I'm fascinated
with that as well,

00:45:48.610 --> 00:45:50.650 align:middle line:84%
and I'm fascinated with
that particular chapel.

00:45:50.650 --> 00:45:55.660 align:middle line:84%
Just it's visually just so
interesting to spend time in.

00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:59.110 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about before we go
into how we can use this energy

00:45:59.110 --> 00:46:02.200 align:middle line:84%
and use the dowsing ourselves
as you call to spiritualize

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:05.530 align:middle line:84%
our homes, our own sacred
places in our own lives,

00:46:05.530 --> 00:46:07.600 align:middle line:84%
even a room in our
home, let's talk

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:13.510 align:middle line:84%
about dragon lines and
aquastat areas just briefly.

00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:17.000 align:middle line:84%
Because dragon lines, you
say, really amplify emotions,

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.324 align:middle line:84%
for example, thoughts
and emotions.

00:46:19.324 --> 00:46:20.365 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: That's right.

00:46:20.365 --> 00:46:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Dragon lines do amplify
our thoughts and emotions.

00:46:23.770 --> 00:46:27.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how do we know
where a dragon line might be?

00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:28.060 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Yes.

00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:30.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's easy
in the UK because we

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:31.630 align:middle line:90%
have lots of ancient sites.

00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:35.110 align:middle line:84%
So you can start to plot on maps
and things, you know, a course.

00:46:35.110 --> 00:46:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And dowsing will help
you to fine tune that.

00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:40.639 align:middle line:84%
Visualizing and sensing
will help you as well.

00:46:40.639 --> 00:46:42.430 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to be
a dowser to understand

00:46:42.430 --> 00:46:45.210 align:middle line:84%
the ancient landscape,
it just helps a bit.

00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:47.590 align:middle line:84%
It was Hamish Miller that
first kind of studied

00:46:47.590 --> 00:46:51.460 align:middle line:84%
the effects of the dragon
lines upon human consciousness.

00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:55.000 align:middle line:84%
And he noticed repeatedly
that people would

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.370 align:middle line:90%
go really high or really low.

00:46:57.370 --> 00:46:59.140 align:middle line:84%
So he thought, yes,
it amplifies it.

00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:02.340 align:middle line:84%
You have to be quite balanced
to live amid earth energies.

00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:04.960 align:middle line:84%
Let us not forget,
our ancient ancestors

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:09.032 align:middle line:84%
created these ancient sites
to go to and come away from.

00:47:09.032 --> 00:47:10.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, it's very true.

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:12.250 align:middle line:84%
Even in Sedona the
Native Americans

00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:15.010 align:middle line:84%
would go into the area
that is now Sedona.

00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And they would use it
for ceremony and ritual,

00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:18.940 align:middle line:84%
but they knew to
never live there.

00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:20.530 align:middle line:90%
They lived outside.

00:47:20.530 --> 00:47:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And now you have people from
all over the world living there.

00:47:23.410 --> 00:47:24.710 align:middle line:90%
And you're absolutely right.

00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:28.540 align:middle line:84%
If you're not a well balanced
and bolted together person,

00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:31.180 align:middle line:84%
the oddest things start
happening to people's lives.

00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And usually the experience
will kick them right out

00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:38.400 align:middle line:84%
of Sedona, usually
penniless and heartbroken.

00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:40.060 align:middle line:90%
And you know, it's fascinating.

00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:42.700 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: That is
so true and reflective

00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:46.946 align:middle line:84%
of Avebury, of people that
go to Stonehenge too much.

00:47:46.946 --> 00:47:48.070 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm quite grounded.

00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:49.445 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What
about Glastonbury?

00:47:49.445 --> 00:47:53.090 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: Glastonbury is dark
and light entwined, you know.

00:47:53.090 --> 00:47:54.564 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
how I felt there.

00:47:54.564 --> 00:47:56.980 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: I think you're
very correct in your perception

00:47:56.980 --> 00:47:58.540 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
of Glastonbury.

00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Because just like Sedona, you
will get people going there

00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:03.310 align:middle line:90%
with dreams and visions.

00:48:03.310 --> 00:48:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And they will leave
with sometimes nothing.

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:07.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Broken. yes, exactly.

00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:08.740 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about aquastat,
aquastatic energy and yin-yang

00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:18.080 align:middle line:90%
waters underneath the land.

00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:18.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Yes.

00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:23.110 align:middle line:84%
Well as a kind of water diviner
from a very young child,

00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:26.520 align:middle line:84%
my late father and other dowsers
alike always pointed out,

00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:28.030 align:middle line:90%
there's two types of water.

00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:30.400 align:middle line:84%
The first type we
call yang water.

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:32.800 align:middle line:84%
It falls from the sky and
fills up the aquifers.

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:33.730 align:middle line:90%
Everybody knows that.

00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And geologists would
be nodding away

00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:37.580 align:middle line:84%
saying yes, I'm in
agreement with that.

00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:40.780 align:middle line:84%
But we say as dowsers
there's another type of water

00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:43.570 align:middle line:90%
born within the womb of Gaia.

00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:47.080 align:middle line:84%
She perpetually and chemically
generates this water.

00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And where that
water breaks through

00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:52.750 align:middle line:84%
to the surface, that's your holy
spring with medicinal healing

00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:54.010 align:middle line:90%
power, yeah.

00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And the two give off a different
harmonic surface pattern.

00:48:57.100 --> 00:49:00.100 align:middle line:84%
That's basically what dowsers
pick up with dowsing rods.

00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:03.130 align:middle line:84%
Yang water gives a kind of
three wave in the landscape.

00:49:03.130 --> 00:49:06.190 align:middle line:84%
So if I was crossing
it, bang, bang, bang.

00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:08.950 align:middle line:84%
That's the international
sign for water.

00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:12.690 align:middle line:84%
Even if you go to a
cartouche in ancient Egypt,

00:49:12.690 --> 00:49:15.224 align:middle line:84%
a broken chevron
sign means water.

00:49:15.224 --> 00:49:16.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: You can
go to any culture.

00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:19.810 align:middle line:90%
So that's yang water.

00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:22.090 align:middle line:84%
Yin water, born within
the womb of Gaia,

00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:24.160 align:middle line:90%
gives off a spiral effect.

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:26.560 align:middle line:84%
Now I've been saying this
for many, many years.

00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I've been
mocked for saying that,

00:49:29.170 --> 00:49:33.640 align:middle line:84%
but I say come on, Gaia produces
sulfur, plutonium, uranium.

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:36.750 align:middle line:84%
Why wouldn't she
produce her own waters?

00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And thankfully,
scientists that were

00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:43.450 align:middle line:84%
looking into the deep
waters for oil and minerals

00:49:43.450 --> 00:49:46.360 align:middle line:84%
beneath Peking, modern
day Beijing, they

00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:50.050 align:middle line:84%
found that in all probability,
the rocks beneath there

00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:51.290 align:middle line:90%
were producing water.

00:49:51.290 --> 00:49:52.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:49:52.090 --> 00:49:56.020 align:middle line:84%
I just had this conversation
with Manjir Samanta-Laughton

00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:59.950 align:middle line:84%
on the same subject about the
earth producing her own water.

00:49:59.950 --> 00:50:03.580 align:middle line:84%
Which is something that
needs to be very well studied

00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:05.530 align:middle line:90%
and embraced, in my opinion.

00:50:05.530 --> 00:50:10.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's more desirable
to live over yin or yang?

00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:11.420 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Yin.

00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:15.100 align:middle line:84%
Because the yang water
with that three kind

00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:17.920 align:middle line:84%
of pattern, energy
pattern, gives off

00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:20.190 align:middle line:90%
what's called geopathic stress.

00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And geopathic stress will
break down your immune system

00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:26.110 align:middle line:90%
with long term exposure.

00:50:26.110 --> 00:50:28.900 align:middle line:84%
By that, I mean you got to live
over that for over five years

00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:29.700 align:middle line:90%
minimum.

00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:31.540 align:middle line:84%
But it will break your
immune system down.

00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Kathe
Bachler of Germany,

00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:37.300 align:middle line:84%
who did the most research
into geopathic stress

00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:38.980 align:middle line:90%
called them cancer houses.

00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:42.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how are we
able to dowse to find out

00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:43.990 align:middle line:90%
what we're living over?

00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:45.740 align:middle line:90%
How would that take place?

00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: Dowse is
relatively simple.

00:50:47.810 --> 00:50:48.730 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:50:48.730 --> 00:50:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And anyone and
everyone can dowse.

00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:53.940 align:middle line:84%
I've taught hundreds of
people and lots of schoolkids.

00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:56.320 align:middle line:84%
I take out, you know,
children from the Netherlands.

00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And within five minutes I
can get anybody dowsing.

00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:03.200 align:middle line:84%
But it's really easy because
you just identify the pattern.

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:06.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to be
three lines crossing

00:51:06.070 --> 00:51:09.790 align:middle line:84%
your landscape or maybe six if
there's a crossing of a stream.

00:51:09.790 --> 00:51:14.100 align:middle line:84%
And to find the healing
harmonics of aquastats or geo

00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:18.220 align:middle line:84%
spirals, they give off
more a spiral pattern.

00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's really interesting to
see the layout of stately homes

00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:26.500 align:middle line:84%
and large buildings built
by the medieval Masons.

00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:29.140 align:middle line:84%
They always were above
those spiral patterns.

00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:32.300 align:middle line:84%
They're called habitation
spirals to a diviner.

00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:34.200 align:middle line:84%
So they knew what
they were doing.

00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And I know that the aristocracy
had better diets than the more

00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:40.190 align:middle line:90%
kind of working class people.

00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:43.210 align:middle line:84%
But none the less,
their life expectancy

00:51:43.210 --> 00:51:45.400 align:middle line:84%
was much, much greater,
and I contribute

00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:48.650 align:middle line:84%
part of that to the land
upon which they live.

00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:49.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:51:49.450 --> 00:51:50.080 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:51.920 align:middle line:84%
So we need to learn--
well, first of all,

00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:54.400 align:middle line:84%
you have, I just
want to say this now,

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:57.160 align:middle line:84%
you do a very good
job of helping people

00:51:57.160 --> 00:52:00.920 align:middle line:84%
learn how to dowse these kinds
of properties in your book.

00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:02.330 align:middle line:90%
It's a really good how-to book.

00:52:02.330 --> 00:52:04.570 align:middle line:84%
So we'll send people
there for sure.

00:52:04.570 --> 00:52:07.300 align:middle line:84%
But right now in
case anyone wants

00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:10.180 align:middle line:84%
to get a jump on it
before the book arrives,

00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:12.640 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about our own
domain, wherever we're living,

00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:16.930 align:middle line:84%
whether we're living
over a dragon line

00:52:16.930 --> 00:52:20.410 align:middle line:84%
or whether we're living
over yin or yang waters,

00:52:20.410 --> 00:52:21.880 align:middle line:90%
this is our place.

00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And so let's take a home
or a room, for example.

00:52:24.970 --> 00:52:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And tell us how
we can use dowsing

00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:30.067 align:middle line:84%
to help shift the energy
or spiritualize the house.

00:52:30.067 --> 00:52:31.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: Yes, that's
a really good point.

00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:34.810 align:middle line:84%
Because you could be living
above leys, dragon lines,

00:52:34.810 --> 00:52:38.120 align:middle line:84%
water, and grid lines as
well, like the Curry Net

00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:39.320 align:middle line:90%
or the Hartmann Grid.

00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:40.870 align:middle line:84%
These are kind of
like global grid

00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:44.860 align:middle line:84%
systems that cover Gaia that
can be a little bit toxic.

00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:46.900 align:middle line:84%
Dowsing can lead you
to find out where

00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:49.330 align:middle line:84%
the best places for
your bed, for example,

00:52:49.330 --> 00:52:52.300 align:middle line:84%
to get off the grid, to actually
get yourself off the grid.

00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And you will live to
be a ripe old age.

00:52:54.350 --> 00:52:56.320 align:middle line:84%
This is what the
studies have found.

00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:58.960 align:middle line:84%
Because in one
test alone, a third

00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:01.900 align:middle line:84%
of all people in a
province of Germany

00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:04.800 align:middle line:84%
were admitted to hospital
because of geopathic stress.

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:07.060 align:middle line:84%
Not because of an illness,
because of the breakdown.

00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:10.910 align:middle line:84%
Germany kind of leads the way
in geopathic stress currently.

00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:12.800 align:middle line:84%
But we can do lots
in our own home.

00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:14.830 align:middle line:84%
We can get very
simple devices that

00:53:14.830 --> 00:53:18.010 align:middle line:84%
don't cost much, which is
called a Lakhovsky coil.

00:53:18.010 --> 00:53:20.050 align:middle line:10%
Which anyone can look
up on the internet.

00:53:20.050 --> 00:53:21.412 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Spell that.

00:53:21.412 --> 00:53:22.870 align:middle line:10%
>>WHEATLEY: No, I
won't be able to.

00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:23.670 align:middle line:10%
I can't spell.

00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:25.559 align:middle line:10%
It's called a Lakhovsky coil.

00:53:25.559 --> 00:53:26.600 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Lakhovsky Coil.

00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:27.725 align:middle line:10%
>>WHEATLEY: Lakhovsky Coil.

00:53:27.725 --> 00:53:29.590 align:middle line:10%
And all that coil
is, is two pieces

00:53:29.590 --> 00:53:31.740 align:middle line:10%
of copper about a meter long.

00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:34.900 align:middle line:10%
You twist it round and
round, a bit like plait,

00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:36.730 align:middle line:10%
kind of twisting it
around like that.

00:53:36.730 --> 00:53:38.380 align:middle line:90%
Make it into a circle.

00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:41.350 align:middle line:84%
Place that in your home and
it creates an electrical field

00:53:41.350 --> 00:53:44.770 align:middle line:84%
system that diffuses
any energies.

00:53:44.770 --> 00:53:46.720 align:middle line:84%
It's not really
widely advertised

00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:50.180 align:middle line:84%
by dowsing societies,
because it's so easy to do

00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:52.510 align:middle line:84%
and they don't get a
commission from a sale.

00:53:52.510 --> 00:53:54.040 align:middle line:90%
But it empowers people.

00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And yes, you could
go on to the internet

00:53:55.870 --> 00:53:58.480 align:middle line:84%
and put in geographic
stress diffusers

00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:00.940 align:middle line:84%
and you'll get a million
and one that cost

00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:04.960 align:middle line:84%
anything from 50 pounds
to you know, 1,000 pound.

00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:08.680 align:middle line:84%
But those two pieces of copper
have been tried and tested

00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:10.960 align:middle line:90%
since the Russians invented it.

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:13.720 align:middle line:90%
And it's really very, very good.

00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's really
useful information.

00:54:15.530 --> 00:54:16.720 align:middle line:90%
I like that kind of thing.

00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And so you'd certainly
want to make sure

00:54:18.430 --> 00:54:20.980 align:middle line:84%
that your bedroom, for
example, the place you sleep,

00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:23.530 align:middle line:84%
has this more balanced
energy or diffused energy

00:54:23.530 --> 00:54:25.980 align:middle line:84%
if you're in an area that's
a little toxic, right?

00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:26.860 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Yes.

00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:27.660 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:29.290 align:middle line:90%
It's really easy to identify.

00:54:29.290 --> 00:54:32.680 align:middle line:84%
Because if you are under the
influence of geopathic stress,

00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:34.840 align:middle line:84%
you probably won't go
to sleep that fast.

00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:36.520 align:middle line:90%
You may grind your teeth.

00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:38.980 align:middle line:84%
You may avoid a
particular place in bed

00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:42.130 align:middle line:84%
by moving away from
the energy line.

00:54:42.130 --> 00:54:45.120 align:middle line:84%
The body knows what's good
and what isn't good for it.

00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:48.650 align:middle line:84%
Our mines kind of counteract
and explain things.

00:54:48.650 --> 00:54:51.340 align:middle line:84%
So I ask people when I go
into their homes to decode

00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:52.870 align:middle line:90%
their homes, how do you sleep?

00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:54.220 align:middle line:90%
Show me on your bed.

00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:56.230 align:middle line:84%
Nine times out of 10, if
they're on a grid line,

00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:57.280 align:middle line:84%
they go, you know,
I'm always kind

00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:58.960 align:middle line:84%
of in the half fetal
position and then

00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:01.090 align:middle line:84%
I move over this
side of the bed.

00:55:01.090 --> 00:55:02.750 align:middle line:90%
Strong indications.

00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:03.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:05.410 align:middle line:10%
OK, this building
we're in, we're

00:55:05.410 --> 00:55:07.810 align:middle line:10%
in the London
Marriott Hotel County

00:55:07.810 --> 00:55:13.990 align:middle line:10%
Hall, which they were the old
debate chambers for parliament

00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:15.220 align:middle line:10%
at one time in this place.

00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:17.710 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about, did
you dowse this at all?

00:55:17.710 --> 00:55:20.330 align:middle line:84%
Do you know anything about
this building and where we are?

00:55:20.330 --> 00:55:21.130 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: No.

00:55:21.130 --> 00:55:23.430 align:middle line:10%
To be truthful, I
haven't dowsed it.

00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:26.760 align:middle line:10%
But interestingly, being in a
traffic jam on the way here,

00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:30.370 align:middle line:10%
I was looking at particular
points in churches.

00:55:30.370 --> 00:55:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And you know, my
geomance eye start

00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:33.990 align:middle line:90%
to look for phalli and things.

00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed down
outside one church

00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:41.520 align:middle line:84%
and chapel there was some large
obelisks placed into the wall.

00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:44.520 align:middle line:84%
So obelisks really
pass on energy.

00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:48.950 align:middle line:84%
So that was a whole kind of
row of obelisks in the fence.

00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was headed
to the direction of a spire.

00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:54.390 align:middle line:84%
Now once you've got a
spire in the church,

00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:57.210 align:middle line:84%
all international
dowsers agree, that's

00:55:57.210 --> 00:55:59.860 align:middle line:84%
an interface between elements
of like earth and sky.

00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:00.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: And that can also
enhance and make the energy

00:56:03.090 --> 00:56:05.760 align:middle line:90%
flow even faster along any ley.

00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:08.280 align:middle line:84%
So I think, you know, I think
London has been laid out,

00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:11.670 align:middle line:84%
certainly as other places,
United States have.

00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:13.470 align:middle line:84%
There's been well
research on Washington.

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:14.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Washington DC, yes.

00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:15.703 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Exactly.

00:56:15.703 --> 00:56:18.940 align:middle line:10%
And London has been
completely built over,

00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:21.579 align:middle line:10%
but it still retains
an energy system.

00:56:21.579 --> 00:56:23.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you
can feel it when you go

00:56:23.370 --> 00:56:25.010 align:middle line:90%
to the various sites, for sure.

00:56:25.010 --> 00:56:26.010 align:middle line:90%
And we are out of time.

00:56:26.010 --> 00:56:28.044 align:middle line:84%
And it's been a
fascinating conversation.

00:56:28.044 --> 00:56:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for taking the
time to make your way to London

00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:32.350 align:middle line:90%
and to be here with us.

00:56:32.350 --> 00:56:33.282 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Thanks.

00:56:33.282 --> 00:56:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again,
the book is titled

00:56:34.740 --> 00:56:36.450 align:middle line:90%
"Divining Ancient Sites."

00:56:36.450 --> 00:56:39.090 align:middle line:10%
And also to join Maria for
a tour of ancient sites,

00:56:39.090 --> 00:56:43.504 align:middle line:10%
you can look at her website
theaveburyexperience.co.uk.

00:56:43.504 --> 00:56:45.420 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:48.690 align:middle line:10%
in London on "Open Minds."
