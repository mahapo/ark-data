>> Regina Meredith: The actions

00:00:21.422 --> 00:00:23.124 align:middle line:84%
of the soul have a
very different timeline

00:00:23.124 --> 00:00:25.826 align:middle line:84%
than our personalities which
can be frustrating here

00:00:25.826 --> 00:00:27.194 align:middle line:90%
on the ground.

00:00:27.194 --> 00:00:29.697 align:middle line:84%
This has sent most of us at
one time or another to consult

00:00:29.697 --> 00:00:33.100 align:middle line:84%
with an astrologer, a
numerologist, tarot card reader,

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.504 align:middle line:84%
other divination expert to
help uncover what lies ahead.

00:00:36.504 --> 00:00:40.074 align:middle line:84%
Paul Obrien is a software
designer and an I Ching expert

00:00:40.074 --> 00:00:42.510 align:middle line:84%
and decided the world
needed a more accessible

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.613 align:middle line:84%
and less expensive interface
with divination tools.

00:00:45.613 --> 00:00:48.916 align:middle line:84%
So he created tarot.com
and other divination sites

00:00:48.916 --> 00:00:50.985 align:middle line:84%
to help us do the
job for ourselves.

00:00:50.985 --> 00:00:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what
it's all about in the end.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.890 align:middle line:90%
And we, in our last conversation

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.925 align:middle line:84%
in about one minute's
time we squeezed

00:00:57.925 --> 00:00:59.426 align:middle line:90%
in a really important subject.

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:01.896 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to take time
to review that again.

00:01:01.896 --> 00:01:05.866 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do with the fact
that we have moved into the age

00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:07.868 align:middle line:84%
or are moving into
the age of Aquarius.

00:01:07.868 --> 00:01:10.738 align:middle line:90%
And it's not just a song.

00:01:10.738 --> 00:01:13.841 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a cliche,
it means something.

00:01:13.841 --> 00:01:17.878 align:middle line:84%
So if you can tell us why
these tools are flourishing

00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:19.113 align:middle line:90%
through the lens of moving

00:01:19.113 --> 00:01:21.248 align:middle line:84%
from the Piscean age
to the Aquarian age.

00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:23.117 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a
helpful place to start.

00:01:23.117 --> 00:01:24.518 align:middle line:90%
>> Paul Obrien: Okay.

00:01:24.518 --> 00:01:28.055 align:middle line:84%
Well first of all these ages,
this is an astronomical term.

00:01:28.055 --> 00:01:31.192 align:middle line:84%
An age lasts approximately
2,000 years.

00:01:31.192 --> 00:01:33.861 align:middle line:84%
I think the whole cycle is
something like 22,000 years

00:01:33.861 --> 00:01:37.198 align:middle line:84%
and has to do with the
revolution of our solar system

00:01:37.198 --> 00:01:39.333 align:middle line:84%
around the galaxy or
something like that.

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:40.734 align:middle line:90%
I'm not an astronomer.

00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:41.702 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yes.

00:01:41.702 --> 00:01:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Paul Obrien: But
the point is is

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.639 align:middle line:84%
that these ages are
an astronomical idea

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:48.676 align:middle line:84%
and they've been defined
by astrologers just

00:01:48.676 --> 00:01:50.978 align:middle line:84%
like everything else
astronomical has been defined

00:01:50.978 --> 00:01:52.346 align:middle line:90%
by astrologers.

00:01:52.346 --> 00:01:55.748 align:middle line:84%
And so it's reckoned that for
approximately the past 2,000

00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:59.153 align:middle line:84%
years we've been living
in the age of Pisces.

00:01:59.153 --> 00:02:01.956 align:middle line:84%
Now is it just a
coincidence that the symbol

00:02:01.956 --> 00:02:04.959 align:middle line:84%
of Christianity are these two
fish which is the same thing

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:06.994 align:middle line:84%
as the symbol of
the sign of Pisces?

00:02:06.994 --> 00:02:10.497 align:middle line:84%
I don't think so but it any case
we've had this age of Pisces.

00:02:10.497 --> 00:02:14.201 align:middle line:84%
Well and now we're supposed to
be entering the age of Aquarius.

00:02:14.201 --> 00:02:17.338 align:middle line:84%
Most people think we're
right on the cusp right now.

00:02:17.338 --> 00:02:18.739 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it happened 10 years ago.

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.107 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's going to
happen in 20 years.

00:02:20.107 --> 00:02:21.208 align:middle line:90%
I mean, when you're talking

00:02:21.208 --> 00:02:23.711 align:middle line:84%
about something that's
2,000 years old,

00:02:23.711 --> 00:02:25.012 align:middle line:90%
it's not a clear delineation.

00:02:25.012 --> 00:02:26.113 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:02:26.113 --> 00:02:27.214 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: Where it starts
and where it begins.

00:02:27.214 --> 00:02:28.616 align:middle line:84%
But even when you're
on the cusp of a change

00:02:28.616 --> 00:02:32.620 align:middle line:84%
like that you could see
the energy start to shift.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.489 align:middle line:84%
And so this idea of
the age of Aquarius

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.559 align:middle line:84%
which has been popularized
by songs and musicals

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:41.495 align:middle line:90%
and has been made fun of as kind

00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:46.800 align:middle line:84%
of a new age joke actually
has some validity to it.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.271 align:middle line:84%
And what it means energetically
and we can see this happening is

00:02:50.271 --> 00:02:55.876 align:middle line:84%
that we're moving into a
society that is more defined

00:02:55.876 --> 00:03:00.147 align:middle line:84%
by the qualities of the sign
of Aquarius than of the sign

00:03:00.147 --> 00:03:02.383 align:middle line:90%
of Pisces which came before.

00:03:02.383 --> 00:03:06.186 align:middle line:84%
Pisces is the sign after
Aquarius but these precisions

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:08.022 align:middle line:84%
of the equinox going
that reverse order...

00:03:08.022 --> 00:03:08.789 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:09.623 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: For some reason.

00:03:09.623 --> 00:03:10.858 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: For some reason, yeah.

00:03:10.858 --> 00:03:13.661 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: In any case, Aquarius
is an intellectual sign.

00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:15.029 align:middle line:90%
It's an air sign.

00:03:15.029 --> 00:03:18.632 align:middle line:84%
It governs mental, certain
types of mental activity.

00:03:18.632 --> 00:03:21.402 align:middle line:84%
It's very humanitarian
and egalitarian.

00:03:21.402 --> 00:03:23.836 align:middle line:84%
And that's why everybody's
been so excited about it.

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:26.173 align:middle line:84%
You know, the dawning
of the age of Aquarius

00:03:26.173 --> 00:03:28.175 align:middle line:84%
where everybody loves
everybody and the kind

00:03:28.175 --> 00:03:31.512 align:middle line:84%
of the whole counterculture
thing really dovetailed

00:03:31.512 --> 00:03:34.882 align:middle line:84%
with that quite nicely
in the '60s.

00:03:34.882 --> 00:03:39.420 align:middle line:84%
The age of Pisces is not
so concerned with ideas.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.522 align:middle line:84%
It's more concerned
with feelings.

00:03:41.522 --> 00:03:46.393 align:middle line:84%
And it's more concerned with the
sacred and with the mysteries

00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:48.095 align:middle line:90%
and there's more secrets.

00:03:48.095 --> 00:03:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And so these secrets are
governed by Priests and Shamans

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.605 align:middle line:84%
and middlemen and
hierarchies of embodied wisdom.

00:03:58.605 --> 00:04:02.843 align:middle line:84%
And people didn't know how to
read until fairly recently.

00:04:02.843 --> 00:04:04.178 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:04:04.178 --> 00:04:05.646 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: You know, nobody could
read the Bible, you know,

00:04:05.646 --> 00:04:08.882 align:middle line:84%
which was the only, which
was pretty much the only

00:04:08.882 --> 00:04:09.717 align:middle line:90%
book around.

00:04:09.717 --> 00:04:10.484 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Only book in town, yeah.

00:04:10.484 --> 00:04:11.185 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Yeah, that's right.

00:04:11.185 --> 00:04:12.353 align:middle line:90%
And so now in the age

00:04:12.353 --> 00:04:14.021 align:middle line:84%
of Aquarius things
are getting flatter,

00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:16.557 align:middle line:90%
we're getting less hierarchical,

00:04:16.557 --> 00:04:19.626 align:middle line:84%
businesses have flatter
organizational structures,

00:04:19.626 --> 00:04:22.496 align:middle line:84%
there's less levels
of management.

00:04:22.496 --> 00:04:26.967 align:middle line:84%
And I think that this portends
something very special for us

00:04:26.967 --> 00:04:29.103 align:middle line:84%
in terms of getting
in touch with the soul

00:04:29.103 --> 00:04:32.306 align:middle line:84%
or the spiritual dimension
of life in the sense

00:04:32.306 --> 00:04:34.675 align:middle line:90%
that we can go direct.

00:04:34.675 --> 00:04:37.544 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to,
we don't have to go

00:04:37.544 --> 00:04:44.051 align:middle line:84%
through a highly organized
hierarchy of authority in order

00:04:44.051 --> 00:04:47.054 align:middle line:84%
to access the spiritual
dimension.

00:04:47.054 --> 00:04:51.692 align:middle line:84%
And for me that's why divination
is becoming so popular.

00:04:51.692 --> 00:04:54.762 align:middle line:84%
I think it's an Aquarian
phenomenon this idea

00:04:54.762 --> 00:04:58.265 align:middle line:84%
that people can use a deck
of cards or the I Ching

00:04:58.265 --> 00:05:01.635 align:middle line:84%
which is the oldest divination
system that we know of.

00:05:01.635 --> 00:05:07.741 align:middle line:84%
Or for a bigger picture
astrology or numerology in order

00:05:07.741 --> 00:05:12.146 align:middle line:84%
to access this dimension and
they can do it by themselves,

00:05:12.146 --> 00:05:15.983 align:middle line:84%
that's basically my vision,
that's what I dedicated myself

00:05:15.983 --> 00:05:20.421 align:middle line:84%
to when I started developing
divination software back

00:05:20.421 --> 00:05:24.158 align:middle line:84%
in the '80s and later on when
I developed the world's largest

00:05:24.158 --> 00:05:26.794 align:middle line:84%
astrology Website which
was called Tarot.com.

00:05:26.794 --> 00:05:29.797 align:middle line:84%
It was also do it yourself
tarot card readings

00:05:29.797 --> 00:05:31.432 align:middle line:84%
and do it yourself
I Ching readings.

00:05:31.432 --> 00:05:33.500 align:middle line:84%
So it was all about
do it yourself.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.703 align:middle line:84%
And this do it yourself thing
is kind of an Aquarian idea too.

00:05:36.703 --> 00:05:39.540 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like
you can go direct.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.308 align:middle line:90%
You can do it yourself.

00:05:41.308 --> 00:05:42.843 align:middle line:90%
You can create a direct link.

00:05:42.843 --> 00:05:46.146 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to go through
all of these middlemen.

00:05:46.146 --> 00:05:51.985 align:middle line:84%
So, that's what it means to me
and that's my understanding.

00:05:51.985 --> 00:05:57.291 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yeah and here we have yet
we're kind of watching the death

00:05:57.291 --> 00:06:00.861 align:middle line:84%
of certain secret orders
and secret societies

00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:02.963 align:middle line:90%
and hidden away information.

00:06:02.963 --> 00:06:07.201 align:middle line:84%
And some of the information is
so esoteric, so highly esoteric

00:06:07.201 --> 00:06:09.236 align:middle line:84%
and ancient that most people
aren't interested in it anyway.

00:06:09.236 --> 00:06:13.207 align:middle line:84%
But the point you're saying is,
it too will have light shown

00:06:13.207 --> 00:06:17.177 align:middle line:84%
on it because the time for the
secrecy itself is what's ending.

00:06:17.177 --> 00:06:18.846 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Right, exactly.

00:06:18.846 --> 00:06:21.582 align:middle line:84%
People have the capacity
in this information age.

00:06:21.582 --> 00:06:23.784 align:middle line:84%
Another Aquarian
phenomenon is the internet

00:06:23.784 --> 00:06:27.187 align:middle line:84%
where we have access to
information like never before.

00:06:27.187 --> 00:06:30.524 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You're like a poster
child for the age of Aquarius.

00:06:30.524 --> 00:06:32.059 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Well in a way perhaps.

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:36.830 align:middle line:84%
But we have the capacity
to go and find

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.565 align:middle line:84%
out what we need
to know on our own.

00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:43.237 align:middle line:84%
So, it's pretty,
it's individualistic

00:06:43.237 --> 00:06:46.306 align:middle line:84%
and it's humanitarian
at the same time.

00:06:46.306 --> 00:06:51.111 align:middle line:84%
We, our opportunity to evolve as
individuals is going to be good

00:06:51.111 --> 00:06:54.148 align:middle line:84%
for us as the collective because
the collective is only as strong

00:06:54.148 --> 00:06:57.251 align:middle line:90%
as the parts within it.

00:06:57.251 --> 00:07:00.888 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: When we were
basically submerged

00:07:00.888 --> 00:07:03.690 align:middle line:84%
in the Piscean age
it also aligned

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.726 align:middle line:90%
with the age of the patriarchy.

00:07:05.726 --> 00:07:06.994 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Right.

00:07:06.994 --> 00:07:08.996 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I mean, literal
alignment with the patriarchy.

00:07:08.996 --> 00:07:10.297 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Right.

00:07:10.297 --> 00:07:12.132 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And we've seen a lot
of what those effects are.

00:07:12.132 --> 00:07:14.468 align:middle line:84%
And we're also seeing
those structures begin

00:07:14.468 --> 00:07:16.036 align:middle line:90%
to crumble and give way.

00:07:16.036 --> 00:07:17.971 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: Right, oh
yeah, absolutely.

00:07:17.971 --> 00:07:19.573 align:middle line:90%
And thank God for that.

00:07:19.573 --> 00:07:21.508 align:middle line:90%
You know, we're getting,

00:07:21.508 --> 00:07:24.711 align:middle line:84%
the feminine is coming
back into its own.

00:07:24.711 --> 00:07:27.414 align:middle line:84%
It's coming into its
rightful position of power.

00:07:27.414 --> 00:07:28.715 align:middle line:90%
And I don't mean power

00:07:28.715 --> 00:07:32.953 align:middle line:84%
in the patriarchal sense
of power over people.

00:07:32.953 --> 00:07:37.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about a balance
between nature and the ego.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.826 align:middle line:84%
A balance between the left
brain and the right brain.

00:07:39.826 --> 00:07:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And that also has a bearing on
this whole divination revolution

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.703 align:middle line:84%
that I've been privileged
to be a part of.

00:07:49.703 --> 00:07:55.075 align:middle line:84%
Because 85 percent of the
people who use tarot.com

00:07:55.075 --> 00:07:58.045 align:middle line:84%
to give themselves
readings were female.

00:07:58.045 --> 00:08:02.082 align:middle line:84%
We knew that because we were
tracking birthdates and gender

00:08:02.082 --> 00:08:04.985 align:middle line:84%
as part of our membership
program.

00:08:04.985 --> 00:08:07.487 align:middle line:84%
Eight five percent,
what does that say?

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:10.157 align:middle line:84%
That's says to me
what it says was

00:08:10.157 --> 00:08:14.494 align:middle line:84%
that women are more receptive
and they're more open

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:18.198 align:middle line:84%
to receiving information
in nonlinear ways.

00:08:18.198 --> 00:08:19.266 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:08:19.266 --> 00:08:20.434 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: And that's
what we were offering.

00:08:20.434 --> 00:08:24.171 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yet the tool
itself was very masculine,

00:08:24.171 --> 00:08:25.739 align:middle line:90%
kind of war oriented.

00:08:25.739 --> 00:08:27.808 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk about
that when we get further

00:08:27.808 --> 00:08:30.177 align:middle line:84%
into the modalities and
the I Ching specifically

00:08:30.177 --> 00:08:34.080 align:middle line:84%
which was wonderful that it
inspired you, those numbers

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.651 align:middle line:84%
and other things inspired you to
take a fresh look at the I Ching

00:08:37.651 --> 00:08:39.920 align:middle line:84%
and how it can be
brought out in the world.

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.188 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Right.

00:08:41.188 --> 00:08:43.223 align:middle line:84%
Well I'd say of all the
divination systems the I Ching

00:08:43.223 --> 00:08:45.592 align:middle line:84%
probably is the most
masculine one.

00:08:45.592 --> 00:08:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of suited for
men in a sense that it's kind

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:54.067 align:middle line:84%
of solitary ritual that
you can do by yourself.

00:08:54.067 --> 00:08:57.971 align:middle line:84%
Whereas tarot cards are more
collegial and more communal,

00:08:57.971 --> 00:09:00.173 align:middle line:84%
you know, people like
to do them together.

00:09:00.173 --> 00:09:04.011 align:middle line:84%
Usually people give each
other readings or they share.

00:09:04.011 --> 00:09:05.145 align:middle line:90%
And it's like playing cards.

00:09:05.145 --> 00:09:06.546 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's more
of social thing.

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:07.381 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right, yes.

00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:08.482 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: So I think of tarot as a,

00:09:08.482 --> 00:09:11.752 align:middle line:84%
like a more feminine
manifestation of that.

00:09:11.752 --> 00:09:15.155 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: But still, you
have updated the I Ching

00:09:15.155 --> 00:09:16.223 align:middle line:90%
which I do [inaudible]

00:09:16.223 --> 00:09:17.758 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: Yeah, yeah,
yeah, no, absolutely.

00:09:17.758 --> 00:09:19.693 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: It's really, I think it's
a really important distinction

00:09:19.693 --> 00:09:23.363 align:middle line:84%
that people understand your
mindset and that the passing

00:09:23.363 --> 00:09:26.333 align:middle line:84%
of the ages into the
newer age that was,

00:09:26.333 --> 00:09:31.038 align:middle line:84%
that inspired your bringing out
a new way of interfacing with,

00:09:31.038 --> 00:09:33.473 align:middle line:84%
it's even though the
principles are the same.

00:09:33.473 --> 00:09:34.308 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Oh yeah, yeah.

00:09:34.308 --> 00:09:35.609 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: A face of the I Ching.

00:09:35.609 --> 00:09:37.044 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: No, if you look at
the history of the I Ching,

00:09:37.044 --> 00:09:42.082 align:middle line:84%
it was designed for use by
emperors and military generals.

00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:44.484 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: When was it designed,
what era are we looking at?

00:09:44.484 --> 00:09:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: It's about three,
as best we can tell it's

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.256 align:middle line:90%
about 3,000 years ago.

00:09:49.256 --> 00:09:54.928 align:middle line:84%
And there was a King Wen and he,
he was one of the formulators

00:09:54.928 --> 00:09:57.664 align:middle line:84%
of the ordering of
the 64 archetypes

00:09:57.664 --> 00:10:00.300 align:middle line:84%
which are called
hexagrams in the I Ching.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:05.338 align:middle line:84%
And then Confucius weighed in
and Confucius reputedly said

00:10:05.338 --> 00:10:08.975 align:middle line:84%
that when he died he said
if he had another 70 years

00:10:08.975 --> 00:10:11.778 align:middle line:84%
to live he would devote
all of it to the I Ching.

00:10:11.778 --> 00:10:12.779 align:middle line:90%
But he developed it.

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:14.748 align:middle line:84%
Now he was kind of
a patriarchal guy.

00:10:14.748 --> 00:10:16.750 align:middle line:84%
He was all about know
your place and stay

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.752 align:middle line:90%
in your place and do your duty.

00:10:18.752 --> 00:10:21.154 align:middle line:90%
So it, he was very structured.

00:10:21.154 --> 00:10:25.826 align:middle line:84%
And I mean there was a lot of
good in that but what I did is

00:10:25.826 --> 00:10:28.962 align:middle line:84%
when I wrote my own
version of the I Ching,

00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:32.933 align:middle line:84%
in order to make it more
relevant to our society

00:10:32.933 --> 00:10:36.870 align:middle line:84%
which is being, becoming
more into balance.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:39.406 align:middle line:84%
It's moving away from the
patriarchal and the age

00:10:39.406 --> 00:10:42.509 align:middle line:90%
of Pisces, I wanted to make sure

00:10:42.509 --> 00:10:46.213 align:middle line:84%
that I could offer the world
a version of the oracle

00:10:46.213 --> 00:10:49.916 align:middle line:84%
that was not patriarchal,
that was not sexist,

00:10:49.916 --> 00:10:53.320 align:middle line:84%
that didn't refer
to the superior man.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.554 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:10:54.554 --> 00:10:55.889 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: In the older versions
and the Chinese versions

00:10:55.889 --> 00:10:58.425 align:middle line:84%
of the I Ching is the superior
man is all over the place.

00:10:58.425 --> 00:11:00.994 align:middle line:84%
It never says anything
about superior women.

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:02.162 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:03.497 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: Or hardly anything
about women at all.

00:11:03.497 --> 00:11:04.898 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well you weren't doing
this in a patronizing way.

00:11:04.898 --> 00:11:06.733 align:middle line:84%
You were doing this
to reflect what is.

00:11:06.733 --> 00:11:08.034 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:11:08.034 --> 00:11:09.169 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:10.404 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: Because and not
only to reflect what is

00:11:10.404 --> 00:11:11.838 align:middle line:90%
but to support what's happening.

00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:13.173 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:14.541 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: I mean, to support
the evolution of our culture.

00:11:14.541 --> 00:11:17.177 align:middle line:84%
Because cultural evolution is
something that never stops,

00:11:17.177 --> 00:11:20.647 align:middle line:84%
it never should stop and that's
what we're on the cusp of here.

00:11:20.647 --> 00:11:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say that's another way
of describing the transition

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:26.319 align:middle line:84%
from the age of Pisces
to the age of Aquarius is

00:11:26.319 --> 00:11:33.660 align:middle line:84%
through a major cultural shift
as well as a sociological shift

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:36.363 align:middle line:90%
from one mindset to another one.

00:11:36.363 --> 00:11:38.165 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted to support that.

00:11:38.165 --> 00:11:41.902 align:middle line:84%
So I also removed all of
the militaristic aspects

00:11:41.902 --> 00:11:43.470 align:middle line:90%
of the ancient I Ching.

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:46.039 align:middle line:84%
Like for instance, hexagram
number six was traditionally

00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:47.741 align:middle line:90%
called the army.

00:11:47.741 --> 00:11:54.047 align:middle line:84%
In my visionary I Ching, it's
called organized discipline.

00:11:54.047 --> 00:11:55.248 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:11:55.248 --> 00:11:59.686 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: And it uses the
metaphor of a rowing crew.

00:11:59.686 --> 00:12:02.956 align:middle line:84%
So there is a leader, there's
coordination and all that.

00:12:02.956 --> 00:12:04.257 align:middle line:90%
So, but we stayed away

00:12:04.257 --> 00:12:06.793 align:middle line:84%
and in the ancient I
Ching it says things

00:12:06.793 --> 00:12:10.430 align:middle line:84%
like the army marches
to the southwest.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:11.798 align:middle line:84%
Well I don't know
what that means.

00:12:11.798 --> 00:12:13.133 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:12:13.133 --> 00:12:14.501 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: You know, and maybe
they did know what that means.

00:12:14.501 --> 00:12:15.569 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Well if they lived

00:12:15.569 --> 00:12:17.204 align:middle line:84%
with the four directions
and all of that...

00:12:17.204 --> 00:12:18.572 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Right.

00:12:18.572 --> 00:12:20.006 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: They were living with
feng shui, other modalities...

00:12:20.006 --> 00:12:20.841 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: That's right.

00:12:20.841 --> 00:12:21.641 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: That would make sense.

00:12:21.641 --> 00:12:22.843 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: That's right and then

00:12:22.843 --> 00:12:24.511 align:middle line:84%
in southwest China there's
something going on there

00:12:24.511 --> 00:12:25.946 align:middle line:84%
that I don't know
anything about.

00:12:25.946 --> 00:12:31.384 align:middle line:84%
So I eliminated all of that
kind of language and kind

00:12:31.384 --> 00:12:37.523 align:middle line:84%
of gave the thing a more
balanced usability for women

00:12:37.523 --> 00:12:41.862 align:middle line:84%
as well as men because
that's what I think it needed

00:12:41.862 --> 00:12:43.496 align:middle line:90%
and that's what I think we need.

00:12:43.496 --> 00:12:45.665 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Right, that
makes perfect sense.

00:12:45.665 --> 00:12:49.069 align:middle line:84%
Now let's go into some
of the, when you created,

00:12:49.069 --> 00:12:50.937 align:middle line:84%
first of all what
was in tarot.com?

00:12:50.937 --> 00:12:52.873 align:middle line:90%
What did it encompass?

00:12:52.873 --> 00:12:57.210 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: Well at, well
tarot.com started as Iching.com

00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:01.548 align:middle line:84%
and then we added tarot
to the mix with the help

00:13:01.548 --> 00:13:05.519 align:middle line:84%
of a tarot expert who helped
me develop this encyclopedia

00:13:05.519 --> 00:13:07.988 align:middle line:84%
of all the meaning, any,
the meaning of any card

00:13:07.988 --> 00:13:09.956 align:middle line:90%
in any position in any spread.

00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:11.491 align:middle line:84%
That would be like in a
book form that would be

00:13:11.491 --> 00:13:13.226 align:middle line:90%
like a 2,000 page book.

00:13:13.226 --> 00:13:14.961 align:middle line:84%
That took three years
to do that.

00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:17.030 align:middle line:90%
So we added that to it.

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:18.031 align:middle line:90%
So then we had two things.

00:13:18.031 --> 00:13:20.700 align:middle line:90%
We had Iching.com and tarot.com.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:21.902 align:middle line:90%
And then, you know, as part

00:13:21.902 --> 00:13:25.672 align:middle line:84%
of my marketing effort I
made an alliance with AOL

00:13:25.672 --> 00:13:28.708 align:middle line:90%
to provide them all of that.

00:13:28.708 --> 00:13:33.213 align:middle line:84%
So the I Ching and tarot in
addition to the astrology

00:13:33.213 --> 00:13:35.448 align:middle line:84%
that they had which at
the time they were getting

00:13:35.448 --> 00:13:39.452 align:middle line:90%
from a competitor astrology.com.

00:13:39.452 --> 00:13:43.356 align:middle line:84%
And then I added numerology
which AOL didn't have

00:13:43.356 --> 00:13:47.160 align:middle line:84%
and I added it to my mix
and licensed it to AOL.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.931 align:middle line:84%
And so that we just were, you
know, developing a relationship

00:13:50.931 --> 00:13:55.035 align:middle line:84%
with the biggest online portal
at the time that there was.

00:13:55.035 --> 00:13:56.403 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes, I remember that.

00:13:56.403 --> 00:13:59.105 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: And so then a couple
years after that it wasn't easy

00:13:59.105 --> 00:14:04.244 align:middle line:84%
but we managed to capture
the franchise for horoscopes

00:14:04.244 --> 00:14:06.980 align:middle line:84%
and astrology as well
as all this other thing

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:10.283 align:middle line:84%
and we basically beat
out astrology.com.

00:14:10.283 --> 00:14:13.820 align:middle line:84%
But they still had Yahoo
and somebody else had MSN.

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:15.388 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of
how it happened.

00:14:15.388 --> 00:14:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's was with the
help of Rick Levine...

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:18.792 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:14:18.792 --> 00:14:21.428 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: And Jeff Jawer, two of
the top astrologers in the world

00:14:21.428 --> 00:14:23.063 align:middle line:90%
that we were able to do that.

00:14:23.063 --> 00:14:26.399 align:middle line:84%
And to this day both of
those guys write horoscopes

00:14:26.399 --> 00:14:29.769 align:middle line:84%
and other features that
are still on tarot.com.

00:14:29.769 --> 00:14:33.173 align:middle line:84%
So tarot.com ended up having
astrology, numerology,

00:14:33.173 --> 00:14:36.443 align:middle line:90%
tarot and I Ching and feng shui.

00:14:36.443 --> 00:14:38.445 align:middle line:90%
Those are the five things.

00:14:38.445 --> 00:14:41.314 align:middle line:84%
And we limited it to that even
though we were being bombarded

00:14:41.314 --> 00:14:43.216 align:middle line:84%
it with requests to put
on every different kind

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:44.284 align:middle line:90%
of deck that everybody was...

00:14:44.284 --> 00:14:44.918 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Sure.

00:14:44.918 --> 00:14:46.052 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Making up.

00:14:46.052 --> 00:14:49.456 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to limit it to
classical divination.

00:14:49.456 --> 00:14:55.395 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for that Regina
is that I wanted to make sure

00:14:55.395 --> 00:15:00.300 align:middle line:84%
that we didn't succumb to
this age of marketing where,

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:02.335 align:middle line:84%
you know, there's so
many products and so many

00:15:02.335 --> 00:15:04.337 align:middle line:84%
of them are just designed
to make you feel good.

00:15:04.337 --> 00:15:06.172 align:middle line:84%
I wanted products that
were actually going

00:15:06.172 --> 00:15:10.043 align:middle line:90%
to help people go deep.

00:15:10.043 --> 00:15:13.213 align:middle line:84%
Go direct for guidance but
go deep within themselves.

00:15:13.213 --> 00:15:16.983 align:middle line:84%
And that depended upon having
a balanced set of archetypes.

00:15:16.983 --> 00:15:21.588 align:middle line:84%
And I thought like tarot
and I Ching and numerology

00:15:21.588 --> 00:15:25.091 align:middle line:84%
and astrology certainly
had sets of archetypes

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:27.727 align:middle line:84%
that predated any
kind of marketing.

00:15:27.727 --> 00:15:29.062 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Sure.

00:15:29.062 --> 00:15:31.331 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: You know, they were
ancient and they were designed

00:15:31.331 --> 00:15:34.601 align:middle line:90%
to reflect the whole realm

00:15:34.601 --> 00:15:37.270 align:middle line:84%
of human experience
including the shadow,

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.672 align:middle line:84%
at what Carl Jung
would call the shadow.

00:15:39.672 --> 00:15:43.143 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So it wasn't just your
daily horoscope hit per say

00:15:43.143 --> 00:15:45.645 align:middle line:84%
when you started using
it for divination.

00:15:45.645 --> 00:15:48.715 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because a lot of
people really it's as far

00:15:48.715 --> 00:15:50.350 align:middle line:84%
as we've ever really scratched
in a lot of the cases.

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:51.651 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Right.

00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:55.355 align:middle line:84%
One thing you see now, the
daily horoscope is the most

00:15:55.355 --> 00:15:57.724 align:middle line:84%
inconsequential thing
we ever did.

00:15:57.724 --> 00:15:59.893 align:middle line:84%
But it was also from
a marketing point

00:15:59.893 --> 00:16:01.327 align:middle line:84%
of view the most
important thing.

00:16:01.327 --> 00:16:02.028 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Well the most popular.

00:16:02.028 --> 00:16:02.562 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Yeah.

00:16:02.562 --> 00:16:03.730 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:05.098 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: Because most
people don't realize this

00:16:05.098 --> 00:16:08.535 align:middle line:84%
but the most popular feature
on AOL and in a sense and Yahoo

00:16:08.535 --> 00:16:12.372 align:middle line:84%
as well as most daily newspapers
is the daily horoscope.

00:16:12.372 --> 00:16:13.473 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Exactly.

00:16:13.473 --> 00:16:14.641 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: More people read
the daily horoscope

00:16:14.641 --> 00:16:15.508 align:middle line:90%
than anything else.

00:16:15.508 --> 00:16:16.910 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Most magazines have it.

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:18.912 align:middle line:84%
Certainly all the
women's magazines.

00:16:18.912 --> 00:16:20.180 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Right, right.

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.215 align:middle line:84%
And it's always one of the
most widely read features.

00:16:22.215 --> 00:16:23.516 align:middle line:90%
So we thought of that.

00:16:23.516 --> 00:16:27.987 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted Rick Levine
to be our horoscope author

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:30.490 align:middle line:84%
because he's like one of the
top astrologers in the world.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:31.257 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:16:31.257 --> 00:16:32.392 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: And he's got a way

00:16:32.392 --> 00:16:34.360 align:middle line:84%
of writing those daily
horoscopes that's more

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.528 align:middle line:90%
meaningful than most.

00:16:35.528 --> 00:16:36.863 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:16:36.863 --> 00:16:38.531 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: But it's not the most
profound thing that he does

00:16:38.531 --> 00:16:41.234 align:middle line:84%
and it's certainly not
a profound reflection

00:16:41.234 --> 00:16:42.469 align:middle line:90%
of astrology.

00:16:42.469 --> 00:16:43.870 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times you talk
about astrology people think

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:46.773 align:middle line:84%
of the daily horoscope and it's
just a bunch of fluff and it's

00:16:46.773 --> 00:16:48.074 align:middle line:90%
like a fortune cookie.

00:16:48.074 --> 00:16:49.442 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:16:49.442 --> 00:16:52.412 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: You know, but actually
astrology's way deep, much,

00:16:52.412 --> 00:16:53.813 align:middle line:90%
much deeper than that.

00:16:53.813 --> 00:16:57.851 align:middle line:84%
It, everybody has
got all 12 signs,

00:16:57.851 --> 00:16:59.285 align:middle line:90%
it's just a different mix.

00:16:59.285 --> 00:17:00.687 align:middle line:84%
It's just a different
proportion.

00:17:00.687 --> 00:17:03.889 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has all of these
archetypes inside of themselves.

00:17:03.889 --> 00:17:06.091 align:middle line:84%
It's just a different,
different mix.

00:17:06.091 --> 00:17:08.094 align:middle line:84%
So if you can, you
can use astrology

00:17:08.094 --> 00:17:09.596 align:middle line:90%
to understand yourself.

00:17:09.596 --> 00:17:12.599 align:middle line:84%
You can use astrology to
understand other people better.

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:14.000 align:middle line:90%
And one of the things I love

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.101 align:middle line:84%
about it is the diversity
aspect.

00:17:16.101 --> 00:17:19.105 align:middle line:84%
It's like if you were
going to do something

00:17:19.105 --> 00:17:21.908 align:middle line:84%
or if my friend was
going to do something

00:17:21.908 --> 00:17:25.578 align:middle line:84%
that I completely don't
understand, not a harmful thing

00:17:25.578 --> 00:17:27.679 align:middle line:84%
but just something that
I don't understand.

00:17:27.679 --> 00:17:31.484 align:middle line:84%
I could say well, oh he's an
Aries with a Scorpio moon.

00:17:31.484 --> 00:17:33.219 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what that's like.

00:17:33.219 --> 00:17:34.921 align:middle line:84%
You know, so I cut
him some slack.

00:17:34.921 --> 00:17:37.624 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yes, exactly you
can truly see the value

00:17:37.624 --> 00:17:39.492 align:middle line:84%
in acknowledging each
other for what we are.

00:17:39.492 --> 00:17:40.827 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Exactly.

00:17:40.827 --> 00:17:43.897 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Let's talk about, I
want to go into tarot and some

00:17:43.897 --> 00:17:45.265 align:middle line:90%
of the other modalities.

00:17:45.265 --> 00:17:48.301 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk first about
the computer interface

00:17:48.301 --> 00:17:49.636 align:middle line:90%
with divination in general.

00:17:49.636 --> 00:17:50.737 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Right.

00:17:50.737 --> 00:17:51.938 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So most of us
have looked at a chart

00:17:51.938 --> 00:17:54.707 align:middle line:84%
or say we've cast
the I Ching coins

00:17:54.707 --> 00:17:58.444 align:middle line:84%
or we've laid out
the tarot deck.

00:17:58.444 --> 00:18:00.747 align:middle line:84%
Is there fundamentally
when you're talking

00:18:00.747 --> 00:18:05.885 align:middle line:84%
about consciousness, is there
fundamentally any difference

00:18:05.885 --> 00:18:09.656 align:middle line:84%
in pulling it up via your
visionary I Ching app

00:18:09.656 --> 00:18:12.458 align:middle line:84%
from all the years of
experience you've had

00:18:12.458 --> 00:18:14.727 align:middle line:84%
as with tossing the
coins with your hands?

00:18:14.727 --> 00:18:16.563 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: That is a
very good question.

00:18:16.563 --> 00:18:20.633 align:middle line:84%
And it's one that concerned
me greatly in the development

00:18:20.633 --> 00:18:22.135 align:middle line:90%
of all of these things.

00:18:22.135 --> 00:18:24.237 align:middle line:90%
So first let me just refer

00:18:24.237 --> 00:18:27.106 align:middle line:84%
to the what I call the
big picture reports

00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:30.143 align:middle line:84%
which is astrology
and numerology.

00:18:30.143 --> 00:18:32.579 align:middle line:84%
In those cases it
completely makes sense...

00:18:32.579 --> 00:18:33.346 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:18:33.346 --> 00:18:34.447 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: To use a computer.

00:18:34.447 --> 00:18:36.749 align:middle line:84%
And it's, if you had
to hand draw a chart...

00:18:36.749 --> 00:18:37.584 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: No.

00:18:37.584 --> 00:18:38.284 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: I mean, it'd be crazy.

00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:39.152 align:middle line:90%
It'd just take forever.

00:18:39.152 --> 00:18:40.086 align:middle line:90%
And it used to take forever.

00:18:40.086 --> 00:18:41.187 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And that we
can understand.

00:18:41.187 --> 00:18:41.888 align:middle line:84%
It makes total sense
[inaudible] computing.

00:18:41.888 --> 00:18:42.689 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Yeah, right.

00:18:42.689 --> 00:18:43.656 align:middle line:90%
So in those there's no issue

00:18:43.656 --> 00:18:45.325 align:middle line:84%
because you're getting
a big report

00:18:45.325 --> 00:18:47.694 align:middle line:84%
and it's a reflection
on the big picture.

00:18:47.694 --> 00:18:50.563 align:middle line:84%
Now you can use astrology
and numerology

00:18:50.563 --> 00:18:54.334 align:middle line:84%
as a divination system
to help make decisions.

00:18:54.334 --> 00:18:57.337 align:middle line:84%
They have a branch of astrology
called horoeastrology [phonetic]

00:18:57.337 --> 00:18:58.671 align:middle line:90%
for that.

00:18:58.671 --> 00:19:03.476 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not too clear on how
you do that with numerology.

00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:04.877 align:middle line:90%
But it can be done.

00:19:04.877 --> 00:19:08.615 align:middle line:84%
But the tarot and I Ching are
kind of in a different category.

00:19:08.615 --> 00:19:09.749 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:19:09.749 --> 00:19:10.950 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: [Inaudible] too
in so far as it's used

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:12.218 align:middle line:90%
for divination at all.

00:19:12.218 --> 00:19:14.320 align:middle line:84%
And they're in a
category of, they're kind

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:17.724 align:middle line:90%
of the be here now experience.

00:19:17.724 --> 00:19:20.793 align:middle line:84%
In other words I'm going to
post some cards right now

00:19:20.793 --> 00:19:22.962 align:middle line:84%
about something that's
happening right now.

00:19:22.962 --> 00:19:26.599 align:middle line:84%
So astrology's reflecting
maybe the moment of your birth.

00:19:26.599 --> 00:19:27.800 align:middle line:90%
Now you can draw up...

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.168 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You have to
compute what's happening

00:19:29.168 --> 00:19:31.104 align:middle line:90%
since then, yeah progressive.

00:19:31.104 --> 00:19:33.940 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: Yeah or you can draw
up a chart of the here and now

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:35.308 align:middle line:90%
but not relative to yourself.

00:19:35.308 --> 00:19:38.044 align:middle line:84%
But you can, then you can
draw up a composite chart

00:19:38.044 --> 00:19:40.747 align:middle line:84%
which is the here and now
relative to your natal chart

00:19:40.747 --> 00:19:43.816 align:middle line:84%
which is going to give you
some indication of, you know,

00:19:43.816 --> 00:19:44.851 align:middle line:90%
where to focus right now.

00:19:44.851 --> 00:19:46.085 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:19:46.085 --> 00:19:47.387 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: You can do that
with astrology and compute.

00:19:47.387 --> 00:19:48.788 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't do it without
computers, that's for sure.

00:19:48.788 --> 00:19:53.293 align:middle line:84%
But the I Ching and tarot, those
are basically tools that you use

00:19:53.293 --> 00:19:56.029 align:middle line:84%
to reflect on something's
that happening

00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:57.430 align:middle line:90%
in your life right now.

00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:59.565 align:middle line:84%
It's some decision
you have to make

00:19:59.565 --> 00:20:02.835 align:middle line:84%
or some problem or
some relationship.

00:20:02.835 --> 00:20:05.905 align:middle line:84%
Like I might ask the question,
I don't even ask a question.

00:20:05.905 --> 00:20:09.642 align:middle line:84%
Like when I use I Ching
app on my iPhone or iPad

00:20:09.642 --> 00:20:14.614 align:middle line:84%
or an Android phone I might
just type somebody's name.

00:20:14.614 --> 00:20:16.816 align:middle line:84%
You know, and it's implied,
the question's implied.

00:20:16.816 --> 00:20:19.719 align:middle line:84%
And the question is what's
the best approach to take

00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:23.022 align:middle line:84%
with Mary Jane, you
know, or whatever?

00:20:23.022 --> 00:20:25.992 align:middle line:84%
So I might just put in, you
know, asking for a raise

00:20:25.992 --> 00:20:28.127 align:middle line:84%
or just something just
to help myself stay clear

00:20:28.127 --> 00:20:30.496 align:middle line:84%
about what I'm focused
on when I do that.

00:20:30.496 --> 00:20:33.199 align:middle line:84%
But getting back to
your question is do we

00:20:33.199 --> 00:20:34.300 align:middle line:90%
lose anything...

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:35.335 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:20:35.335 --> 00:20:36.302 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: By getting a
computer involved?

00:20:36.302 --> 00:20:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
have wondered

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.105 align:middle line:84%
about that especially
with tarot cards.

00:20:39.105 --> 00:20:40.173 align:middle line:84%
They like playing
with the cards.

00:20:40.173 --> 00:20:41.541 align:middle line:90%
They like holding the deck.

00:20:41.541 --> 00:20:43.509 align:middle line:84%
They feel like they're putting
their energy into the deck.

00:20:43.509 --> 00:20:47.013 align:middle line:84%
They want to shuffle the deck,
etc. And I totally understand

00:20:47.013 --> 00:20:48.348 align:middle line:84%
that and I totally
relate to that.

00:20:48.348 --> 00:20:49.916 align:middle line:84%
Same thing with the I Ching,
you want to hold the coins,

00:20:49.916 --> 00:20:53.686 align:middle line:84%
etc. Now here's the disadvantage
to doing it the old fashion way.

00:20:53.686 --> 00:20:55.321 align:middle line:90%
Before I get into the question

00:20:55.321 --> 00:20:56.889 align:middle line:84%
of how did we solve
this problem?

00:20:56.889 --> 00:21:00.860 align:middle line:84%
The disadvantage is if I toss
the coins six times I have

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:03.830 align:middle line:84%
to interrupt this process of
focusing on my question in order

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:06.933 align:middle line:84%
to analyze how do the coins
land and then draw that.

00:21:06.933 --> 00:21:08.601 align:middle line:90%
So that's busy work.

00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:09.602 align:middle line:90%
You know, I don't have to...

00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:10.703 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You're breaking
the, the focus.

00:21:10.703 --> 00:21:11.971 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: That's right,
I'm breaking my focus

00:21:11.971 --> 00:21:13.306 align:middle line:90%
on the meditation I'm having,

00:21:13.306 --> 00:21:16.642 align:middle line:84%
on whatever my query
is gets interfered

00:21:16.642 --> 00:21:20.480 align:middle line:84%
with by this busy work
that I've got to do.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.015 align:middle line:84%
And so the computer
solves that problem.

00:21:23.015 --> 00:21:24.350 align:middle line:90%
Same thing with tarot.

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:29.655 align:middle line:84%
So, but getting back to
your original question,

00:21:29.655 --> 00:21:33.226 align:middle line:84%
was I concerned about the
energetic authenticity

00:21:33.226 --> 00:21:34.260 align:middle line:90%
of the experience?

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:35.628 align:middle line:90%
Yes I was.

00:21:35.628 --> 00:21:42.435 align:middle line:84%
And in fact after I created
these things I defined the three

00:21:42.435 --> 00:21:45.271 align:middle line:84%
characteristics of
interactive divination.

00:21:45.271 --> 00:21:48.708 align:middle line:84%
I called them interactive
because you're using software,

00:21:48.708 --> 00:21:50.910 align:middle line:90%
multimedia to interact.

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:55.314 align:middle line:84%
And so interactive divination,
the three things I was concerned

00:21:55.314 --> 00:21:57.950 align:middle line:84%
about it had to be
mathematically authentic,

00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:02.789 align:middle line:84%
it had to be energetically
authentic and it had

00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:07.693 align:middle line:84%
to be emotionally resonate which
was more of the multimedia thing

00:22:07.693 --> 00:22:11.164 align:middle line:84%
of creating a feeling,
you know, or an ambiance

00:22:11.164 --> 00:22:13.699 align:middle line:90%
for I called it ritual space.

00:22:13.699 --> 00:22:16.502 align:middle line:84%
So I saw myself as a
pioneer in the development

00:22:16.502 --> 00:22:19.372 align:middle line:84%
of ritual space specifically
having to do

00:22:19.372 --> 00:22:20.873 align:middle line:90%
with divination rituals.

00:22:20.873 --> 00:22:22.675 align:middle line:90%
So I thought of it as a ritual.

00:22:22.675 --> 00:22:26.045 align:middle line:84%
Okay, so when it came to
counting the coins, I,

00:22:26.045 --> 00:22:29.949 align:middle line:84%
it was easy to make it
mathematically accurate.

00:22:29.949 --> 00:22:32.852 align:middle line:84%
I mean, computers
can handle math

00:22:32.852 --> 00:22:34.687 align:middle line:84%
that goes way beyond
anything that I Ching

00:22:34.687 --> 00:22:36.255 align:middle line:90%
or tarot will throw at it.

00:22:36.255 --> 00:22:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And you can in a lot of Websites
or software like for tarot

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:44.263 align:middle line:84%
for instance, you push
a button, bing it flings

00:22:44.263 --> 00:22:46.299 align:middle line:90%
out seven cards, you know.

00:22:46.299 --> 00:22:49.101 align:middle line:84%
Well to me that's not
energetically authentic.

00:22:49.101 --> 00:22:51.003 align:middle line:90%
You didn't pick those cards.

00:22:51.003 --> 00:22:52.371 align:middle line:90%
You just pushed a button

00:22:52.371 --> 00:22:56.142 align:middle line:84%
and then the computer picks
them cards using some program,

00:22:56.142 --> 00:22:59.345 align:middle line:84%
random number generator program
they call them, whatever.

00:22:59.345 --> 00:23:00.480 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.781 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: To me that's not
energetically authentic.

00:23:01.781 --> 00:23:03.850 align:middle line:84%
So in an answer to your
question a lot of times

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:06.519 align:middle line:84%
when people computerize these
things they do it wrong.

00:23:06.519 --> 00:23:08.988 align:middle line:84%
It's not authentic
and it is, you know,

00:23:08.988 --> 00:23:10.323 align:middle line:90%
it's not really their reading.

00:23:10.323 --> 00:23:12.358 align:middle line:84%
Same thing with the I Ching,
it's easy to click a button

00:23:12.358 --> 00:23:14.127 align:middle line:90%
and have it spit out six lines.

00:23:14.127 --> 00:23:17.063 align:middle line:84%
And there's, I could name off
sites that do it that way.

00:23:17.063 --> 00:23:18.898 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't want
to do it that way.

00:23:18.898 --> 00:23:21.701 align:middle line:84%
There had to be a
connection between what you do

00:23:21.701 --> 00:23:23.769 align:middle line:90%
and what the result was.

00:23:23.769 --> 00:23:25.771 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Sounds extremely
complex [inaudible]

00:23:25.771 --> 00:23:27.573 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: Well I had to come
up with a way to do it.

00:23:27.573 --> 00:23:28.941 align:middle line:90%
I had to come up with a way

00:23:28.941 --> 00:23:31.944 align:middle line:84%
to cast three coins six times
using a mouse and keyboard.

00:23:31.944 --> 00:23:36.315 align:middle line:84%
And this was in 1989 when
the Macintosh was still

00:23:36.315 --> 00:23:37.650 align:middle line:90%
pretty primitive.

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:38.918 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Big cube on
your desk, yeah.

00:23:38.918 --> 00:23:41.354 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: But it was the only
computer that had a mouse.

00:23:41.354 --> 00:23:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And in fact IBM used to
compete with Apple by saying

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:49.896 align:middle line:84%
if God wanted you to use a
mouse he would have given you

00:23:49.896 --> 00:23:53.099 align:middle line:90%
three hands.

00:23:53.099 --> 00:23:57.270 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I figured out a way
to do it using timing, okay.

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:59.272 align:middle line:84%
So like there's four
different kinds of lines

00:23:59.272 --> 00:24:02.175 align:middle line:84%
that you can get
with the I Ching.

00:24:02.175 --> 00:24:05.044 align:middle line:84%
There's the yin which
is the feminine,

00:24:05.044 --> 00:24:06.512 align:middle line:90%
yang which is the masculine,

00:24:06.512 --> 00:24:09.515 align:middle line:84%
you get changing yin
and changing yang.

00:24:09.515 --> 00:24:12.018 align:middle line:84%
Each one of those
lines has certain odds

00:24:12.018 --> 00:24:13.486 align:middle line:90%
that can be calculated.

00:24:13.486 --> 00:24:14.820 align:middle line:84%
Like if you're using
three coins,

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:16.923 align:middle line:84%
the odds of getting three
heads if one in eight.

00:24:16.923 --> 00:24:19.692 align:middle line:84%
The odds of getting three
tails is one in eight.

00:24:19.692 --> 00:24:23.863 align:middle line:84%
If you use the sticks, the older
method, the yarrow stock method

00:24:23.863 --> 00:24:26.198 align:middle line:84%
of the I Ching, the
odds are different.

00:24:26.198 --> 00:24:30.236 align:middle line:84%
And I won't go into the details
but we divided it up into 16ths.

00:24:30.236 --> 00:24:33.105 align:middle line:84%
So imagine that there's
this imaginary wheel

00:24:33.105 --> 00:24:35.441 align:middle line:84%
and it's got 16 notches
around it

00:24:35.441 --> 00:24:38.210 align:middle line:84%
that represent the distribution
of those of the odds

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:40.446 align:middle line:84%
of the four different
kinds of lines you can get.

00:24:40.446 --> 00:24:41.781 align:middle line:90%
And imagine you push a button

00:24:41.781 --> 00:24:44.784 align:middle line:84%
like a mouse button
perhaps or a spacebar.

00:24:44.784 --> 00:24:47.019 align:middle line:84%
And you push a button and you
hold it down and when you,

00:24:47.019 --> 00:24:48.421 align:middle line:90%
the minute that you hold it

00:24:48.421 --> 00:24:51.791 align:middle line:84%
down that wheel starts spinning
thousands of times per second.

00:24:51.791 --> 00:24:54.594 align:middle line:84%
And then boom you let it
up, that's your first line.

00:24:54.594 --> 00:24:56.028 align:middle line:90%
So it's your timing.

00:24:56.028 --> 00:24:58.230 align:middle line:84%
It's your timing
that's determining...

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:01.100 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Because you have an
interface as you move the device

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.702 align:middle line:90%
for example with the app.

00:25:02.702 --> 00:25:05.371 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: Yeah, well the app
it's, we do it differently.

00:25:05.371 --> 00:25:06.505 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Okay go ahead.

00:25:06.505 --> 00:25:08.975 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: Okay, although
we do it that way too.

00:25:08.975 --> 00:25:11.243 align:middle line:90%
You can actually press the app.

00:25:11.243 --> 00:25:12.411 align:middle line:90%
I showed you how to shake it.

00:25:12.411 --> 00:25:13.546 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:25:13.546 --> 00:25:14.714 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: You know, which
is kind of a cool thing

00:25:14.714 --> 00:25:15.381 align:middle line:84%
because it's kind of
like shaking three coins.

00:25:15.381 --> 00:25:16.682 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah, right.

00:25:16.682 --> 00:25:19.485 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: And I was very
particular when I worked

00:25:19.485 --> 00:25:22.555 align:middle line:84%
with that app developer who
by the way approached me

00:25:22.555 --> 00:25:29.762 align:middle line:84%
because I had just published the
Visionary I Ching as an eBook.

00:25:29.762 --> 00:25:32.865 align:middle line:90%
Now it's an illustrated I Ching.

00:25:32.865 --> 00:25:35.134 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the world's
only illustrated ones.

00:25:35.134 --> 00:25:37.169 align:middle line:84%
We've got 64 beautiful
paintings.

00:25:37.169 --> 00:25:39.138 align:middle line:84%
I think we're going to
look at it in a while.

00:25:39.138 --> 00:25:40.439 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: They're gorgeous.

00:25:40.439 --> 00:25:42.775 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: But and this artist
had done these 64 paintings

00:25:42.775 --> 00:25:44.443 align:middle line:84%
and she was inspired
by the I Ching

00:25:44.443 --> 00:25:47.346 align:middle line:84%
and I stumbled across
her somehow.

00:25:47.346 --> 00:25:51.217 align:middle line:84%
And she's just a humble artist
down in the Bay area who...

00:25:51.217 --> 00:25:52.318 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: She does beautiful work.

00:25:52.318 --> 00:25:53.452 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Yeah.

00:25:53.452 --> 00:25:55.321 align:middle line:84%
And I was so impressed
and I said, you know,

00:25:55.321 --> 00:25:57.023 align:middle line:90%
maybe we can work together.

00:25:57.023 --> 00:26:00.192 align:middle line:84%
And so we put it together and I
created it in the eBook format.

00:26:00.192 --> 00:26:03.729 align:middle line:84%
And we may come out with a
print copy but, you know,

00:26:03.729 --> 00:26:06.065 align:middle line:84%
it's very expensive
to do art in a book.

00:26:06.065 --> 00:26:06.999 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Especially yes like this,

00:26:06.999 --> 00:26:08.034 align:middle line:84%
four color print
and stuff like...

00:26:08.034 --> 00:26:09.268 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: [Inaudible]
beautiful color art.

00:26:09.268 --> 00:26:14.006 align:middle line:84%
But it looks great on an
eBook especially a color one

00:26:14.006 --> 00:26:17.176 align:middle line:84%
like an iPad or a color
Kindle, that kind of thing.

00:26:17.176 --> 00:26:18.511 align:middle line:90%
So we did the eBook.

00:26:18.511 --> 00:26:21.881 align:middle line:84%
Well this developer from
France contacted me.

00:26:21.881 --> 00:26:23.015 align:middle line:90%
He's an app developer.

00:26:23.015 --> 00:26:25.251 align:middle line:84%
And this just happened
last, last fall.

00:26:25.251 --> 00:26:29.989 align:middle line:84%
And he was looking for an I
Ching author because he wanted

00:26:29.989 --> 00:26:33.626 align:middle line:84%
to do a I Ching app because
he had just done some kind

00:26:33.626 --> 00:26:36.829 align:middle line:84%
of oracle card app
for somebody else.

00:26:36.829 --> 00:26:40.266 align:middle line:84%
Not classical divination
but some other form.

00:26:40.266 --> 00:26:42.468 align:middle line:84%
And he had decided he
wanted to do the I Ching

00:26:42.468 --> 00:26:47.006 align:middle line:84%
because he had the engine that
he felt he could adapt to that.

00:26:47.006 --> 00:26:52.478 align:middle line:84%
So I said well I not only
have a modern I Ching

00:26:52.478 --> 00:26:57.950 align:middle line:84%
that in all humility I think is
the best for modern audiences,

00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:00.519 align:middle line:90%
I have art to go along with it.

00:27:00.519 --> 00:27:02.021 align:middle line:90%
So this could be good.

00:27:02.021 --> 00:27:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking
about doing an app

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:09.128 align:middle line:84%
because I'm have a
background in software.

00:27:09.128 --> 00:27:12.264 align:middle line:84%
But since I sold tarot.com
I don't really want

00:27:12.264 --> 00:27:13.299 align:middle line:90%
to work that hard.

00:27:13.299 --> 00:27:15.735 align:middle line:84%
So maybe this is
what's meant to be.

00:27:15.735 --> 00:27:17.570 align:middle line:90%
So we got to talking and we kind

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:19.505 align:middle line:84%
of hit it off and
we made a deal.

00:27:19.505 --> 00:27:22.341 align:middle line:84%
And I said okay, I'll
give you the rights

00:27:22.341 --> 00:27:27.379 align:middle line:84%
to use my content provided that
you give me creative control.

00:27:27.379 --> 00:27:29.381 align:middle line:90%
Because I have to make sure

00:27:29.381 --> 00:27:31.717 align:middle line:84%
that this thing's
energetically authentic.

00:27:31.717 --> 00:27:34.153 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you to
do this shaking thing.

00:27:34.153 --> 00:27:36.722 align:middle line:84%
Let's figure out a way
that we can do that.

00:27:36.722 --> 00:27:38.724 align:middle line:84%
And I won't bore you with
the technical details.

00:27:38.724 --> 00:27:39.925 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:27:39.925 --> 00:27:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: But he was
completely resonate with that

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:42.428 align:middle line:90%
and he agreed to all that.

00:27:42.428 --> 00:27:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And he did everything the way
that I needed it to be done

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:46.832 align:middle line:90%
for him to use my content.

00:27:46.832 --> 00:27:49.502 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very, very happy
with the result in terms

00:27:49.502 --> 00:27:53.072 align:middle line:84%
of the visionary I Ching
app that's available

00:27:53.072 --> 00:27:55.040 align:middle line:90%
for iPhone and Android now.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.375 align:middle line:90%
And so that's a real new thing.

00:27:56.375 --> 00:27:58.444 align:middle line:84%
That just came out
about two months ago.

00:27:58.444 --> 00:28:00.179 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: But does it have
the same characteristics

00:28:00.179 --> 00:28:01.647 align:middle line:84%
as the original programming
you did

00:28:01.647 --> 00:28:03.149 align:middle line:90%
in terms of that authenticity?

00:28:03.149 --> 00:28:04.183 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:28:04.183 --> 00:28:05.818 align:middle line:84%
I fact, I think it's
better than ever.

00:28:05.818 --> 00:28:08.454 align:middle line:84%
I think that this thing
was made for an app.

00:28:08.454 --> 00:28:09.855 align:middle line:90%
And so you can take it with you.

00:28:09.855 --> 00:28:11.891 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I can take the
phone and I can cast the coins

00:28:11.891 --> 00:28:13.826 align:middle line:84%
like that just like
I might do like that.

00:28:13.826 --> 00:28:15.161 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Well you know what?

00:28:15.161 --> 00:28:18.230 align:middle line:84%
I brought my iPad because
prior to our interview I wanted

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:21.200 align:middle line:84%
to kind of check out and see
what was going on with the app.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:24.870 align:middle line:90%
And so I pulled it up.

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:27.339 align:middle line:84%
And it rather than starting
from the beginning we'll see

00:28:27.339 --> 00:28:30.176 align:middle line:84%
if we can get a little
shot over my shoulder

00:28:30.176 --> 00:28:31.610 align:middle line:90%
and take a look at this.

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:34.814 align:middle line:84%
The artwork, this is,
this is the card I pulled

00:28:34.814 --> 00:28:36.482 align:middle line:90%
up before we started today.

00:28:36.482 --> 00:28:37.883 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: It's beautiful.

00:28:37.883 --> 00:28:41.787 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And just for fun about
this interview and it brought

00:28:41.787 --> 00:28:46.158 align:middle line:84%
up number 58 which
is joy and number 1

00:28:46.158 --> 00:28:47.560 align:middle line:90%
which is creative power.

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:51.096 align:middle line:84%
One represents the present and
the other is the future of it.

00:28:51.096 --> 00:28:52.231 align:middle line:90%
But you can see as you get

00:28:52.231 --> 00:28:55.134 align:middle line:84%
in here the artwork is
absolutely beautiful.

00:28:55.134 --> 00:28:57.636 align:middle line:84%
But what I want to
do is now tap on this

00:28:57.636 --> 00:28:59.171 align:middle line:84%
so people can see
how this works.

00:28:59.171 --> 00:29:00.906 align:middle line:90%
You did a great job by the way.

00:29:00.906 --> 00:29:04.977 align:middle line:84%
Okay, so we're tapping on
the present which is joy,

00:29:04.977 --> 00:29:06.812 align:middle line:90%
lake above and lake below.

00:29:06.812 --> 00:29:09.915 align:middle line:84%
And up in this corner we
hit this and we go to flip

00:29:09.915 --> 00:29:12.218 align:middle line:84%
and it flips the card
over and then it gives...

00:29:12.218 --> 00:29:14.086 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: You know you could just
swipe it and it'll flip over.

00:29:14.086 --> 00:29:15.321 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Okay or swipe it.

00:29:15.321 --> 00:29:16.021 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Yeah.

00:29:16.021 --> 00:29:17.389 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: You should know.

00:29:17.389 --> 00:29:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And it starts giving you the
text that of each of the lines

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:25.564 align:middle line:84%
and what, what basically what
that card represents to you

00:29:25.564 --> 00:29:28.567 align:middle line:84%
in the moment, the dynamic of
the situation in the moment.

00:29:28.567 --> 00:29:31.337 align:middle line:84%
And another cool thing
is you can share it

00:29:31.337 --> 00:29:32.404 align:middle line:90%
so you can send it off

00:29:32.404 --> 00:29:34.273 align:middle line:84%
to someone via I guess
email or Facebook.

00:29:34.273 --> 00:29:35.107 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Facebook yeah.

00:29:35.107 --> 00:29:36.375 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: And you can also save it.

00:29:36.375 --> 00:29:38.410 align:middle line:84%
There's a journal
of sorts in there.

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:39.511 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Right.

00:29:39.511 --> 00:29:40.913 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And you can save
it and you title it.

00:29:40.913 --> 00:29:41.947 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: Yeah because you might
not have time, you might want

00:29:41.947 --> 00:29:43.616 align:middle line:84%
to get the general
impression and look

00:29:43.616 --> 00:29:45.050 align:middle line:90%
at it more closely later.

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:46.285 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:29:46.285 --> 00:29:48.954 align:middle line:84%
Okay, now let's take a
look a little more closely.

00:29:48.954 --> 00:29:51.523 align:middle line:84%
So here you go, here's what
it looks like when you want

00:29:51.523 --> 00:29:53.425 align:middle line:90%
to start a reading, right?

00:29:53.425 --> 00:29:54.126 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: That's right.

00:29:54.126 --> 00:29:55.094 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: So there we go.

00:29:55.094 --> 00:29:56.395 align:middle line:90%
Go on a reading.

00:29:56.395 --> 00:29:59.465 align:middle line:84%
And here this is where you
become clear in your thought

00:29:59.465 --> 00:30:03.369 align:middle line:84%
and you can, you can write the
subject in here or the name

00:30:03.369 --> 00:30:04.570 align:middle line:90%
of the person or whatnot.

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:07.273 align:middle line:84%
Or you can just hold it
in your mind with clarity.

00:30:07.273 --> 00:30:10.409 align:middle line:84%
Then it says here you take three
deep breaths while focusing

00:30:10.409 --> 00:30:12.011 align:middle line:90%
on your subject.

00:30:12.011 --> 00:30:14.914 align:middle line:84%
Really bring it in,
give it some energy.

00:30:14.914 --> 00:30:19.018 align:middle line:84%
Then as you continue you
start casting the coins.

00:30:19.018 --> 00:30:22.621 align:middle line:84%
And I was shaking it like crazy
like boom, boom, boom, okay.

00:30:22.621 --> 00:30:25.090 align:middle line:84%
There's my first
line, the second line.

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:27.526 align:middle line:84%
And they start stacking up
and you do this six times.

00:30:27.526 --> 00:30:31.063 align:middle line:84%
I might as well do it just so we
can get a nice little reading.

00:30:31.063 --> 00:30:36.035 align:middle line:90%
And one more, six, six, okay.

00:30:36.035 --> 00:30:39.405 align:middle line:84%
So there it goes and
that's how it pops up.

00:30:39.405 --> 00:30:41.507 align:middle line:84%
Your reading for the
present and future.

00:30:41.507 --> 00:30:44.543 align:middle line:84%
Now I wasn't tapping in
or asking for anything

00:30:44.543 --> 00:30:48.380 align:middle line:84%
but it says here
nearing completion.

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:51.784 align:middle line:84%
We still have 25 minutes left
so we're not nearing completion.

00:30:51.784 --> 00:30:53.519 align:middle line:90%
But anyway, there you go.

00:30:53.519 --> 00:30:55.521 align:middle line:84%
And then boom again,
back to flip.

00:30:55.521 --> 00:30:57.856 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: Or you could
email that to yourself.

00:30:57.856 --> 00:30:59.491 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And you can
email it to yourself.

00:30:59.491 --> 00:31:01.226 align:middle line:90%
I did that on a couple of them.

00:31:01.226 --> 00:31:03.595 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you I shared
this with a couple

00:31:03.595 --> 00:31:06.298 align:middle line:90%
of people right off the bat.

00:31:06.298 --> 00:31:08.934 align:middle line:84%
Anyways and here's where you
enter it in your journal, right?

00:31:08.934 --> 00:31:10.336 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Right.

00:31:10.336 --> 00:31:11.737 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You're reading in your
journal when you save afterward.

00:31:11.737 --> 00:31:17.209 align:middle line:84%
So, I have to say not only is it
really easy and useful and easy

00:31:17.209 --> 00:31:19.078 align:middle line:90%
to share in this age of Aquarius

00:31:19.078 --> 00:31:21.313 align:middle line:84%
where sharing information
is really part

00:31:21.313 --> 00:31:23.215 align:middle line:84%
of what we're supposed
to be doing.

00:31:23.215 --> 00:31:27.353 align:middle line:84%
But the first time I did it
I was asking a very specific

00:31:27.353 --> 00:31:31.690 align:middle line:84%
question and the card that came
up had that exact language in it

00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:33.192 align:middle line:84%
in the present, the
exact language.

00:31:33.192 --> 00:31:36.462 align:middle line:84%
I thought well kind of like the
very first time you did the I

00:31:36.462 --> 00:31:39.732 align:middle line:84%
Ching when you were an arrogant
young fellow with that woman.

00:31:39.732 --> 00:31:41.867 align:middle line:84%
You were trying to
dare it and put her on.

00:31:41.867 --> 00:31:45.437 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: I was making fun of
it and I got youthful folly.

00:31:45.437 --> 00:31:47.740 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Exactly, I
love that story.

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:50.676 align:middle line:84%
We talked about that story
in our first conversation.

00:31:50.676 --> 00:31:53.746 align:middle line:84%
But I found it was
really right on.

00:31:53.746 --> 00:31:55.647 align:middle line:84%
So I started sharing
it with people.

00:31:55.647 --> 00:31:57.082 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: Well, you
know, it's actually,

00:31:57.082 --> 00:31:58.717 align:middle line:90%
you can get it for free too.

00:31:58.717 --> 00:32:01.720 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you first get it
it's free but it kind of locks

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.757 align:middle line:84%
out some of the future
hexagram and the changing lines.

00:32:04.757 --> 00:32:05.824 align:middle line:84%
So it locks out some
of the features.

00:32:05.824 --> 00:32:07.893 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
upgrade it at that point.

00:32:07.893 --> 00:32:09.228 align:middle line:90%
You pay for it.

00:32:09.228 --> 00:32:11.663 align:middle line:84%
Now this was my programmers,
my developer partner's idea.

00:32:11.663 --> 00:32:13.298 align:middle line:90%
I was okay with it.

00:32:13.298 --> 00:32:16.568 align:middle line:84%
So last night just to tell you,
I was at dinner with six people.

00:32:16.568 --> 00:32:20.105 align:middle line:90%
Three of them had Smartphones.

00:32:20.105 --> 00:32:24.276 align:middle line:84%
And we got around to
talking about what I'm doing

00:32:24.276 --> 00:32:26.845 align:middle line:84%
and I mentioned the app
and they wanted to see it.

00:32:26.845 --> 00:32:29.715 align:middle line:84%
And three of them bought
it right on the spot.

00:32:29.715 --> 00:32:31.116 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:32:31.116 --> 00:32:32.618 align:middle line:84%
Well that's what happened when I
started sharing it with people.

00:32:32.618 --> 00:32:35.154 align:middle line:84%
They tried the freebie which
is just the present card.

00:32:35.154 --> 00:32:37.189 align:middle line:84%
And they're like whoa,
this is pretty good.

00:32:37.189 --> 00:32:38.624 align:middle line:84%
So they, almost everyone
bought it.

00:32:38.624 --> 00:32:40.225 align:middle line:90%
What for $3.99?

00:32:40.225 --> 00:32:41.493 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: No it's $5.99.

00:32:41.493 --> 00:32:43.328 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Five ninety nine,
something like that, so.

00:32:43.328 --> 00:32:45.964 align:middle line:84%
But for a lifetime of
divination, sure why not?

00:32:45.964 --> 00:32:47.199 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Yeah, yeah.

00:32:47.199 --> 00:32:48.934 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And so far I've
gotten really good responses

00:32:48.934 --> 00:32:50.803 align:middle line:84%
from people that
have given it a try.

00:32:50.803 --> 00:32:52.171 align:middle line:90%
So...

00:32:52.171 --> 00:32:55.707 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: We used to charge, we
used to charge $3.00 a reading.

00:32:55.707 --> 00:32:57.242 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I know you had to
cut certain people off

00:32:57.242 --> 00:32:58.644 align:middle line:84%
because they were
maxing out their card.

00:32:58.644 --> 00:33:00.312 align:middle line:84%
The ones that were
super insecure.

00:33:00.312 --> 00:33:01.480 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Right, so, you know,

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:03.449 align:middle line:84%
for six bucks it's
a pretty good deal.

00:33:03.449 --> 00:33:05.150 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, I
just have to say

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:09.321 align:middle line:84%
that Eric the French programmer
did such a marvelous job.

00:33:09.321 --> 00:33:13.125 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so grateful to him
because I wouldn't have done it.

00:33:13.125 --> 00:33:14.560 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't going to do it.

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:18.564 align:middle line:84%
But now it just delivers this to
people in a very portable way.

00:33:18.564 --> 00:33:19.565 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: And a beautiful way.

00:33:19.565 --> 00:33:20.799 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Thank you, thank you.

00:33:20.799 --> 00:33:24.303 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Easy, easy to access
and beautiful as well.

00:33:24.303 --> 00:33:27.206 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to go back to
that larger discussion again

00:33:27.206 --> 00:33:30.142 align:middle line:84%
for just a moment because as
you were talking I was kind

00:33:30.142 --> 00:33:32.878 align:middle line:90%
of flashing back on experiments

00:33:32.878 --> 00:33:34.480 align:middle line:84%
that have been replicated
many times.

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:36.482 align:middle line:84%
But it was a, it was
an interview I did

00:33:36.482 --> 00:33:39.384 align:middle line:90%
in the 1980s with Russell Targ.

00:33:39.384 --> 00:33:41.854 align:middle line:84%
And they were in Russia doing
remote viewing experiments.

00:33:41.854 --> 00:33:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is relevant
to the question

00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:46.658 align:middle line:90%
or maybe it's just a comment.

00:33:46.658 --> 00:33:51.230 align:middle line:84%
What they were finding was
that the subjects were able

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:54.500 align:middle line:84%
to view more clearly into
the future where they jumped

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:57.903 align:middle line:84%
out of the time space continuum
and all the interference of now.

00:33:57.903 --> 00:34:02.007 align:middle line:84%
But what they were doing
was influencing the choices

00:34:02.007 --> 00:34:04.676 align:middle line:90%
of a random image generator.

00:34:04.676 --> 00:34:06.078 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Wow.

00:34:06.078 --> 00:34:09.180 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: What I'm saying is, well
you know what I'm saying are,

00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:13.651 align:middle line:84%
is our consciousness
affecting the images

00:34:13.651 --> 00:34:16.889 align:middle line:84%
and the way the coins are going
to be tossed in a similar way.

00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:19.358 align:middle line:84%
That was an interface
with technology.

have a scientific answer

think it's very possible the

00:34:25.764 --> 00:34:28.934 align:middle line:84%
synchronicity principle says
that everything that happens

00:34:28.934 --> 00:34:31.470 align:middle line:84%
in a given moment
of time is related

our psychic powers.

I know you've worked
it out mathematically.

You've worked out the odds.

You've given it this
ritual environment

experience online.

to say some of these answers,

oracle gave you the card

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:56.448 align:middle line:84%

a meditative state

of the time whether you
happen to have a tarot deck

00:37:21.006 --> 00:37:23.842 align:middle line:90%
or an I Ching app or not.

00:37:23.842 --> 00:37:26.111 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So, now let's
go on to tarot a bit.

00:37:26.111 --> 00:37:27.512 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Okay.

00:37:27.512 --> 00:37:28.647 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So we here, so here we
just have a lovely little deck.

00:37:28.647 --> 00:37:31.149 align:middle line:84%
We go into tarot which
we're dealing with like

00:37:31.149 --> 00:37:33.719 align:middle line:84%
with playing cards you have
some suits and so forth.

00:37:33.719 --> 00:37:35.087 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Okay, yeah.

00:37:35.087 --> 00:37:37.255 align:middle line:84%
So what we had, we had the same
problem with the tarot cards

00:37:37.255 --> 00:37:39.958 align:middle line:84%
that we had with the I Ching
in the sense of wanting

00:37:39.958 --> 00:37:42.627 align:middle line:84%
to make it energetically
authentic.

00:37:42.627 --> 00:37:45.330 align:middle line:84%
We didn't, we didn't
want people,

00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:47.733 align:middle line:84%
we didn't want the computer
picking the cards for you.

00:37:47.733 --> 00:37:53.705 align:middle line:84%
So what we did was we
basically to solve the problem

00:37:53.705 --> 00:37:56.041 align:middle line:84%
of shuffling because people
like to shuffle and they feel

00:37:56.041 --> 00:37:57.642 align:middle line:84%
like the way they shuffle
make it a difference

00:37:57.642 --> 00:37:59.144 align:middle line:90%
and it is making a difference.

00:37:59.144 --> 00:38:02.214 align:middle line:84%
So what we did was
we had a thing

00:38:02.214 --> 00:38:04.549 align:middle line:84%
where you could hold the
mouse button down on,

00:38:04.549 --> 00:38:07.619 align:middle line:84%
there was a representation
of the deck on a screen.

00:38:07.619 --> 00:38:10.956 align:middle line:84%
You hold the mouse button down
on it and it would, you know,

00:38:10.956 --> 00:38:13.859 align:middle line:84%
it'd fan out the
cards like that.

00:38:13.859 --> 00:38:16.461 align:middle line:84%
And then if you wanted
to mix them

00:38:16.461 --> 00:38:18.864 align:middle line:84%
up you'd hold the mouse button
down and then it would kind

00:38:18.864 --> 00:38:20.298 align:middle line:84%
of go like that and
you'd see this visual.

00:38:20.298 --> 00:38:22.567 align:middle line:84%
And they actually
were mixing them up.

00:38:22.567 --> 00:38:24.936 align:middle line:84%
And we did all this
research on how do cards,

00:38:24.936 --> 00:38:27.773 align:middle line:84%
how well do they mix depending
on the age of the deck.

00:38:27.773 --> 00:38:31.843 align:middle line:84%
And so we tracked how many times
that person had used that deck.

00:38:31.843 --> 00:38:33.111 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Interesting.

00:38:33.111 --> 00:38:34.279 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: And, and I mean we
really got anal about it.

00:38:34.279 --> 00:38:35.414 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:38:35.414 --> 00:38:37.182 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: But at the end
of the day it didn't,

00:38:37.182 --> 00:38:40.085 align:middle line:84%
the shuffling part didn't
matter so much because we'd fan

00:38:40.085 --> 00:38:43.121 align:middle line:84%
out 78 cards on the
screen like that

00:38:43.121 --> 00:38:46.291 align:middle line:84%
and then you'd use the mouse
and you say that's my first one.

00:38:46.291 --> 00:38:47.726 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: That's the one I
was just going to choose.

00:38:47.726 --> 00:38:48.527 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Is that right?

00:38:48.527 --> 00:38:49.294 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Exactly.

00:38:49.294 --> 00:38:49.961 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Okay, so six of...

00:38:49.961 --> 00:38:50.629 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: What is that?

00:38:50.629 --> 00:38:51.630 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Six of coins.

00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:54.466 align:middle line:84%
Okay and so then
you'd say okay, boom.

00:38:54.466 --> 00:38:56.034 align:middle line:84%
And you'd just pick
them like that.

00:38:56.034 --> 00:38:57.502 align:middle line:84%
Just like you would
on a tabletop.

00:38:57.502 --> 00:39:01.473 align:middle line:84%
So there was no question that
you were picking your own cards.

00:39:01.473 --> 00:39:04.910 align:middle line:84%
Whereas most of the Websites
that do any semblance of tarot

00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:10.081 align:middle line:84%
or purport to do tarot, they,
they pick the cards for you.

00:39:10.081 --> 00:39:13.785 align:middle line:84%
You know, you click a button
and kaboom, 11 cards pop up.

00:39:13.785 --> 00:39:14.886 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah, right.

00:39:14.886 --> 00:39:15.954 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: Well I didn't
want to do it like that

00:39:15.954 --> 00:39:19.157 align:middle line:84%
because to me I have
too much respect

00:39:19.157 --> 00:39:22.961 align:middle line:84%
for what these tools can
do if they're respected.

00:39:22.961 --> 00:39:25.397 align:middle line:84%
Because I found out through
my own experience what happens

00:39:25.397 --> 00:39:27.365 align:middle line:90%
when you disrespect them.

00:39:27.365 --> 00:39:29.034 align:middle line:90%
They disrespect you back.

00:39:29.034 --> 00:39:30.235 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You mean from
that first...

00:39:30.235 --> 00:39:31.436 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Yeah, exactly.

00:39:31.436 --> 00:39:32.704 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: They disrespect,
yeah you deserved it too.

00:39:32.704 --> 00:39:34.873 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: I made fun of it
and it made fun of me.

00:39:34.873 --> 00:39:36.975 align:middle line:90%
I tested it, it tested me.

00:39:36.975 --> 00:39:40.579 align:middle line:84%
So the attitude and the
sincerity of your intention

00:39:40.579 --> 00:39:43.982 align:middle line:84%
that you bring to an experience
and this is a ritual, you know,

00:39:43.982 --> 00:39:45.617 align:middle line:90%
picking cards is a ritual.

00:39:45.617 --> 00:39:48.119 align:middle line:84%
You know and you pick your cards
and maybe you have a spread

00:39:48.119 --> 00:39:50.255 align:middle line:84%
and you already have agreed
what the spread means.

00:39:50.255 --> 00:39:51.323 align:middle line:90%
This is the present.

00:39:51.323 --> 00:39:52.257 align:middle line:90%
This is the past.

00:39:52.257 --> 00:39:53.859 align:middle line:90%
The next one's the near future.

00:39:53.859 --> 00:39:55.927 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Six of coins, the
chariot and all of that.

00:39:55.927 --> 00:39:57.062 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Yeah, right.

00:39:57.062 --> 00:39:59.764 align:middle line:84%
And so what you've got
is 78 archetypes here.

00:39:59.764 --> 00:40:03.034 align:middle line:84%
Now the interesting
thing about tarot is

00:40:03.034 --> 00:40:08.473 align:middle line:84%
that you've got this set of
correspondences, it's very rich

00:40:08.473 --> 00:40:12.844 align:middle line:84%
because you, each card, each of
the 22 of the major [inaudible]

00:40:12.844 --> 00:40:18.083 align:middle line:84%
which is the trump suit has
an astrological significator

00:40:18.083 --> 00:40:22.254 align:middle line:84%
and has a numerology
correspondent, goes up to 22.

00:40:22.254 --> 00:40:26.825 align:middle line:90%
And it has the tarot symbolism.

00:40:26.825 --> 00:40:28.493 align:middle line:84%
So you get the tarot
symbolism, you've got astrology,

00:40:28.493 --> 00:40:30.729 align:middle line:84%
you've got numerology
all built into this deck.

00:40:30.729 --> 00:40:34.399 align:middle line:90%
It's a very rich set of symbols.

00:40:34.399 --> 00:40:36.134 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a whole
body of knowledge

00:40:36.134 --> 00:40:39.604 align:middle line:90%
on how to interpret that.

00:40:39.604 --> 00:40:42.641 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: There is, Patrick
Flanagan who is another one

00:40:42.641 --> 00:40:46.011 align:middle line:84%
of our interviewees,
and is a devote

00:40:46.011 --> 00:40:48.046 align:middle line:84%
of this one particular
tarot book.

00:40:48.046 --> 00:40:51.216 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying that in case
anybody is interested in it.

00:40:51.216 --> 00:40:53.318 align:middle line:84%
It's highly esoteric
but it's supposed

00:40:53.318 --> 00:40:57.222 align:middle line:84%
to be the carrying
forward of knowledge,

00:40:57.222 --> 00:40:59.391 align:middle line:84%
the tarot initially
carrying forward

00:40:59.391 --> 00:41:02.727 align:middle line:84%
from the Atlantean period
of time in through Egypt.

00:41:02.727 --> 00:41:03.795 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Right.

00:41:03.795 --> 00:41:04.996 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And then what
became popularized.

00:41:04.996 --> 00:41:07.432 align:middle line:84%
And again this whole thing
secreted away, hidden,

00:41:07.432 --> 00:41:11.269 align:middle line:84%
the age of Pisces, everything
was hidden within the symbols.

00:41:11.269 --> 00:41:12.871 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain a
little bit about that?

00:41:12.871 --> 00:41:14.940 align:middle line:90%
Why, how that came to be?

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:16.274 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: Well that's
one of the theories

00:41:16.274 --> 00:41:17.876 align:middle line:90%
about the origins of tarot.

00:41:17.876 --> 00:41:23.582 align:middle line:84%
And we can't really prove
it because the church was

00:41:23.582 --> 00:41:30.722 align:middle line:84%
such a repressive force
for, you know, 1,500 years.

00:41:30.722 --> 00:41:32.123 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:41:32.123 --> 00:41:34.693 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: If you got caught doing
anything divinatory even though

00:41:34.693 --> 00:41:38.129 align:middle line:84%
like we said in a previous
conversation, we were talking

00:41:38.129 --> 00:41:40.699 align:middle line:84%
about divination in the
Bible and all of that

00:41:40.699 --> 00:41:44.135 align:middle line:84%
and how it was a part
of every culture.

00:41:44.135 --> 00:41:47.906 align:middle line:84%
And they haven't been conflicted
about it in India or China ever.

00:41:47.906 --> 00:41:49.174 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:41:49.174 --> 00:41:52.077 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: You know, but the
Christian church condemned it

00:41:52.077 --> 00:41:53.411 align:middle line:90%
almost right off the bat.

00:41:53.411 --> 00:41:56.147 align:middle line:84%
And when I say right off the
bat I don't mean going back

00:41:56.147 --> 00:41:57.549 align:middle line:90%
to Jesus.

00:41:57.549 --> 00:42:00.819 align:middle line:84%
I mean, going back to 325 when
they actually formed the church.

00:42:00.819 --> 00:42:04.322 align:middle line:84%
And so basically, you know, if
you didn't mind being burned

00:42:04.322 --> 00:42:07.392 align:middle line:84%
at the stake, you might be
very open about these things.

00:42:07.392 --> 00:42:10.462 align:middle line:84%
But most people do mind being
burned at the stake and so...

00:42:10.462 --> 00:42:11.596 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:42:11.596 --> 00:42:14.699 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: We, this makes it
very difficult to sort

00:42:14.699 --> 00:42:19.004 align:middle line:84%
out the true history because
everything had to be so secret.

00:42:19.004 --> 00:42:20.005 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Clubbed, yes
it was clubbed.

00:42:20.005 --> 00:42:23.208 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: Anything esoteric
or occult had

00:42:23.208 --> 00:42:25.777 align:middle line:84%
to go underground
for 1,000 years.

00:42:25.777 --> 00:42:27.479 align:middle line:90%
And that, that's...

00:42:27.479 --> 00:42:29.648 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So it's hard to
sort through the origins

00:42:29.648 --> 00:42:31.816 align:middle line:84%
but apparently Egypt
was supposed to be...

00:42:31.816 --> 00:42:33.051 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: Yeah, there's
a lot of Egyptian.

00:42:33.051 --> 00:42:34.886 align:middle line:84%
There's some decks
that have nothing.

00:42:34.886 --> 00:42:38.556 align:middle line:84%
Like the Otila deck is one
of them that harkens back

00:42:38.556 --> 00:42:41.593 align:middle line:84%
to the Egyptian symbology
because it was reckoned

00:42:41.593 --> 00:42:44.162 align:middle line:84%
that it came from the
Book of Thoth and...

00:42:44.162 --> 00:42:45.530 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:48.266 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: And that it all came
out of Egypt and that it flowed

00:42:48.266 --> 00:42:51.403 align:middle line:84%
through North Africa
through Spain with the Moors

00:42:51.403 --> 00:42:54.439 align:middle line:84%
and then it went to Italy and it
became, you know, they're not.

00:42:54.439 --> 00:42:57.575 align:middle line:84%
What the Wikipedia
will tell you is

00:42:57.575 --> 00:43:00.745 align:middle line:84%
that in the 15th century it
was a card game in Italy.

00:43:00.745 --> 00:43:02.847 align:middle line:84%
And then it became a
card game in France.

00:43:02.847 --> 00:43:06.785 align:middle line:84%
And then it started to be
used as a divination system

00:43:06.785 --> 00:43:13.224 align:middle line:84%
in the early 19th century when
the English decks came around.

00:43:13.224 --> 00:43:15.126 align:middle line:84%
Like it was near the
end of the 19th century

00:43:15.126 --> 00:43:18.196 align:middle line:84%
that the Rider Waite deck,
which is the best-selling deck,

00:43:18.196 --> 00:43:21.666 align:middle line:84%
and the Crowley deck
were created.

00:43:21.666 --> 00:43:23.868 align:middle line:84%
And that's when it
really started...

00:43:23.868 --> 00:43:26.237 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I bet the [inaudible]
Crowley, they're kind of creepy.

00:43:26.237 --> 00:43:26.905 align:middle line:90%
It's creepy stuff.

00:43:26.905 --> 00:43:27.472 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Yeah, right.

00:43:27.472 --> 00:43:28.173 align:middle line:90%
I don't like...

00:43:28.173 --> 00:43:29.774 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: It's a repellent.

00:43:29.774 --> 00:43:30.975 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: I don't like the way

00:43:30.975 --> 00:43:35.246 align:middle line:84%
that he named cards
cruelty or despair.

00:43:35.246 --> 00:43:36.314 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes, yeah.

00:43:36.314 --> 00:43:37.082 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: You know, I
don't think it should be

00:43:37.082 --> 00:43:38.183 align:middle line:90%
that didactic, you know.

00:43:38.183 --> 00:43:39.017 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah, agreed.

00:43:39.017 --> 00:43:41.653 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Yeah it was pretty scary.

00:43:41.653 --> 00:43:44.923 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well I, I cut myself
off but the name of the author

00:43:44.923 --> 00:43:46.991 align:middle line:84%
of that highly esoteric
book and I meant

00:43:46.991 --> 00:43:50.495 align:middle line:84%
to bring it here today just to
have you give it a look see,

00:43:50.495 --> 00:43:52.797 align:middle line:90%
his name is only Richman.

00:43:52.797 --> 00:43:56.234 align:middle line:84%
And I think this was
written in the 1920s or 30s.

00:43:56.234 --> 00:43:58.169 align:middle line:90%
[Inaudible] Richman mystic cards

00:43:58.169 --> 00:44:00.071 align:middle line:84%
and I don't remember
the subtitle of it, but.

00:44:00.071 --> 00:44:01.106 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Right.

00:44:01.106 --> 00:44:02.207 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: It goes into
that deep ancient,

00:44:02.207 --> 00:44:03.775 align:middle line:90%
ancient history of cards.

00:44:03.775 --> 00:44:06.511 align:middle line:84%
And so for anyone who really
wants to dig it's kind of fun.

00:44:06.511 --> 00:44:08.079 align:middle line:84%
So I just thought
I'd bring that up.

00:44:08.079 --> 00:44:09.414 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Right.

00:44:09.414 --> 00:44:11.549 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So you've explained
that yes, we're participating,

00:44:11.549 --> 00:44:15.987 align:middle line:84%
we're choosing the cards of the
deck, so that makes total sense

00:44:15.987 --> 00:44:17.622 align:middle line:84%
that you're having
a personal impact.

00:44:17.622 --> 00:44:18.723 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Right.

00:44:18.723 --> 00:44:20.225 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not really here
to promote tarot.com

00:44:20.225 --> 00:44:21.726 align:middle line:90%
or any particular service.

00:44:21.726 --> 00:44:23.094 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Sure.

00:44:23.094 --> 00:44:24.729 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: It's just
explaining the interface

00:44:24.729 --> 00:44:27.532 align:middle line:84%
between technology
and divination.

00:44:27.532 --> 00:44:28.900 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:31.436 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about numerology
a little bit because for me

00:44:31.436 --> 00:44:33.805 align:middle line:84%
that was one of the first
things maybe 30 years ago

00:44:33.805 --> 00:44:35.507 align:middle line:90%
that I became intrigued with.

00:44:35.507 --> 00:44:36.808 align:middle line:90%
A little bit of astrology.

00:44:36.808 --> 00:44:39.110 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
numerology and talk

00:44:39.110 --> 00:44:41.379 align:middle line:90%
about some of the roots of it.

00:44:41.379 --> 00:44:44.916 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: Right, well, you
know, the history of numbers

00:44:44.916 --> 00:44:48.553 align:middle line:84%
and the history of number
systems is fascinating.

00:44:48.553 --> 00:44:49.954 align:middle line:90%
And at some point, you know,

00:44:49.954 --> 00:44:53.258 align:middle line:84%
we in the west we
didn't have a zero.

00:44:53.258 --> 00:44:56.761 align:middle line:90%
We got the zero from the Arabs.

00:44:56.761 --> 00:44:59.597 align:middle line:90%
The Arabs invented the zero.

00:44:59.597 --> 00:45:04.669 align:middle line:84%
Before we had a zero we had
a hard time doing accounting.

00:45:04.669 --> 00:45:06.538 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes, we had abacus.

00:45:06.538 --> 00:45:11.176 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: So then what happened was
and I don't, I'm not an expert

00:45:11.176 --> 00:45:13.378 align:middle line:90%
on the history of numerology.

00:45:13.378 --> 00:45:17.115 align:middle line:84%
But basically the
numbers were seen

00:45:17.115 --> 00:45:20.685 align:middle line:84%
as archetypes in
and of themselves.

00:45:20.685 --> 00:45:24.088 align:middle line:84%
So the number 1,
that means unity.

00:45:24.088 --> 00:45:26.357 align:middle line:90%
That represents unity.

00:45:26.357 --> 00:45:29.861 align:middle line:84%
Number 2, polarity or
partnership depending

00:45:29.861 --> 00:45:30.695 align:middle line:90%
on how you want to look at it.

00:45:30.695 --> 00:45:31.763 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:45:31.763 --> 00:45:33.331 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: Three is the
triangle, you know,

00:45:33.331 --> 00:45:37.735 align:middle line:84%
and it has a particular
way of being interpreted.

00:45:37.735 --> 00:45:41.439 align:middle line:84%
And then the square is
a foundation, you know,

00:45:41.439 --> 00:45:44.809 align:middle line:84%
and etc. So each of the
numbers had some kind

00:45:44.809 --> 00:45:48.213 align:middle line:84%
of significance that,
archetypal significance

00:45:48.213 --> 00:45:50.782 align:middle line:84%
and so people started
reading into these things.

00:45:50.782 --> 00:45:54.219 align:middle line:84%
And so the Hebrew alphabet
has got 22 characters.

00:45:54.219 --> 00:45:56.855 align:middle line:84%
So they associated
numbers with the letters

00:45:56.855 --> 00:45:57.856 align:middle line:90%
of the Hebrew alphabet.

00:45:57.856 --> 00:45:59.090 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like tarot cards

00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:01.759 align:middle line:84%
because the Hebrew alphabet
also can be correlated

00:46:01.759 --> 00:46:04.896 align:middle line:84%
with the 22 major
arcana cards of tarot.

00:46:04.896 --> 00:46:07.932 align:middle line:84%
And there's a numerological
significance that's correlated

00:46:07.932 --> 00:46:09.267 align:middle line:90%
with those 22.

00:46:09.267 --> 00:46:12.670 align:middle line:90%
So numerology basically posits

00:46:12.670 --> 00:46:14.873 align:middle line:84%
that numbers have
symbolic meaning

00:46:14.873 --> 00:46:17.709 align:middle line:84%
and that you can symbolic
meaning in the spelling

00:46:17.709 --> 00:46:24.549 align:middle line:84%
of somebody's name or in an
address or something like that.

00:46:24.549 --> 00:46:28.286 align:middle line:84%
And rather than pretend
I know more than I do,

00:46:28.286 --> 00:46:30.054 align:middle line:90%
that pretty much sums it up.

00:46:30.054 --> 00:46:31.189 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:46:31.189 --> 00:46:33.324 align:middle line:84%
Well I know just from
a personal experience,

00:46:33.324 --> 00:46:38.329 align:middle line:84%
this is just one small thing but
numerologically, a numerologist

00:46:38.329 --> 00:46:41.466 align:middle line:84%
who is just a friend of ours,
just was looking over my number

00:46:41.466 --> 00:46:42.901 align:middle line:84%
and my son's when
he was very young.

00:46:42.901 --> 00:46:44.068 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Right.

00:46:44.068 --> 00:46:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And they said
well this is interesting.

00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:47.405 align:middle line:84%
You're on the same
numerological cycle

00:46:47.405 --> 00:46:50.708 align:middle line:84%
down to the day your
entire lives.

00:46:50.708 --> 00:46:53.845 align:middle line:84%
And I thought well okay,
that's very interesting.

00:46:53.845 --> 00:46:57.815 align:middle line:84%
Well as the years went on it
was kind of shocking the degree

00:46:57.815 --> 00:47:02.820 align:middle line:84%
to which our experience in
larger periods but also day

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:04.989 align:middle line:84%
to day were reflecting
each other

00:47:04.989 --> 00:47:06.925 align:middle line:90%
without even having contact.

00:47:06.925 --> 00:47:10.695 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I kept kind
of reflecting back on that.

00:47:10.695 --> 00:47:11.829 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that interesting?

00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:13.665 align:middle line:84%
We're in the same
numerological cycle.

00:47:13.665 --> 00:47:15.600 align:middle line:84%
We get a speeding
ticket the same morning

00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:16.868 align:middle line:90%
in different cities.

00:47:16.868 --> 00:47:18.970 align:middle line:84%
You know, these kinds
of and other things.

00:47:18.970 --> 00:47:21.572 align:middle line:84%
Many, many, many, it's
like this all the time.

00:47:21.572 --> 00:47:23.074 align:middle line:84%

synchronicity.

00:47:23.074 --> 00:47:23.908 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah there you go.

00:47:23.908 --> 00:47:24.909 align:middle line:90%

00:47:24.909 --> 00:47:27.312 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: And what about runes?

00:47:27.312 --> 00:47:30.014 align:middle line:84%
Now runes, we mentioned
runes just a little bit

00:47:30.014 --> 00:47:31.316 align:middle line:90%
in our last show.

00:47:31.316 --> 00:47:34.085 align:middle line:84%
And we were, it has
Viking origins.

00:47:34.085 --> 00:47:35.320 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: That's right.

00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:36.521 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So can you talk a
little bit about the runes.

00:47:36.521 --> 00:47:37.422 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Just a little bit.

00:47:37.422 --> 00:47:38.690 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Just a little bit.

00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:42.226 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: Well the runic
alphabets go way back to as far

00:47:42.226 --> 00:47:44.696 align:middle line:90%
as we know the 1st century AD

00:47:44.696 --> 00:47:48.700 align:middle line:84%
and they were the
alphabet of the Vikings.

00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:51.736 align:middle line:84%
But the Vikings were pretty
much illiterate people.

00:47:51.736 --> 00:47:56.074 align:middle line:84%
And so they, that whole
alphabet kind of got lost.

00:47:56.074 --> 00:47:58.876 align:middle line:84%
And my understanding is it
got recovered, you know,

00:47:58.876 --> 00:48:00.745 align:middle line:90%
several hundred years later.

00:48:00.745 --> 00:48:02.847 align:middle line:84%
And it was after
that that it started

00:48:02.847 --> 00:48:05.383 align:middle line:90%
to be used for divination.

00:48:05.383 --> 00:48:08.586 align:middle line:84%
Just like any other system
that's full of correspondences

00:48:08.586 --> 00:48:11.022 align:middle line:90%
and symbols and numbers.

00:48:11.022 --> 00:48:14.559 align:middle line:84%
People have such a desire to
use tools and to find ways

00:48:14.559 --> 00:48:18.396 align:middle line:84%
to stimulate their intuition
that anything like that is going

00:48:18.396 --> 00:48:20.398 align:middle line:90%
to be applied in this way.

00:48:20.398 --> 00:48:22.500 align:middle line:84%
There are some people
how do divination

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:25.269 align:middle line:90%
with a set of 52 playing cards.

00:48:25.269 --> 00:48:26.804 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well and there
is a whole,

00:48:26.804 --> 00:48:29.474 align:middle line:84%
there is a whole system called
love cards and destiny cards.

00:48:29.474 --> 00:48:30.608 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Right.

00:48:30.608 --> 00:48:31.609 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I think Robert
Camp made that popular.

00:48:31.609 --> 00:48:32.377 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Right, yeah.

00:48:32.377 --> 00:48:33.444 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:48:33.444 --> 00:48:34.846 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: There's a lot
of ways of doing it.

00:48:34.846 --> 00:48:38.082 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Shows compatibility and
so forth and it is interesting.

00:48:38.082 --> 00:48:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And that particular system
I noticed that for example

00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:45.456 align:middle line:84%
in Sedona everyone
has those cards.

00:48:45.456 --> 00:48:46.691 align:middle line:90%
And so you kind of look

00:48:46.691 --> 00:48:48.793 align:middle line:84%
up what's another
person's card, right.

00:48:48.793 --> 00:48:49.794 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Right.

00:48:49.794 --> 00:48:51.696 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: My entire
family and almost all

00:48:51.696 --> 00:48:56.634 align:middle line:84%
of my close friends
were all the same suit.

00:48:56.634 --> 00:48:58.036 align:middle line:90%
Everybody was a club.

00:48:58.036 --> 00:49:00.605 align:middle line:84%
And I thought well that's
beyond coincidence again.

00:49:00.605 --> 00:49:04.175 align:middle line:84%
So there's again some
kind of, there's some kind

00:49:04.175 --> 00:49:08.679 align:middle line:84%
of a tribal incarnation path
quality to it or something

00:49:08.679 --> 00:49:10.048 align:middle line:90%
where we must through these,

00:49:10.048 --> 00:49:13.451 align:middle line:84%
the suits are reflecting drawing
these experiences and people

00:49:13.451 --> 00:49:16.854 align:middle line:84%
and such back into our
lives for whatever purpose.

00:49:16.854 --> 00:49:18.089 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Yeah.

00:49:18.089 --> 00:49:21.225 align:middle line:84%
Well the suit of ones it
corresponds with enterprise

00:49:21.225 --> 00:49:23.327 align:middle line:90%
and getting things done.

00:49:23.327 --> 00:49:25.797 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you have a
highly productive tribe.

00:49:25.797 --> 00:49:28.299 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Maybe we do, maybe we do.

00:49:28.299 --> 00:49:30.601 align:middle line:84%
But there's this
recognition and comfort level

00:49:30.601 --> 00:49:31.936 align:middle line:90%
that happens immediately.

00:49:31.936 --> 00:49:33.538 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know, I
don't think it's the same

00:49:33.538 --> 00:49:36.941 align:middle line:84%
where most peoples families
are all the same suit.

00:49:36.941 --> 00:49:39.877 align:middle line:84%
It just so happens all these
people are the same suit.

00:49:39.877 --> 00:49:43.214 align:middle line:84%
I think right after my immediate
family, boom, boom, boom,

00:49:43.214 --> 00:49:46.250 align:middle line:84%
one right after the
other, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:46.751 align:middle line:90%

00:49:46.751 --> 00:49:47.819 align:middle line:90%

00:49:47.819 --> 00:49:48.653 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: You know so
these things can be used

00:49:48.653 --> 00:49:50.154 align:middle line:90%
for typology like that.

00:49:50.154 --> 00:49:51.255 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes, exactly.

00:49:51.255 --> 00:49:52.824 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: Just like the
Myers Briggs in a way.

00:49:52.824 --> 00:49:53.758 align:middle line:90%

okay, I'm an ENFP.

this thing meetup.org right?

00:49:58.963 --> 00:50:00.331 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:50:00.331 --> 00:50:02.567 align:middle line:84%

up in Portland where I live

00:50:02.567 --> 00:50:05.336 align:middle line:84%
of everybody who's
got NF in the middle

00:50:05.336 --> 00:50:06.971 align:middle line:90%
of their Myers Briggs thing.

00:50:06.971 --> 00:50:08.106 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Okay.

00:50:08.106 --> 00:50:09.540 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: And so I thought
well that's interesting.

00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:11.375 align:middle line:84%
You know, intuitive
feeling type.

00:50:11.375 --> 00:50:12.743 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:50:12.743 --> 00:50:13.978 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: Okay, so I thought well
I'm going to check this out.

00:50:13.978 --> 00:50:15.480 align:middle line:84%
So I've gone to two
of their meetings.

00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And I have to tell you, I've
never felt so comfortable

00:50:19.650 --> 00:50:21.352 align:middle line:84%
with a group of strangers
in my life.

00:50:21.352 --> 00:50:22.687 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Because everyone's
just like you.

00:50:22.687 --> 00:50:24.689 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: Yeah, it's
just amazing, so.

00:50:24.689 --> 00:50:27.592 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: All these, I mean
whether you call it a typology

00:50:27.592 --> 00:50:29.961 align:middle line:84%
or whether you use it for
other purposes, they all seem

00:50:29.961 --> 00:50:30.995 align:middle line:90%
to reflect each other.

00:50:30.995 --> 00:50:33.364 align:middle line:84%
There's a greater
truth that comes,

00:50:33.364 --> 00:50:35.466 align:middle line:84%
seems to spring forth
from all of these.

00:50:35.466 --> 00:50:37.602 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: Right, so it's like I
was saying about astrology's

00:50:37.602 --> 00:50:40.671 align:middle line:84%
like we're all made
of the same stuff.

00:50:40.671 --> 00:50:42.573 align:middle line:84%
It's just in different
proportions.

00:50:42.573 --> 00:50:45.309 align:middle line:84%
And the more that we can
accept that and understand

00:50:45.309 --> 00:50:48.613 align:middle line:84%
that we could figure
out who we're compatible

00:50:48.613 --> 00:50:50.214 align:middle line:90%
with for what, you know.

00:50:50.214 --> 00:50:51.616 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:50:51.616 --> 00:50:53.885 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: It's like for instance if
I'm hiring, you know, I'm going,

00:50:53.885 --> 00:50:56.087 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually, I shouldn't
admit this but, you know,

00:50:56.087 --> 00:50:58.656 align:middle line:84%
I used to ask people when I ran
a business I'd ask them what's

00:50:58.656 --> 00:51:01.425 align:middle line:90%
your astrological sign.

00:51:01.425 --> 00:51:02.593 align:middle line:90%
And they'd tell me.

00:51:02.593 --> 00:51:03.528 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say you know
why I asked you that?

00:51:03.528 --> 00:51:04.829 align:middle line:90%
And they'd say why?

00:51:04.829 --> 00:51:07.098 align:middle line:90%
And I'd say because I can.

00:51:07.098 --> 00:51:10.234 align:middle line:84%
I can't ask you how old you
are or what your gender is

00:51:10.234 --> 00:51:12.737 align:middle line:84%
or what your sexual orientation
is but I can ask you your sign.

00:51:12.737 --> 00:51:13.838 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:51:13.838 --> 00:51:15.306 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: And actually
it had meaning for me.

00:51:15.306 --> 00:51:16.140 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:16.741 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: I didn't tell them that.

00:51:16.741 --> 00:51:17.675 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:51:17.675 --> 00:51:18.943 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: But if they
were a Capricorn

00:51:18.943 --> 00:51:21.312 align:middle line:84%
or a Virgo I was a little
more likely to hire them.

00:51:21.312 --> 00:51:22.413 align:middle line:90%
So...

00:51:22.413 --> 00:51:23.347 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Interesting,
yeah that makes sense

00:51:23.347 --> 00:51:24.148 align:middle line:90%
in the computer industry.

00:51:24.148 --> 00:51:25.283 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Yeah, because I know

00:51:25.283 --> 00:51:27.952 align:middle line:84%
in my life I really work
well with earth signs.

00:51:27.952 --> 00:51:28.586 align:middle line:90%

00:51:28.586 --> 00:51:29.654 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: So, anyway.

00:51:29.654 --> 00:51:31.055 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well let's
talk about your life.

00:51:31.055 --> 00:51:35.960 align:middle line:84%
Okay, so you went on to build
this empire, a divination empire

00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:39.797 align:middle line:84%
as it were and you sold it
and it went for a good amount

00:51:39.797 --> 00:51:42.099 align:middle line:90%
of money like most empires do.

00:51:42.099 --> 00:51:45.736 align:middle line:84%
And it set you on a path
of freedom on a new level

00:51:45.736 --> 00:51:46.837 align:middle line:90%
but with another level

00:51:46.837 --> 00:51:48.739 align:middle line:84%
of responsibility you
didn't have before.

00:51:48.739 --> 00:51:51.909 align:middle line:84%
You became really, really
wealthy as a result of that.

00:51:51.909 --> 00:51:52.977 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Right.

00:51:52.977 --> 00:51:54.412 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Let's talk about
your own doing now

00:51:54.412 --> 00:51:59.150 align:middle line:84%
with the divination nonprofit
that you have, your foundation.

00:51:59.150 --> 00:52:01.118 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
your own life.

00:52:01.118 --> 00:52:03.788 align:middle line:84%
I mean, now you're instead
of slogging it out day

00:52:03.788 --> 00:52:05.823 align:middle line:84%
to day going bankrupt
trying to figure it out,

00:52:05.823 --> 00:52:08.326 align:middle line:84%
you have to manage
wealth for example.

00:52:08.326 --> 00:52:09.493 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: Right.

00:52:09.493 --> 00:52:10.895 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So let's talk
about your own [inaudible]

00:52:10.895 --> 00:52:13.998 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: Well, you know, that's a
really, really interesting topic

00:52:13.998 --> 00:52:15.967 align:middle line:84%
because people don't
have any idea.

00:52:15.967 --> 00:52:19.770 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like when
I became an entrepreneur

00:52:19.770 --> 00:52:23.407 align:middle line:84%
because I was inspired
by my fascination

00:52:23.407 --> 00:52:26.010 align:middle line:84%
with the intersection
between software,

00:52:26.010 --> 00:52:27.311 align:middle line:90%
I was in the software industry

00:52:27.311 --> 00:52:30.181 align:middle line:84%
and I had a six figure
job, I was an executive.

00:52:30.181 --> 00:52:32.984 align:middle line:84%
And I was, but I became
fascinated by the possibility

00:52:32.984 --> 00:52:37.455 align:middle line:84%
that computers could be made
to support divination rituals

00:52:37.455 --> 00:52:40.625 align:middle line:84%
and specifically the I Ching
which was the one that I knew.

00:52:40.625 --> 00:52:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And that just inspired
me so much

00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:47.498 align:middle line:84%
that I left a six figure job
and spent my entire life savings

00:52:47.498 --> 00:52:50.301 align:middle line:84%
to create a prototype
and then start a company

00:52:50.301 --> 00:52:53.904 align:middle line:84%
to market something that in
1989 there really wasn't a

00:52:53.904 --> 00:52:55.139 align:middle line:90%
market for.

00:52:55.139 --> 00:52:58.175 align:middle line:84%
And so for the next, because
I was ahead of its time.

00:52:58.175 --> 00:53:00.845 align:middle line:84%
And it really needed
the internet.

00:53:00.845 --> 00:53:03.447 align:middle line:84%
And the internet wasn't going to
come along for another 10 years.

00:53:03.447 --> 00:53:06.250 align:middle line:84%
So it was about 10
years ahead of its time.

00:53:06.250 --> 00:53:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you, people tell
me because I sold the company

00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:13.624 align:middle line:84%
in 2007 which was perfect
timing before 2008.

00:53:13.624 --> 00:53:15.026 align:middle line:90%

00:53:15.026 --> 00:53:16.794 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: They say oh, you've got,
you've got such great timing.

00:53:16.794 --> 00:53:19.730 align:middle line:84%
And I said yeah I suppose
I do but it didn't feel

00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:21.499 align:middle line:84%
like that during
that first 10 years.

00:53:21.499 --> 00:53:22.800 align:middle line:90%

enough money to pay myself.

00:53:24.368 --> 00:53:25.569 align:middle line:90%

00:53:25.569 --> 00:53:26.871 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: And when, you know,
it was all I could do

00:53:26.871 --> 00:53:29.674 align:middle line:84%
to keep the mortgage and pay
my staff and I was worried

00:53:29.674 --> 00:53:31.609 align:middle line:84%
about going bankrupt
all the time.

00:53:31.609 --> 00:53:32.743 align:middle line:90%
It was tough.

00:53:32.743 --> 00:53:36.647 align:middle line:84%
But I was so in love,
I just motivated by my,

00:53:36.647 --> 00:53:38.249 align:middle line:90%
by my love for what I was doing.

00:53:38.249 --> 00:53:44.288 align:middle line:84%
And my prayer was God if nobody
else like this let me be happy

00:53:44.288 --> 00:53:47.024 align:middle line:84%
with the fact that
I think it's good

00:53:47.024 --> 00:53:49.360 align:middle line:84%
and that I'm doing something
that's meaningful to me.

00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:51.462 align:middle line:90%
Let that be my bottom line.

00:53:51.462 --> 00:53:54.365 align:middle line:84%
Even if I lose everything
let that be my bottom line

00:53:54.365 --> 00:53:57.201 align:middle line:84%
because this is, this is
what I'm supposed to do.

00:53:57.201 --> 00:53:59.537 align:middle line:84%
And my friends thought I
was crazy because I sat

00:53:59.537 --> 00:54:02.606 align:middle line:84%
out the dot com, could
have gotten stock options

00:54:02.606 --> 00:54:05.009 align:middle line:90%
like crazy, been a VP somewhere.

00:54:05.009 --> 00:54:08.412 align:middle line:84%
And no, I've just got
to do this, you know,

00:54:08.412 --> 00:54:11.449 align:middle line:84%
and my motto was wherever
God drags me I will follow.

00:54:11.449 --> 00:54:12.783 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:54:12.783 --> 00:54:14.418 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: Now when I used to work
God, I'm thinking in terms

00:54:14.418 --> 00:54:17.355 align:middle line:84%
of creative power, you know,
in a kind of impersonal way.

00:54:17.355 --> 00:54:18.456 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Absolutely.

00:54:18.456 --> 00:54:22.159 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: But so in any
case I never intended

00:54:22.159 --> 00:54:23.027 align:middle line:90%
to sell the company.

00:54:23.027 --> 00:54:25.162 align:middle line:90%
I just wanted creative freedom.

00:54:25.162 --> 00:54:28.666 align:middle line:84%
I wanted the freedom to make
a living doing something

00:54:28.666 --> 00:54:30.668 align:middle line:90%
that meant something to me.

00:54:30.668 --> 00:54:32.703 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't one of these people
that was trying to figure

00:54:32.703 --> 00:54:34.772 align:middle line:84%
out how to become an
entrepreneur and, you know,

00:54:34.772 --> 00:54:37.908 align:middle line:84%
buy a franchise and figure out
how to make a lot of money.

00:54:37.908 --> 00:54:41.479 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't money motivated
even though money's important

00:54:41.479 --> 00:54:42.947 align:middle line:84%
and nobody was going
to give me any

00:54:42.947 --> 00:54:45.049 align:middle line:90%
and I felt responsible about it.

00:54:45.049 --> 00:54:48.786 align:middle line:84%
I was motivated by, my
vision was creative freedom.

00:54:48.786 --> 00:54:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And I had a very modest
definition of it which was

00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:55.426 align:middle line:84%
to make a living doing
something I cared about.

00:54:55.426 --> 00:54:56.727 align:middle line:90%
So I did that.

00:54:56.727 --> 00:54:59.029 align:middle line:90%
I just, I kept at it.

00:54:59.029 --> 00:55:00.097 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't easy.

00:55:00.097 --> 00:55:02.566 align:middle line:84%
I had many dark nights
of the soul.

00:55:02.566 --> 00:55:05.069 align:middle line:84%
And then what happened,
I told the story

00:55:05.069 --> 00:55:07.471 align:middle line:84%
about how we got involved with
AOL and all that and that's

00:55:07.471 --> 00:55:08.839 align:middle line:84%
when things really
started taking off.

00:55:08.839 --> 00:55:10.241 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Right, sure
numbers, numbers.

00:55:10.241 --> 00:55:12.910 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: Beyond my wildest dreams
and then that's when we started

00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:16.280 align:middle line:84%
to be pursued by
large media companies.

00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:21.352 align:middle line:84%
Not only AOL but
Disney came up to visit.

00:55:21.352 --> 00:55:24.088 align:middle line:84%
And Barnes and Noble
was interested.

00:55:24.088 --> 00:55:26.223 align:middle line:90%
And because we were a big,

00:55:26.223 --> 00:55:29.360 align:middle line:84%
we were doing 50 million
page views a month.

00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:30.628 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: That's amazing.

00:55:30.628 --> 00:55:32.863 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: We had 8 million
members and I mean, it was huge.

00:55:32.863 --> 00:55:34.932 align:middle line:84%
And it all started
in my basement.

00:55:34.932 --> 00:55:38.002 align:middle line:84%
And we just kept,
it was really hard.

00:55:38.002 --> 00:55:40.738 align:middle line:84%
I was working 70, 80
hour weeks for 20 years

00:55:40.738 --> 00:55:42.673 align:middle line:84%
and half the time
didn't get paid anything.

00:55:42.673 --> 00:55:45.209 align:middle line:84%
But now all of a sudden
I'm making a lot of money.

00:55:45.209 --> 00:55:47.645 align:middle line:84%
And but it shows
up on the charts.

00:55:47.645 --> 00:55:51.015 align:middle line:84%
Because the advertisers can see
who's getting the major traffic.

00:55:51.015 --> 00:55:53.584 align:middle line:84%
But not only the advertisers
but the M&A departments

00:55:53.584 --> 00:55:55.619 align:middle line:84%
of these major media
corporations could see too.

00:55:55.619 --> 00:55:58.155 align:middle line:84%
And they're always looking
for little fish to buy, right.

00:55:58.155 --> 00:55:59.156 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:55:59.156 --> 00:56:00.825 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: And so we
started to be pursued.

00:56:00.825 --> 00:56:03.894 align:middle line:84%
And I said oh no, no,
no, she's, you know what?

00:56:03.894 --> 00:56:05.296 align:middle line:84%
This is what I was
supposed to do.

00:56:05.296 --> 00:56:08.432 align:middle line:84%
I'm loving it and I'm
finally making some money.

00:56:08.432 --> 00:56:10.234 align:middle line:84%
And we were making a lot
of money at that point.

00:56:10.234 --> 00:56:12.269 align:middle line:84%
And so I just told
them to go away.

00:56:12.269 --> 00:56:16.640 align:middle line:84%
But then I started thinking well
what would I do, I was in my 50s

00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:19.977 align:middle line:84%
and I was just getting
into my 50s.

00:56:19.977 --> 00:56:25.149 align:middle line:84%
I thought what will I do if
I was to, I got my number.

00:56:25.149 --> 00:56:28.319 align:middle line:84%
If I sold the business for a
sufficient amount of money,

00:56:28.319 --> 00:56:29.720 align:middle line:84%
I could live off the
investments for the rest

00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:31.355 align:middle line:90%
of my life, what would I do?

00:56:31.355 --> 00:56:34.058 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden creative
freedom started taking

00:56:34.058 --> 00:56:35.659 align:middle line:90%
on a much larger definition.

00:56:35.659 --> 00:56:37.561 align:middle line:84%
And there were things
that I like to do

00:56:37.561 --> 00:56:41.699 align:middle line:84%
which is write books
and give talks.

00:56:41.699 --> 00:56:45.569 align:middle line:84%
And I have a radio show of my
own that I've had for 25 years.

00:56:45.569 --> 00:56:49.840 align:middle line:84%
And so and I have all these
pent up travel desires.

00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:53.511 align:middle line:84%
And I've got a son
and a grandson now.

00:56:53.511 --> 00:56:57.081 align:middle line:84%
And I have more time to spend
with my family and my friends.

00:56:57.081 --> 00:57:00.484 align:middle line:84%
So I thought oh, I'm going
to have plenty to do.

00:57:00.484 --> 00:57:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And so that made me, that made
me feel okay about letting go.

00:57:06.090 --> 00:57:08.926 align:middle line:84%
And I basically said I'm not
going to sell the company

00:57:08.926 --> 00:57:11.662 align:middle line:84%
to anybody, I don't
want a single employee

00:57:11.662 --> 00:57:13.163 align:middle line:90%
to be effected by this.

00:57:13.163 --> 00:57:14.064 align:middle line:90%
Nobody has to move.

00:57:14.064 --> 00:57:15.699 align:middle line:90%
Nobody loses their job.

00:57:15.699 --> 00:57:16.867 align:middle line:90%
This is the parameter.

00:57:16.867 --> 00:57:18.202 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happened.

00:57:18.202 --> 00:57:18.903 align:middle line:90%
I sold the company.

00:57:18.903 --> 00:57:20.538 align:middle line:90%
Nobody lost their job.

00:57:20.538 --> 00:57:22.006 align:middle line:90%
Nobody had to move.

00:57:22.006 --> 00:57:24.708 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I got
double my number.

00:57:24.708 --> 00:57:26.343 align:middle line:90%
It just was meant to be.

00:57:26.343 --> 00:57:29.947 align:middle line:84%
And so I immediately started
the divination foundation

00:57:29.947 --> 00:57:31.615 align:middle line:90%
which is a way of giving back.

00:57:31.615 --> 00:57:34.118 align:middle line:84%
And now that I'm in
the third stage of life

00:57:34.118 --> 00:57:36.287 align:middle line:90%
which I call the patron stage,

00:57:36.287 --> 00:57:40.391 align:middle line:84%
I just basically the
divination foundation, this app,

00:57:40.391 --> 00:57:42.626 align:middle line:84%
all the proceeds that
we get from the app go

00:57:42.626 --> 00:57:47.965 align:middle line:84%
to the divination foundation
and it publishes my work.

00:57:47.965 --> 00:57:50.734 align:middle line:84%
And so it's kind of
work as philanthropy.

00:57:50.734 --> 00:57:51.635 align:middle line:90%
And I'm so blessed.

00:57:51.635 --> 00:57:52.703 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: And a wonderful offering.

00:57:52.703 --> 00:57:54.038 align:middle line:90%
You are totally blessed.

00:57:54.038 --> 00:57:56.307 align:middle line:84%
People would say oh what an
enchanting, enchanted life.

00:57:56.307 --> 00:57:57.608 align:middle line:90%
No, not really.

00:57:57.608 --> 00:58:00.844 align:middle line:84%
You simply had the courage
to put your resources

00:58:00.844 --> 00:58:02.947 align:middle line:84%
because you had to put your own
money into this to begin with.

00:58:02.947 --> 00:58:04.648 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: Oh yeah, there
were no investors.

00:58:04.648 --> 00:58:05.849 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: There were no investors.

00:58:05.849 --> 00:58:08.986 align:middle line:84%
You put your money, you
put your love and passion

00:58:08.986 --> 00:58:12.089 align:middle line:84%
and intention creativity,
long hours into it

00:58:12.089 --> 00:58:14.158 align:middle line:84%
to create what looks
like a miracle

00:58:14.158 --> 00:58:16.126 align:middle line:90%
like oh, good timing right?

00:58:16.126 --> 00:58:17.628 align:middle line:90%
No, no not good timing.

00:58:17.628 --> 00:58:18.896 align:middle line:90%
It was a lot of hard work.

00:58:18.896 --> 00:58:20.264 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: Right, yeah
right, that's right.

00:58:20.264 --> 00:58:21.365 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Tell us a little bit
about, we only about a minute

00:58:21.365 --> 00:58:23.534 align:middle line:84%
or so left, tell us
about your radio show.

00:58:23.534 --> 00:58:27.504 align:middle line:84%
>> PO: I have a radio show in
Portland Oregon called Pathways

00:58:27.504 --> 00:58:31.141 align:middle line:84%
and we podcast everything,
it's on divination.com.

00:58:31.141 --> 00:58:33.644 align:middle line:84%
By the way there's a lot of
content on divination.com.

00:58:33.644 --> 00:58:34.345 align:middle line:90%

00:58:34.345 --> 00:58:35.412 align:middle line:90%
>> PO: I have a blog.

00:58:35.412 --> 00:58:38.215 align:middle line:84%
We, but we're not
trying to make money.

00:58:38.215 --> 00:58:39.683 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're just basically
giving everything away.

00:58:39.683 --> 00:58:42.820 align:middle line:84%
So all the radio shows
are podcast there.

00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:47.057 align:middle line:84%
Do two a month and it's similar
to the kind of, it's similar

00:58:47.057 --> 00:58:49.660 align:middle line:84%
to this kind of show except that
it's half hour and it's radio.

00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:51.762 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the
loves of my life

00:58:51.762 --> 00:58:55.265 align:middle line:84%
because it gives me a chance
to meet visionary people.

00:58:55.265 --> 00:58:58.435 align:middle line:84%
People that are smarter than me
and ask them anything I want.

00:58:58.435 --> 00:59:00.204 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:59:00.204 --> 00:59:01.338 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Well thank you

00:59:01.338 --> 00:59:04.274 align:middle line:84%
for bringing the
divination foundation and all

00:59:04.274 --> 00:59:05.809 align:middle line:90%
of its offspring to us.

00:59:05.809 --> 00:59:07.011 align:middle line:90%
I love your app.

00:59:07.011 --> 00:59:09.213 align:middle line:84%
This is and it's been a
lot of fun talking to you

over the course of two hours.

00:59:10.681 --> 00:59:12.049 align:middle line:90%

00:59:16.654 --> 00:59:17.221 align:middle line:90%
Thank you Regina.

You're so welcome.

00:59:18.889 --> 00:59:20.624 align:middle line:84%
Okay, so you can go
to your app store

00:59:20.624 --> 00:59:23.260 align:middle line:84%
and begin having some fun
becoming your own psychic.

00:59:23.260 --> 00:59:25.629 align:middle line:90%
That's visionary I Ching.

00:59:25.629 --> 00:59:28.298 align:middle line:84%
