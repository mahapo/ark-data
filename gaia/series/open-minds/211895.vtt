00:00:15.552 --> 00:00:17.990 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: Eileen
McKusick is back with us today

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.020 align:middle line:10%
to share her expertise on
healing the energy field

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.040 align:middle line:10%
surrounding us.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.050 align:middle line:84%
As this epoch in
history continues

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.200 align:middle line:84%
to roll out its surprises,
human anxiety mounts.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.120 align:middle line:84%
According to Eileen,
by tidying up

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.580 align:middle line:84%
the first line of defense,
our energy matrix,

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.610 align:middle line:84%
we can avoid the illness
that could eventually follow.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.310 align:middle line:84%
Because your body knows
exactly what to do once

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.690 align:middle line:90%
your field is clear.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:39.590 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back, Eileen.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:40.690 align:middle line:90%
It's so good to see you again.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:41.150 align:middle line:90%
>> EILEEN MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.942 align:middle line:84%
It's great to be back
with you too, Regina.

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:45.838 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So we have so
many things to tidy up here.

00:00:45.838 --> 00:00:47.630 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I just
have to say because we

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.570 align:middle line:84%
were talking off-camera,
you're known worldwide.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.990 align:middle line:84%
You have practitioners all over
the world in Biofield Tuning.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.080 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know till today that
you got your very first tuning

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.155 align:middle line:84%
forks from GAIAM, way back
when GAIAM had a store.

00:01:00.155 --> 00:01:02.030 align:middle line:84%
That's where you got
your first tuning forks.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.364 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: I did in 1996.

00:01:03.364 --> 00:01:04.239 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.290 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: I was reading
books about the use of color

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.760 align:middle line:90%
and sound and music and healing.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.890 align:middle line:84%
That was when this journey
with sound started.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.960 align:middle line:10%
And just as soon as I finished
my little stack of books,

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.570 align:middle line:10%
I got a GAIAM
catalog in the mail

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.740 align:middle line:10%
that had a set of tuning
forks for healing in it.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And that was what
got me started.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.450 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.960 align:middle line:84%
So here we are full circle
all those years later.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.790 align:middle line:90%
But there's more to that circle.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.030 align:middle line:10%
You got a long way to go.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.820 align:middle line:10%
So first of all,
there's something else

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.830 align:middle line:10%
that you have said that
I find interesting,

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.470 align:middle line:10%
because so many-- you
deal with frequencies,

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.880 align:middle line:10%
you deal with sound.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.210 align:middle line:84%
So many people say you just
have to raise your vibrations

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.710 align:middle line:90%
and raise your frequencies.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.600 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about
and you say, oh, that

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.380 align:middle line:90%
irks me when people say that.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.115 align:middle line:90%
So let's get your take on it.

00:01:43.115 --> 00:01:45.720 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: Well as a
writer, as a wordsmith,

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.980 align:middle line:84%
and as a sound therapist, I
realized it's so important

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.310 align:middle line:84%
the specificity with
which we use words.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And when we heal, we're not
really technically raising

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.860 align:middle line:90%
our vibration.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.420 align:middle line:84%
This idea that somehow
higher is better

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.740 align:middle line:84%
or that we're going up in
this one kind of linear way.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.449 align:middle line:84%
What I find happens is that
we clarify our vibration.

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.460 align:middle line:90%
We bring our vibration in tune.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.400 align:middle line:84%
We want to get the
noise out of the signal.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that,
we raise our voltage,

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.290 align:middle line:84%
we raise the amount
of electric current

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.020 align:middle line:84%
that's flowing through
us, and we actually

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.140 align:middle line:84%
have an experience of
expanding our field.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.840 align:middle line:84%
We expand out into
our potential.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.590 align:middle line:84%
Like, why limit it in just one
direction when what is really

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.060 align:middle line:84%
happening is we are expanding
out in every direction

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.465 align:middle line:84%
and accessing our
potential as human beings.

00:02:39.465 --> 00:02:41.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And when you think about
it, it's like raising.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.230 align:middle line:84%
So if we're talking about
it in terms of music, right?

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.390 align:middle line:84%
It's as though somehow a C is
more lowly than an A or a B.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.550 align:middle line:90%
And actually, that is not true.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.970 align:middle line:84%
It's more harmonizing
the total effect of all

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.665 align:middle line:90%
of these frequencies, right?

00:02:58.665 --> 00:03:01.920 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: We want all
of them to be in tune.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And this sort of demonization
of these low frequencies,

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.840 align:middle line:84%
now, I joke about,
well, how does that make

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.010 align:middle line:90%
the bass players feel--

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And the drum players.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.500 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: --and
the drum players.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.600 align:middle line:84%
We know we need the low
frequencies for sleep.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.320 align:middle line:84%
So the whole spectrum
of frequency we

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.870 align:middle line:84%
want to avail ourselves
to experience and to get

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.535 align:middle line:90%
all of those in tune.

00:03:23.535 --> 00:03:26.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you've also
said that the low frequencies

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.470 align:middle line:84%
actually help us take
up oxygen in the body.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.830 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, I like the
tabla for example,

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:33.810 align:middle line:90%
the sound of the tabla.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.060 align:middle line:90%
That deep Indian drum.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.400 align:middle line:84%
What's actually going
on there when we hear

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.930 align:middle line:90%
these deep resonant sounds?

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.240 align:middle line:84%
Most people feel it on
a really primal level.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.410 align:middle line:90%
It kind of wakes you up.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.970 align:middle line:90%
It feels like it's feeding you.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.310 align:middle line:90%
You say it's more than that?

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.350 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: Well, the work
of John Stuart Reid who is

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.390 align:middle line:84%
a cymatics expert, he observed
that these low frequencies,

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.230 align:middle line:84%
these bass rhythms like the
tabla cause the blood to uptake

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.100 align:middle line:90%
oxygen.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean,
that's fascinating.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.140 align:middle line:84%
When you think about it, when
you go to different experiences

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.990 align:middle line:84%
where you're doing a
trance dance or whatnot,

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.450 align:middle line:84%
it's really those
lower frequencies

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.940 align:middle line:84%
that kind of get you
into this ecstatic state.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.170 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Exactly.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.310 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.930 align:middle line:84%
So then you're
talking about getting

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.950 align:middle line:84%
rid of what we would call the
static or the dirty noise that

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.530 align:middle line:84%
is taking away from the
harmonization of all

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:23.670 align:middle line:90%
these frequencies?

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.740 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: We all have
noise in our signal,

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.620 align:middle line:84%
if you think of your body
with an electrical system

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.690 align:middle line:84%
and everything is running
in different rhythms

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.540 align:middle line:90%
and expressing different tones.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.430 align:middle line:84%
Trauma-- multigenerational
trauma, accidents or injuries,

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.000 align:middle line:84%
a vicious inner critic
being inwardly divided

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.480 align:middle line:84%
and having just a lot of
noise in your own mind

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.810 align:middle line:84%
all create static
that diminishes us.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.840 align:middle line:90%
Self-doubt, low self-worth.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.950 align:middle line:84%
All of these things stop us
from having that experience

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.810 align:middle line:90%
of accessing our potential.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.900 align:middle line:84%
And everybody knows that they
have greatness within them.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.000 align:middle line:84%
That's certainly
been my experience.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.140 align:middle line:84%
Many people are stuck
feeling like they can't get

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.470 align:middle line:90%
to that self-realized place.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And the
mean girl thing,

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.780 align:middle line:84%
you've also said that this has a
lot to do kind of with the mean

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:16.580 align:middle line:90%
inner voice.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'm using females
because of a subject

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.830 align:middle line:84%
we had talked about before,
which has to do with digestion.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And so many people
having chronic

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.740 align:middle line:90%
digestive disorders now.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.510 align:middle line:84%
It's like we're
allergic to everything.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.180 align:middle line:84%
But you say what we're
actually allergic to is

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.980 align:middle line:90%
our own thoughts.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.160 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Our own thoughts.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.970 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with thousands
of clients over the years.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And that is really what stands
out to me more than anything,

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.220 align:middle line:90%
that the enemy is within.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And people are inwardly
divided into judge

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.870 align:middle line:84%
and the part that's judged
into victim and perpetrator.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And they have very
unkind dialogues

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.830 align:middle line:90%
going on inside of them.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.120 align:middle line:84%
So there's this experience
of being inwardly split

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.530 align:middle line:84%
and then this voice that is just
or maybe multiple voices that

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.200 align:middle line:84%
are mean, that are
punitive, that are critical,

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.230 align:middle line:84%
that if that was a person
who was following you

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.950 align:middle line:84%
around and saying those things,
you wouldn't stand for it.

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.900 align:middle line:84%
You're like, you're
a really bad friend.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.200 align:middle line:90%
Like, get out of here.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And yet somehow we've
been conditioned

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.220 align:middle line:90%
to accept it in our own mind.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.930 align:middle line:90%
And it's very, very destructive.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.610 align:middle line:90%
In fact, I observed a pattern.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.670 align:middle line:84%
Everybody that I treated
that were diagnosed

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:30.850 align:middle line:84%
with Crohn's disease just had a
vicious, vicious inner critic.

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.500 align:middle line:84%
They were like eating
themselves alive with acidity

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.530 align:middle line:90%
within their own minds.

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So this is highly
critical type of thought

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.750 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about here.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.120 align:middle line:84%
But what about something
that seems like it's

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.570 align:middle line:84%
kind of more ordinary and it's
definitely ubiquitous, I see.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
subject of self-doubt.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm just seeing this a lot in
people around me questioning

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.080 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.520 align:middle line:84%
Very few people actually don't
question themselves and say,

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.320 align:middle line:90%
what am I doing?

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.080 align:middle line:90%
I mean, why am I bothering?

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.440 align:middle line:90%
Am I on the right path?

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.193 align:middle line:84%
This kind of chronic self-doubt,
what does that do to a person?

00:07:06.193 --> 00:07:08.360 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: Well, you know,
I see that too, Regina.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think this past year, that
really sunk in for me that I

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:13.395 align:middle line:90%
was noticing the same thing.

00:07:13.395 --> 00:07:14.195 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Me too.

00:07:14.195 --> 00:07:14.995 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:14.995 --> 00:07:17.430 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: So I teach the
advanced classes in Biofield

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:18.230 align:middle line:90%
Tuning.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And we do a number of
exercises in that that really

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.220 align:middle line:84%
gets people centered and
grounded and embodied.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And what I really notice
is that after people

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:31.070 align:middle line:84%
go through those experiences,
they're self-confident.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.740 align:middle line:90%
And you can see it in them.

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.170 align:middle line:84%
They all look like they're like
the star of their own show.

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:38.130 align:middle line:84%
Like, everything
that we are, if we

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:41.370 align:middle line:84%
can let ourselves be
our authentic self,

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:43.170 align:middle line:90%
we're all amazing.

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have
to go out and get it.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.310 align:middle line:90%
That is in you.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And self-doubt becomes a
self-fulfilling prophecy

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.690 align:middle line:84%
because that creates a lot
of noise in the signal.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And then you're
just in the noise.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.980 align:middle line:84%
Instead of in that
comfortable clear like,

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:02.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm awesome kind of place
because everybody is.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.890 align:middle line:84%
That's really been
my observation.

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:05.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's
interesting, though,

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:09.210 align:middle line:84%
because it's almost come hand
in hand with after the pandemic

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:12.630 align:middle line:84%
came in, it changed the nature
of reality and the questions

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:15.270 align:middle line:84%
people ask and the way people
want to allocate their time

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:16.210 align:middle line:90%
and energy.

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:18.930 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people have taken
a courageous step to say,

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:20.710 align:middle line:84%
you know I'm not going
back to that job,

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:22.650 align:middle line:84%
which we have
shortages in fields

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:25.200 align:middle line:84%
all over the world because
workers aren't showing up

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.050 align:middle line:84%
but many people are saying,
I can't do that job anymore.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:29.910 align:middle line:84%
And they're trying to
put it back together.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:32.260 align:middle line:84%
Like, here I've always
wanted to do this or that.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:37.820 align:middle line:84%
But then comes that sticky old
subject of survival and money.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.450 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as a price tag seems
to be attached to something

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:44.390 align:middle line:84%
someone really wants to
do, self-doubt and anxiety

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:46.550 align:middle line:90%
seems to take over.

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:47.850 align:middle line:90%
Do you notice this as well?

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:48.650 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Sure.

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And I've been
through that myself.

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:52.650 align:middle line:84%
Do what you love and
the money will follow.

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:53.930 align:middle line:90%
But sometimes there is a gap.

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:54.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:54.800 align:middle line:90%
There's a gap.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.600 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: And I definitely
struggled when I was first

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.740 align:middle line:84%
creating Biofield Tuning,
working in the field.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.660 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't sure about
what I was doing.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.030 align:middle line:90%
And I think it takes--

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:08.300 align:middle line:90%
you can't shortcut experience.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.880 align:middle line:84%
Self-doubt is
appropriate, but as you

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.840 align:middle line:84%
gain more experience and more
comfort with what you're doing,

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.980 align:middle line:90%
then it goes away.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:16.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:18.000 align:middle line:90%
That is true.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.730 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
something that's

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:22.260 align:middle line:84%
just chronic where people,
continually their entire life

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:23.060 align:middle line:90%
doubt themselves.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:23.860 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: How does that
tend to play out in the body?

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:27.980 align:middle line:90%
That kind of emotion.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.950 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: Well, you're
going to see that in digestion

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:33.290 align:middle line:84%
because that is creating
noise in the signal,

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:36.600 align:middle line:84%
it's creating low-level
stress and discomfort.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.710 align:middle line:84%
So anything that you've got
that is a signal jammer that

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:44.040 align:middle line:84%
is stopping the body from
accessing a clear blueprint

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.840 align:middle line:90%
is going to show up.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.870 align:middle line:84%
One of the places where I see
self-doubt in the inner critic

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:51.000 align:middle line:84%
really show up is in
people's right hips.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.445 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:09:52.445 --> 00:09:54.820 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: So that's just
a pattern that I've observed.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.640 align:middle line:84%
When you're in
self-doubt and self-worth

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.430 align:middle line:84%
and constantly criticizing
ourselves within,

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:02.340 align:middle line:84%
it creates an imbalance
in the field in that sort

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.680 align:middle line:90%
of right root sacral area.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And then because there's
noise in the signal there,

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.730 align:middle line:84%
the body can't repair
itself properly.

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:11.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it starts
radiating out to the hip

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:12.060 align:middle line:90%
joints.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:12.540 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Exactly.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And the right
hip, in particular.

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:14.025 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: In particular.

00:10:14.025 --> 00:10:16.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, pay attention
if you have anything going

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:17.020 align:middle line:90%
in your right hip.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:17.820 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We're here
we're talking about

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.060 align:middle line:90%
an electromagnetic field.

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And I love the work you
do in the Biofield Tuning.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.120 align:middle line:84%
Because you can read a person--
you and your practitioners

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:28.920 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.340 align:middle line:84%
When someone comes to you,
you start assessing out

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.590 align:middle line:84%
what's going on with
them by reading,

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:37.110 align:middle line:84%
I believe that you start with
the left side of the field

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:40.260 align:middle line:84%
using your tuning fork
and finding resistance

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.190 align:middle line:90%
when certain ages come up.

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the trauma
may have started and so forth.

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:47.980 align:middle line:84%
Talk about that a little bit
for people who don't already

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:48.780 align:middle line:90%
know your work.

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:50.480 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Sure.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.380 align:middle line:90%
It's sort of an odd practice.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And it took me a very long
time to get over my concern

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.000 align:middle line:90%
about how strange it was.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.420 align:middle line:84%
But now we have
thousands of people,

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.128 align:middle line:84%
like you said, around
the world doing it.

00:11:00.128 --> 00:11:01.830 align:middle line:90%
And it's normalized it a bit.

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:04.050 align:middle line:84%
But Biofield Tuning
is a little bit

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.750 align:middle line:84%
like using a tuning fork
like a needle on an album.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.400 align:middle line:84%
It's like dropping
a needle on an album

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.190 align:middle line:84%
and reading the vibrational
record of somebody's life.

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:14.550 align:middle line:84%
So in this model,
our memories are

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:18.240 align:middle line:84%
stored in standing waves in
our body's magnetic field.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And there's a very specific
anatomy and physiology

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.467 align:middle line:90%
that I mapped over many years.

00:11:23.467 --> 00:11:25.050 align:middle line:84%
I discovered that
there was a pattern.

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And every time I heard
what sounded like sadness

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:32.160 align:middle line:84%
through the overtones and
undertones of the tuning fork,

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.230 align:middle line:90%
it was off the left shoulder.

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:37.210 align:middle line:84%
Every time I came across things
that sounded and felt angry,

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:40.300 align:middle line:84%
it was off the right
side of the solar plexus.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.468 align:middle line:84%
And I essentially discovered
that, just like you and I have

00:11:43.468 --> 00:11:45.010 align:middle line:84%
pretty much the same
digestive tract,

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:48.110 align:middle line:84%
we have the same
biofield anatomy as well.

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And so the essence of my work
is this biofield anatomy map.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.100 align:middle line:90%
So we're sort of striated.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And different emotions produce
different frequency signatures.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And then those are stored in
different areas of the field.

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:04.390 align:middle line:90%
The field is also time lined.

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:07.083 align:middle line:84%
So as we generate information,
we go through our day

00:12:07.083 --> 00:12:09.250 align:middle line:84%
and we have our thoughts,
our feelings, our actions,

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:11.860 align:middle line:84%
our experiences, that's
all electrical impulses

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:12.730 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And those get
recorded in the field

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:16.870 align:middle line:90%
and they move away from us.

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:17.740 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:21.970 align:middle line:84%
So most people's fields
extend about 6 feet around

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:23.240 align:middle line:90%
on either side.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.872 align:middle line:84%
And what I discovered was
that the outer boundary

00:12:25.872 --> 00:12:27.580 align:middle line:84%
of the field, because
there's a boundary,

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.550 align:middle line:84%
it's a torus or a bubble
with a spiral channel.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:34.030 align:middle line:84%
That that outer boundary
contained information

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:36.920 align:middle line:90%
from gestation and then birth.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And then as we went
along, the fork

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.137 align:middle line:84%
was literally reading this
track as it was laid down.

00:12:42.137 --> 00:12:44.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's almost like
tree rings, is how I see it.

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:44.730 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:46.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you've got
the rings of the tree,

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.070 align:middle line:90%
the years of the tree.

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:48.180 align:middle line:90%
So you're coming in.

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're using
the fork, all of a sudden,

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:54.860 align:middle line:84%
the tone shifts for you or you
find a resistance of some kind,

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:57.510 align:middle line:84%
you say, oh, what
happened at age 3?

00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:58.310 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:59.660 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Exactly.

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:02.030 align:middle line:84%
Just for an example, I
was working on a gentleman

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:03.210 align:middle line:90%
not that long ago.

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And I got to this
place in his field

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:08.182 align:middle line:90%
where the sound went so wonky.

00:13:08.182 --> 00:13:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And he could hear it
and I could hear it.

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:11.180 align:middle line:90%
And he's like, what's that?

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And I plotted it
on the timeline.

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And I said, this is
something that happened

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:16.010 align:middle line:90%
when you were around 18.

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, oh, that's when
I went through the windshield

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:19.440 align:middle line:90%
of a car.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.240 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And you think about the
chaos of that experience.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.080 align:middle line:84%
The pain, the
resistance, the shock.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:25.880 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.310 align:middle line:84%
Those are all very
dissonant vibrations

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:31.230 align:middle line:84%
that got laid down in his
record, in his memory banks.

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:32.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:36.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, I did a session with you
years ago when we first met.

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And what I thought
was interesting

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:42.280 align:middle line:84%
is definitely hit on the primary
times when things happen.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.590 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you got them exactly.

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.270 align:middle line:84%
What happened at this
age and this age.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:48.250 align:middle line:84%
But then as you went
along, there were more.

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:50.260 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, oh, yeah.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:51.100 align:middle line:90%
Wait a minute.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And things that I wasn't
even remembering anymore.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.700 align:middle line:84%
But there were
actually profound.

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:58.300 align:middle line:84%
So it actually helps
us reflect back

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.340 align:middle line:84%
in our own memory
the things that we

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.680 align:middle line:90%
may have even suppressed.

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.190 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Absolutely.

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:05.560 align:middle line:84%
Or we can also find the
things that are precognitive,

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.753 align:middle line:84%
that happen from
gestation to three

00:14:07.753 --> 00:14:08.920 align:middle line:90%
that we don't remember that.

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:12.010 align:middle line:84%
Might have been really
formative where we form beliefs.

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:14.320 align:middle line:84%
Like if you were a baby
who was left to cry it out

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.720 align:middle line:84%
or bottle fed on a
schedule, you form

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.005 align:middle line:84%
a belief early on that
nobody listens to me.

00:14:20.005 --> 00:14:20.960 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:21.760 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.080 align:middle line:90%
So now you've gone through.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.700 align:middle line:84%
This is on the left
side of the body,

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:26.680 align:middle line:84%
you've read the tree
rings, what happened here.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:27.480 align:middle line:90%
Oh, OK.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.280 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.050 align:middle line:84%
Then you go to the
right side of the body.

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And this is, as I
understand it, what

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:36.610 align:middle line:84%
the lingering effects
of these traumas

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:38.420 align:middle line:84%
have been on what
you're still carrying?

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.550 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Well, not so much.

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:43.670 align:middle line:84%
The left side is
these file drawers.

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:47.150 align:middle line:84%
So the left side is more of the
yin inward kind of feelings.

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Frustration, powerlessness,
sadness, holding things back.

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.270 align:middle line:84%
So this is more
wet, more inward.

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:55.730 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the right side
is more hot or fiery.

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:59.990 align:middle line:84%
It's anger, it's overdoing,
it's being a caretaker.

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:01.920 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Is it how
it expresses itself?

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: It's how
it expresses itself.

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:03.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I see.

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:03.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:06.410 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: So we might find
issues in the right shoulder

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:08.890 align:middle line:84%
because you keep saying
yes when you mean no.

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:11.030 align:middle line:84%
Or we might find issues
in the left shoulder

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:13.070 align:middle line:84%
because you have
a lot of sadness

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:14.750 align:middle line:90%
that you're not expressing.

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:16.620 align:middle line:90%
And it's just sort of piling up.

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:19.940 align:middle line:84%
So the biofield anatomy,
each energy center

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:24.900 align:middle line:84%
has a particular theme
off each side of it.

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.450 align:middle line:84%
So we don't always
start on the left.

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:27.960 align:middle line:90%
I often do.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.750 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, I might
start on the right.

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:32.420 align:middle line:84%
If your right shoulder
and right hip hurt,

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:33.410 align:middle line:90%
come start over there.

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:34.915 align:middle line:84%
And then come follow
up on the left.

00:15:34.915 --> 00:15:37.415 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what happens if
you have two frozen shoulders?

00:15:37.415 --> 00:15:39.207 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: Well, we
work on both of them.

00:15:39.207 --> 00:15:40.840 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.480 align:middle line:84%
If you have two frozen
shoulders, I would say,

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.250 align:middle line:84%
you're really
stuck in your life.

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:47.750 align:middle line:84%
You're trying to take
care of everybody else

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:49.570 align:middle line:84%
and you're not taking
care of yourself

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:51.592 align:middle line:90%
and you're sad about it.

00:15:51.592 --> 00:15:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's get into
the subject of cancers

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.835 align:middle line:90%
for a moment.

00:15:55.835 --> 00:15:58.610 align:middle line:84%
How do you see that showing
up in a person's field?

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:01.040 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: Well, you know,
it's interesting that you ask

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.120 align:middle line:90%
about cancer genome.

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.800 align:middle line:84%
Because in Biofield Tuning,
we don't treat cancer.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:05.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.017 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: In
the United States,

00:16:07.017 --> 00:16:10.190 align:middle line:84%
you're not allowed to treat
cancer with anything other than

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:11.030 align:middle line:90%
drugs or surgery.

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:12.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But it has
to show up in the field.

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:13.678 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: It does show up.

00:16:13.678 --> 00:16:17.660 align:middle line:84%
It shows up as stuck energy,
as places where there's

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:20.130 align:middle line:90%
traumas that have been present.

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:22.250 align:middle line:84%
For example, women
with breast cancer

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:25.430 align:middle line:84%
have often observed that
they get it on the right side

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:28.070 align:middle line:84%
if they've been putting
everybody else's needs ahead

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:30.470 align:middle line:84%
of their own and
neglecting themselves.

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And then cancer often becomes
a gift and an opportunity.

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:36.990 align:middle line:84%
You realize that it's
time to take care of you.

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:37.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's usually, you're
giving yourself away

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:41.413 align:middle line:90%
at your own expense.

00:16:41.413 --> 00:16:42.213 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:16:42.213 --> 00:16:43.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.180 align:middle line:84%
So now you've
identified these things.

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:47.360 align:middle line:84%
So now, where does
the healing part

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:50.360 align:middle line:84%
come in with the tuning
fork and vibration?

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: Well, you know
how we talk about having charge

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:56.220 align:middle line:84%
around certain things, like
that divorce you went through 10

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:58.650 align:middle line:84%
years ago and it
still gets you upset?

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:00.570 align:middle line:84%
So that's a place
in your memory bank,

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:03.914 align:middle line:84%
in your field where you
literally do have charge.

00:17:03.914 --> 00:17:06.930 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
electrical voltage

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:09.750 align:middle line:84%
that should be flowing
through your body is

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:11.249 align:middle line:90%
stuck in that particular--

00:17:11.249 --> 00:17:14.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it's just making
a jaggedy stuck kind of place

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.588 align:middle line:90%
in you over amped place?

00:17:15.588 --> 00:17:17.130 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: That's
the way I see it.

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:19.950 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like a
memory that's overamped.

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:22.560 align:middle line:84%
That's why we feel resistance
when we hit it because there's

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:25.079 align:middle line:90%
charge and it's stuck there.

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's usually
trapped in chaos waves

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:29.980 align:middle line:84%
because all of the
upset that was involved.

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:33.030 align:middle line:84%
So there's a sort of pocket
of chaos and stuck energy.

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And we could call it our
emotional baggage, right?

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:36.960 align:middle line:84%
The things that weigh
us down, that we

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.030 align:middle line:84%
haven't digested, that
we haven't integrated,

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:41.370 align:middle line:90%
that we haven't forgiven.

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And so a tuning fork
is both diagnostic

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.790 align:middle line:84%
in that it helps us to locate
these places in our memory bank

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:50.730 align:middle line:84%
where things are jammed
up, but it is also

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:52.110 align:middle line:90%
immediately therapeutic.

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Because it starts giving the
body the information of order.

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:59.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So when you first--

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:01.590 align:middle line:84%
using the tuning
fork and it sounds

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:04.390 align:middle line:84%
maybe a little discordant,
when you first discover it.

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:07.310 align:middle line:84%
So what starts happening in
that transformational process?

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:10.230 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: So it's the
physics principles of resonance

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:11.070 align:middle line:90%
and entrainment.

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:13.980 align:middle line:84%
The tuning fork will initially
resonate with whatever

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:16.470 align:middle line:90%
the story is that is there.

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:18.930 align:middle line:84%
But then a strong
coherent signal

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:22.860 align:middle line:84%
will overtake and entrain
a weak incoherent signal.

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:25.170 align:middle line:84%
So I describe it
as it sort of acts

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:27.000 align:middle line:84%
like a mirror in
that it reflects

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.935 align:middle line:90%
to the body what's going on.

00:18:28.935 --> 00:18:30.552 align:middle line:84%
Like the guy with
the car accident.

00:18:30.552 --> 00:18:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And you're like,
whoa, what's that?

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.258 align:middle line:84%
It's an opportunity for
that kind of reflection.

00:18:34.258 --> 00:18:36.300 align:middle line:84%
It's like you don't know
that your hair is a mess

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.010 align:middle line:84%
and that you have a
poppy seed in your teeth

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:39.427 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have
the opportunity

00:18:39.427 --> 00:18:41.130 align:middle line:84%
to fix it until you
see it reflected.

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:42.250 align:middle line:90%
So it's the same thing.

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:44.460 align:middle line:84%
The moment we see
ourselves out of order,

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:47.460 align:middle line:84%
we immediately go to
put ourselves in order.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And so the body's organizing
intelligence does this.

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:50.940 align:middle line:90%
It has a mirror.

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:52.750 align:middle line:84%
The tuning fork acts
like a metronome.

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:55.290 align:middle line:84%
It's producing a steady
rhythm that the body

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:57.970 align:middle line:90%
can order its rhythms against.

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And so as the information
and the rhythms that

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.200 align:middle line:84%
are present there
start to harmonize,

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.830 align:middle line:84%
the energy that's been
stuck sort of decouples.

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And then the tuning
fork acts like a magnet.

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:12.360 align:middle line:90%
And it's sort of odd as this is.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm able to do what I call
click, drag, and drop, where

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.550 align:middle line:84%
I use the tuning
fork like a magnet.

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:20.370 align:middle line:84%
I hook into that little pocket
of energy that was stuck

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:22.470 align:middle line:84%
and I bring it
back to the midline

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:24.420 align:middle line:84%
of the body, the
central channel where

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:26.566 align:middle line:90%
it goes back into circulation.

00:19:26.566 --> 00:19:31.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So how do these tree
rings of trauma and events that

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:37.560 align:middle line:84%
happen and our reactions to
them correlate with maybe just

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:39.300 align:middle line:90%
making visible the subconscious?

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.230 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Hmm.

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:42.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's exactly what
it is because this is--

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:44.880 align:middle line:84%
our biofield is our--
it's our conscious mind,

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.410 align:middle line:84%
it's our subconscious
mind, it's our memories.

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:49.620 align:middle line:84%
I would even go so far as
to say that it's our soul.

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:51.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Hmm.

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:54.870 align:middle line:84%
So it's allowing
you to see what is

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:57.400 align:middle line:84%
serving as a hindrance
in the subconscious.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.200 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:58.840 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:19:59.923 align:middle line:90%
And it gets right into it.

00:19:59.923 --> 00:20:01.756 align:middle line:84%
And people don't even
need to talk about it.

00:20:01.756 --> 00:20:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's one of the
things I think is beautiful

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:04.920 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:07.350 align:middle line:90%
Talk therapy only does so much.

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:09.120 align:middle line:84%
After you've talked
and talked and talked,

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.435 align:middle line:84%
it seems to me, oftentimes,
you just reinforce the story.

00:20:11.435 --> 00:20:11.910 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:12.710 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:14.902 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can do this
without even saying what

00:20:14.902 --> 00:20:16.110 align:middle line:90%
happened when you were three.

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:19.140 align:middle line:84%
I can just be like, well,
I hit a stuck spot here.

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:20.950 align:middle line:84%
Where are you feeling
this in your body?

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:21.960 align:middle line:90%
What are you noticing?

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.840 align:middle line:84%
Just make it somatic so that
you can tell-- because all

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.150 align:middle line:84%
of these places where we
have jam ups in the field,

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:28.660 align:middle line:90%
we have tension in the body.

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:31.972 align:middle line:84%
So these areas of tension
create inflammation.

00:20:31.972 --> 00:20:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And we know that inflammation
is the root of disease.

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:35.930 align:middle line:84%
So if you end up with
excess in one place,

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:37.270 align:middle line:90%
you get deficiency in the other.

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:38.620 align:middle line:90%
And then you're out of balance.

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:41.040 align:middle line:84%
So really on a very
fundamental level,

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.210 align:middle line:84%
this is just helping you to
relax subconscious tension

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:45.960 align:middle line:84%
that you're still
holding from old trauma.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:48.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So how does this
then resonate out in the subtle

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:49.470 align:middle line:90%
bodies?

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:49.830 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:51.800 align:middle line:84%
So let's say, how
does it resonate out

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.080 align:middle line:84%
into the mental and
the emotional bodies?

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: Well, I would say
that it settles people down.

00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:01.730 align:middle line:84%
It helps you to go from being
maybe habitually dysregulated

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:03.500 align:middle line:90%
to being more regulated.

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:06.620 align:middle line:84%
From being incoherent and
upset and feeling like

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:09.980 align:middle line:84%
you have ants in your pants
or discomfort of some kind

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:11.635 align:middle line:90%
to just being more at ease.

00:21:11.635 --> 00:21:14.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So once you can
bring the field into coherence

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.210 align:middle line:84%
through the tuning, because
first there's the recognition

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:19.010 align:middle line:90%
the person saying, oh, yes.

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:20.460 align:middle line:90%
That happened at 18.

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:22.370 align:middle line:84%
So now it's on the
table, you're going

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:25.820 align:middle line:84%
through those sub frequency
sounds, you're doing the over--

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:30.740 align:middle line:84%
you say, overarching harmonics
or coherence in forks.

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:33.740 align:middle line:84%
From that point, that's going
to then start automatically

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:35.990 align:middle line:84%
radiating out and
making those corrections

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:38.050 align:middle line:84%
in the emotional
body and the response

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:39.050 align:middle line:90%
it's been holding on to?

00:21:39.050 --> 00:21:39.230 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:40.560 align:middle line:90%
And the responses.

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:43.310 align:middle line:84%
So those knee jerk places
where your parents always

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:45.050 align:middle line:90%
got your goat in this way.

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:47.510 align:middle line:10%
All of a sudden, you find
yourself less reactive,

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:50.960 align:middle line:10%
less triggered, more
able to keep a calm

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:53.090 align:middle line:10%
center in difficult situations.

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:54.720 align:middle line:90%
Certainly more resilient.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.847 align:middle line:84%
I think that that's a
really big part of it.

00:21:56.847 --> 00:21:59.180 align:middle line:84%
If you're holding a lot of
tension from a lot of trauma,

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:01.100 align:middle line:90%
you can't take much more.

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:03.290 align:middle line:84%
But if you're sort of
big and soft and relaxed

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:06.200 align:middle line:84%
and you've released tension, you
can handle those difficulties

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.820 align:middle line:90%
with a lot more ease and grace.

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:09.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, you've had
to go through a lot of these

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:11.510 align:middle line:84%
transitions of your own
or these transformations.

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:12.950 align:middle line:84%
You had a lot of
digestive issues.

00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:16.190 align:middle line:84%
For example, we talked about
that earlier at one time.

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:20.120 align:middle line:84%
But as you've moved through
the process of using the tuning

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:23.060 align:middle line:84%
forks, you literally can-- you
don't have any of those issues

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:23.360 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:24.160 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: No.

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.090 align:middle line:84%
I used to have
terrible digestion.

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:28.683 align:middle line:84%
Gas bloating, heartburn,
stomach aches--

00:22:28.683 --> 00:22:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Everything.

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:30.500 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Everything.

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:31.400 align:middle line:90%
Everything miserable.

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.650 align:middle line:90%
Go to bed miserable.

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:36.230 align:middle line:84%
But at the time I was
giving my power away,

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:38.460 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have good boundaries.

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:41.150 align:middle line:84%
I was under stress and
running on adrenaline.

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:43.070 align:middle line:84%
So all of these
things contribute

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:47.390 align:middle line:84%
to not being in that sort of
solid place of rest and digest.

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And over the years
through receiving tuning,

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:52.340 align:middle line:90%
I started teaching this in 2010.

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And my first students
started working on me.

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And right from the
very beginning,

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:58.970 align:middle line:90%
my digestion started to improve.

00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:02.600 align:middle line:84%
And I also learned a lot about
boundaries, about saying no,

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.760 align:middle line:84%
about how to not put
myself in situations

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.670 align:middle line:84%
where I was under time
pressure, under money pressure,

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:11.480 align:middle line:84%
revving, stressing,
feeling like a victim.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.490 align:middle line:84%
I've learned a lot
of hard lessons

00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:17.270 align:middle line:84%
and gotten myself to a place
where for the most part,

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:21.690 align:middle line:84%
I enjoy being in a
coherent regulated state.

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And I'm way better at
boundaries, obviously.

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And so now I can eat
anything and everything.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.530 align:middle line:90%
And I don't suffer at all.

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:32.060 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I think everyone's
ears are perking up.

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:33.830 align:middle line:90%
The women in particular.

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:35.750 align:middle line:90%
Ears are perking up at this one.

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:38.150 align:middle line:84%
To think of how to actually
do that instead of taking

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:40.490 align:middle line:90%
yet another digestive aid.

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:43.790 align:middle line:84%
Going to another
gastroenterologist or whatnot.

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:46.070 align:middle line:84%
You're finding it's
mostly emotion.

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:47.600 align:middle line:90%
And I find that too, honestly.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:48.530 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: It's
mostly emotion.

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:49.400 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's also really important
that we express our emotion.

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:58.010 align:middle line:84%
I had a very difficult emotional
thing happen a few months ago.

00:23:58.010 --> 00:23:59.940 align:middle line:90%
And I tried to suppress it.

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And my stomach
immediately protested.

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:04.130 align:middle line:84%
Like immediately, I
got a stomach ache.

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:06.088 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, well,
this isn't going to work.

00:24:06.088 --> 00:24:09.230 align:middle line:84%
Like, I absolutely have
to express my emotions.

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And I can do that
diplomatically.

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:14.480 align:middle line:84%
We can figure out ways to
express our emotions that are

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:18.140 align:middle line:84%
appropriate, that don't hurt
or they might hurt other people

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:22.065 align:middle line:84%
but they don't-- we don't have
to go off the hook or be wild

00:24:22.065 --> 00:24:22.865 align:middle line:90%
and uncontrollable.

00:24:22.865 --> 00:24:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Suppressing
it is not going to work.

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:26.358 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: Suppressing
it doesn't work.

00:24:26.358 --> 00:24:28.760 align:middle line:84%
We really have to learn
to dance in a healthy way

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:31.020 align:middle line:84%
with our emotions and
not suppress them.

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:33.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So how long
did that process take you

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:33.840 align:middle line:90%
in the beginning?

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.480 align:middle line:84%
Once you had your
student work on you?

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:38.323 align:middle line:84%
How long did it take you to
work through all of this?

00:24:38.323 --> 00:24:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: Well, I've
had a lot of tune ups.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:42.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: As you said, you're
in a lovely position where you

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:43.825 align:middle line:90%
can have a lot of tune-ups.

00:24:43.825 --> 00:24:44.935 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Exactly.

00:24:44.935 --> 00:24:49.060 align:middle line:84%
I've had a lot of tune ups. And
I've learned a lot as a tuner.

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.677 align:middle line:84%
Because I work in people
and I see their bad habits

00:24:51.677 --> 00:24:52.510 align:middle line:90%
or their imbalances.

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:54.800 align:middle line:90%
And I'm, I do that too.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:55.600 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.360 align:middle line:84%
So I've had kind of a
window into the imbalances

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:02.380 align:middle line:84%
of human nature and seeing that
kind of behavior in myself.

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:04.300 align:middle line:84%
But I've worked
with people and I've

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:06.550 align:middle line:84%
seen them completely
turn their digestion

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:09.560 align:middle line:90%
around and 6 to 10 sessions.

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:10.435 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wonderful.

00:25:10.435 --> 00:25:11.235 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:25:11.235 --> 00:25:13.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we're going to
get to it at the end in terms

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:16.810 align:middle line:84%
of what we can do for ourselves
if someone doesn't have access

00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:18.010 align:middle line:90%
to a practitioner.

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:20.260 align:middle line:84%
But right now, there are
thousands of practitioners,

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:24.190 align:middle line:84%
but another interesting thing
is that through this field,

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:28.030 align:middle line:84%
we have, of course, quantum
entrainment and entanglement.

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:31.360 align:middle line:84%
So this can actually
be done at a distance.

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:34.060 align:middle line:90%
Remote tuning can be done.

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:36.100 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
this and how long

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:37.810 align:middle line:84%
you've been doing it,
when you discovered

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:40.070 align:middle line:84%
that the person didn't have
to be in the room with you

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.870 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:44.060 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: Well, people would
ask me for years if I could do

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:44.960 align:middle line:90%
it at a distance.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that was the most
ridiculous thing to ask me.

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:49.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, this is sound
waves on the body.

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:50.908 align:middle line:90%
This is physics people.

00:25:50.908 --> 00:25:52.730 align:middle line:84%
Like, I am not doing
this at a distance.

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And I was arrogant and snide
about it, as people can be,

00:25:57.330 --> 00:25:58.130 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:25:58.130 --> 00:25:59.555 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
people out there

00:25:59.555 --> 00:26:03.570 align:middle line:84%
who feel this way about distance
tuning and I was no different.

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:06.900 align:middle line:84%
But I am a scientist and
I do like experiments.

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And so I think it
was probably in 2011,

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:13.200 align:middle line:84%
I was working on
my master's thesis.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And I was working with a
fellow by the name of Dr. Carl

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Merritt, who is very,
very knowledgeable

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.480 align:middle line:84%
about the biofield
and energy medicine.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.570 align:middle line:84%
And he's a physician
and M.D. And he

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:25.590 align:middle line:90%
was helping me with my thesis.

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:29.900 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Eileen, how about
if we try a distance session?

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:31.690 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK.

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:32.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm game.

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:33.330 align:middle line:90%
Let's give it a try.

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:36.920 align:middle line:84%
But I went into it not
believing it was possible.

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And what he did was he laid down
in his office in California,

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:44.810 align:middle line:84%
and I approached my
treatment table in Vermont,

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:46.100 align:middle line:90%
pretending that he was there.

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:48.830 align:middle line:84%
We had no open line of
communication at all.

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:51.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, at this point, I
had mapped the field

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.540 align:middle line:84%
and I learned the language
of vibration pretty well.

00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:57.860 align:middle line:84%
And so I just went
and did a session

00:26:57.860 --> 00:26:59.780 align:middle line:90%
as if there was a body there.

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And much to my amazement,
all of the same patterns

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:06.470 align:middle line:84%
of information that would
show up when there was a body

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:07.890 align:middle line:90%
there showed up.

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:09.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I went through
and I took notes,

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:13.895 align:middle line:84%
and I observed the years
that were really stressful,

00:27:13.895 --> 00:27:16.910 align:middle line:84%
the organs in his body that
weren't quite up to snuff,

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:18.230 align:middle line:90%
where he had inflammation.

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:21.200 align:middle line:84%
The personality of his mother,
the personality of his father,

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.340 align:middle line:90%
head injury at five.

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:24.800 align:middle line:84%
Like all the things that I
had learned to figure out

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.540 align:middle line:90%
by reading the field.

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And then we got on
the phone afterwards

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:29.540 align:middle line:90%
and I went through my notes.

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Eileen,
all of that is correct.

00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:33.560 align:middle line:90%
So how did you feel?

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:35.360 align:middle line:90%
I felt like I had to eat crow.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.270 align:middle line:84%
I was like, wow,
I've been so rude.

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:39.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But weren't you
incredibly relieved to know

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:40.510 align:middle line:90%
it's possible?

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:42.650 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: Well, I
was a little mortified,

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:45.312 align:middle line:84%
because I'd been so adamant
that it wasn't possible.

00:27:45.312 --> 00:27:48.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Once you got done
being ashamed of yourself.

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:48.830 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Yes.

00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:49.970 align:middle line:90%
Then I was amazed.

00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:52.970 align:middle line:84%
Because it opened up a whole
new world of possibility

00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:55.400 align:middle line:84%
to actually be able to
do this at a distance

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.260 align:middle line:84%
with no open line
of communication.

00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:01.382 align:middle line:84%
Now, after that, I
did some with people

00:28:01.382 --> 00:28:02.840 align:middle line:84%
without open line
of communication.

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:06.485 align:middle line:84%
But now we do it through
Zoom or through the phone.

00:28:06.485 --> 00:28:09.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so your
practitioners have been taught

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:10.100 align:middle line:90%
this as well?

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:10.400 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.680 align:middle line:84%
Every single person who's a
Biofield Tuning practitioner

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:13.470 align:middle line:90%
knows how to do this.

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:15.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So now, this makes it
a lot easier because if people

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:18.500 align:middle line:84%
want to get tuned up, they can
do it on a more frequent basis

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.360 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
have to be, obviously,

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:21.763 align:middle line:90%
in physical proximity.

00:28:21.763 --> 00:28:23.180 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
something else

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:26.540 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to get on
to the notion of our own voices

00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:27.597 align:middle line:90%
as our tuning forks.

00:28:27.597 --> 00:28:29.930 align:middle line:84%
This is something you're
really charged about and really

00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:31.250 align:middle line:90%
involved with right now.

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:34.100 align:middle line:84%
Going beyond the forks, back
to the most primitive thing.

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:34.900 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Our own voices, but right now,
there's some studies going on.

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is
really important.

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:43.850 align:middle line:84%
I know almost 40 years ago,
my group of beings told me,

00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:47.120 align:middle line:84%
the most profound
accepted new healing that

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.690 align:middle line:84%
will happen in my lifetime is
going to happen through sound.

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And they said, including sound
beyond the ability to hear it

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:57.290 align:middle line:84%
auditorily and that
which we can hear.

00:28:57.290 --> 00:28:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And I remember thinking,
that's interesting.

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.210 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about some of the
great strides that are being

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:03.385 align:middle line:90%
made now in these studies.

00:29:03.385 --> 00:29:07.130 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: Well, we did a
study in December of 2020 that

00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:09.300 align:middle line:84%
was originally going to
be an in-person study.

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:12.680 align:middle line:84%
But because of COVID, we
decided to move it to remote.

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:14.250 align:middle line:90%
And it was on anxiety.

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:16.940 align:middle line:84%
So things that are
rhythmic, that are tonal.

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:19.310 align:middle line:84%
Like for example,
anxiety is just a pattern

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:20.910 align:middle line:90%
in your electrical system.

00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:24.120 align:middle line:84%
So that's pretty easy
to treat at a distance.

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:27.260 align:middle line:84%
But if you have a pinched
nerve in your neck

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:30.060 align:middle line:84%
and it's going down your arm, I
would rather see you in-person.

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:30.860 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:31.985 align:middle line:90%
If there's physical things.

00:29:31.985 --> 00:29:35.570 align:middle line:84%
But these things like anxiety
that are purely energetic

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:40.260 align:middle line:84%
are very readily treated
it through at a distance.

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And so our first study was
just a feasibility study.

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:45.360 align:middle line:90%
We had 15 people.

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And everybody came in
with clinical anxiety.

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And everybody left
without clinical anxiety.

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And the markers
were very dramatic.

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:55.710 align:middle line:90%
They were very dramatic drops.

00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And we wrote both a
quantitative paper

00:29:57.630 --> 00:29:59.580 align:middle line:84%
with all the graphs
and p-values.

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And we wrote a qualitative paper
that was about people's stories

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:04.930 align:middle line:90%
and experiences with it.

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And basically, it changed their
relationship to themselves.

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:10.560 align:middle line:84%
People said things like,
I know when I'm hungry,

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:11.760 align:middle line:90%
I know when I'm thirsty.

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.170 align:middle line:90%
I know what my needs are.

00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:18.750 align:middle line:84%
That they just really settle
down into greater regulation.

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:20.790 align:middle line:84%
And it was very consistent
across the board

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:24.860 align:middle line:84%
with all of the participants
reported the same thing.

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This is important
because there are rising levels

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:28.095 align:middle line:90%
of mass anxiety.

00:30:28.095 --> 00:30:29.130 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Everywhere.

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:31.140 align:middle line:84%
This was just three
one-hour sessions

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:33.780 align:middle line:84%
at a distance that
dramatically changed

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:35.130 align:middle line:90%
people's quality of life.

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:36.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you're saying
they knew when they were

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.308 align:middle line:84%
hungry, they knew when
they were thirsty.

00:30:38.308 --> 00:30:41.770 align:middle line:84%
Are you saying that the anxiety
was blocking out their ability

00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:43.660 align:middle line:84%
to even be in tune with
the simplest things

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:44.900 align:middle line:90%
about their own functioning?

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:45.700 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:47.530 align:middle line:84%
When you're very full
of anxiety and you've

00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:49.780 align:middle line:84%
got all of those
pulsing currents running

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:52.000 align:middle line:84%
through your body
all the time, that's

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.310 align:middle line:84%
a strong signal that
interrupts your ability

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:56.650 align:middle line:84%
to perceive your
more subtle signals.

00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:59.590 align:middle line:84%
If all you are aware of is
your fear and your discomfort

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:03.760 align:middle line:84%
and things like that, you're
not aware of the subtle signals

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:06.520 align:middle line:84%
that your body is sending
you about what its needs are.

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, because
things are changing rapidly,

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:11.890 align:middle line:84%
because we have changes
happening in the cosmos,

00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:14.500 align:middle line:84%
on our planet, you know,
societally, in every which way,

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:16.480 align:middle line:84%
everybody can feel
changes upon us.

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:19.325 align:middle line:84%
And most humans don't
respond that well to change.

00:31:19.325 --> 00:31:20.200 align:middle line:90%
The notion of change.

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:20.845 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:31:20.845 --> 00:31:21.370 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:22.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It means you
don't know the outcome.

00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:24.850 align:middle line:84%
So what are you seeing
in your practice

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:28.030 align:middle line:84%
in terms of rising levels
of fear and anxiety

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:31.295 align:middle line:84%
at large throughout all of your
practitioners' practices as

00:31:31.295 --> 00:31:32.095 align:middle line:90%
well?

00:31:32.095 --> 00:31:34.540 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: Well, it
definitely got worse in COVID.

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:38.440 align:middle line:84%
Because this feeling of just a
collective fear and discomfort

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:40.015 align:middle line:90%
and anxiety.

00:31:40.015 --> 00:31:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And certainly in
the younger people,

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:45.370 align:middle line:90%
it's absolutely rampant.

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:46.485 align:middle line:90%
Kids, teenagers--

00:31:46.485 --> 00:31:48.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They're struggling
more than the adults are?

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:50.800 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: Well,
everybody is struggling.

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:51.700 align:middle line:90%
Everybody is struggling.

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:52.675 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But they
don't know their futures.

00:31:52.675 --> 00:31:53.475 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:31:53.475 --> 00:31:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And their futures
don't seem to work.

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:55.300 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:57.925 align:middle line:84%
At least you and I grew up in a
world where we could have a job

00:31:57.925 --> 00:31:58.870 align:middle line:90%
and get an apartment.

00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:59.560 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:00.685 align:middle line:90%
Like things kind of worked.

00:32:00.685 --> 00:32:06.310 align:middle line:84%
But it's become so stressful
and so uncertain and so endemic

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:08.770 align:middle line:90%
to the whole population of them.

00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:13.660 align:middle line:84%
The holomorphic field of young
people is just rife with this.

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:15.590 align:middle line:90%
And social pressure.

00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:19.000 align:middle line:84%
But the amazing thing is
that young people respond

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.330 align:middle line:90%
very quickly to this work.

00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:22.960 align:middle line:84%
So somebody who's
15, I only need

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:24.970 align:middle line:84%
to do a few sessions
with them, give them

00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:27.760 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of instruction
about self-regulation

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:32.080 align:middle line:84%
and self-care and we're going
to see significant shifts.

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.300 align:middle line:84%
If I'm working with
somebody who's 70

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:37.965 align:middle line:84%
and they have patterns that have
been going on for a lifetime,

00:32:37.965 --> 00:32:39.340 align:middle line:84%
it's going to take
more sessions.

00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:41.410 align:middle line:84%
It's going to take
a longer duration

00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:45.236 align:middle line:84%
to get the body to shift and
start adopting new patterns.

00:32:45.236 --> 00:32:47.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So there was
another study too, as I recall.

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:48.910 align:middle line:90%
Are there two?

00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:49.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:53.050 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: We're currently
underway in a three-year study,

00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:56.950 align:middle line:84%
fully funded by grants that
we have 60 participants

00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:59.110 align:middle line:90%
in and a control group.

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:01.480 align:middle line:84%
And we're repeating the
same study on anxiety.

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:03.940 align:middle line:84%
Taking a diverse
group of people.

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And in this one,
we're going to do

00:33:05.530 --> 00:33:08.440 align:middle line:90%
six sessions instead of three.

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:11.180 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to really
see what is the difference.

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:13.263 align:middle line:84%
What happens when you have
six biofilms to assess?

00:33:13.263 --> 00:33:15.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what happens
with the control group?

00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:18.985 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: To be honest
in this moment, Regina,

00:33:18.985 --> 00:33:20.610 align:middle line:84%
we've been all over
the place for that.

00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure
what we settled on.

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:24.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm working with
another organization,

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:27.230 align:middle line:84%
a research organization called
The Consciousness and Healing

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Initiative that's founded by
my friend and colleague Shamini

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:31.760 align:middle line:90%
Jain.

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And so they are working on
the IRB submission right now

00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:37.760 align:middle line:84%
because you have to get
permission for these kinds

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:39.050 align:middle line:90%
of things and make sure it's--

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:41.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I'm just trying
to imagine what the control

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:43.010 align:middle line:84%
group's experience
would look like.

00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:45.050 align:middle line:84%
Because they have to think
they're getting the same thing.

00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:45.850 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:48.790 align:middle line:84%
Or have something that might
be comparable but different.

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:49.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Comparable
but is different.

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:50.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:51.268 align:middle line:90%
Well, that'll be interesting.

00:33:51.268 --> 00:33:52.715 align:middle line:90%
So 3 years, 60 people.

00:33:52.715 --> 00:33:54.090 align:middle line:84%
We'll see what
comes out of that.

00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:56.060 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like the first
one, you did great with.

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:56.860 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:58.550 align:middle line:84%
We were so pleased
with the outcome.

00:33:58.550 --> 00:33:59.510 align:middle line:90%
The way that it got written up.

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And getting accepted
into peer review.

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:01.220 align:middle line:90%
So they've--

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:02.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: This is the deal.

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:02.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:03.800 align:middle line:90%
That is the deal.

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.967 align:middle line:84%
And that's what my guides
were telling me back then.

00:34:05.967 --> 00:34:08.510 align:middle line:84%
This will be accepted
in our lifetimes

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:12.062 align:middle line:84%
as a powerful mode of
healing that is non-invasive

00:34:12.062 --> 00:34:14.270 align:middle line:84%
compared to everything that
was going on at the time.

00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:14.510 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:17.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This was in the
era of AIDS and all that too.

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.840 align:middle line:90%
So at the time I thought, wow.

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:20.489 align:middle line:84%
That would be great
if that happened.

00:34:20.489 --> 00:34:21.330 align:middle line:90%
Here you are.

00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:21.929 align:middle line:90%
It's happening.

00:34:21.929 --> 00:34:22.310 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: It's happening.

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:25.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So now let's go even
further into the most simple

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.150 align:middle line:84%
thing we carry with
us all the time,

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:29.899 align:middle line:84%
our voice and the work
you're doing with that now.

00:34:29.899 --> 00:34:33.020 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: So I paired up with
these two wonderful Australian

00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:33.820 align:middle line:90%
brothers--

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:35.460 align:middle line:90%
Isaac, and Thorald Koren.

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And I initially worked
with them because they

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:43.409 align:middle line:84%
are specialists in
helping people to overcome

00:34:43.409 --> 00:34:44.969 align:middle line:90%
their fear of singing.

00:34:44.969 --> 00:34:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And they work with you
to co-write and record

00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:51.960 align:middle line:84%
some songs so that you can
just overcome that fear.

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:55.199 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is a fear
that so many people have and I

00:34:55.199 --> 00:34:56.489 align:middle line:90%
certainly had it.

00:34:56.489 --> 00:34:59.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm so comfortable speaking in
front of thousands of people.

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:03.330 align:middle line:84%
But the thought of singing
was absolutely terrifying.

00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't really feel
connected to my voice

00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:09.450 align:middle line:84%
or to that authentic place
where your voice really

00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:12.060 align:middle line:90%
comes from when you sing.

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:15.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm a big fan of
meeting fears head on.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:18.580 align:middle line:84%
Because where we have
fear, we also have power.

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And so the exercise in
addressing and overcoming fears

00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:26.890 align:middle line:84%
is really one of the best things
that we can do for ourselves.

00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:28.270 align:middle line:90%
It's so expanding.

00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:29.070 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
working with them

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:35.640 align:middle line:84%
to write and record some
songs, but then COVID happened.

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't get to California
to do the recording with them.

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And to be honest, I
didn't feel ready.

00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:44.040 align:middle line:84%
I still felt like I
had all these blocks

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:45.750 align:middle line:84%
and places in my
body and I still

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:47.800 align:middle line:90%
had fear and tension around it.

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And so without even trying,
and I don't even really fully

00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:53.160 align:middle line:90%
remember how it happened.

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:56.730 align:middle line:84%
This whole body of work that
we call the sonic anatomy

00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:57.720 align:middle line:90%
came through us.

00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And what we discovered was
that there were very specific

00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:04.860 align:middle line:84%
tones-like sounds
that resonated in very

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:07.148 align:middle line:90%
specific areas of the body.

00:36:07.148 --> 00:36:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And there are primitive
sounds, like sounds

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:11.070 align:middle line:84%
that babies make when
they're exploring

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:12.690 align:middle line:90%
their human instrument sounds.

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:16.190 align:middle line:84%
Like "ga" and "wa" and
"ma" and "pa" and "da."

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:20.150 align:middle line:84%
But the discovery
through our own

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:23.210 align:middle line:84%
shared experience
that, for example "waa"

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:25.610 align:middle line:90%
resonates in the tailbone.

00:36:25.610 --> 00:36:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And "yaa" comes from
the front of the heart.

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:30.200 align:middle line:90%
"Haa" is in the throat.

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And so we developed
a program called

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:36.530 align:middle line:84%
Sing the Body Electric, where
we take people through what we

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:40.160 align:middle line:84%
call the tones and the demi
tones of the sonic anatomy.

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And it is an incredibly powerful
and liberating experience

00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:47.570 align:middle line:84%
to make all of these
sounds because you

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:51.800 align:middle line:84%
don't have to sound good, you
don't have to be in pitch.

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:55.010 align:middle line:84%
The metaphor that I use is that
we're all like pipe organs.

00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And we've got all of these pipes
that have been shut down in us.

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:02.840 align:middle line:84%
Places we don't go, emotions
we don't express, old traumas.

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.548 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so many people
have voice trauma.

00:37:04.548 --> 00:37:05.348 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:37:05.348 --> 00:37:08.330 align:middle line:84%
You've got a mouse nest in this
pipe and the key to this one

00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:09.183 align:middle line:90%
doesn't work.

00:37:09.183 --> 00:37:10.850 align:middle line:84%
And so we don't feel
comfortable singing

00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:14.280 align:middle line:84%
because we don't have our full
instrument available to us.

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:16.580 align:middle line:84%
So it's really like
an exercise in pipe

00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:19.530 align:middle line:84%
cleaning where you just go
to these different areas

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:21.900 align:middle line:84%
in the body and you make
whatever sound is there.

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And it might sound awful,
because that's just

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.580 align:middle line:90%
what is held there.

00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:29.520 align:middle line:84%
Whatever emotion or tension
that you're holding,

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:32.730 align:middle line:84%
the sound of the heart
might come out, yeah.

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And you just keep on adding
air and it blows out the pipe.

00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden
you're like, "yeaah."

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:40.535 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You're really
able to make sounds.

00:37:40.535 --> 00:37:43.200 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: So when we
take people through--

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.180 align:middle line:84%
it's like an eight or
nine-hour workshop.

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:47.760 align:middle line:84%
At the beginning, we have
them sing happy birthday

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:50.890 align:middle line:84%
to themselves because
everybody knows how to do that.

00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:53.490 align:middle line:84%
And then we just make all
of these vowel sounds.

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And we really play in
tuning up our instruments.

00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And then we sing happy
birthday at the end.

00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And everybody has a completely
different experience.

00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:06.120 align:middle line:84%
They are more soulful,
they're more creative,

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:06.870 align:middle line:84%
they're more playful,
they're more in the body.

00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:08.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I can feel
the truth in this.

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:08.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.230 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: They're
just like, oh, my God.

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.740 align:middle line:90%
I can sing.

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:11.820 align:middle line:90%
And we didn't even sing.

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:14.740 align:middle line:84%
All we did was just make
a whole bunch of noise.

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:19.240 align:middle line:84%
Very freely and as loud or
quiet or as oddly as we want to.

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly,
because you've

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:25.240 align:middle line:84%
opened up your human
instrument, you get to enjoy it.

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is one of
life's greatest pleasures.

00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:31.930 align:middle line:84%
Is to enjoy singing and
how it resonates in you.

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:33.003 align:middle line:90%
It's energizing.

00:38:33.003 --> 00:38:34.420 align:middle line:84%
They've done a lot
of studies that

00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:37.610 align:middle line:84%
show that singing in groups
is so good for our health.

00:38:37.610 --> 00:38:38.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:39.797 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: And
so many people--

00:38:39.797 --> 00:38:42.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Rupert Sheldrake
I think was involved in some

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:42.350 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:38:42.350 --> 00:38:42.710 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:43.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And so many people, probably
90% of the population

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:49.960 align:middle line:84%
doesn't get to
enjoy this process.

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:51.130 align:middle line:90%
But it's more than that.

00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:54.290 align:middle line:84%
Because it's really by our
word that we create our life.

00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:55.090 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:56.740 align:middle line:90%
The word is creative.

00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And we speak our
lives into being.

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And if you're just
using your voice

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:03.700 align:middle line:84%
in one little place and your
life is going to be like that.

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:04.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's true.

00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:08.410 align:middle line:84%
I, years ago, was friends with
a woman named Annie Williams.

00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:12.397 align:middle line:84%
And she has this voice
spectrum analyzer.

00:39:12.397 --> 00:39:14.230 align:middle line:84%
So you would sit and
chat with her and she's

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:15.980 align:middle line:90%
beautiful, beautiful singer.

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:18.650 align:middle line:84%
But this is what she
did in the daytime.

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:20.570 align:middle line:84%
Analyze your voice and
it would go through

00:39:20.570 --> 00:39:23.960 align:middle line:84%
and show which notes were
missing from your voice,

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:24.860 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And you could tell
a lot about-- she

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.730 align:middle line:84%
could tell a lot about a
person on an emotional level,

00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:31.370 align:middle line:84%
in particular, by which
notes simply weren't there

00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:33.650 align:middle line:84%
that you don't utilize
in your own spectrum.

00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:35.220 align:middle line:90%
Did you find this as well?

00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:35.450 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:36.250 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:37.888 align:middle line:84%
And then those are
parts of you, right?

00:39:37.888 --> 00:39:39.680 align:middle line:84%
Again, coming back to
this idea that we all

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:42.690 align:middle line:84%
have this incredible potential,
but we struggle to access it.

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:43.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:46.940 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: And so if you can
really open up the spectrum

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:49.820 align:middle line:84%
of your voice and have it
be a full body experience,

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:53.150 align:middle line:84%
then your voice is reflecting
more of who you are.

00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:55.085 align:middle line:90%
And then your life follows suit.

00:39:55.085 --> 00:39:59.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So is it fair to
say if we even so much as when

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:01.640 align:middle line:90%
we're driving in our car, OK.

00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:03.590 align:middle line:84%
Roll the windows up so
no one can hear you.

00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:07.640 align:middle line:84%
But just singing to ourselves,
singing to ourselves

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:09.710 align:middle line:84%
in the shower in the
car is a beginning

00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:11.810 align:middle line:84%
of this vibrational
healing process

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:13.760 align:middle line:84%
without having to
even go to a workshop,

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:14.900 align:middle line:84%
then we'll talk
about the workshops.

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:15.700 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Right.

00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:18.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you're singing, one
of the things that's happening

00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:22.790 align:middle line:84%
is your mental body,
that inner critic,

00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:26.310 align:middle line:84%
the fussing, the worrying
isn't taking place.

00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:28.670 align:middle line:84%
So if you can really sing
with your whole being,

00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:30.560 align:middle line:84%
then you get to
experience yourself

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:32.420 align:middle line:90%
as whole and undivided.

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:35.900 align:middle line:84%
If you can sing with just
the play and the pleasure

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:39.200 align:middle line:84%
without what Isaac and Thorald
call the small voices coming

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:42.650 align:middle line:84%
in and criticizing and
judging, then all of a sudden,

00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:44.930 align:middle line:84%
you've created
wholeness in yourself.

00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And wholeness is
where healing happens.

00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:49.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's talk
about the workshops.

00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:52.910 align:middle line:84%
Are you actually doing these
workshops with these two men?

00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:53.750 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Yes.

00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:57.015 align:middle line:84%
We do workshops
online and in-person.

00:40:57.015 --> 00:40:59.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What are they called
so if people want to look

00:40:59.390 --> 00:40:59.700 align:middle line:90%
for them?

00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:01.280 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: So it's called
Sing the Body Electric.

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:02.697 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Sing
the Body Electric.

00:41:02.697 --> 00:41:04.955 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK:
singthebodyelectric.com.

00:41:04.955 --> 00:41:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's great for
all kinds of people.

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:09.740 align:middle line:84%
So we have a lot of Biofield
Tuning practitioners

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:11.060 align:middle line:90%
who learn this.

00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And then they might be
working with somebody

00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:14.930 align:middle line:84%
and they're all jammed
up in the heart.

00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:17.310 align:middle line:84%
They're having trouble
giving and receiving love.

00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:19.520 align:middle line:84%
So as they're tuning
the heart, they'll

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:23.780 align:middle line:84%
also have the person
say, tone yeah.

00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:27.056 align:middle line:84%
And so people might not,
they're like, "yeaah."

00:41:27.056 --> 00:41:31.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it's really
making your original Bio Tuning

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:34.140 align:middle line:84%
practice even more
rich and more subtle.

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:37.520 align:middle line:84%
Because we're getting the sound
from the inside and the sound

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:39.027 align:middle line:84%
from the outside
at the same time.

00:41:39.027 --> 00:41:39.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:40.250 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:42.660 align:middle line:84%
Just listening to you, I
can feel the truth in that.

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:46.040 align:middle line:84%
So what about using
the forks on ourselves?

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:48.440 align:middle line:84%
Is it as good if we
try to do it ourselves?

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And how do we know which fork
and which tone and everything

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:53.198 align:middle line:90%
that's going to work for us?

00:41:53.198 --> 00:41:57.530 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: Well, I always
say, the best one to start with

00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:59.143 align:middle line:84%
for self care-- and
actually this one,

00:41:59.143 --> 00:42:01.310 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people have reported
to us that it's helped

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:02.630 align:middle line:90%
their digestion.

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:06.290 align:middle line:84%
Is a weighted tuning fork
that I call the sonic slider.

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And I originally
created that more

00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:11.120 align:middle line:90%
for vanity and rejuvenation.

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:12.830 align:middle line:84%
Just sort of ironing
your face at the end

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:15.870 align:middle line:84%
of the day with this
vibrating tuning fork handle.

00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:17.420 align:middle line:84%
But then over the
years, people have

00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:20.210 align:middle line:84%
discovered that it's great
for pain, for arthritis,

00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:23.450 align:middle line:84%
for digestive stuff,
for headaches, for TMJ.

00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:25.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's just a really
pleasing frequency

00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:27.770 align:middle line:84%
that's based in the Schumann
resonance, the Earth's

00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:30.890 align:middle line:90%
natural background pulse.

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And we recommend that
people use it every day.

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Because you're putting
coherent sound and energy

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:36.650 align:middle line:90%
into your body.

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And it helps you to just
look and feel better.

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:41.780 align:middle line:84%
So that's one, is
the sonic slider.

00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:43.800 align:middle line:84%
But I just brought
you a 528 hertz fork.

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:44.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:45.400 align:middle line:90%
I love this.

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:46.550 align:middle line:90%
I love the feeling of it.

00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:48.620 align:middle line:84%
It's really-- for
me, it's all kind

00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:51.680 align:middle line:84%
of moving and flushing
upward from the eyeballs

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:53.000 align:middle line:90%
from the sixth chakra up.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.230 align:middle line:90%
That's my experience of it.

00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:55.030 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's a really brightening,
lifting, lightning forks.

00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:00.020 align:middle line:84%
It's nice to just
sit with meditation,

00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:02.890 align:middle line:84%
if you want to quiet your
mind and bathe yourself

00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:04.140 align:middle line:90%
in coherent bright uplifting--

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:05.060 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Takes you right out.

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:05.405 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: --frequencies.

00:43:05.405 --> 00:43:07.130 align:middle line:84%
It'll quiet your
mind right away.

00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:08.110 align:middle line:90%
Right away.

00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we've
been talking about.

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:13.340 align:middle line:84%
People need to learn this
sort of mental discipline

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:17.732 align:middle line:84%
of quieting the unkind
voices in the head.

00:43:17.732 --> 00:43:19.190 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's because
you're singing

00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:20.810 align:middle line:84%
and you're fully
present or you're

00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:22.490 align:middle line:84%
just sitting
listening very deeply.

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:24.890 align:middle line:84%
Your brain goes into that
alpha brainwave state

00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:26.810 align:middle line:84%
where you're just very
present and listening.

00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And that, again, is
where health happens.

00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:31.265 align:middle line:84%
When we're whole, when we're
present, when we're regulating.

00:43:31.265 --> 00:43:32.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: When
we're harmonized.

00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: When
we're harmonized.

00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:34.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: We're out of time.

00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:35.915 align:middle line:90%
Any final thoughts?

00:43:35.915 --> 00:43:36.800 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Hmm.

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:38.970 align:middle line:90%
Any final thoughts?

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:43.070 align:middle line:90%
Well, use your voice.

00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:49.250 align:middle line:84%
Explore the beauty and the
gift to yourself in believing.

00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:50.300 align:middle line:90%
Everybody can sing.

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:51.200 align:middle line:90%
Everybody can sing.

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:52.580 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't sing for so long.

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And this work has
opened my voice

00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:55.843 align:middle line:84%
where I can lead
sing alongs now.

00:43:55.843 --> 00:43:56.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, I love.

00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:59.218 align:middle line:10%
>> MCKUSICK: Lead sing alongs
at the end of these workshops

00:43:59.218 --> 00:44:01.485 align:middle line:10%
where even a year ago,
Regina, I wouldn't even--

00:44:01.485 --> 00:44:03.860 align:middle line:10%
I didn't even want to sing in
front of Isaac and Thorald.

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:06.650 align:middle line:10%
And just practicing these
tones over and over again

00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:08.930 align:middle line:10%
has given me so much more
confidence and presence

00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:11.015 align:middle line:10%
and enjoyment of my voice.

00:44:11.015 --> 00:44:12.050 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:12.350 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:44:12.350 --> 00:44:13.642 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So sing to yourself.

00:44:13.642 --> 00:44:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And you can feel the
harmonization happening.

00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:18.510 align:middle line:84%
Anytime you even start
humming to yourself,

00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:20.820 align:middle line:84%
your vibration immediately
starts shifting.

00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKUSICK: Immediately
starts to shift.

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:24.107 align:middle line:84%
So believe that you can have
a beautiful voice and make it

00:44:24.107 --> 00:44:25.225 align:middle line:90%
a goal to get there.

00:44:25.225 --> 00:44:26.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:28.225 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm so glad you took
on this new body of work

00:44:28.225 --> 00:44:31.120 align:middle line:84%
to add to your already
amazing body of work.

00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:32.880 align:middle line:84%
So next time we
see you, who knows

00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:35.130 align:middle line:84%
what study you'll have going
and what you'll be up to?

00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:36.777 align:middle line:84%
But I'm very appreciative
you took time

00:44:36.777 --> 00:44:38.610 align:middle line:84%
to come in because
you're a busy, busy lady.

00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:39.210 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:39.840 align:middle line:90%
You bet, Regina.

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:40.660 align:middle line:90%
It's such a pleasure.

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:41.535 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you.
