>> REGINA MEREDITH: Everyone
loves a reformed sinner.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.650 align:middle line:84%
It's the basis of some of the
greatest tear-jerking films

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:25.450 align:middle line:90%
and books.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:26.250 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.190 align:middle line:84%
Because we love to see the
moment of awakening or breakdown

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.670 align:middle line:84%
and growth in our character
there and in ourselves, which

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.310 align:middle line:84%
leads us to today's guest,
Jerry Sargeant, who has

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.450 align:middle line:84%
walked the path from sinner to
saint, or at least wonderful

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.250 align:middle line:90%
teacher.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.990 align:middle line:84%
Wonderful to have
you here, Jerry.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.460 align:middle line:84%
>> JERRY SARGEANT: Thank
you for having me, Regina.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.720 align:middle line:90%
It's an absolute pleasure.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, you just
have such a wonderful, wild,

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.550 align:middle line:90%
broad life story.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.043 align:middle line:84%
So I thought what we'd do is,
first of all, the things you do

00:00:52.043 --> 00:00:53.710 align:middle line:84%
are pretty wild and
wonderful and crazy.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.610 align:middle line:84%
But like you say, if you
can do this, anybody can.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.510 align:middle line:84%
But I think you
came in to do this.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.835 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk a little
bit about just you,

00:01:00.835 --> 00:01:02.460 align:middle line:84%
so people get to know
you a little bit.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.590 align:middle line:84%
Growing up, your
birth and growing up

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.220 align:middle line:84%
because there was a
bit of a rough go.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.350 align:middle line:90%
Your mom was sent off.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.460 align:middle line:10%
>> SARGEANT: Yeah, I mean, I was
adopted and fostered as a kid.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.030 align:middle line:10%
I found my real mom when I
was about 25, 26 years old.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And she told me what happened
when I came into this world.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And she was out of wedlock
when she got pregnant.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Teenager, I assume.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.290 align:middle line:90%
Was she young?

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.400 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: She was
about 20-odd, 19, 20.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.200 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.000 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: So it was kind
of frowned upon back then.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.510 align:middle line:84%
So she told her mom and dad
she was going to college.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.913 align:middle line:84%
So she went from Birmingham,
where she grew up,

00:01:35.913 --> 00:01:37.830 align:middle line:84%
to a place called
Cheltenham where I was born,

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.640 align:middle line:84%
which is only like 40
minutes on the train.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.490 align:middle line:84%
But she went into a
home for women that

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.320 align:middle line:90%
are pregnant out of wedlock.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.090 align:middle line:10%
When she went in to
give birth to me,

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.540 align:middle line:10%
it was kind of like traumatic.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.730 align:middle line:10%
There was a lot of
abuse, a lot of torture.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.960 align:middle line:10%
And yeah, I kind of came
into the world that way,

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.250 align:middle line:10%
and then fostered.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: How was
the foster situation?

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.740 align:middle line:90%
>> SARGEANT: I was really young.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.032 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was a lot of
abuse that was taking place.

00:02:00.032 --> 00:02:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, it's
the foster care system.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>> SARGEANT: Yeah, yeah.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: My mother went
through that and that abuse,

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.940 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:05.870 align:middle line:90%
>> SARGEANT: OK.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And then I was adopted
about a year old.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And my adoptive mother
was kind of abusive, too.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.890 align:middle line:84%
My first school teacher
was kind of abusive,

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.570 align:middle line:90%
and she was a female.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.935 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of came into the world
treated not very well by women.

00:02:21.935 --> 00:02:23.560 align:middle line:84%
So I've always had
this thing that I've

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.380 align:middle line:84%
had to deal with
women to bring myself

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.060 align:middle line:84%
into a kind of
space of equilibrium

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.050 align:middle line:84%
where I can love all
humans, especially women.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.010 align:middle line:84%
It was a big kind of
like trauma point for me.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Trust.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.150 align:middle line:90%
Trust.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.100 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: A lot
of trust, yeah.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.560 align:middle line:90%
My trust--

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Great trust issues.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.110 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: Massive trust
issues in so many different

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.910 align:middle line:90%
ways.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:41.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.340 align:middle line:84%
OK, so needless to say,
this didn't give you

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.640 align:middle line:84%
a firm foundation,
so you ended up

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.130 align:middle line:84%
as kind of a guy who had
to work it out on his own,

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.430 align:middle line:90%
as I understand it.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And this led you to all kinds
of different activities,

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.090 align:middle line:84%
including what we talked about
in the beginning, which was-- it

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.630 align:middle line:90%
got you into a life of crime.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're good
with numbers, right?

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.170 align:middle line:90%
>> SARGEANT: Yeah.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.260 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Doing some drug stuff
and doing some international

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.730 align:middle line:84%
level banking fraud,
from what I understand.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.700 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us a
little bit about how

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.340 align:middle line:84%
you made those
decisions and how you

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.710 align:middle line:84%
felt in those
entrepreneurial endeavors?

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.650 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: So as a kid,
I was really good at rugby.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.120 align:middle line:90%
I was a really angry child.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.920 align:middle line:90%
And I used to--

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.400 align:middle line:90%
I was good at a lot of sports.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.720 align:middle line:84%
I played tennis, rugby, and
football for the county.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And then there was
a point that came

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.510 align:middle line:84%
where I had to make
a decision because I

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.160 align:middle line:84%
was at a high
level at all three,

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.368 align:middle line:84%
and I had to choose which
road am I going to go down.

00:03:32.368 --> 00:03:34.993 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't do the tennis because
my mom and dad couldn't afford

00:03:34.993 --> 00:03:36.760 align:middle line:84%
the private lessons,
and I had to choose

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.730 align:middle line:90%
between rugby and football.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:38.530 align:middle line:90%
I chose rugby.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.940 align:middle line:90%
It was more, more violent--

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:40.420 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: More vicious.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.837 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: --more
contact, yeah.

00:03:41.837 --> 00:03:44.230 align:middle line:84%
So I was playing
rugby and one day

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.300 align:middle line:84%
I got banned from playing
rugby for fighting.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.050 align:middle line:84%
I was fighting on the
pitch, got sent off.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.860 align:middle line:84%
I was fighting on the sideline,
had to go to court, rugby court,

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.240 align:middle line:90%
and got banned for a year.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.080 align:middle line:90%
Then I got into drink, drugs.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.440 align:middle line:84%
My kind of life sort of
spiraled out of control.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.690 align:middle line:84%
I started selling
ecstasy tablets

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.000 align:middle line:84%
with my friends, sort
of 14, 15 years old.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.470 align:middle line:84%
We were going to raves and
just traveling all over the UK,

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.460 align:middle line:84%
really, at rave parties,
having a great time.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.260 align:middle line:90%
We loved it.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.565 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I didn't have
a care in the world.

00:04:13.565 --> 00:04:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now, let me just
ask you really quickly.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.170 align:middle line:84%
So you were doing
ecstasy, too, I assume.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And did it bring those
incredible feelings

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.880 align:middle line:90%
of euphoria and love to you?

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:22.880 align:middle line:90%
>> SARGEANT: Absolutely.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.273 align:middle line:84%
The amount of feelings of
love when I was a child,

00:04:25.273 --> 00:04:27.440 align:middle line:84%
doing ecstasy, I mean, I
didn't want to come off it.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.590 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It was heaven.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:28.590 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: It was heaven,
yeah, it was beautiful.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.673 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So I can
understand how you'd go there.

00:04:30.673 --> 00:04:33.240 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: Every weekend,
from Friday until Monday,

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.500 align:middle line:84%
I'd be dropping ecstasy, pills,
and just having a great time

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.473 align:middle line:90%
dancing with my mates.

00:04:37.473 --> 00:04:40.140 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't really think I was
going to be doing anything else.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And then I ended
up meeting a girl.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.900 align:middle line:84%
We got into a
relationship and we

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.690 align:middle line:84%
decided that we were going to
go traveling around Europe.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.350 align:middle line:90%
And we bought an old camper van.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.573 align:middle line:84%
I got a job working in
an ice cream factory

00:04:51.573 --> 00:04:53.990 align:middle line:84%
and I used to sell weed to all
the people in the ice cream

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.790 align:middle line:90%
factory.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: As one does one--

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.100 align:middle line:90%
ice cream factory.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: And then what
happened is we were due to leave

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.600 align:middle line:84%
England the next day
in this camper van

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.940 align:middle line:84%
and we're in the local
pub having a drink.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And this guy walks in that we've
never, ever seen in our life.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.615 align:middle line:90%
And he was like a walk-in.

00:05:11.615 --> 00:05:12.990 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
a walk-in was,

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.800 align:middle line:84%
but I've since discovered
this guy walks into the pub.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: He appeared.

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.503 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: He just appeared
from nowhere, and he said,

00:05:18.503 --> 00:05:20.530 align:middle line:84%
I hear you guys are
going traveling.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.903 align:middle line:90%
He said, don't do that.

00:05:21.903 --> 00:05:23.320 align:middle line:84%
He said, take this
piece of paper.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.790 align:middle line:84%
He gave us a Spanish mobile
telephone number and the name.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And he said, go to
Tenerife, you'll

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.620 align:middle line:84%
earn at least 300
pounds a week and you'll

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:32.920 align:middle line:90%
get free accommodation.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And we were like,
where's Tenerife?

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:35.530 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, he just left.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.230 align:middle line:84%
So the next day, we get a map
and we're like, oh Tenerife,

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:39.730 align:middle line:90%
is this like a hot country.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.540 align:middle line:84%
So we sold the camper van,
we bought two one-way tickets

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:43.410 align:middle line:90%
to Tenerife.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And we ended up working for
a guy called John Palmer,

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.350 align:middle line:84%
who was the guy that
melted the gold down from

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.740 align:middle line:84%
the brink's-mat gold Bullion
robbery at Heathrow Airport

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:53.620 align:middle line:90%
in 1982.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:54.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Wow,
that's high profile.

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:56.873 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: He set up
loads of timeshare resorts.

00:05:56.873 --> 00:05:59.270 align:middle line:84%
He was involved in all sorts
of different bits of crime,

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.310 align:middle line:84%
and I worked for him for
several years doing timeshare,

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.200 align:middle line:84%
then got involved in
lots of other things.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And so that just,
you know, that was

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.330 align:middle line:84%
kind of how I got involved
in all of this stuff.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And I absolutely
loved it because I

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.270 align:middle line:90%
was earning loads of money.

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.423 align:middle line:84%
I could buy whatever I
wanted at a young age.

00:06:12.423 --> 00:06:13.840 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have a
care in the world.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:14.650 align:middle line:90%
I was partying.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:15.450 align:middle line:90%
I was traveling.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.690 align:middle line:84%
It was sunny in
Tenerife all year round.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.430 align:middle line:84%
There were parties and
discos and, I was in heaven.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You were
living at large.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.480 align:middle line:84%
You were a young
man living at large.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: Yeah, it
was like we're in heaven.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.210 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I didn't have any reason
to want a different life.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Right,
but things changed.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: They
did change, yeah.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:32.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's
talk about that.

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.790 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: So I ended up
leaving Tenerife about 2003.

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.390 align:middle line:84%
My daughter was born
in 2002 in Tenerife.

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:41.760 align:middle line:84%
The lady that I got involved
in, who became my wife,

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.110 align:middle line:90%
was from Romania.

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.480 align:middle line:84%
She didn't have a passport,
so I couldn't get-- we

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.580 align:middle line:84%
couldn't get our daughter
a passport at the time.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.200 align:middle line:84%
So I had to smuggle my wife
and child back into England.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.100 align:middle line:90%
Then we got married.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.740 align:middle line:90%
We set up a property business.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And everything was
going really well.

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.430 align:middle line:84%
We made millions in a
very short period of time.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And then the property market
took a downturn and everything

00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.890 align:middle line:90%
crashed.

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:00.670 align:middle line:90%
We lost the business.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.420 align:middle line:84%
We lost all the money,
we lost everything.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.450 align:middle line:84%
We lost our client's
money, even worse.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:07.390 align:middle line:84%
So it was a horrible
position to be in.

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And we got kicked
out of our home.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.430 align:middle line:84%
Our son, Josh, was
born at that time.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.610 align:middle line:90%
This is like 2005.

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, I went
back to selling drugs

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.593 align:middle line:84%
again, went back to
bank fraud, and yeah,

00:07:20.593 --> 00:07:22.260 align:middle line:84%
just went back to
that for several years

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.952 align:middle line:84%
and just got really
engaged in that

00:07:23.952 --> 00:07:25.660 align:middle line:84%
because I was making
lots of money again.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.375 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, my
spiritual journey started.

00:07:28.375 --> 00:07:30.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let me ask you a
quick question before we jump

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:31.620 align:middle line:90%
over there.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.360 align:middle line:84%
Did you feel when you were doing
the bank fraud and such that,

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.160 align:middle line:90%
what the heck?

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.560 align:middle line:90%
You can make ends meet.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.100 align:middle line:90%
You're not hurting any person.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.650 align:middle line:84%
You're not hurting a
person, just banks.

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:44.880 align:middle line:84%
Did you have a disconnection
with the notion of it

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.290 align:middle line:90%
being criminal at the time?

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.900 align:middle line:84%
Or did you just accept that
as part of the gig and it

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.620 align:middle line:84%
was OK and hoped you
didn't get caught?

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:51.420 align:middle line:90%
>> SARGEANT: Yeah.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:54.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, what actually happened is
I started my spiritual journey

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:56.040 align:middle line:84%
around the same sort
of time as this.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.787 align:middle line:84%
I was getting into
all the bank fraud.

00:07:57.787 --> 00:08:00.120 align:middle line:84%
So the drugs started first,
then got into the bank fraud

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:00.540 align:middle line:90%
afterwards.

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And my spiritual
journey had started.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.418 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
is this lady that

00:08:03.418 --> 00:08:07.650 align:middle line:84%
became my spiritual
teacher, she had charities

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:08.950 align:middle line:90%
that she worked with.

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:10.860 align:middle line:84%
So I was getting
all of this money,

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.460 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't know
what to do with it.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.413 align:middle line:84%
So I was saying to
her, is there any way

00:08:14.413 --> 00:08:16.330 align:middle line:84%
we could donate some of
this money to charity?

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.420 align:middle line:84%
So we started sending
this money to Africa

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.150 align:middle line:84%
and we were building
water pipelines,

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:24.510 align:middle line:84%
putting school projects in
place, educational projects,

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:26.407 align:middle line:84%
and just helping
the local community.

00:08:26.407 --> 00:08:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is we were
getting letters coming back

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.922 align:middle line:84%
from the people that
owned this charity,

00:08:30.922 --> 00:08:33.130 align:middle line:84%
and they were saying this
happened and that happened.

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:35.928 align:middle line:84%
And it started to change
me on a different level

00:08:35.928 --> 00:08:38.220 align:middle line:84%
because I started to realize
that this money that we're

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:41.169 align:middle line:84%
getting, I don't just
need to buy Rolex watches,

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:43.120 align:middle line:84%
and all this dumb stuff,
you know what I mean?

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.455 align:middle line:90%
All this material stuff.

00:08:44.455 --> 00:08:45.580 align:middle line:90%
I can actually help people.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.670 align:middle line:84%
So I saw it as a
really good cause.

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:49.660 align:middle line:90%
Let's do more of it.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.200 align:middle line:84%
Let's get as much money of
this-- as much money as we can

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.665 align:middle line:90%
and give it back to the poor.

00:08:53.665 --> 00:08:55.540 align:middle line:84%
So we were still keeping
money for ourselves,

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:56.070 align:middle line:90%
don't get me wrong.

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.700 align:middle line:84%
We were just having
a brilliant life.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.600 align:middle line:84%
But over the course
of so many years,

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.410 align:middle line:84%
I started going deeper and
deeper on this spiritual journey

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:06.010 align:middle line:90%
and giving back and giving back.

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:09.000 align:middle line:84%
It started to separate me
from the criminal stuff.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And it started to take me
on this path of healing.

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:15.883 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, it all
kicked off and started.

00:09:15.883 --> 00:09:18.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, let's talk
about what happened in Romania

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.500 align:middle line:90%
then, and then the car crash.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: Yeah,
so in Romania,

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:24.760 align:middle line:84%
I was with my
ex-wife and children.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.160 align:middle line:84%
The taxi that I was in,
it ran three ladies over.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.910 align:middle line:84%
The first one came
through the windscreen,

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:31.800 align:middle line:84%
smacked me in the face
whilst I was asleep,

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.503 align:middle line:84%
got flipped over
the car and died.

00:09:33.503 --> 00:09:34.920 align:middle line:84%
Second one had her
ankles cut off,

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.690 align:middle line:84%
and the third one
was physically OK.

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:38.790 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that a lady had
come through the windscreen

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:39.640 align:middle line:90%
because I was asleep.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.440 align:middle line:90%
I just woke up.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.380 align:middle line:84%
There's glass, there's wind,
hole in the windscreen, cars

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:44.950 align:middle line:90%
swaying from side to side.

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:47.260 align:middle line:84%
The car stops, there's
blood dripping down my face.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:48.780 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't my blood.

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:51.700 align:middle line:84%
So I end up getting out of
the car, walking up the road,

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.900 align:middle line:84%
and walking past this-- the
first two ladies, one of them

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.110 align:middle line:90%
had her ankles cut off.

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:57.102 align:middle line:90%
I left her.

00:09:57.102 --> 00:09:59.310 align:middle line:84%
I left the one that was
screaming because the guy had

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:01.100 align:middle line:90%
come out from a nearby factory.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:04.060 align:middle line:84%
I was fixated on what
looked like a dead body.

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:06.130 align:middle line:84%
I've got closer and
closer to this lady

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:08.030 align:middle line:84%
and I see a soul
leaving her body.

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:09.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
first time I'd had

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.140 align:middle line:84%
any kind of
experience of anything

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:12.470 align:middle line:90%
beyond the physical realm.

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:13.850 align:middle line:90%
So this woke me up.

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, I'd met
my first spiritual teacher.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.920 align:middle line:84%
She was kind of helping me
out with different things.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.530 align:middle line:84%
She was taking me
into past lives,

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:22.330 align:middle line:84%
helping me bring my
light out of my body

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:23.770 align:middle line:84%
so I could have
out-of-body experiences

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:25.780 align:middle line:84%
and travel through the
multi-dimensional playing

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:26.580 align:middle line:90%
fields.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.290 align:middle line:84%
I was meeting spirit
guides and, everything just

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:31.210 align:middle line:84%
started to take a
whole different turn.

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:33.190 align:middle line:84%
All the time, I was
kind of battling it

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:36.097 align:middle line:84%
because I had mates that were
saying, Jerry, you're nuts.

00:10:36.097 --> 00:10:38.680 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about angels and
fairies and extraterrestrials,

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.240 align:middle line:84%
and these are guys
that have not got

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.450 align:middle line:90%
a clue about any of this stuff.

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:43.242 align:middle line:84%
Like I didn't used to
have a clue about it.

00:10:43.242 --> 00:10:47.290 align:middle line:84%
So the influence is to keep
on the kind of criminal path

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:49.030 align:middle line:84%
were difficult
because it was like

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:51.290 align:middle line:84%
drawn to come in, earn 20
grand here, 30 grand there.

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:52.570 align:middle line:90%
And it was like, yeah.

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:53.330 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You're used to it.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:54.170 align:middle line:84%
You'd gotten away
with it so far.

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:55.210 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: So I
just went and did it.

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:57.730 align:middle line:84%
So it took me a long time
to transition from that,

00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:59.230 align:middle line:90%
but eventually I did.

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:01.840 align:middle line:90%
And so I had the car crash.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But didn't you
ultimately get caught and you

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.180 align:middle line:90%
had to go to court?

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:05.960 align:middle line:90%
>> SARGEANT: I did, yes.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because that's a
fascinating story about the two

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:10.762 align:middle line:84%
beings there that were next
to the magistrate, I think.

00:11:10.762 --> 00:11:12.553 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: So what
actually happened is--

00:11:12.553 --> 00:11:13.730 align:middle line:90%
this is fast-forwarding.

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:16.940 align:middle line:84%
So fast forward to 2009,
I moved to New Zealand.

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.480 align:middle line:84%
I had some experiences where
I got taken in spacecraft,

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.620 align:middle line:90%
met some blue beings from--

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we're going
to go back to all that, yeah.

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:23.070 align:middle line:90%
>> SARGEANT: Yeah.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And fast forward to like, say,
2013, I moved back to England

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:32.020 align:middle line:84%
and I get arrested for
some of these old crimes

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.580 align:middle line:90%
to do with bank fraud.

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And to cut a long story
short, I have to go to court

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:38.530 align:middle line:84%
and I say to the
universe, listen,

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:39.962 align:middle line:84%
you get me off of
this court case,

00:11:39.962 --> 00:11:41.920 align:middle line:84%
because I was looking at
a long prison stretch,

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.680 align:middle line:84%
and I promise you I'll
do this Star Magic stuff.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.090 align:middle line:90%
And so I go to court.

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:50.270 align:middle line:84%
The judge walks out with his
two accomplices, two females.

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:51.350 align:middle line:90%
The judge was male.

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And the one lady, the one
to my left, his right,

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.817 align:middle line:90%
had wings on her back.

00:11:54.817 --> 00:11:56.150 align:middle line:90%
And she looked at me and winked.

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.750 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, no way.

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.650 align:middle line:84%
My skin kind of
went chicken skin.

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:02.380 align:middle line:90%
I was like, I was going cold.

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.217 align:middle line:84%
But my mind was
like, nah, you're

00:12:04.217 --> 00:12:05.300 align:middle line:90%
never going to get off it.

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.200 align:middle line:84%
I was in a bulletproof dock, you
know what I mean, in the court.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.140 align:middle line:84%
So the police get up, the
jurors, the prosecution, they

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:12.380 align:middle line:90%
give their side of the story.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:15.047 align:middle line:84%
They bring stuff up from when I
was young, like they made me out

00:12:15.047 --> 00:12:16.430 align:middle line:90%
to be terrible.

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:20.403 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, my solicitor gets up,
she gives our side of the story.

00:12:20.403 --> 00:12:21.820 align:middle line:84%
They go out, they
deliberate, they

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.200 align:middle line:90%
come back in 40 minutes later.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.430 align:middle line:84%
The judge looks at
me and winks again.

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:27.260 align:middle line:90%
And, you know, all rise.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.990 align:middle line:84%
I get up and they just say you
can see you're a changed man.

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:31.010 align:middle line:90%
You're free to go.

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:34.300 align:middle line:84%
So it was at that point, I
knew I had to do Star Magic.

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I love that story
that you were able to see

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.612 align:middle line:90%
the being beyond the being.

00:12:39.612 --> 00:12:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And you knew it was
going to be all right

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.890 align:middle line:90%
when she winked at you.

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:43.720 align:middle line:90%
>> SARGEANT: Yeah.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:44.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's amazing.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>> SARGEANT: Amazing.

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.115 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now we
got to go back.

00:12:46.115 --> 00:12:49.820 align:middle line:84%
So, car crash, you've been
on your journey for a while.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:52.450 align:middle line:84%
You're watching this woman,
the soul rise out of the body,

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:55.310 align:middle line:84%
and you're now
starting your path.

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about what
happens from there because we

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:00.340 align:middle line:84%
need to talk about
OBEs or out-of-body,

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:03.100 align:middle line:84%
what started happening and about
your interface with the grid

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.670 align:middle line:84%
because all this has to do with
mathematics, codes, numbers,

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:07.570 align:middle line:90%
geometry.

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: Yes, so I ended
up having this experience

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:11.770 align:middle line:84%
and seeing like life
beyond the veil.

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And then lots of
different things happened.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.055 align:middle line:84%
People coming into
my life and they've

00:13:16.055 --> 00:13:18.430 align:middle line:84%
got little things that are
going on with them, headaches,

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:20.630 align:middle line:84%
this kind of injury,
this kind of illness.

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just like,
things are happening.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.350 align:middle line:84%
Like my wife had a headache
and I saw it in her head.

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:25.250 align:middle line:90%
I pulled it out.

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:29.150 align:middle line:84%
Something else happened where
someone was in a car crash.

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And I was guided just to go
in and work on this person.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.320 align:middle line:90%
And it helped her.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.282 align:middle line:84%
She walked out of
hospital on a Zimmer frame

00:13:37.282 --> 00:13:38.740 align:middle line:84%
in 12 weeks when
the doctor thought

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:40.960 align:middle line:84%
that she was going to be in
hospital for at least a year

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:41.630 align:middle line:90%
or so.

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:43.213 align:middle line:84%
Different kinds of
healing experiences

00:13:43.213 --> 00:13:45.410 align:middle line:84%
happened, but I didn't
really think too much of it.

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:48.160 align:middle line:84%
I was just like, OK, I was
just taking it in my stride.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And then we moved
to New Zealand.

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.480 align:middle line:84%
That's when things sort
of started to amplify.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.160 align:middle line:90%
So I met this old guy.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.750 align:middle line:90%
He taught me how to meditate.

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:58.130 align:middle line:90%
I had an encounter with Jesus.

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:02.220 align:middle line:84%
I was in the Last Supper having
an experience as Matthew.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:03.760 align:middle line:90%
I saw extraterrestrials.

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.740 align:middle line:84%
I got taken in the
spacecraft one day

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:08.920 align:middle line:84%
to Alpha Centauri, where
I met my Lyran family,

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:12.080 align:middle line:84%
and they gave me a
big download of codes.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.540 align:middle line:90%
I know they're here now.

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:16.210 align:middle line:84%
So they gave me
a big download of

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:18.430 align:middle line:84%
like these fluid
geometrical codes

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:20.690 align:middle line:90%
which later became Star Magic.

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:24.700 align:middle line:84%
When I-- we moved back
to England in 2013

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:27.822 align:middle line:84%
and I started seeing these codes
in the empty space and my guides

00:14:27.822 --> 00:14:29.780 align:middle line:84%
were telling me that I
needed to meditate more.

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:33.010 align:middle line:84%
So I was going to these ancient
mystery schools in Egypt.

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:34.350 align:middle line:90%
Thoth was coming out.

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:35.150 align:middle line:90%
He was the teacher.

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:37.108 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that it
was Thoth until later on,

00:14:37.108 --> 00:14:39.160 align:middle line:84%
but he was showing
us codes and scripts

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.290 align:middle line:84%
and showing us how to heal
people with these codes.

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And so after about
nine months, we

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.290 align:middle line:84%
finished this kind of training
in the mystery schools,

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:48.760 align:middle line:84%
and people just started
coming into my life

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:49.597 align:middle line:90%
that needed healing.

00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:50.930 align:middle line:90%
So I thought, let's just try it.

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:52.970 align:middle line:84%
So we started trying
it and it was working.

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:55.480 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that Thoth
showed us in the mystery schools

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:58.000 align:middle line:84%
was how to use numerology
and mathematics

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.470 align:middle line:84%
to recode people's
DNA structures,

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:03.950 align:middle line:84%
their own blueprints, and
how to plug their blueprints

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:07.100 align:middle line:84%
into the Kathara Grids, which
is kind of like a tree of life

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:08.780 align:middle line:84%
structure, which
we have embedded

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:12.630 align:middle line:84%
in our own kind of physical
structure, our own energetics.

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:15.360 align:middle line:84%
But also it's the
structure of the universe.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And so when you plug this
mathematical structure

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:20.180 align:middle line:84%
into the structure
of the universe,

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:23.660 align:middle line:84%
amazing things happen within
someone's anatomy-- mentally,

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:25.440 align:middle line:84%
physically, emotionally,
and spiritually.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.580 align:middle line:84%
Their frequency elevates
and they become a much more

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:29.910 align:middle line:90%
empowered human being.

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:32.130 align:middle line:84%
So he was showing
us all this stuff.

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to myself, maybe
we can set up a business.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And I can actually
set up a business

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.140 align:middle line:84%
and earn money kind of legally
for the first time in my life.

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And so we went to
this exhibition,

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:45.552 align:middle line:84%
and it was a mind,
body, spirit festival.

00:15:45.552 --> 00:15:47.010 align:middle line:84%
I said to people
at the mind, body,

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:48.892 align:middle line:84%
spirit festival, listen,
put your name down.

00:15:48.892 --> 00:15:51.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give out three free
healings at the end of the show.

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.218 align:middle line:84%
So lots of people
put their name down.

00:15:53.218 --> 00:15:55.010 align:middle line:84%
I phoned them all and
told them that they'd

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:56.240 align:middle line:90%
won just so I could practice.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.900 align:middle line:84%
I was practicing
all these people.

00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:59.990 align:middle line:84%
I went to all their
houses, got testimonials,

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:01.860 align:middle line:90%
and then set Star Magic up.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And when I set Star
Magic up, the same being,

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.110 align:middle line:84%
whose name is Derek,
came to visit me again.

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:09.620 align:middle line:84%
I was meditating one day,
looking out over Gloucestershire

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:11.850 align:middle line:84%
where I used to live,
looking out over the city.

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:13.230 align:middle line:90%
The city just disappeared.

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:15.480 align:middle line:90%
I see these orange dots.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.330 align:middle line:90%
There were 13 of them.

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And this being, Derek, said
to me, the healing centers,

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:22.430 align:middle line:90%
you've got to build them.

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And then since
then, this number 13

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:26.970 align:middle line:84%
has just been coming
through all the time.

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:30.075 align:middle line:84%
Like the number 13
is the sacred code.

00:16:30.075 --> 00:16:32.450 align:middle line:84%
So we're in the process now
of building our first healing

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.730 align:middle line:84%
center in Transylvania
in Romania.

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And since then, we've set
Star Magic up in 2016.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.980 align:middle line:84%
We did our first
training where we

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:45.180 align:middle line:84%
started training other people
to heal with Star Magic in 2017.

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And then since then, we've
created lots of other trainings

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:51.410 align:middle line:84%
where we're sharing the
knowledge that we learnt

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:54.170 align:middle line:84%
in the mystery schools to help
people develop a higher level

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:56.480 align:middle line:84%
of awareness, to raise
their energy levels,

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.060 align:middle line:84%
to bring their vibration
up, and to activate

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.080 align:middle line:84%
their multi-dimensional
architecture.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, critical at
this point in time because there

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:06.490 align:middle line:84%
are some distortions in it,
which we're going to get to.

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:07.490 align:middle line:90%
>> SARGEANT: Absolutely.

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:08.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about how
that can be adjusted.

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Do you mind if we go back
a little bit to the Lyrans

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:14.930 align:middle line:84%
when you first met
them and what I

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:18.750 align:middle line:84%
assume you're part of that
family somewhere long ago.

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:20.599 align:middle line:84%
And did they talk
to you about you,

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:23.750 align:middle line:84%
your own mission, and why you
chose the path you did in life

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:25.790 align:middle line:84%
and give you more
clarity on you?

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:26.609 align:middle line:90%
>> SARGEANT: Yes.

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:32.010 align:middle line:84%
So I'm part of a tribe
called the Kirwan New Tribe.

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And this is like a
feline humanoid tribe

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:38.850 align:middle line:90%
that is way before--

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:42.390 align:middle line:84%
when I went to Alpha
Centauri, the Lyrans

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:45.952 align:middle line:84%
that I met there had escaped
after the wars that had taken

00:17:45.952 --> 00:17:47.410 align:middle line:84%
place through our
Galactic history.

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And they ended up on
Lyra, some of these beings

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.880 align:middle line:90%
that were my family.

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:51.963 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now, when you
say you were taken there,

00:17:51.963 --> 00:17:53.637 align:middle line:84%
was this more
interdimensionally?

00:17:53.637 --> 00:17:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: Well, when
I was in New Zealand

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:58.590 align:middle line:84%
in my friend's pyramid,
I was meditating

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:01.140 align:middle line:84%
in my friend's pyramid in
the garden with my eyes open

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.730 align:middle line:84%
because he taught me to
meditate with my eyes open.

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:06.947 align:middle line:84%
And I see this little space
pod several meters away

00:18:06.947 --> 00:18:08.530 align:middle line:84%
and there's a blue
being inside of it.

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:10.140 align:middle line:84%
So I brought my
light out of my body,

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:13.350 align:middle line:84%
which I'd been trained to
do by the spiritual teacher

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:15.250 align:middle line:84%
that I had that worked
for Scotland Yard.

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:16.860 align:middle line:84%
So it was like
everything was divine

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:18.420 align:middle line:84%
because I'd have
never met her, I

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:20.795 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't have known how to
bring my light out of my body.

00:18:20.795 --> 00:18:22.440 align:middle line:84%
So I brought my
light out of my body,

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.030 align:middle line:84%
went and got in the
spacecraft, and we

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:27.730 align:middle line:84%
flew through a tunnel,
ended up on a beach.

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:30.310 align:middle line:84%
I walked up the beach, and
they were like 200 of them,

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:33.590 align:middle line:84%
like massive, like 6
and a half, 7 feet tall.

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:35.043 align:middle line:90%
They had no gender.

00:18:35.043 --> 00:18:35.960 align:middle line:90%
They were androgynous.

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:36.950 align:middle line:90%
They had no clothes on.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:38.818 align:middle line:84%
They all like had
eight packs, like they

00:18:38.818 --> 00:18:39.860 align:middle line:90%
were all fit and healthy.

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, wow,
these guys must--

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:43.270 align:middle line:84%
in my mind, I was saying,
these guys go to the gym,

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:44.500 align:middle line:90%
like they're so athletic.

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.220 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You said they
were from Alpha Centauri.

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: No,
they were Lyrans,

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.432 align:middle line:90%
but they were on Alpha Centauri.

00:18:48.432 --> 00:18:49.640 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: On Alpha Centauri.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.130 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: I don't know how
I knew that I was on Alpha

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:51.930 align:middle line:90%
Centauri.

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:53.950 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how I knew
that they were Lyrans.

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:56.530 align:middle line:84%
But I just started
to know information.

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, after connecting
with these guys there,

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:01.700 align:middle line:84%
they've been with
me all the time.

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And they've taken me on
so many little journeys.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:09.780 align:middle line:84%
They took me back to Avian
in the cradle of Lyra.

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:14.800 align:middle line:84%
Avian was a planet, and Avian
had the first Garden of Eden.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And I remember being there in
these sacred emerald pyramids

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.800 align:middle line:84%
where we were doing
multi-dimensional grid work.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:23.160 align:middle line:84%
And they were showing
me how to open portals,

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.760 align:middle line:84%
bend space-time by opening
a portal with your intention

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.710 align:middle line:84%
connecting it to another
point in space time,

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:30.660 align:middle line:84%
and merging the two
points in space time

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:33.910 align:middle line:84%
together by using
these 26 crystals.

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And so they bring the
26 crystals into--

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: 3 times 2,
so you keep going back.

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:40.810 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: Yes,
specific formation.

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:44.040 align:middle line:84%
It would draw in on itself
and create this field.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And you just step into it
and end up somewhere else.

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:48.390 align:middle line:84%
There was nowhere that
you were really going,

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:52.120 align:middle line:84%
but time and space became the
same in two different locations.

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:57.350 align:middle line:84%
So when I went back to
that time and space,

00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:00.978 align:middle line:84%
one of the beings that was
there was the same consciousness

00:20:00.978 --> 00:20:02.770 align:middle line:84%
as Saint Germain and
the same consciousness

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:05.035 align:middle line:84%
that was Thoth, which I
then later encountered.

00:20:05.035 --> 00:20:06.910 align:middle line:84%
Because another thing
that happens to me when

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:10.062 align:middle line:84%
I went to New Zealand and I was
communicating with my friend

00:20:10.062 --> 00:20:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Michael and he was teaching
me how to meditate,

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.820 align:middle line:84%
he was really tapped
into Saint Germain.

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:18.972 align:middle line:84%
So Saint Germain is someone we
used to connect with almost,

00:20:18.972 --> 00:20:20.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, three
or four times a week,

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:21.940 align:middle line:90%
every week without fail.

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:23.815 align:middle line:84%
But three or four times
a week, we go and sit

00:20:23.815 --> 00:20:25.360 align:middle line:84%
in this little
coffee shop and we'd

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.810 align:middle line:90%
communicate with Saint Germain.

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:28.330 align:middle line:84%
When I went to the
mystery schools

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:31.030 align:middle line:84%
and I looked into the eyes
of the teacher, which I then

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:33.820 align:middle line:84%
found out was Thoth, I
could see the same light,

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.690 align:middle line:84%
the same frequency,
the same code.

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:37.600 align:middle line:90%
And so they were the same being.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And then going back to Avian,
to that Kirwan new tribe

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:45.160 align:middle line:84%
and being there with the
kind of Lyran Feline beings

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.440 align:middle line:84%
and seeing the same
consciousness in one

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.630 align:middle line:84%
of these beings that was
in Thoth and Saint Germain,

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:54.040 align:middle line:84%
I kind of knew that we're going
all the way back to the start

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:55.750 align:middle line:84%
and then bringing all
of this information

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:58.600 align:middle line:84%
forwards to where we are
right now on planet Earth.

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And so many times throughout
our human history,

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:03.460 align:middle line:84%
we've tried to bring
this information forward.

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:07.297 align:middle line:84%
Not just me, but many human
souls in many different forms

00:21:07.297 --> 00:21:09.130 align:middle line:84%
that have connected to
many different beings

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:11.170 align:middle line:84%
and many different
fields of consciousness

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:14.330 align:middle line:84%
have tried to share
this knowledge.

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:16.540 align:middle line:84%
But every single time,
it's either got closed down

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:19.510 align:middle line:84%
or it's got manipulated, and
there's been a catastrophe

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:22.280 align:middle line:84%
or there's been a sinking of
islands or whatever it is.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:23.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:23.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.800 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about that on the
little larger scale, going back

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.840 align:middle line:84%
to the Lyrans, because
they had their own issues

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.360 align:middle line:84%
and had to flee their
own planet at one time

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.460 align:middle line:84%
and were dealing with others
and wars were taking place.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:37.750 align:middle line:84%
So the Lyrans by this
time have this knowledge

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:40.670 align:middle line:84%
of how things can play out
if it's not done correctly.

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And they're here to
help you understand

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.100 align:middle line:84%
how you can help
others, I assume, do

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:47.560 align:middle line:84%
this in a correct
manner so Earth doesn't

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:51.720 align:middle line:84%
have the same fate as what they
had experienced very long ago.

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:54.710 align:middle line:10%
And so with this,
you were taken out

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:58.280 align:middle line:10%
and you had, like you said,
this incredible experience

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:01.400 align:middle line:10%
in a matrix or a grid.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.900 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
your experiences

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:06.170 align:middle line:84%
when you're out-of-body
working with the grid.

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And why it's even
important for all of us

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:12.590 align:middle line:84%
to be aware that there is
this amazing, supportive grid

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:14.390 align:middle line:84%
energy around the
Earth that we can

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:16.143 align:middle line:90%
tap into and utilize ourselves?

00:22:16.143 --> 00:22:18.560 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: Yeah, I mean,
like just to cut back slightly,

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:22.040 align:middle line:84%
going back to the Lyrans,
because when the Lyrans first

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:26.150 align:middle line:84%
got massacred on Avian, they
didn't have the technology

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:27.260 align:middle line:90%
to fight back then.

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:29.700 align:middle line:84%
They had some amazing,
incredible technology

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:30.950 align:middle line:90%
but it wasn't like weaponry.

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:33.770 align:middle line:84%
It was more mental and
spiritual, wasn't it?

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:34.770 align:middle line:90%
>> SARGEANT: Absolutely.

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:40.010 align:middle line:84%
So they were doing some amazing,
like, amazing feats of mastery

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:44.330 align:middle line:84%
in terms of creation and
co-creation and DNA manipulation

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:46.370 align:middle line:84%
and creating different
races of beings,

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:48.000 align:middle line:90%
which was absolutely awesome.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.570 align:middle line:84%
But when the
draconian reptilians

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:53.240 align:middle line:84%
came in and with their
kind of laser technology,

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:57.410 align:middle line:84%
massacred, raped, exterminated,
all of that nasty, evil stuff,

00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:59.850 align:middle line:84%
there was no kind of way
that they could fight back.

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:01.860 align:middle line:84%
And I remember being
there at those times.

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And so many people that
were beings that we loved

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:09.060 align:middle line:84%
were exterminated and we
had to get onto the crafts.

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And it was actually some of the
draco-reptilians that actually

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.720 align:middle line:84%
had turned against
their own families that

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.135 align:middle line:84%
helped us get off the planet
and flee to other systems.

00:23:17.135 --> 00:23:18.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Including Earth?

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:19.350 align:middle line:90%
>> SARGEANT: Including Earth.

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:21.142 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the
other thing about Earth.

00:23:21.142 --> 00:23:23.098 align:middle line:84%
People talk about
Earth's history,

00:23:23.098 --> 00:23:25.390 align:middle line:84%
but we've been here for
hundreds and millions of years.

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:26.350 align:middle line:90%
Not just like--

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:28.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We don't even
know, billions, trillions.

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:28.870 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:30.120 align:middle line:90%
>> SARGEANT: It's so, so long.

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:31.160 align:middle line:90%
So, so long.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And we've been reincarnating so
many times over human history.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:37.030 align:middle line:10%
But if you go all the
way back to the start,

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:39.520 align:middle line:10%
even before Avian,
even before Lyra,

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:43.270 align:middle line:10%
like the beings that came out
from source consciousness,

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:46.510 align:middle line:10%
they were tasked with
creating universes.

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:50.500 align:middle line:84%
They were tasked with creating
galaxies and dimensional fields

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:52.810 align:middle line:90%
within universal structures.

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And everything was beautiful for
a long period of time, billions

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:56.570 align:middle line:90%
and billions of years.

00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:59.260 align:middle line:84%
But at some point,
these beings started

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:02.350 align:middle line:84%
to create with light that wasn't
from the original prime creator.

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And so dark and light was
introduced very slowly

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:07.040 align:middle line:90%
and subtly into the universe.

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And if you fast forward
time billions of years,

00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:12.760 align:middle line:84%
we come to the construct
that we're all in now.

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:14.350 align:middle line:84%
This whole construct
that we're in

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:17.140 align:middle line:84%
is Earth and also the whole
matrix system, which isn't just

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:21.550 align:middle line:84%
Earth, it's billions of planets
in a multi-dimensional matrix

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:24.350 align:middle line:84%
which has several
super universes.

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And so this kind of
structure that we're in

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:30.440 align:middle line:90%
is Metatron's Cube.

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And Metatron's
Cube is 13 spheres.

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:38.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, when a human being comes
into their mother's womb,

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:41.480 align:middle line:84%
on 49 days, there's eight
little cells that appear.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:45.070 align:middle line:84%
Those eight little cells,
they form a Merkabah field.

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:46.077 align:middle line:90%
4 and 9 is 13.

00:24:46.077 --> 00:24:47.660 align:middle line:84%
It's the number of
the divine goddess.

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:52.370 align:middle line:84%
So we come in on a 13-code,
on a divine goddess frequency.

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:55.118 align:middle line:84%
Those eight little cells
are our genesis cells,

00:24:55.118 --> 00:24:57.160 align:middle line:84%
which are held between
the perineum and the anus.

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.618 align:middle line:84%
They're the only cells in our
human body that never change.

00:24:59.618 --> 00:25:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's the flowering
of these cells, which

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:04.480 align:middle line:84%
is that magnetic
code which supports

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.980 align:middle line:84%
the electrical Kundalini
rising up through our body.

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:09.760 align:middle line:84%
But this is like a whole
other piece of the puzzle.

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:15.880 align:middle line:84%
But this 13-code that we come
into, this kind of matrix on is

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.570 align:middle line:90%
also the code that we leave on.

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:22.450 align:middle line:84%
So if you build a matrix to stop
the falling consciousness, which

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:24.580 align:middle line:84%
is what Metatron's
Cube was, it was

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:27.520 align:middle line:84%
to stop us falling any deeper
into deeper levels of lower

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:28.580 align:middle line:90%
frequency.

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:31.630 align:middle line:84%
So Metatron's Cube
was put in place

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:34.430 align:middle line:90%
to house this whole matrix.

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:37.120 align:middle line:84%
But you don't build a
house without a doorway,

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.800 align:middle line:90%
otherwise you can't get out.

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:42.590 align:middle line:84%
So the doorway out of this
structure is Metatron's Cube.

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And Metatron's Cube is held
in so many different places

00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:46.620 align:middle line:90%
around Earth.

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:48.710 align:middle line:90%
One of them is the Giza Plateau.

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:50.420 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at
the Giza Plateau,

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:52.950 align:middle line:90%
it's based off these 13 spheres.

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:54.970 align:middle line:84%
When you go into
the king's chamber,

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:58.640 align:middle line:84%
the number 13 and
the number eight

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:02.120 align:middle line:84%
are imprinted throughout
it, which we can come onto.

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.910 align:middle line:84%
But we as humans,
what we have to do

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:07.070 align:middle line:84%
is to activate our
own architecture.

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:10.610 align:middle line:84%
So when we're in
the mystery schools,

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:12.740 align:middle line:84%
Thoth was showing us that
around our body we have

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:14.330 align:middle line:84%
a multi-dimensional
Merkabah field,

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:16.130 align:middle line:90%
which is a 12-pointed star.

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:22.530 align:middle line:84%
That 12-pointed star is
held in a 13th sphere.

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:25.380 align:middle line:84%
So again, you've got
12 and 1, which is 13.

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:27.900 align:middle line:84%
We've got 13
multi-dimensional chakras.

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:29.450 align:middle line:84%
We call them
transmission centers.

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:31.730 align:middle line:84%
We've got a 12-strand
DNA template,

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:34.050 align:middle line:84%
which is actually
housed in the 13th.

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:37.890 align:middle line:84%
So all of these thirteens
have to plug into each other.

00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:39.720 align:middle line:90%
So how do you activate that?

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:42.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the third
dimensional reality,

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:45.150 align:middle line:90%
our heart is like a cube.

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And when we switch to a fifth
dimensional frequency band,

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.890 align:middle line:84%
our heart changes to a
dodecahedron, which is 12.

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:54.890 align:middle line:84%
The 12 is always
surrounded by the 13.

00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:57.800 align:middle line:84%
When you activate your
dodecahedral heart, which

00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.210 align:middle line:84%
we teach people on
our level 2 trainings,

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:03.620 align:middle line:84%
it's all the mystery school
teachings, 12 streams of light

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:06.890 align:middle line:84%
flow out from your
dodecahedral heart

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:09.020 align:middle line:84%
and connect with your
multi-dimensional Merkabah

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:10.470 align:middle line:90%
field, the 12 points.

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Then what happens is
the activation plugs

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:15.060 align:middle line:84%
into your 12-strand
DNA blueprint.

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:18.250 align:middle line:84%
It plugs into your
own Kathara Grid,

00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:20.750 align:middle line:84%
which is the template of the
whole universe, which is inside

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:21.570 align:middle line:90%
your body.

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:24.180 align:middle line:84%
It's the template that all
of the stargates run off.

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:26.000 align:middle line:84%
It's the template that
everything runs off

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.200 align:middle line:90%
or is supposed to run off.

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:32.480 align:middle line:84%
So all of these 12 and 13
structures plug into each other

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:33.870 align:middle line:90%
and all activate.

00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:35.480 align:middle line:84%
Then what happens
is the frequency

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.660 align:middle line:84%
flows from the heart down
into Mother Earth, down

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:40.100 align:middle line:90%
into Mother Earth's heart.

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:42.050 align:middle line:84%
Mother Earth's heart
is a Merkabah field.

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:44.990 align:middle line:84%
In the center of her Merkabah
field, you've got 12 spheres.

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:48.710 align:middle line:84%
Those 12 spheres are the 12
original spheres of creation,

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:51.170 align:middle line:84%
which are housed
in the 13th sphere.

00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:55.070 align:middle line:84%
When you pull those
frequencies into this space,

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:57.000 align:middle line:90%
they link into the Giza Plateau.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.840 align:middle line:84%
The Giza plateau links into the
frequency of Mother Earth, which

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.620 align:middle line:90%
is 4, 3, 2 Hertz.

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:06.590 align:middle line:84%
If you get the Giza Plateau and
you blow it up 43,200 times,

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:09.380 align:middle line:84%
it equals the circumference
of planet Earth.

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:12.200 align:middle line:84%
So you start to pull
those harmonics back

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:14.660 align:middle line:84%
into Mother Earth's heart,
back up into your own body,

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:18.030 align:middle line:84%
and you have this
incredible activation.

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:19.800 align:middle line:84%
You start to
vibrate differently.

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.770 align:middle line:90%
Your consciousness expands.

00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you activate
yourself like this

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:25.520 align:middle line:84%
and you go into
the Giza pyramids

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:28.550 align:middle line:84%
and you go into
the King's Chamber,

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:31.250 align:middle line:84%
a whole activation
sequence starts.

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:34.220 align:middle line:84%
I know this from experience
because two years ago, I hired

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:35.960 align:middle line:90%
the Giza pyramid for myself.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.480 align:middle line:90%
Went in on my birthday.

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.980 align:middle line:84%
I was supposed to go in on the
8th of march, on my birthday,

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:42.105 align:middle line:84%
but when I got there they
told me I couldn't go in.

00:28:42.105 --> 00:28:45.560 align:middle line:84%
I had to go in on the 11th of
March at 11:00 PM for whatever

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:46.640 align:middle line:90%
reason.

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.525 align:middle line:84%
When I went into
the King's Chamber,

00:28:48.525 --> 00:28:50.400 align:middle line:84%
all the lights were off
in the whole pyramid.

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.200 align:middle line:90%
I went into my own.

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.980 align:middle line:84%
I laid down in the
King's Chamber.

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the King's
Chamber, like the dimensions,

00:28:57.730 --> 00:29:02.390 align:middle line:90%
they all add up to 11, 11, 13.

00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:05.340 align:middle line:84%
If you add 11, 11, 13
together, the length, the width

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:09.640 align:middle line:84%
and the height, it
breaks down to 8.

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:12.450 align:middle line:84%
OK, this 8-code, again, same
as the genesis cells down

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:14.700 align:middle line:90%
in the Kundalini.

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:17.310 align:middle line:84%
You've also got
constellations on the wall

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:18.580 align:middle line:90%
of the King's Chamber.

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:21.450 align:middle line:84%
So once you activate
those constellations,

00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:24.600 align:middle line:84%
they activate the 13-code,
they activate the 12-code,

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:27.180 align:middle line:84%
and these two kind of
overlays take place inside

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:28.530 align:middle line:90%
the King's Chamber.

00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:32.620 align:middle line:84%
When I was in there, all
of the walls disappeared.

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And there was all
this orange light

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:38.170 align:middle line:84%
and all these portals opened
up, and so many beings

00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:39.650 align:middle line:90%
came into the King's Chamber.

00:29:39.650 --> 00:29:44.380 align:middle line:84%
I was lying down in the
middle of the temple floor,

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:47.210 align:middle line:84%
and my lights came
out of my body.

00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And I went up through a very
specific bend in space-time.

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:56.980 align:middle line:84%
I went through Stargates
3, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 12.

00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And if you had the numerology
on these Stargates together,

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:02.620 align:middle line:90%
it equals 8 again.

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:05.530 align:middle line:84%
So this 8-code keeps coming back
in and the central gateway that

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:07.890 align:middle line:84%
we went through was
the Orion gateway.

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:11.290 align:middle line:84%
So I ended up in the God
worlds outside of our matrix,

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:14.020 align:middle line:90%
looking down at the construct.

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:17.740 align:middle line:84%
What they were showing me
is that this is actually

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:19.570 align:middle line:84%
possible in your
physical body, to go

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:20.903 align:middle line:90%
through this bend in space-time.

00:30:20.903 --> 00:30:22.945 align:middle line:84%
And I asked, why I didn't
go in my physical body?

00:30:22.945 --> 00:30:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And they told me
because I wasn't ready.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:27.250 align:middle line:84%
They said humanity's
not ready, but humanity

00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:28.852 align:middle line:90%
will be ready at some point.

00:30:28.852 --> 00:30:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And what we're here
right now to do

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:33.230 align:middle line:84%
is to share these
mathematical codes

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:36.540 align:middle line:84%
so we know how to exit
this time-based matrix.

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:38.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, ultimately, what
we're trying to do

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:40.170 align:middle line:90%
is to get into space.

00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:42.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we go in a
space rocket, we're

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:44.150 align:middle line:84%
going to travel
at Mach 33, which

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:46.690 align:middle line:90%
is 11.2 kilometers per second.

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:48.910 align:middle line:90%
11 plus 2 is 13.

00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:51.380 align:middle line:84%
If you're going through the
Giza Plateau in a Stargate,

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:53.920 align:middle line:84%
it's the 13-code that
you're traveling through.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:55.760 align:middle line:84%
So we come in on
13, we're always

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:58.500 align:middle line:84%
exiting on 13, which
is really important.

00:30:58.500 --> 00:30:59.930 align:middle line:84%
The other point
to mention, which

00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:01.820 align:middle line:84%
is really kind of
mission critical,

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:04.190 align:middle line:84%
is that when you activate
these platonic solids

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:08.120 align:middle line:84%
inside your heart, through these
codes that I was talking about

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:10.760 align:middle line:84%
earlier, inside the
platonic solids,

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:14.000 align:middle line:90%
you have 33 nodal points.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.890 align:middle line:84%
You've got 33 vertebrae
on your spinal column.

00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And around the planet,
there are 33 nodal points.

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:21.800 align:middle line:84%
When you activate
your spinal column

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:24.260 align:middle line:84%
through the platonic
solids in your heart, which

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:26.660 align:middle line:84%
switches from the cube to
the dodecahedral heart,

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:29.570 align:middle line:84%
you connect to
off-planet frequencies

00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:32.120 align:middle line:84%
through the 33 nodal
points around Earth

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:35.320 align:middle line:84%
and you start to pull
in DNA activation codes.

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.850 align:middle line:84%
So these DNA
activation codes, they

00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:40.430 align:middle line:84%
start to recode our
internal mathematics

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:41.900 align:middle line:84%
so that when we
do get off planet

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.760 align:middle line:84%
and we go to these
different systems,

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:47.150 align:middle line:84%
our frequency can
actually handle it.

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:50.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK Thank you.

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.830 align:middle line:90%
So this makes--

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:54.240 align:middle line:84%
I do have a question that
came up during all of that.

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:57.680 align:middle line:84%
I think we were able to
hang with you on the number

00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:59.900 align:middle line:84%
13, the number 8, the
codes, the grid, how

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:02.760 align:middle line:84%
it interfaces with these
what we call sacred sites.

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:05.390 align:middle line:84%
So the question
that I want to ask

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:08.330 align:middle line:84%
is then who built
those pyramids?

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:11.490 align:middle line:84%
Because they're, as you
know, hotly contested.

00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:14.150 align:middle line:84%
Even some archaeologists say
they are at least 100,000 years

00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:14.400 align:middle line:90%
old.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.317 align:middle line:84%
But I'm wondering if the
Lyrans were involved.

00:32:16.317 --> 00:32:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: When
I look at this,

00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:21.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm told that they've been
there for millions of years.

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:22.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:23.772 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Possibly, yes.

00:32:23.772 --> 00:32:25.173 align:middle line:90%
I know it's not 4,000 years old.

00:32:25.173 --> 00:32:27.090 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: Yeah, these
pyramids are ancient.

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:29.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So because of the
results that come out of it

00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:31.520 align:middle line:84%
and because those associations
are what you learn from

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:35.978 align:middle line:84%
your tribe, the Lyrans, were the
Lyrans responsible for at least

00:32:35.978 --> 00:32:37.520 align:middle line:84%
part of the building
out the pyramid?

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.562 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: They definitely
played a part, 100%.

00:32:39.562 --> 00:32:42.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and other species, too.

00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:44.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
because that's--

00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:47.250 align:middle line:84%
we don't usually talk
about that, who built them.

00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:48.760 align:middle line:84%
Because what you're
talking about

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:54.810 align:middle line:84%
is for purpose to allow for
the awakening of people.

00:32:54.810 --> 00:32:57.740 align:middle line:84%
It's been argued that it's
also that they were portals

00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:00.860 align:middle line:84%
for those from other places
to use as a stargate,

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:02.977 align:middle line:84%
also to come and go
from and work from.

00:33:02.977 --> 00:33:04.310 align:middle line:90%
It's all of the above, I assume.

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:06.110 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: If you look
at the Giza Plateau,

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:07.230 align:middle line:90%
you've got the three pyramids.

00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:08.688 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
Orion's Belt, you've

00:33:08.688 --> 00:33:11.220 align:middle line:84%
got the three
activation points there,

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:12.530 align:middle line:90%
which link into the pyramids.

00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:14.870 align:middle line:84%
If you go back to
Lyra, you've also

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:17.060 align:middle line:84%
got three emerald pyramids,
which are actually

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:18.240 align:middle line:90%
really octahedrons.

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:21.230 align:middle line:84%
But they plug into
the Orion's Belt

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:23.570 align:middle line:84%
and they also plug
into the Giza Plateau.

00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:26.720 align:middle line:84%
So these three points are very
important because they all

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:28.920 align:middle line:90%
link into the number 8.

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:31.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So they were
designed for awakening?

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:33.528 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: Well, they were
designed for multi-dimensional

00:33:33.528 --> 00:33:36.560 align:middle line:90%
travel, but they've--

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:39.510 align:middle line:84%
as so many things have happened
over our human history,

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:41.910 align:middle line:84%
there's been so much
manipulation, so much control,

00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:43.940 align:middle line:84%
they've tried to bury
this information from us

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:44.960 align:middle line:90%
on one level.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:49.160 align:middle line:84%
But what is happening
is, we as a species,

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.950 align:middle line:84%
have had these experiences
on a multi-dimensional level

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:55.110 align:middle line:84%
as other extraterrestrials
coming down

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:57.700 align:middle line:84%
to planet Earth
and other systems.

00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And now we're here to
wake ourselves back up.

00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:05.340 align:middle line:84%
So during these times
of Atlantis and Lemuria

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:08.340 align:middle line:84%
and Egypt and all of
these different time

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:12.000 align:middle line:84%
points in space-time on
multiple timelines, going back,

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.679 align:middle line:84%
back to the stars
billions of years

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:16.409 align:middle line:84%
ago, we've been
coming down and trying

00:34:16.409 --> 00:34:18.159 align:middle line:90%
to remember this knowledge.

00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:20.190 align:middle line:84%
But every time we
remember the knowledge

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:22.139 align:middle line:84%
and we activate ourselves
and get ourselves

00:34:22.139 --> 00:34:24.859 align:middle line:84%
into a higher frequency band,
this battle of dark and light

00:34:24.859 --> 00:34:25.659 align:middle line:90%
comes in.

00:34:25.659 --> 00:34:30.167 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So I mean, the ones
who mess with the codes and take

00:34:30.167 --> 00:34:32.250 align:middle line:84%
them off their ideal state,
which we'll talk about

00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:34.500 align:middle line:84%
in a moment here,
the ideal state,

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:35.949 align:middle line:90%
what are they gaining from it?

00:34:35.949 --> 00:34:38.139 align:middle line:90%
And is that game almost over?

00:34:38.139 --> 00:34:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Or is there really going to
be a mass choice on our part

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:42.828 align:middle line:84%
once we're awake enough
to make a good choice?

00:34:42.828 --> 00:34:44.620 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: I think
it's a game of energy.

00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:47.020 align:middle line:90%
We're in a frequency war.

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:49.659 align:middle line:84%
There's a battle for the
right passage of our soul.

00:34:49.659 --> 00:34:52.060 align:middle line:84%
When our soul is
in a human body,

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:55.239 align:middle line:84%
the human body can be
used as a food source.

00:34:55.239 --> 00:34:57.850 align:middle line:84%
When the soul is outside of the
human body and the human body

00:34:57.850 --> 00:35:01.040 align:middle line:84%
decays, that food source
is no longer there anymore.

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:04.240 align:middle line:84%
So there are certain
beings that are using us

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:07.870 align:middle line:84%
to power their own systems,
to feed off our own energy,

00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:10.180 align:middle line:84%
and control us on
so many levels.

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:13.932 align:middle line:84%
And the game itself,
consciousness

00:35:13.932 --> 00:35:16.140 align:middle line:84%
is expanding on planet Earth
and more and more people

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:16.940 align:middle line:90%
are waking up.

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:20.520 align:middle line:84%
But the game, on one
hand, it's already done.

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:23.340 align:middle line:84%
We wrote this story, like this
story is already played out

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:24.720 align:middle line:90%
all the way to the end.

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:26.220 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What's
the end look like?

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:31.540 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: The end to me looks
like planets that are teeming

00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:37.950 align:middle line:84%
with life that have incredible
lakes and waterfalls and beauty

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:40.560 align:middle line:84%
that is just beyond
our wildest dreams.

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.180 align:middle line:84%
You go to some places
on planet Earth

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:43.780 align:middle line:84%
that are absolutely
extraordinary.

00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:46.890 align:middle line:84%
You times that by 100 and
you're still not even there.

00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:51.120 align:middle line:84%
Like where everybody is happy,
everybody is full of joy,

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:53.220 align:middle line:84%
everybody is caring and
sharing, and everybody

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:55.800 align:middle line:90%
works from a hive mentality.

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:57.570 align:middle line:84%
On planet Earth,
there's this kind

00:35:57.570 --> 00:36:04.170 align:middle line:84%
of individualized journey of
individuality, where everybody

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:06.690 align:middle line:90%
is out for themselves.

00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has free
will and free choice.

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And so that enables
us to make choices

00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:12.550 align:middle line:84%
based on what we
want as human beings.

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:14.677 align:middle line:84%
Earth itself is a training
ground and a playground.

00:36:14.677 --> 00:36:16.510 align:middle line:84%
That's a whole other
reason that we're here.

00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And having this
level of free will

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:20.590 align:middle line:84%
makes the game
really interesting.

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:23.280 align:middle line:84%
But when you go to a lot
of these other planets,

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:25.570 align:middle line:84%
there's a hive mentality
like worker bees.

00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:26.740 align:middle line:90%
Bees are amazing.

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:30.720 align:middle line:84%
And what we will be doing
when this heaven on earth,

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:33.910 align:middle line:84%
this golden age reforms and
recalibrates and rebirths itself

00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:35.980 align:middle line:84%
on Earth and on other
planets is we'll

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:38.073 align:middle line:84%
be working like
bees together as one

00:36:38.073 --> 00:36:40.240 align:middle line:84%
and working to help each
other, and love each other.

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Cooperation
and collaboration.

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:42.312 align:middle line:90%
>> SARGEANT: Absolutely.

00:36:42.312 --> 00:36:45.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But a lot of times
when people hear hive mentality,

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:49.060 align:middle line:84%
they think of more negative ET
impacts where you have no will

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:51.700 align:middle line:84%
of your own and you simply
kind do a top-down directive.

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:53.200 align:middle line:84%
But that's not what
you're speaking.

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:54.550 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: Not when you're
working from heart-based

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:56.020 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:58.450 align:middle line:84%
When you're living and playing
this game of the heart,

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:00.250 align:middle line:90%
none of that stuff exists.

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:02.360 align:middle line:90%
It's here in this reality.

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:04.030 align:middle line:84%
When we look at
hive mentality, we

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:07.270 align:middle line:84%
understand it from an
intellectual, like low frequency

00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:08.240 align:middle line:90%
state of consciousness.

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:11.230 align:middle line:84%
When we look at hive mentality
from heart-based consciousness,

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:16.090 align:middle line:84%
we see oneness and
cooperation and love and unity

00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:18.370 align:middle line:84%
and all of the good stuff
that comes along with that.

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:20.540 align:middle line:84%
People helping and
caring and sharing,

00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:23.680 align:middle line:84%
like if I climb up
the ladder, you need

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:25.233 align:middle line:90%
to climb up the ladder with me.

00:37:25.233 --> 00:37:27.400 align:middle line:84%
This world that we live in
and play the game of life

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.380 align:middle line:84%
in at the moment is if I'm
going to climb up the ladder,

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:31.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm prepared to stand on your
head to get up the ladder.

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: For some people, I
believe most people are actually

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:35.480 align:middle line:84%
good and would help
the next person up.

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:37.790 align:middle line:90%
Most people, but not all people.

00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:41.440 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: I think naturally
in our own DNA codes,

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:42.640 align:middle line:90%
that's who we are.

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:45.460 align:middle line:84%
But because of the manipulation
and because of the stuff

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:48.740 align:middle line:84%
that's going on, people tend
to think about themselves a bit

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:49.540 align:middle line:90%
too much.

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:50.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: A bit, yes.

00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:53.560 align:middle line:84%
So you say the mathematical
code, not just of us,

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:56.710 align:middle line:84%
but Earth itself,
was tampered with.

00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:59.500 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: The first time
that I really realized this was

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:01.930 align:middle line:90%
several years ago.

00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:04.540 align:middle line:84%
A young lad from Brazil,
he got in contact with us

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:06.530 align:middle line:84%
and he said, you know,
I need some help.

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:10.288 align:middle line:84%
He said, I woke up this morning
and my head was so much bigger.

00:38:10.288 --> 00:38:11.330 align:middle line:90%
I said, what do you mean?

00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:14.660 align:middle line:84%
He goes, I was meditating
and my head just grew.

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:16.140 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, send me a photo.

00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:17.840 align:middle line:84%
So he sent me a photo
when his head was massive

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:19.715 align:middle line:84%
and the rest of his body
had stayed the same.

00:38:19.715 --> 00:38:22.335 align:middle line:84%
So whenever we go in to
do a healing session,

00:38:22.335 --> 00:38:23.960 align:middle line:84%
I always get a picture
of people's face

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:25.400 align:middle line:84%
so I can see their eyes
because the eyes are

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:26.520 align:middle line:90%
the gateway to the soul.

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.160 align:middle line:84%
So I'm looking into
this guy's eyes

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:30.020 align:middle line:84%
and I'm looking at the
meditation experience

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:31.670 align:middle line:84%
that he'd had,
and he's connected

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:33.290 align:middle line:84%
with some off-planet
frequencies.

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:35.960 align:middle line:84%
And his skull had
gone back to its kind

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:37.880 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrial size.

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:41.150 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I met him on Skype
and he said to me, Jerry,

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:43.220 align:middle line:90%
please help me shrink my skull.

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him,
brother, why did you--

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:45.890 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's a tough one.

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:48.432 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: Because what was
happening is when he was laying

00:38:48.432 --> 00:38:50.810 align:middle line:84%
down, his brain wasn't-- it
didn't grow and it would fall

00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:52.050 align:middle line:90%
on his skull, so it would hurt.

00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And when he was
walking around, it

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:54.960 align:middle line:84%
was rattling so it
was very painful.

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:57.800 align:middle line:84%
I said to him, why don't you
try and grow your skull and so

00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:58.640 align:middle line:90%
your brain.

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Brain,
to fill the skull.

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:01.100 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: Because
I said, you know,

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:02.517 align:middle line:84%
just think what's
going to happen.

00:39:02.517 --> 00:39:05.540 align:middle line:84%
If your brain grows to this size
like you might have all these

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:07.170 align:middle line:84%
multi-dimensional
abilities which--

00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:08.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But he didn't want to
attract the attention, I assume,

00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:09.550 align:middle line:90%
with a massive head.

00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:10.550 align:middle line:90%
>> SARGEANT: Absolutely.

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:12.630 align:middle line:84%
He said, Jerry, look
at me, I look stupid.

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And he did look a bit funny with
a big head on these shoulders.

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:19.293 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I never really try
and convince anyone, but I did.

00:39:19.293 --> 00:39:20.460 align:middle line:90%
But he didn't want to do it.

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:23.270 align:middle line:84%
So I took him underneath
the pyramids in Giza

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:27.020 align:middle line:84%
and we took him through this
kind of futuristic MRI machine

00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:28.740 align:middle line:90%
which scanned his body.

00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And as he went
through it, his skull

00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:32.760 align:middle line:90%
went back to its normal size.

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And I wish I'd videoed
it, but I didn't

00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:37.250 align:middle line:90%
know what was going to happen.

00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:40.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, this feeds back
into the codes of Earth being

00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:41.550 align:middle line:90%
tampered with.

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:43.640 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: So yeah, so
what I realized is that

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:46.070 align:middle line:90%
our mathematical code is wrong.

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:48.440 align:middle line:84%
You've got the
crystalline mathematics

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:50.640 align:middle line:84%
and you've got the
Fibonacci mathematics.

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:52.850 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at the
Fibonacci mathematics,

00:39:52.850 --> 00:39:54.740 align:middle line:84%
they never link back
to the zero point.

00:39:54.740 --> 00:40:00.150 align:middle line:84%
You've got 1 plus 2 is 3; 2
plus 3 is 5; 3 plus 5 is 8.

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:03.290 align:middle line:84%
So to get 8, it
has to eat 5 and 3,

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:05.360 align:middle line:84%
and it's not connected
to the other two numbers.

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:07.590 align:middle line:84%
There's no connection
back to the zero point.

00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:10.070 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the New
Earth mathematics, which

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:15.000 align:middle line:84%
is the crystalline code, you've
got 0 plus 1 and plus 1 is 2.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.970 align:middle line:84%
0 plus 1 plus 1 plus
2 plus equals 4.

00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:20.140 align:middle line:84%
0 plus 1 plus 1 plus
2 plus 4 equals 8.

00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:23.520 align:middle line:84%
So the next number always
links back to the zero point.

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And this mathematical spiral,
which is the Kathara Grid

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:30.120 align:middle line:84%
rotating out from source, which
is the tree of life that we were

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:35.310 align:middle line:84%
previously talking about, it
rotates at a 45-degree spiral.

00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And that 45 degree spiral
is the original mathematics.

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:42.960 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
Fibonacci, "Fib-o-nacci."

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:43.960 align:middle line:90%
What is a fib?

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:45.240 align:middle line:90%
A fib is a lie.

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:46.290 align:middle line:90%
OK, chi is energy.

00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:47.740 align:middle line:90%
It's the lie of no energy.

00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:52.560 align:middle line:84%
So it's the frequency that
dismantles our connection

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:53.900 align:middle line:90%
to the original blueprint.

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:56.517 align:middle line:84%
When you start to
change the code

00:40:56.517 --> 00:40:58.350 align:middle line:84%
and you work with the
new Earth mathematics,

00:40:58.350 --> 00:41:00.040 align:middle line:90%
your whole frequency shifts.

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:02.057 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've seen it
in business so much.

00:41:02.057 --> 00:41:04.140 align:middle line:84%
Like we work with a number
of different businesses

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:06.150 align:middle line:84%
that are running
the old mathematics

00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:08.350 align:middle line:84%
and we come into
their businesses

00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:10.930 align:middle line:84%
and we switch them to
the newer template.

00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Their business goes
through the roof.

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:13.360 align:middle line:90%
They thrive.

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:15.090 align:middle line:84%
They go from earning
X amount of money

00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:17.700 align:middle line:90%
to earning a lot more money.

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:20.590 align:middle line:84%
Their workforce becomes
happier and healthier.

00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:24.870 align:middle line:84%
So you can see this in
so many different ways.

00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:26.375 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Go
ahead, finish that.

00:41:26.375 --> 00:41:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And then I want to have you
tell us what that looks like.

00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:31.733 align:middle line:84%
You go into a company and
they say, here are our books.

00:41:31.733 --> 00:41:34.150 align:middle line:84%
They show you their spreadsheets
and you see the old math.

00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:37.350 align:middle line:84%
I want to know what that looks
like to shift to the new math.

00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:41.350 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: So first of all,
when you go into a business,

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:42.650 align:middle line:90%
like there's so much to it.

00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
kind of stuff that I

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:45.970 align:middle line:84%
love because you
go into a business,

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:48.032 align:middle line:84%
the business is in a
building most of the time.

00:41:48.032 --> 00:41:49.990 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you obviously
get an online business,

00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:51.850 align:middle line:84%
but most of the time
there's a premises.

00:41:51.850 --> 00:41:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And that premises is
built on a piece of land.

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:57.040 align:middle line:84%
That piece of land
has got ley lines

00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:58.400 align:middle line:90%
running under it, grid points.

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:00.820 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, you've got
to go and change the grids.

00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:02.530 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time,
there could have been

00:42:02.530 --> 00:42:03.967 align:middle line:90%
battles fought on that land.

00:42:03.967 --> 00:42:06.050 align:middle line:84%
All sorts of things have
happened and taken place.

00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:06.190 align:middle line:90%
They might--

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:07.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Do you use codes,
mathematical codes to change--

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:09.520 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: We use
codes, absolutely.

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:14.420 align:middle line:84%
So we have codes that are in
the form of images and pictures.

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:17.920 align:middle line:84%
So we can grow those grids,
expand them electromagnetically,

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:20.900 align:middle line:84%
and stick them
underneath the building.

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:23.260 align:middle line:84%
We can plug them into the
walls, the ceiling, all

00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:24.387 align:middle line:90%
of the different rooms.

00:42:24.387 --> 00:42:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And then as soon as you
plug that architecture in,

00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:28.647 align:middle line:84%
it starts to release
a field of energy.

00:42:28.647 --> 00:42:30.730 align:middle line:84%
So that field of energy
moves through the building

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:34.010 align:middle line:84%
and the grid system
restructures around it.

00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:38.410 align:middle line:84%
We then build other pieces of
architecture around the grids.

00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:40.930 align:middle line:84%
So right now, you've got
a six dimensional grid

00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:44.150 align:middle line:84%
structure that's formed around
Earth, which is 111 sites.

00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:46.960 align:middle line:84%
You've got the
Icosahedral grid, which

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:50.110 align:middle line:84%
is the Christ Consciousness
grid or the Christ Consciousness

00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:53.120 align:middle line:90%
grid, which is 20 icosahedrons.

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:55.060 align:middle line:84%
So sorry, 20
equilateral triangles

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:56.710 align:middle line:90%
which make up an icosahedron.

00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:59.690 align:middle line:84%
Around this huge
6-dimensional grid,

00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:04.510 align:middle line:84%
you've got 111 equilateral
triangles which make up the grid

00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:05.310 align:middle line:90%
structure.

00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:07.690 align:middle line:84%
When you start to plug these
grids into the new Earth

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:09.790 align:middle line:84%
mathematics and you run
them through a building,

00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:11.590 align:middle line:84%
and that is the only
frequency running

00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:14.110 align:middle line:84%
through the building,
everybody within the building

00:43:14.110 --> 00:43:15.427 align:middle line:90%
their template changes, too.

00:43:15.427 --> 00:43:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because it feels more
natural to their own personal

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:18.500 align:middle line:90%
matrix?

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:20.708 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: It tunes them
in to the natural rhythms,

00:43:20.708 --> 00:43:24.260 align:middle line:84%
but not the natural rhythms
that most people are running.

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:27.130 align:middle line:84%
Because even if you look
at nature, a lot of nature

00:43:27.130 --> 00:43:29.610 align:middle line:84%
is running off of
false mathematics.

00:43:29.610 --> 00:43:31.480 align:middle line:84%
The way that I
describe it to people,

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:35.920 align:middle line:84%
imagine you are some
huge being and you

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.420 align:middle line:84%
wanted to control
a planet and there

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:39.470 align:middle line:90%
was a huge galactic Amazon.

00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:41.620 align:middle line:84%
So you'd go to this
galactic Amazon

00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:44.350 align:middle line:84%
and you bought like
a mold of a planet.

00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And this mold of this planet,
you tipped loads of energy

00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:48.010 align:middle line:90%
into it.

00:43:48.010 --> 00:43:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And it was running off
a certain template.

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:52.630 align:middle line:90%
That's what's happened to Earth.

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:56.830 align:middle line:84%
So what we do is we go in and
we create new structures which

00:43:56.830 --> 00:43:59.830 align:middle line:84%
are running off other templates
and other mathematics,

00:43:59.830 --> 00:44:01.990 align:middle line:84%
and it changes the
frequency in the field,

00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:05.080 align:middle line:84%
and it changes them back to
their original template, which

00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:08.110 align:middle line:84%
is the Kathara Grid template,
the crystalline mathematical

00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:10.630 align:middle line:84%
template, which locks
them into the zero-point.

00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:13.330 align:middle line:84%
Because if you run on the
geometries that a lot of people

00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:15.040 align:middle line:84%
are running on planet
Earth, then you're

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:18.280 align:middle line:84%
running off a false code which
ultimately is never going

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:19.413 align:middle line:90%
to connect you into source.

00:44:19.413 --> 00:44:21.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's
what you're doing,

00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:22.870 align:middle line:84%
that's what you do
with your school,

00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:25.030 align:middle line:90%
is you're teaching people.

00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:27.490 align:middle line:84%
You work with people,
I take directly,

00:44:27.490 --> 00:44:29.657 align:middle line:84%
but you also teach people
how to do this themselves.

00:44:29.657 --> 00:44:31.823 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: So we're in
the process now of building

00:44:31.823 --> 00:44:33.350 align:middle line:84%
our first healing
center in Romania.

00:44:33.350 --> 00:44:34.450 align:middle line:90%
In Transylvania, yeah.

00:44:34.450 --> 00:44:37.840 align:middle line:84%
So when Derek came
to see me, the Lyran,

00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:40.240 align:middle line:84%
and I was looking out over
the town in Gloucestershire,

00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:42.350 align:middle line:84%
and I saw the 13
healing centers,

00:44:42.350 --> 00:44:44.540 align:middle line:84%
he told me that we
needed to train people.

00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:46.792 align:middle line:84%
I ran home and wrote a book
called "Healing With Light

00:44:46.792 --> 00:44:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Frequencies: The Transformative
Power of Star Magic,"

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.270 align:middle line:90%
because he told me to.

00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:53.590 align:middle line:84%
And then that book has all
of the tools that we share

00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:54.980 align:middle line:90%
with people on our trainings.

00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:57.040 align:middle line:84%
The trainings have now
evolved and expanded

00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:58.790 align:middle line:90%
into level 1, level 2, level 3.

00:44:58.790 --> 00:45:02.710 align:middle line:10%
But we're training people how to
restructure people's blueprints

00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:06.190 align:middle line:10%
so that they can become
empowered, high-frequency beings

00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:09.160 align:middle line:10%
that are plugged into source,
into those original blueprints

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:11.060 align:middle line:10%
so that they can emit that code.

00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:13.630 align:middle line:84%
Because everywhere we go,
we're uploading and downloading

00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:14.570 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:45:14.570 --> 00:45:15.670 align:middle line:10%
And when you walk
through town, there's

00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:17.600 align:middle line:10%
information coming
in from other humans.

00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:19.330 align:middle line:10%
You're sending it
off to other humans.

00:45:19.330 --> 00:45:21.727 align:middle line:10%
It's going down through
your body, into the grids.

00:45:21.727 --> 00:45:23.060 align:middle line:90%
It's coming down from the stars.

00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:24.890 align:middle line:90%
It's moving in all directions.

00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:27.280 align:middle line:84%
So when you're running
the crystalline codes,

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:30.230 align:middle line:84%
you're literally having a
positive impact on humanity.

00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:32.470 align:middle line:84%
So the more people we can
train and recode this way,

00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:34.370 align:middle line:84%
the better it's going
to be for everybody.

00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:36.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, I think you're
going to have a lot of excited

00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:39.040 align:middle line:84%
people, certainly after watching
you here and everywhere else you

00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:40.080 align:middle line:90%
appear.

00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:44.348 align:middle line:84%
You obviously embody those
codes that connect you

00:45:44.348 --> 00:45:46.140 align:middle line:84%
back with where you
came from to begin with

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:49.540 align:middle line:84%
and why you're here now on Earth
to help others understand that.

00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And yes, it is a geometrical
mathematic matrix

00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:55.060 align:middle line:84%
that we live in, and so we might
as well have the numbers right.

00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:56.310 align:middle line:10%
>> SARGEANT: Absolutely.

00:45:56.310 --> 00:45:57.250 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:45:57.250 --> 00:45:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And being that
frequency of love.

00:45:59.270 --> 00:46:00.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:01.210 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's wonderful.

00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:02.210 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you so much.

00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:03.580 align:middle line:90%
What a wonderful story.

00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:06.750 align:middle line:84%
I've been absolutely
fascinated listening to you,

00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:09.480 align:middle line:84%
even if sometimes the numbers
are swirling around in my head

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:11.640 align:middle line:84%
like an alphabet
soup of some kind,

00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:13.600 align:middle line:90%
I can feel what you're saying.

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:16.240 align:middle line:90%
So good luck with all of this.

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:19.180 align:middle line:84%
Your journey and new shows
coming up and everything else.

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:20.620 align:middle line:84%
>> SARGEANT: Thank you so
much for having me, Regina.

00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:21.420 align:middle line:90%
It's been awesome.

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:22.563 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:46:22.563 --> 00:46:24.230 align:middle line:84%
