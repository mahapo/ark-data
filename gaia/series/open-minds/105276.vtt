00:00:29.264 --> 00:00:30.680 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Some of you may

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.020 align:middle line:10%
have already read the
magnificent work of Joan Grant.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.210 align:middle line:84%
Endowed with an impeccable
memory of the distant past,

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.770 align:middle line:84%
she's helped mystics and
seekers of all backgrounds

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.750 align:middle line:84%
understand the nature
of life in times past.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.220 align:middle line:84%
Joan died in 1989, but
her friend, granddaughter,

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.880 align:middle line:84%
and regression associate are
carrying her work forward today

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.590 align:middle line:84%
to the delight of
myself and many others.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.490 align:middle line:84%
Jane Lahr is with
us today to tell us

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.770 align:middle line:84%
of a magnificent
account of far memory,

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.920 align:middle line:84%
and you and I are
in agreement here,

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.820 align:middle line:84%
Jane, neither one of us,
with all our exposure,

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.320 align:middle line:84%
have ever heard of
someone with the kind

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.070 align:middle line:90%
of vision this woman had.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And I know some of the
people I have the most

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.780 align:middle line:84%
respect for on this planet,
living and not living,

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.280 align:middle line:84%
have very high degrees
of respect for Joan.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.320 align:middle line:90%
So she's right at the top.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.500 align:middle line:10%
>>JANE LAHR: Yes, Joan
was the real deal,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:27.000 align:middle line:10%
and she was born in 1907,
and she was born with

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.360 align:middle line:10%
'far memory,' what she
called far memory--

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.020 align:middle line:10%
the ability to recall
previous incarnations--

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.900 align:middle line:10%
and went on to write seven
autobiographies of her earlier

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.124 align:middle line:10%
incarnations.

00:01:39.124 --> 00:01:40.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the
thing is, not everyone

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.957 align:middle line:84%
knew they were autobiographies
initially, right?

00:01:42.957 --> 00:01:43.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LAHR: Right.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because she
couched it as fiction.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Well, they were--
I guess, growing up

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.640 align:middle line:84%
in England in a very
conservative time-- she was

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.550 align:middle line:84%
born into the Edwardian
era-- just to come out

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.100 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, I was a
pharaoh in Egypt in 3000

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.163 align:middle line:90%
BC would not have gone very far.

00:02:06.163 --> 00:02:07.121 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I know.

00:02:07.121 --> 00:02:07.662 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:02:07.662 --> 00:02:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: So for 20
years she did not

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.770 align:middle line:84%
own the fact that they were
far memories of her own,

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.290 align:middle line:84%
and people thought she
was a great Egyptologist.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.090 align:middle line:84%
They thought she was
a great historian.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, well,
understandably,

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.060 align:middle line:84%
because the detail in which she
remembered-- that's just what

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.950 align:middle line:90%
fascinates me about her work.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.650 align:middle line:84%
How else in the world
can we grock what

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.900 align:middle line:90%
life was like in those times?

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk
about a lot of this,

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.920 align:middle line:84%
including later on, systems
of justice even-- what

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.710 align:middle line:84%
the systems of justice
were like, what

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.820 align:middle line:84%
the lifestyle was like,
the behavior of people,

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.140 align:middle line:90%
relationships.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.700 align:middle line:84%
She recalls all of it
right down to the cup

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.400 align:middle line:90%
she's holding in her hand.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Right, she
wrote "Winged Pharaoh"

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:59.020 align:middle line:84%
when she was with her first
husband Leslie Bennett,

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:05.770 align:middle line:84%
and he recorded 115 sessions
when she'd switch levels.

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.380 align:middle line:84%
She called them "hoves," and
then they pieced them together.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:17.520 align:middle line:84%
They were clearly the story
of Sekeeta, who was trained.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.660 align:middle line:84%
Her mother recognized
her at a young age

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.900 align:middle line:84%
to have the potential
to be a priestess, who

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.680 align:middle line:84%
was trained to be a
"winged pharaoh," meaning

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.834 align:middle line:84%
you could work outside of
your body on an astral plane.

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:31.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which she
brought all through-- this

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.060 align:middle line:90%
is what's fascinating.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.940 align:middle line:84%
She brought that skill set
down through incarnations

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.170 align:middle line:84%
and into this incarnation--
that capability--

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.087 align:middle line:84%
to give the rest of us a glimpse
of not just what life was like,

00:03:45.087 --> 00:03:46.670 align:middle line:84%
but the understanding
of human beings,

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.030 align:middle line:84%
what our capabilities
even were in the past.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Well, what's
extraordinary about Joan

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.410 align:middle line:84%
is she was, in terms of
Western esoteric history,

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.734 align:middle line:90%
she remembers it all virtually.

00:03:57.734 --> 00:03:59.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She
remembers all of it.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.500 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LAHR: She had recorded it all.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, "Pharaoh," what
I was so drawn to in that book,

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.780 align:middle line:84%
in "Winged Pharaoh,"
is that the schooling

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.730 align:middle line:84%
to be a winged pharaoh--
she went into the temple.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And the temples
were universities

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.029 align:middle line:84%
where you learned
psychometry, where

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:22.000 align:middle line:84%
you learned astral projection,
where you learned ethics, where

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.440 align:middle line:84%
you learned actually body work,
because the Egyptians cared

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.460 align:middle line:84%
about dancing, in
other words, to honor

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.010 align:middle line:84%
the body as the
vessel of the soul.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.810 align:middle line:84%
So you had to honor
the body as well.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.630 align:middle line:84%
But she had a teacher who
taught her dream work, really,

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:39.930 align:middle line:90%
working outside the body.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was considered,
at the time, a real education

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.866 align:middle line:84%
and would certainly
serve us now.

00:04:44.866 --> 00:04:47.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what's
being crammed down

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.980 align:middle line:84%
these little kids into their
little heads is so nonsensical

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.160 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.370 align:middle line:84%
In my mind, that was
considered a proper education.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.100 align:middle line:84%
Now we have to go
way out of our way

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.940 align:middle line:84%
into ancient
esoteric studies just

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.370 align:middle line:84%
to get a glimpse of what was
taught very naturally in those

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.990 align:middle line:84%
kinds of universities slash--
those were temples and schools,

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.520 align:middle line:84%
and I have past
life spec in there,

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.450 align:middle line:84%
where I remember with
that training was like.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Right, and
it was-- she had

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.500 align:middle line:90%
a brother in that incarnation.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.210 align:middle line:84%
They were being trained
to be pharaoh together.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.700 align:middle line:84%
They were co-pharaoh, and
you wanted a winged pharaoh

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.790 align:middle line:84%
in terms of justice, when
people come with complaining--

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.780 align:middle line:90%
he stole my cow.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:35.170 align:middle line:84%
He's run off with my wife--
to see the truth because Joan

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:39.300 align:middle line:84%
was taught in the temples,
these universities,

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.640 align:middle line:90%
to see and identify the truth.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So someone comes into
your-- it was not a courtroom,

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:52.040 align:middle line:84%
but at the place where they had
to essentially judge the town's

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.710 align:middle line:90%
folk for their behavior.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.750 align:middle line:84%
She was able to go and do
a little astral travel,

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.810 align:middle line:84%
look into the situation
that had actually occurred.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.370 align:middle line:84%
So if the person was going
to show up with a whopper,

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:06.940 align:middle line:90%
she could say beyond it.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.189 align:middle line:84%
She could see beyond it and say,
no, this is not what occurred.

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:11.980 align:middle line:84%
And that is how it
should be, shouldn't it?

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
all striving toward.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.104 align:middle line:84%
And before we go into the
bulk of the "Winged Pharaoh,"

00:06:17.104 --> 00:06:19.520 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to have two
conversations, because we have

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.730 align:middle line:84%
a lot to cover, I really
want to go into Joan's life

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.240 align:middle line:84%
so people understand how
profound a little being

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.460 align:middle line:84%
she was and really start in her
life with the book "Far Memory"

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.450 align:middle line:84%
and also the one that you've
published and written.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.110 align:middle line:84%
Did you co-author the book
"Speaking From the Heart?"

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Well, right,
Sophia, her best friend,

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.540 align:middle line:84%
they shared a number of
incarnations together,

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.040 align:middle line:84%
and Nicky, her granddaughter, we
edited her unpublished writings

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.960 align:middle line:84%
that had obviously never
seen the light of day.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.290 align:middle line:84%
It took Sophia and I, I
think, close to 10 years

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.960 align:middle line:84%
to decipher Joan's
writing, and then

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.745 align:middle line:84%
Overlook Press published it,
and it's a beautiful book.

00:07:01.745 --> 00:07:03.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It is, and between
that and "Far Memory,"

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:06.010 align:middle line:84%
there are some similar
stories, depending

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:07.660 align:middle line:90%
on what she chose to share.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.470 align:middle line:84%
You can really piece together
who she was in this age,

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:12.830 align:middle line:90%
in this lifetime.

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.880 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about her
when she was first born,

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.130 align:middle line:84%
because I was intrigued with
some of the stories about

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:18.354 align:middle line:90%
as a baby in a crib.

00:07:18.354 --> 00:07:19.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Right, her
father, who was

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:23.530 align:middle line:84%
an atheist and a very
well educated scientist--

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.460 align:middle line:84%
I forget if it was
Cambridge or Oxford--

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:31.870 align:middle line:84%
and he had four degrees--
Joan said, well,

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.390 align:middle line:84%
I remember what it was like
when I was a baby, and he said,

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:35.570 align:middle line:90%
it's not possible.

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And then she proceeded to
describe exactly the room

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.450 align:middle line:84%
she was in, the wallpaper
on the room, what

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.540 align:middle line:84%
was going on at the
time in the cottage,

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:46.570 align:middle line:84%
and he actually
went to the cottage,

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.400 align:middle line:84%
and everything that
she said was there.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.256 align:middle line:84%
And then he started--
someone else

00:07:51.256 --> 00:07:52.380 align:middle line:90%
was living in this cottage.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.690 align:middle line:84%
He starts tearing
the wallpaper off.

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:55.606 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Peeled some
of the wallpaper layers.

00:07:55.606 --> 00:07:57.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Yes, and indeed
it was the wallpaper

00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.760 align:middle line:90%
she had described.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:04.380 align:middle line:84%
But she also, as a
young girl at seven,

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:08.510 align:middle line:84%
there was a gentleman
having dinner with them,--

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:12.730 align:middle line:84%
formally dinner with
them-- and he was a doctor.

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And she looked at him,
and she realized he

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:16.750 align:middle line:90%
was going to die the next day.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:17.916 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love this story.

00:08:17.916 --> 00:08:19.550 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I love this story.

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:21.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: And this
was not an old man.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.960 align:middle line:84%
He was 55, and she looked
up, and he was going to die.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.920 align:middle line:84%
She said, oh, you
must be very excited.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:29.570 align:middle line:90%
Tomorrow--

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:30.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --is your birthday.

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:31.514 align:middle line:90%
>>LAHR: It's your birthday.

00:08:31.514 --> 00:08:38.289 align:middle line:84%
And Blanche, Joan's mother,
said, "Joan, his birthday's

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:39.620 align:middle line:90%
a month from now."

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And Joan said, "No, I
mean like the day you die,

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:45.245 align:middle line:90%
in which you die."

00:08:45.245 --> 00:08:47.036 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She considered
that all the same.

00:08:47.036 --> 00:08:49.510 align:middle line:84%
It was seamless--
birthdays, death days

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:51.135 align:middle line:84%
were a birth into
different dimensions.

00:08:51.135 --> 00:08:53.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Well, yes,
but she said, this

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:54.570 align:middle line:84%
will be like your
happiest birthday,

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:57.970 align:middle line:84%
because she believed
that he would be reunited

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:01.360 align:middle line:84%
with the souls that
are waiting for him

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.950 align:middle line:84%
and that it would be, she called
it, the "beautiful country."

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.707 align:middle line:84%
To be dead was to go to
the beautiful country.

00:09:07.707 --> 00:09:09.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, her mother
was very angry with her

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:13.570 align:middle line:84%
for doing this and chastised
her after this event was over.

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, the
man died the next day.

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: That's right, and then
her mother was angry at her

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:20.980 align:middle line:90%
all over again.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:24.930 align:middle line:84%
But Blanche had been actually,
who was a great beauty,

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:29.380 align:middle line:84%
had been a very popular
clairvoyant and psychic

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:34.380 align:middle line:84%
in her own right,
and she had friends

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:40.590 align:middle line:84%
from Oxford and Cambridge
and this very handsome John

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:42.630 align:middle line:90%
Marshall married her.

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:45.200 align:middle line:90%


00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.700 align:middle line:90%
But she was a great clairvoyant.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.189 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he
was a scientist.

00:09:48.189 --> 00:09:49.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LAHR: And he was a scientist.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.100 align:middle line:84%
When she saw the
"Titanic," by the way,

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:56.126 align:middle line:84%
she said, that boat
is going to sink.

00:09:56.126 --> 00:09:57.250 align:middle line:90%
That boat is going to sink.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:00.130 align:middle line:84%
It had gone by their
house on Hayling Island.

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And indeed the
next day the boat--

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --when it
got out to sea, yeah.

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:08.962 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: And the other
time she did this,

00:10:08.962 --> 00:10:10.170 align:middle line:90%
they were supposed to return.

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:11.711 align:middle line:84%
They'd been in
America, and they were

00:10:11.711 --> 00:10:13.980 align:middle line:84%
supposed to go back to
England on the Lusitania.

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: And she said, "We
can't go back tomorrow.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.280 align:middle line:90%
That boat is going to sink.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.850 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be torpedoed.

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:23.320 align:middle line:90%
We're not going."

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:26.509 align:middle line:84%
And her husband went quite
crazy, and he said, "Well,

00:10:26.509 --> 00:10:27.550 align:middle line:90%
what about the next day?"

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:29.130 align:middle line:90%
And she said, "No, that's fine.

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:30.529 align:middle line:90%
That's fine."

00:10:30.529 --> 00:10:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and
that was Blanche.

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:35.107 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Yes,
Blanche, the mother.

00:10:35.107 --> 00:10:35.690 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'm sorry.

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:38.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking too much about
Blanche, but what I'm saying

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:42.180 align:middle line:84%
is that she came into a family
with a mother who had very

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:46.010 align:middle line:90%
psychic and clairvoyant gifts.

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And Joan saw ghosts as solid,
and when she came in-- often

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:55.190 align:middle line:84%
we talk about ghosts being
diaphanous or luminous.

00:10:55.190 --> 00:11:00.790 align:middle line:84%
She saw them as completely solid
and grew up in an Edwardian

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:04.299 align:middle line:84%
household in which she thought
everyone else must have seen

00:11:04.299 --> 00:11:06.840 align:middle line:84%
them; they just didn't want to
talk about them because it was

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.990 align:middle line:90%
impolite, so she didn't.

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:11.520 align:middle line:84%
But they were solid
ghosts, and all her life

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.250 align:middle line:90%
she saw ghosts as solid.

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:17.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And she had kind of
an amazing, you can call them,

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.230 align:middle line:90%
synchronicities.

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:20.680 align:middle line:84%
We know they're there's
something beyond that,

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.490 align:middle line:84%
but she had amazing
synchronicities

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:24.980 align:middle line:84%
happening throughout her
life, as she grew up.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:27.800 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit about her
teenage years and the decision

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.550 align:middle line:84%
she made about school
and all of that.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Well, she
was very bright.

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:38.540 align:middle line:84%
She was very good
mathematically,

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.850 align:middle line:90%
very good with science.

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:44.360 align:middle line:84%
But she had a lovely
nanny that was fired,

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.690 align:middle line:84%
and she decided,
that's it; I'm not

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:50.455 align:middle line:84%
going to go to serious
school and study seriously

00:11:50.455 --> 00:11:51.750 align:middle line:90%
and what have you.

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, it wasn't until
much later-- the family were

00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:00.090 align:middle line:90%
very friendly with HG Wells.

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:03.260 align:middle line:84%
Lots of very famous
people visited the house.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And one day, he came to the
house to see the family,

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.800 align:middle line:90%
but Joan was there alone.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.680 align:middle line:84%
She had the opportunity
to speak to him,

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:16.980 align:middle line:84%
and she told him
about her memories

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.470 align:middle line:84%
of going to the battlefield
during the first World War

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:24.500 align:middle line:84%
and helping soldiers transition
over to the beautiful country.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And he said to her, "Joan,
I want you to write.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:32.780 align:middle line:90%
I want you to write."

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "And don't
share this knowledge

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:39.060 align:middle line:84%
until you know you're
strong enough not

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:42.020 align:middle line:84%
to resist the
laughter of fools."

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:43.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, to
crack under that.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.769 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Yes, to crack under
that, which is indeed what

00:12:45.769 --> 00:12:47.960 align:middle line:84%
she did, and probably,
when she decided

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:52.245 align:middle line:84%
to talk about these earlier
historical novels as far

00:12:52.245 --> 00:12:56.149 align:middle line:84%
memory books was when
she was ready to do that.

00:12:56.149 --> 00:12:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's
talk about-- this

00:12:57.690 --> 00:12:59.650 align:middle line:84%
was something-- it's
along this line,

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:01.370 align:middle line:84%
but I just thought it was
such a quirky little story.

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:02.953 align:middle line:84%
You were telling me
this when we spoke

00:13:02.953 --> 00:13:04.420 align:middle line:84%
on the phone before
your arriving

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:07.970 align:middle line:84%
here about someone that she
was doing business with,

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:10.580 align:middle line:84%
a woman who she was
talking to, and the woman

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:12.269 align:middle line:90%
was slicing this grapefruit.

00:13:12.269 --> 00:13:13.060 align:middle line:90%
Tell us that story.

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.030 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:15.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LAHR: Actually, it was Sophia.

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:17.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, it was
Sophia, her friend.

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:20.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: It was used just
when she met Sophia.

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:27.680 align:middle line:84%
Sophia was introduced to Joan,
and Joan was staying near her

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:32.650 align:middle line:84%
in Manhattan at the
[INAUDIBLE], and she

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:35.070 align:middle line:90%
called Sophia on the phone.

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:38.780 align:middle line:84%
She called Sophia, and Sophia
was trying to cut a grapefruit.

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:40.510 align:middle line:84%
Sophia got on the
phone with Joan,

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:43.480 align:middle line:84%
and Joan said, "I'd like to drop
off a manuscript to show you."

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.720 align:middle line:84%
So, Sophia was thrilled
because she had

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.910 align:middle line:90%
an affinity-- she liked Joan.

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:51.850 align:middle line:84%
She said, "Oh, please, I
would love to read it."

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
the conversation--

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:56.090 align:middle line:84%
they talked for awhile, and she
said, "And, by the way, Sophia,

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:59.745 align:middle line:84%
when I come, I'll teach you how
to cut a grapefruit." [LAUGHS]

00:13:59.745 --> 00:14:01.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] So
she was out traveling--

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:03.890 align:middle line:84%
she was traveling over to
her during the conversation.

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:04.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LAHR: That's right.

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:05.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What a useful skill.

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:07.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it is something
that is our birthright,

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.699 align:middle line:84%
but not very many of us have
recaptured that ability.

00:14:09.699 --> 00:14:11.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Right, now,
one of the things

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.410 align:middle line:84%
that I can tell
you about Sophia is

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:15.980 align:middle line:84%
that, in fact,
Joan had recognized

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.330 align:middle line:90%
Sophia when they met.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.540 align:middle line:84%
One of Joan's books called
"And so Moses was Born"

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:28.510 align:middle line:84%
--Neb was one of the
possibly pharaoh was--

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:33.940 align:middle line:84%
but rather than Ramoses
II, but said he, one,

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:37.700 align:middle line:84%
decided that Neb should be with
[? Sensen. ?] They loved one

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.920 align:middle line:84%
another, [? Sensen ?]
and Neb, and in fact,

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:44.730 align:middle line:84%
Sophia was [? Sensen. ?]
So they recognized--

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:48.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Joan recognized
this bond went way back.

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about some
of the other things that

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.540 align:middle line:84%
were happening in
her lifetime, too,

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:55.150 align:middle line:84%
such as when she
would play the piano.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:59.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: OK, well, again, Sophia
comes in here because Sophia

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.145 align:middle line:90%
was also Jenny Marshall.

00:15:01.145 --> 00:15:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
talk about that.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LAHR: And you will see that--

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.945 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So explain
who Jenny Marshall

00:15:04.945 --> 00:15:07.880 align:middle line:84%
is and explain about this piano
thing and other people who

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.230 align:middle line:90%
had witnessed it.

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:13.715 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: So Jenny Marshall
was John's mother.

00:15:13.715 --> 00:15:14.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So her grandmother.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.315 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Grandmother--
and she was

00:15:16.315 --> 00:15:19.070 align:middle line:84%
married to a very
wealthy man who

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:22.540 align:middle line:84%
was the head of Marshall's
Department Stores in England,

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:26.750 align:middle line:84%
and sadly, she was
a great pianist,

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:29.840 align:middle line:84%
and he did not
allow Jenny to play,

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.920 align:middle line:84%
and then she ultimately
died of cancer.

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:37.010 align:middle line:84%
After she died, she came
back and visited Joan

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:41.995 align:middle line:84%
at Hayling, which is their
house in Cornwall on the sea.

00:15:41.995 --> 00:15:44.750 align:middle line:90%


00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:50.330 align:middle line:84%
And Joan and Jenny spoke,
and Jenny taught Joan

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:51.710 align:middle line:90%
how to play the piano basically.

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:52.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In nonphysical form.

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:57.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Exactly,
exactly, and indeed

00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:01.300 align:middle line:84%
one day there was someone who
had known Jenny and known what

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:04.110 align:middle line:84%
she'd played, and Joan
went over to the piano

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:08.437 align:middle line:84%
and played a work of art
that Jenny had composed,

00:16:08.437 --> 00:16:09.770 align:middle line:90%
a piece that Jenny had composed.

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And the man said,
it's not possible.

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:14.290 align:middle line:84%
That piece has
never been played.

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:15.050 align:middle line:90%
How could it be?

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And it was because
Joan had been taught

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.954 align:middle line:90%
by Jenny to play this piece.

00:16:18.954 --> 00:16:21.495 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She was tapped in on
just so many different levels.

00:16:21.495 --> 00:16:24.110 align:middle line:90%


00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:25.760 align:middle line:84%
People that are
interested in her life

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.650 align:middle line:84%
need to read either "Speaking
From the Heart" or "Far Memory"

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:30.390 align:middle line:84%
or both of them
because we can kind

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:33.300 align:middle line:84%
of randomly kind of
hopscotch through her life.

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:34.650 align:middle line:90%
Everything about it was amazing.

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:38.060 align:middle line:84%
She was just a very commanding
and quirky presence.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:41.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Although she didn't
believe in astrology,

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:45.010 align:middle line:84%
she was an Aries, and she
was bold, and she said it.

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:46.440 align:middle line:90%
She spoke the truth.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And I think I was drawn
to her books and to her

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:53.700 align:middle line:84%
because the truth comes
through all of them.

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.840 align:middle line:84%
There's wisdom and
truth in all of them.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:01.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there's this,
kind of from different points

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:03.800 align:middle line:84%
of view, rendering
of what we would

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.250 align:middle line:90%
consider to be natural justice.

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:10.876 align:middle line:84%
This is really big-- the notion
that this is a just universe.

00:17:10.876 --> 00:17:11.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LAHR: That's right.

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:14.166 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, that keeps
coming through in all the works,

00:17:14.166 --> 00:17:17.970 align:middle line:84%
and it seems to me that she
spent many lifetimes in service

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:23.390 align:middle line:84%
to humanity to help the
populace understand the nature

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:25.300 align:middle line:90%
of true organic justice.

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:33.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Right, exactly, and,
again, going back to "Pharaoh,"

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:36.470 align:middle line:84%
there is something
ultimately just

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:39.020 align:middle line:84%
about a system of
government where

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:44.320 align:middle line:84%
the balance is with a
priestess and a ruler who

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.795 align:middle line:84%
can protect the
country and go to war

00:17:46.795 --> 00:17:47.880 align:middle line:90%
and whatever he has to do.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:51.270 align:middle line:90%


00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:55.257 align:middle line:84%
And again, the honoring,
when-- years ago, I did a book,

00:17:55.257 --> 00:17:56.965 align:middle line:84%
an anthology called
"Love-- a Celebration

00:17:56.965 --> 00:17:58.340 align:middle line:90%
in Art and Literature."

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:00.190 align:middle line:84%
When I was researching
it, I realized

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:06.480 align:middle line:84%
Old Kingdom sculptures-- the
period of "Winged Pharaoh--"

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:09.410 align:middle line:84%
the woman was of
equal size to the men.

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:11.870 align:middle line:84%
They would stand
side by side, pharaoh

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:15.570 align:middle line:84%
and the wife of pharaoh, and
there was a balance there.

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:16.720 align:middle line:90%
So that shifted.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:20.740 align:middle line:84%
That balance shifted by the
time you get to Middle Kingdom

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:21.940 align:middle line:90%
Egyptian history.

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:24.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:25.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LAHR: This is off point.

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:26.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it's not at all.

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:28.450 align:middle line:84%
Nothing you're
saying is off point.

00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:30.840 align:middle line:84%
I want to gobble all
of it up, so you can go

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.470 align:middle line:90%
tangential any time you want.

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:36.000 align:middle line:84%
So now I want to talk a little
bit about her methodology,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.686 align:middle line:84%
the way she was able to go
into these deep memories.

00:18:41.686 --> 00:18:43.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: I mean they
started very early.

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:46.020 align:middle line:90%
Again, she always had them.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:51.980 align:middle line:84%
But when she worked
with someone--

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:55.910 align:middle line:84%
she was taught,
again-- one thing,

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:59.780 align:middle line:84%
when you're trained to be
a priestess, an initiate,

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:03.060 align:middle line:84%
a winged pharaoh, you
learn to regress and recall

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:04.460 align:middle line:90%
your memories.

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:07.950 align:middle line:84%
But the second step, and they
called it the "golden key,"

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:13.640 align:middle line:84%
is you learn to recall another's
memories because the wisdom is

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:14.540 align:middle line:90%
the overlap.

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:17.280 align:middle line:84%
So she could-- and
had the ability

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:23.780 align:middle line:84%
to go to, if she's working with
someone-- the traumatic moment

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:25.510 align:middle line:90%
and see it.

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:29.480 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the individuals can't
really see the whole truth.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.720 align:middle line:84%
There's a very interesting
incident that happened,

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.460 align:middle line:84%
which I'm happy
to tell you about.

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:37.350 align:middle line:84%
She was in Wales with
her second husband,

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:40.860 align:middle line:84%
and they had a house Trelyden
during the Second World War,

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:44.660 align:middle line:84%
and they use the house to
protect children as well

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:46.762 align:middle line:84%
as adults who needed
to get out of London,

00:19:46.762 --> 00:19:47.720 align:middle line:90%
which was being bombed.

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.300 align:middle line:90%


00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:55.970 align:middle line:84%
A psychiatrist actually
came to stay with them,

00:19:55.970 --> 00:20:00.420 align:middle line:84%
and his name was Clarkson,
I believe, Alec Clarkson.

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:02.270 align:middle line:84%
He was interested
in reincarnation

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:05.270 align:middle line:84%
because he'd worked
with hypnosis,

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:07.220 align:middle line:84%
and some of his
clients had shifted

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:12.070 align:middle line:84%
into earlier regressions, and
he'd read some of Joan's books.

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:15.210 align:middle line:84%
He came to the house, and
they had a lovely time,

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:18.590 align:middle line:84%
but nothing too profound
about reincarnation occurred.

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And as he was
leaving-- you couldn't

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:27.090 align:middle line:84%
get meat or birds or
eggs during the war.

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:27.850 align:middle line:90%
It was very hard.

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:30.200 align:middle line:90%
Provisions were very low.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:35.170 align:middle line:84%
They handed him a
brace of pheasants,

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:38.310 align:middle line:84%
and they were tied
by the neck, and he

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:40.810 align:middle line:84%
said, "If you could
wrap it up please.

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:42.770 align:middle line:90%
I can't take it in this form."

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:48.930 align:middle line:84%
So she looked at
him, and she said,

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:51.090 align:middle line:90%
"You and I had a similar death.

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:54.700 align:middle line:84%
You were cut down on
a field in a battle,

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.260 align:middle line:84%
and as you were
dying, the vultures

00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:00.310 align:middle line:84%
started circling
you-- six of them.

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And you could smell them,
and they would come closer,

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:08.450 align:middle line:84%
and you were waving your arms,
and they would move back.

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And finally, they
came closer, and they

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.530 align:middle line:90%
started to take your flesh.

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:16.020 align:middle line:90%
Ultimately, you died."

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:20.530 align:middle line:84%
But then, she said,
"But you were enraged

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:26.120 align:middle line:84%
that none of the other
soldiers hadn't killed you.

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Because they knew
you were dying.

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:30.460 align:middle line:84%
They were supposed
to kill you, and you

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:32.720 align:middle line:90%
were angry at those soldiers."

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And it was that anger,
the energy of the anger,

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:39.420 align:middle line:84%
as well as the death
that caused him

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:42.290 align:middle line:84%
to be locked into
this fear of feathers

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:44.870 align:middle line:90%
that he'd had his whole life.

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:47.680 align:middle line:90%
He collapsed on the sofa.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:50.520 align:middle line:84%
He started recalling
the regression.

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.490 align:middle line:90%
They put him upstairs to bed.

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:54.410 align:middle line:84%
He asked Joan to stay
with him all night.

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:56.320 align:middle line:90%
They worked on it.

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.060 align:middle line:84%
He went to sleep and
slept until 12:00.

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:02.890 align:middle line:84%
He woke up, and
he was completely

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:06.820 align:middle line:84%
cleared of this terrible
problem he'd had his whole life.

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:10.670 align:middle line:84%
They handed him
the brace of birds,

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:15.130 align:middle line:84%
he took them back on the train,
and he remembered writing Joan,

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:17.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure everyone on the train
sitting in his compartment

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:20.320 align:middle line:84%
thought he was mad because he
would take them off the shelf

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:24.131 align:middle line:84%
and pet them on the
trip back to London.

00:22:24.131 --> 00:22:25.714 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it
just goes to show you

00:22:25.714 --> 00:22:27.505 align:middle line:84%
the power of having a
witness, so to speak.

00:22:27.505 --> 00:22:29.505 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people do
regression work,

00:22:29.505 --> 00:22:32.540 align:middle line:84%
and people go into hypnosis
and regression in this lifetime

00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:35.150 align:middle line:84%
even, not necessarily
always past life.

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is there's often
a defense mechanism sitting

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:43.110 align:middle line:84%
there that doesn't
allow them to fully go

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:46.550 align:middle line:84%
into the past or the
area where the trauma is

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:48.430 align:middle line:90%
held within the aura.

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:52.040 align:middle line:84%
To have someone there
to say, I see you.

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:56.230 align:middle line:84%
I know it because I was there
with you, or I can see you--

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:57.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Right, he
wasn't aware that it

00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:59.620 align:middle line:90%
was his anger that held that.

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:03.780 align:middle line:84%
When I did my work with
Joan and K, her husband, who

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:08.700 align:middle line:84%
was a psychiatrist and a
therapist, what held me,

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:12.340 align:middle line:84%
I had a terrible incarnation
in the 16th century-- awful.

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:18.240 align:middle line:84%
The whole life was 32
years, and it was not

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:21.420 align:middle line:84%
a pleasant incarnation,
but I was held by the fact

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:27.490 align:middle line:84%
that I saw coins being
exchanged when my mother was,

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:29.500 align:middle line:90%
I thought, selling me.

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In that
incarnation or this one?

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:35.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: In that incarnation,
and in that incarnation,

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.180 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't being sold.

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:40.640 align:middle line:84%
She was giving coins
to a foster mother.

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Even if I had regressed
and remembered the coins,

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.790 align:middle line:84%
which I did, I
didn't know that it

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:52.700 align:middle line:84%
was I was being fostered out--
a completely different story.

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore I was
held into a trauma.

00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:59.160 align:middle line:90%
I mean that was my ghost.

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:02.740 align:middle line:84%
That ghost was affecting
me in this lifetime.

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:06.216 align:middle line:84%
Once I knew the truth, my
life was changed utterly.

00:24:06.216 --> 00:24:08.090 align:middle line:84%
It was the beginning of
my publishing career.

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:09.506 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
it's very powerful,

00:24:09.506 --> 00:24:11.550 align:middle line:84%
but, again, had she not
given you that piece--

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:13.310 align:middle line:84%
and I've gone back
in regressions

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:16.094 align:middle line:84%
where I saw something, and you
only know what you knew then.

00:24:16.094 --> 00:24:18.510 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you see everything
and know any differently.

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:20.380 align:middle line:90%
You know what you knew then.

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:24.312 align:middle line:84%
And I had kind of a bone
against this other group

00:24:24.312 --> 00:24:25.770 align:middle line:84%
of people that were
doing something

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:28.470 align:middle line:84%
that I thought was very
unethical, because I

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:30.450 align:middle line:84%
was cloistered to the
extent I didn't really

00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:31.610 align:middle line:90%
know the true story.

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:34.010 align:middle line:84%
It was just rumor
that had gotten to us.

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And then in this lifetime
I met two other people

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:41.180 align:middle line:84%
that were there at
the exact same time

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:45.290 align:middle line:84%
and then showed me the
other side of this story.

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh, god,
that makes total sense now,

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:49.641 align:middle line:84%
and all the judgment
around that left.

00:24:49.641 --> 00:24:50.890 align:middle line:90%
It was a painful circumstance.

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:52.765 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Well, that was
extraordinary for you.

00:24:52.765 --> 00:24:55.460 align:middle line:84%
What a lucky, wonderful--
but unfortunately,

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:59.290 align:middle line:84%
even the best of them-- I
mean, Brian Weiss is very good,

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:01.920 align:middle line:84%
but he doesn't have
the golden key.

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.560 align:middle line:90%
He can't do the overlap.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:06.310 align:middle line:90%


00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:11.329 align:middle line:84%
But I'm sure there are folk on
the planet with those gifts.

00:25:11.329 --> 00:25:13.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, well so
there's one thing that did.

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:15.060 align:middle line:84%
I used to take people
into regressions.

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:16.140 align:middle line:90%
I loved doing it.

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:17.720 align:middle line:90%
I did it for fun for years.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:21.070 align:middle line:84%
But I was able to travel
with them and be with them

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:24.670 align:middle line:84%
and be in their mind and
see what they were doing

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:25.930 align:middle line:90%
before they would tell me.

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes it was
kind of-- it just hit me.

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:31.770 align:middle line:84%
I forgot about that, that it
was kind of like what you're

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:34.930 align:middle line:84%
talking about with Joan in
that they wouldn't report

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:39.410 align:middle line:84%
certain things back, and I'd say
afterward, but what about this?

00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:43.190 align:middle line:84%
Didn't you see
this at that time?

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:44.490 align:middle line:90%
I thought I was making it up.

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:46.085 align:middle line:90%
This is where having a witness--

00:25:46.085 --> 00:25:48.850 align:middle line:90%


00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:51.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: And indeed that
was how she was trained.

00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:52.590 align:middle line:90%
She was trained to do that.

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:53.923 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That old temple stuff.

00:25:53.923 --> 00:25:54.834 align:middle line:90%
>>LAHR: That's it.

00:25:54.834 --> 00:25:57.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so, once you
became involved with her,

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.600 align:middle line:84%
why did you
originally go to her,

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:00.950 align:middle line:84%
and then how did your
involvement blossom

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:03.420 align:middle line:84%
and continue to this
many years later?

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:07.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Well, I was married to
a theater critic at the time,

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:10.830 align:middle line:90%
and I had a child, my daughter.

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And I was very close
to having a breakdown.

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:19.960 align:middle line:84%
The marriage wasn't good,
and I had reoccurring dreams

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:23.070 align:middle line:84%
that my daughter was going
to drown-- was drowning.

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:24.730 align:middle line:90%
I would see her drowning.

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:29.849 align:middle line:84%
And oddly enough, a woman, who
I was in a sculpture class,

00:26:29.849 --> 00:26:31.640 align:middle line:84%
I was reading "Winged
Pharaoh" at the time.

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:32.285 align:middle line:90%
It was at home.

00:26:32.285 --> 00:26:33.790 align:middle line:84%
A woman came over
to me and said,

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:35.170 align:middle line:90%
a friend is coming to America.

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:36.920 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to come
and hear her speak?

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:37.966 align:middle line:90%
It was Joan Grant.

00:26:37.966 --> 00:26:38.840 align:middle line:90%
That's synchronicity.

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Lucky you.

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: And so I went, and then
I realized something's wrong.

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And so I went to London
and worked with them

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:50.900 align:middle line:84%
for a month, five days a week,
and I did regression work.

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And the real payload was
the 17th century incarnation

00:26:56.220 --> 00:27:00.050 align:middle line:84%
as a crippled male
acrobat who thought

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:01.912 align:middle line:90%
he was sold by his money.

00:27:01.912 --> 00:27:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, this is a
recurring theme that you're

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:05.547 align:middle line:90%
being sold out, literally.

00:27:05.547 --> 00:27:06.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LAHR: No, it's the same.

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's with
the same reincarnation.

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:10.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Yeah, the one I talked
about-- but the other one was

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:17.300 align:middle line:84%
of a Phoenician woman
whose daughter did drown.

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so your
fear was bleeding through.

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:24.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Exactly, and as
I said to you, because I

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:29.480 align:middle line:84%
have developed my visual
senses over numerous lifetimes,

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:32.190 align:middle line:84%
my visual sense of looking
out into the harbor--

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:35.376 align:middle line:84%
I had a beautiful
villa in Crete,

00:27:35.376 --> 00:27:36.875 align:middle line:84%
and I would look
out into the harbor

00:27:36.875 --> 00:27:39.100 align:middle line:84%
and see the Phoenician
boats, which were painted

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:41.130 align:middle line:90%
with wonderful colorful shapes.

00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:47.310 align:middle line:84%
So the reason why I give you
real credibility to far memory

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:51.977 align:middle line:84%
is when I recalled these
things, I never had the issues.

00:27:51.977 --> 00:27:53.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's right,
the reality changes.

00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:58.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: And also, the strength
of the one-legged acrobat who

00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:04.430 align:middle line:84%
died of the plague,
his tenacity,

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:09.860 align:middle line:84%
I had pushed away from
integrating certain strengths

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:14.320 align:middle line:84%
that this character had, that
he had certain lovely qualities

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.350 align:middle line:90%
that he had.

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:19.360 align:middle line:84%
So when we don't integrate
these pieces of ourselves,

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:23.630 align:middle line:84%
we cut off strengths as
well as vulnerabilities.

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:27.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, I find it
amazing that even in the world

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:29.670 align:middle line:84%
we're in, there are
many people have

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:33.200 align:middle line:90%
just unquenchable curiosity.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:36.320 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to themselves,
it's a different thing.

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:43.160 align:middle line:84%
There is often an unwillingness
to look at one's own past-- far

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:46.330 align:middle line:84%
past, near past-- and maybe
because of the trauma that

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:47.340 align:middle line:90%
embedded there.

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Exactly, because
it's too painful.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.190 align:middle line:84%
That regression
took two sessions.

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:56.010 align:middle line:84%
I must have been
under for hours,

00:28:56.010 --> 00:29:01.270 align:middle line:84%
and I broke the first session
because it was too painful too.

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:07.480 align:middle line:84%
It was the pain when I thought
I was sold was so great that I

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.082 align:middle line:90%
just I couldn't bear it.

00:29:09.082 --> 00:29:10.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, the betrayal.

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:12.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Right, and
yet, that was my--

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:18.210 align:middle line:84%
but the second session
we figured it all out.

00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And, by the way, I'd lost
my right leg below the knee,

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:29.145 align:middle line:84%
and I literally could feel it
reforming after the session.

00:29:29.145 --> 00:29:31.810 align:middle line:90%


00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:33.690 align:middle line:84%
Joan called it the
superphysical--

00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:36.569 align:middle line:90%
that we have a body.

00:29:36.569 --> 00:29:39.110 align:middle line:84%
We have our physical body, but
we have a super-physical body.

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:41.484 align:middle line:84%
And the damage was to
the super-physical body.

00:29:41.484 --> 00:29:43.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's oftentimes
what shows up in lifetimes

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:48.510 align:middle line:84%
as weaknesses in our
structure or our immune system

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:52.650 align:middle line:84%
or marks on the body are
said to often be inherited

00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:54.180 align:middle line:90%
from our previous incarnations.

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:55.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Exactly, there's
no question about it.

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that would be
what she calls the super body.

00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:58.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LAHR: Super-physical, mm-hmm.

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:01.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --the information
in the super-physical.

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:03.949 align:middle line:90%
>>LAHR: Exactly, exactly.

00:30:03.949 --> 00:30:05.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I had a
similar experience,

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:09.780 align:middle line:84%
where in this one particular
lifetime-- and Delores Cannon,

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:11.770 align:middle line:84%
dear Delores, who died
a couple weeks ago,

00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:13.290 align:middle line:84%
was the one who
did the regression.

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And when it came to the
really, really painful part,

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:18.610 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't do it.

00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:20.870 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't go to that moment.

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And she said, why
don't you go past this,

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:26.110 align:middle line:84%
and then it was filled in
by these other people later,

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:27.540 align:middle line:90%
and I got the full piece.

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:30.540 align:middle line:84%
But you have to wonder, do you
actually get the healing out

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.616 align:middle line:84%
of it when you--
I just didn't see

00:30:32.616 --> 00:30:35.100 align:middle line:84%
any reason-- I couldn't
traumatize myself over

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:36.440 align:middle line:90%
again in doing it.

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:37.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LAHR: I think you do.

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:39.740 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I do think
you get the healing.

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:43.710 align:middle line:84%
I think it's not as maybe
as dramatic or whatever,

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:47.000 align:middle line:84%
but you do, and also,
the healing sometimes

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.310 align:middle line:90%
comes in time.

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:52.140 align:middle line:84%
But after I came back to America
after working with Joan and K,

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:57.120 align:middle line:84%
I had psychic gifts
that I never had before.

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.940 align:middle line:90%
Someone approached me.

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:01.680 align:middle line:84%
I was in Amagansett on
Long Island in our house,

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.850 align:middle line:84%
and some woman had
lost their little dog.

00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh, look at
the field up the hill,

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:07.810 align:middle line:90%
and they found him.

00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it all
opened up for you.

00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And again, for most of us,
once we release the trauma,

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:16.790 align:middle line:84%
huge parts of our
greater mind are now

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:19.800 align:middle line:84%
freed up to be able to
be allocated and used

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:20.820 align:middle line:90%
in different ways.

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:24.160 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a part
of trauma in general

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:25.600 align:middle line:90%
that is not well understood.

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.180 align:middle line:90%
It's held within the aura.

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:29.610 align:middle line:84%
The fear-- it's
not held so much--

00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:32.710 align:middle line:84%
it may relate to the body,
but it's held in aura.

00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And if the aura is
gunked up with trauma

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:36.870 align:middle line:84%
after drama that's
never released,

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:38.400 align:middle line:90%
how can we use our full forces?

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:40.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Well, you're not because
there's a whole piece of you

00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:41.160 align:middle line:90%
that isn't there.

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.667 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you can't.

00:31:42.667 --> 00:31:44.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Joan called these--
these were our ghosts.

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:47.950 align:middle line:84%
This was a ghost of myself
that was stuck in time,

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:50.970 align:middle line:84%
you see, that I
had not drawn in,

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:58.500 align:middle line:84%
as was the Cretian woman,
who when her daughter died,

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.580 align:middle line:90%
committed suicide.

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:04.362 align:middle line:84%
She lost her daughter, but
I've met my daughter. [LAUGHS]

00:32:04.362 --> 00:32:05.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Have you?

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:07.220 align:middle line:90%
Interesting--

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:09.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: And one of the
interesting things is,

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:14.360 align:middle line:84%
as with Joan and Sophia,
there are people that keep

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:15.349 align:middle line:90%
reoccurring in our--

00:32:15.349 --> 00:32:17.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely,
they keep showing up,

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:20.600 align:middle line:84%
that we're bonded
to on some level.

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And Joan was also interesting
in that the boldness

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:25.610 align:middle line:90%
of her character I loved.

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:27.550 align:middle line:84%
There was one
story, as I recall,

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:30.710 align:middle line:84%
about she was engaged
to a young man,

00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:33.840 align:middle line:84%
and she broke the engagement off
and said, I just can't do this

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.660 align:middle line:90%
and went away-- went away.

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:37.992 align:middle line:84%
And I thought she was
in the lodge somewhere?

00:32:37.992 --> 00:32:39.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LAHR: A ski lodge, I think.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --a ski
lodge, and this man

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:46.170 align:middle line:84%
comes in and recognized
her and said, "I know you.

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:47.600 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember me?"

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.760 align:middle line:90%
And she said, "Yes, I do."

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And they began a
relationship like that.

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:54.720 align:middle line:84%
It was like this
instant recognition,

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:56.494 align:middle line:84%
and they even kissed
that very day.

00:32:56.494 --> 00:32:57.410 align:middle line:90%
It's like, I know you.

00:32:57.410 --> 00:32:59.220 align:middle line:90%
I know you.

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Wonderful,
well, indeed, the people

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:07.430 align:middle line:84%
that were close to her, many
of them she knew before.

00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely, so
that wouldn't be a surprise.

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: I don't know if
I've explained enough.

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:16.180 align:middle line:84%
I sent you a picture
of a young Joan.

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:17.370 align:middle line:90%
I hope you have that.

00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:19.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes,
we love that picture.

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:23.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Yes, so these gifts--
during this first World War,

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:26.330 align:middle line:84%
she started going
at night seeing

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:30.250 align:middle line:84%
these terrifying situations
on the battlefield.

00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:34.420 align:middle line:84%
She was often not the
little girl Joan in them.

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:36.700 align:middle line:90%
She was a nurse in a uniform.

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:37.940 align:middle line:90%
She was older.

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:41.410 align:middle line:84%
So when she manifested
at these battlefields,

00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:44.020 align:middle line:84%
she was a larger
Joan, an older Joan,

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:45.774 align:middle line:90%
but it was terrifying for her.

00:33:45.774 --> 00:33:47.440 align:middle line:84%
At times she didn't
want to go to sleep.

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:49.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because she was
sending her consciousness

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:49.800 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:50.509 align:middle line:90%
It was going out.

00:33:50.509 --> 00:33:51.925 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Yes, and
she healing them.

00:33:51.925 --> 00:33:54.230 align:middle line:84%
She was telling them as she
was putting their guts back

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:56.390 align:middle line:84%
into themselves
and saying, you can

00:33:56.390 --> 00:33:59.870 align:middle line:84%
go on now, letting them
know they'd passed on--

00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:01.710 align:middle line:90%
and go to the beautiful country.

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:04.640 align:middle line:84%
And she was trying to
heal them and get them out

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:07.130 align:middle line:84%
of this terrible hell
that they were in.

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:12.530 align:middle line:84%
So that's quite a
courageous lady.

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:15.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes, to take
on that amount of pain--

00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:19.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: To be initiated you had
to, there were seven ordeals,

00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:22.044 align:middle line:84%
I believe, or possibly more,
that you had to go through.

00:34:22.044 --> 00:34:24.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, you're talking
back in the "Winged Pharaoh"

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:26.929 align:middle line:84%
days, and we're about to
segueway right into that.

00:34:26.929 --> 00:34:29.567 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't finish talking
about it in this conversation,

00:34:29.567 --> 00:34:31.400 align:middle line:84%
we're going to pick it
up again in the next,

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:35.300 align:middle line:84%
because we also have the life
and times of Mary and Jesus

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:36.230 align:middle line:90%
and Moses.

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:38.650 align:middle line:84%
She talks about pivotal
periods of history

00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:40.710 align:middle line:84%
where she may have
been not necessarily

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:44.750 align:middle line:84%
the central figure all the time,
but close to what was going on.

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:47.639 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: And some of the books
are about-- "Life as Carola"

00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:51.120 align:middle line:84%
she was just a little
Renaissance-- she played a lute

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:54.270 align:middle line:84%
and sang, and she wasn't
always the pharaoh.

00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:56.780 align:middle line:84%
People believe who believe
in reincarnation say,

00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:59.560 align:middle line:84%
oh well, I don't believe
it, because you're always--

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:00.940 align:middle line:90%
you were Napoleon.

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:04.350 align:middle line:84%
I was a one-legged acrobat
in 17th century Spain.

00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:07.220 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to be one-legged
in Spain in the 17th century.

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:10.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah,
yeah, I remember

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.410 align:middle line:90%
times being sold off myself.

00:35:11.410 --> 00:35:15.320 align:middle line:84%
They weren't the most glamorous
or comfortable of times.

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:17.550 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the "Winged Pharaoh"

00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:21.000 align:middle line:84%
now and the story of
Sekeeta and, again,

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.380 align:middle line:84%
because this is really just
drenched in pearls of wisdom.

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:27.010 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful story.

00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:29.640 align:middle line:84%
It flows like a novel,
very easy to read,

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:33.480 align:middle line:84%
but, again, this is heralded
by some really interesting

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:35.405 align:middle line:90%
mystic orders as true vision.

00:35:35.405 --> 00:35:36.651 align:middle line:90%
>>LAHR: Oh, without question.

00:35:36.651 --> 00:35:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's why
it's-- I mean, to read it is--

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:41.130 align:middle line:84%
you think, oh, my god,
I'm there with her.

00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:44.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Joan had developed
earlier on the ability

00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:50.070 align:middle line:84%
to psychomotrize objects,
and she kind of did it

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:51.380 align:middle line:90%
with her friends for fun.

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:53.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one of her
friends was involved

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:55.510 align:middle line:84%
with the British Museum,
and they would go,

00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:57.700 align:middle line:84%
and they'd put their
hands on sculptures,

00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:00.450 align:middle line:84%
and she would read them, and
the visions were very powerful.

00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:02.250 align:middle line:90%
So she could.

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:09.710 align:middle line:84%
Once she was given a little
blue scarab, I think it was,

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:12.330 align:middle line:84%
and, all of a sudden,
she thought, wait,

00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:13.550 align:middle line:90%
this is a true scarab.

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:16.720 align:middle line:90%
This is from 3000 BC.

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:21.720 align:middle line:84%
This was mine, and she realized,
and then Sekeeta came through.

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:27.680 align:middle line:90%


00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:30.210 align:middle line:84%
At first, she thought it
was someone who was dead.

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And then she realized,
no, she's being initiated.

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:37.355 align:middle line:84%
She's going into
something like a pyramid,

00:36:37.355 --> 00:36:38.980 align:middle line:90%
but it had three levels.

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:41.870 align:middle line:84%
So the first level
reflected the body;

00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:middle line:84%
the second level, the soul; and
the third level, the spirit.

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And she went across
a lake and then

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:54.420 align:middle line:84%
into a room that was shaped
not unlike a sarcophagus,

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:59.830 align:middle line:84%
and she had to be there for
four nights and be out of body.

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And while she was out
of body, come back,

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:05.660 align:middle line:84%
and record everything
that she had seen.

00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:07.090 align:middle line:90%
Now some people don't make it.

00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:09.810 align:middle line:84%
They don't survive
the initiation,

00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:12.660 align:middle line:84%
but she did, and
therefore she was winged.

00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:15.639 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's go back
now to her husband also.

00:37:15.639 --> 00:37:17.180 align:middle line:84%
He would take her
out-- she was known

00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:19.110 align:middle line:84%
in archaeology--
great archaeologist.

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:21.580 align:middle line:84%
She could suss it out
because of her ability

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:25.010 align:middle line:84%
to use psychometry on
the remnants of the dig,

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:27.720 align:middle line:84%
and so she was taken out a
lot on archaeological digs.

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: There was some,
but she-- Leslie didn't

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:34.390 align:middle line:90%
want her to show these gifts.

00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:35.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Leslie
was her husband.

00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:35.973 align:middle line:90%
>>LAHR: Yes, Leslie.

00:37:35.973 --> 00:37:36.830 align:middle line:90%
Beatty didn't--

00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:38.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He didn't like this,
but he also asked her to read

00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:39.512 align:middle line:90%
things for him--

00:37:39.512 --> 00:37:40.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LAHR: Yes, it's true.

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:41.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --privately.

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:43.079 align:middle line:84%
I mean he was being a
little bit of a hypocrite.

00:37:43.079 --> 00:37:45.910 align:middle line:84%
It's like, don't embarrass
me with your skills, however,

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:47.770 align:middle line:84%
what do you get out
of this little piece?

00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:51.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: But he did record
these 115, I think,

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:57.670 align:middle line:84%
sessions for Sekeeta, and by
chance, she sent it to someone,

00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:59.520 align:middle line:84%
and they sent it
on to a publisher,

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:02.160 align:middle line:84%
and the publisher got in touch
with her immediately and said,

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:03.580 align:middle line:90%
"I'm publishing this."

00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And it was in
1937, and it became

00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:10.152 align:middle line:84%
an instant international
best seller,

00:38:10.152 --> 00:38:11.735 align:middle line:84%
and that was the end
of that marriage.

00:38:11.735 --> 00:38:14.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think that's because
people felt the truth in it,

00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:16.670 align:middle line:84%
and you can see why Leslie
would have felt threatened.

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:19.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he was an academic,
and now his wife is shining.

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:24.700 align:middle line:84%
But let's go into Sekeeta's
life as a young girl.

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:26.450 align:middle line:84%
She was also very
close to her brother.

00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And some of the tenets of
what she was taught even very

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:33.590 align:middle line:84%
young, before she went into
her elder years and separation

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:36.183 align:middle line:84%
from the boy she loved,
and lead the life

00:38:36.183 --> 00:38:39.500 align:middle line:84%
of a young, female pharaoh
and training was like.

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:42.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: I will try to
recall some of this for you,

00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:49.460 align:middle line:84%
but she was born into-- she
was told before she was born

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:52.540 align:middle line:84%
that she would be born to
a family that wanted her,

00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:55.540 align:middle line:84%
and she would be
born among souls

00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:57.060 align:middle line:90%
that knew her from before.

00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:00.010 align:middle line:84%
So her brother-- she
adored her brother,

00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:01.750 align:middle line:84%
and they were best
friends really,

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:05.610 align:middle line:84%
and they were intended
to be co-pharaohs

00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:07.100 align:middle line:90%
from the very beginning.

00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:11.530 align:middle line:84%
It was a loving family-- the
parents, the father and mother.

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:15.110 align:middle line:84%
The father was pharaoh,
and they wanted this child.

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:17.520 align:middle line:84%
The mother recognized the
gifts of the child very early

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:22.070 align:middle line:84%
and gave her a small sculpture
of Anibus, who was-- he

00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:25.460 align:middle line:84%
taught dreaming and
access to dreaming.

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And so early on her
mother said to her--

00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:35.570 align:middle line:84%
I love this too-- she said--
Sekeeta loved to swim.

00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And the mother said to her,
now when you're going to sleep,

00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:42.400 align:middle line:84%
realize it's just
like you're slipping

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:47.790 align:middle line:84%
into the water of dreaming,
and it's as simple as that

00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:49.270 align:middle line:90%
and as wonderful as that.

00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And so the mother encouraged
her dreaming gifts.

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:57.929 align:middle line:84%
And then she was a
real tom girl and--

00:39:57.929 --> 00:39:59.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Out
exploring all the time.

00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:01.240 align:middle line:90%
She had a little pet lion.

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: She had a pet
lion that she adored,

00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:09.450 align:middle line:84%
and she got into lots of
mischief with her brother.

00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:11.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But her father
was also a very just ruler.

00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LAHR: Oh, very just.

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:14.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A good
man and just ruler.

00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:15.650 align:middle line:84%
She had a good template
for what that's like.

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:17.441 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: That's right,
and one of the things

00:40:17.441 --> 00:40:20.150 align:middle line:84%
that I've realized about
early Egyptian culture,

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:22.570 align:middle line:84%
and it's certainly part
of "Winged Pharaoh,"

00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:27.500 align:middle line:84%
is there is a diagram of the
elements of the soul in it.

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:29.600 align:middle line:84%
It's hidden in the
book, but it talks

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:33.920 align:middle line:84%
about all the different levels
of the soul-- body and soul,

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:36.950 align:middle line:84%
healing the body and
healing the soul.

00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is extraordinary,
and it really is reflected.

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:44.820 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of wisdom on
the planet at the same time.

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:47.350 align:middle line:84%
In the Upanishads,
the Hindu Upanishads,

00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:53.160 align:middle line:84%
there is information about the
aspects of the soul as well.

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:56.530 align:middle line:84%
But it's in "Winged
Pharaoh" if you--

00:40:56.530 --> 00:40:57.405 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:40:57.405 --> 00:41:00.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: It's definitely
in "Winged Pharaoh."

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:06.080 align:middle line:84%
So she was a
regular little girl,

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:08.800 align:middle line:84%
and then it became
clear that she

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:13.260 align:middle line:84%
was gifted enough to go to the
temple to become a priestess.

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:15.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And to be initiated.

00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:21.120 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain anymore about
what they were put through,

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:23.040 align:middle line:90%
some of the tests of the day?

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And I ask you this because
if you look at modern times,

00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:32.790 align:middle line:84%
and you hear about things
like the rites of passage,

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:36.080 align:middle line:84%
if you want to call it that,
the initiation into societies

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:40.220 align:middle line:84%
like the Skull and Bones,
I find it interesting

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:42.720 align:middle line:84%
that these-- and
also there are much

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:45.740 align:middle line:90%
darker practices oftentimes.

00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:48.090 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me
that they're trying

00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:51.620 align:middle line:84%
to mimic something
that was held very dear

00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:54.830 align:middle line:84%
and was very real in
times past, but now it's

00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:55.775 align:middle line:90%
kind of a sorority.

00:41:55.775 --> 00:41:57.066 align:middle line:90%
It's not a sorority, but, yeah.

00:41:57.066 --> 00:41:58.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Exactly, these
were true priests.

00:41:58.930 --> 00:42:00.150 align:middle line:90%
These were true priests.

00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:01.485 align:middle line:90%
They weren't just facsimile.

00:42:01.485 --> 00:42:03.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They were
born for a purpose.

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:08.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Exactly, and they gave
their life to the healing arts,

00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:10.610 align:middle line:84%
whether it was the
soul or the body.

00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:13.550 align:middle line:84%
That was what was
taught at these temples.

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:18.830 align:middle line:84%
We don't, of course-- to
go through some silly rite

00:42:18.830 --> 00:42:21.070 align:middle line:84%
in a university
or whatever, which

00:42:21.070 --> 00:42:24.740 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have any
credibility or information

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:25.990 align:middle line:90%
or-- it becomes a rite.

00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:30.090 align:middle line:84%
It's just something quite
superficial and surface.

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:34.450 align:middle line:84%
But OK, when she was
initiated, the first part

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:38.020 align:middle line:84%
of her initiation is she
had to go to the underworld

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:39.522 align:middle line:90%
and bring some souls back.

00:42:39.522 --> 00:42:41.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
found that fascinating.

00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:43.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: They would be
someone who would, say,

00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:47.989 align:middle line:84%
who had been a torturer, and
they would be repeating--

00:42:47.989 --> 00:42:49.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: These patterns.

00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: --patterns
over and over,

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:55.450 align:middle line:84%
trapped into that repetition of
torture, and she would go back,

00:42:55.450 --> 00:42:58.000 align:middle line:84%
and they would
talk of the truth,

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.420 align:middle line:84%
and she would bring them out,
and she would bring them out

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:01.220 align:middle line:90%
of the underworld.

00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:04.150 align:middle line:84%
If someone was a glutton
and was eating everything,

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:09.360 align:middle line:84%
she would try to-- and would
succeed-- bring light into that

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:11.860 align:middle line:90%
and adjust the pattern.

00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:15.250 align:middle line:84%
That was the first
part of the initiation.

00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And then there were
subtler things.

00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Some of us, most of
us, have had some form

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:28.430 align:middle line:84%
of an addiction or another, and
she would work with addictions,

00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:33.330 align:middle line:84%
whether it was you make a
craven image of friendship

00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:37.010 align:middle line:84%
or you drink or
you-- she would have

00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:39.950 align:middle line:84%
to work with people who
had subtler-- I mean,

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:41.114 align:middle line:90%
torture is extreme.

00:43:41.114 --> 00:43:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The more
subtle patterns

00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:43.655 align:middle line:90%
that were not serving them.

00:43:43.655 --> 00:43:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Yes, exactly, and
she would work with them

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:47.240 align:middle line:90%
and heal them.

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And then during
the initiation she

00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:54.050 align:middle line:84%
got to the higher worlds,
in which she went to an area

00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:59.790 align:middle line:84%
where you were seeing true
colors-- amethyst, turquoise,

00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:01.560 align:middle line:90%
blue, gold.

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:04.870 align:middle line:84%
You could experience
colors really

00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:09.270 align:middle line:84%
that we don't on Earth--
more deeply and felt.

00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And then sounds--
music, she said,

00:44:12.930 --> 00:44:15.870 align:middle line:84%
I remember-- I
think in "Pharaoh"

00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:18.890 align:middle line:84%
she said-- I believe-- you
wouldn't want a musician

00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:21.515 align:middle line:84%
to hear this music because they
would never play anything again

00:44:21.515 --> 00:44:23.790 align:middle line:90%
because it was so beautiful.

00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And then Akasha-- the area
that held all the memories--

00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:29.260 align:middle line:90%
the Akashic record.

00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:33.120 align:middle line:84%
There was an area she had to
go through and experience.

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And then she had
to defeat someone

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:44.570 align:middle line:84%
who was a soul that was given
to darkness, a powerful soul,

00:44:44.570 --> 00:44:48.390 align:middle line:84%
just by her will--
just by her will.

00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:53.990 align:middle line:84%
And then her last test was to
do defeat the fear, her greatest

00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.490 align:middle line:90%
fear.

00:44:54.490 --> 00:44:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And in Joan's case, it
was of cobras and snakes.

00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:03.340 align:middle line:84%
So she had to go into a
pit of steaming cobras

00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:07.710 align:middle line:84%
and really destroy
the master cobra.

00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And that was the end of
her-- but these were big.

00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:13.180 align:middle line:90%
These are not easy things to do.

00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:18.720 align:middle line:84%
This was really a serious
test of will and courage.

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:20.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which was
necessary if you

00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:23.590 align:middle line:84%
were going to become a leader
of the people in the day.

00:45:23.590 --> 00:45:24.410 align:middle line:90%
You had to earn.

00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:25.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LAHR: Exactly.

00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:27.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:31.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Because
really the goal here,

00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:37.620 align:middle line:84%
the goal in this dimension,
is to be free and to be happy.

00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:40.780 align:middle line:84%
"To free souls"
was her assignment,

00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:45.450 align:middle line:84%
and joy was really
what was happiness.

00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And Joan, in this
incarnation, in this lifetime,

00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:51.990 align:middle line:84%
always taught we must develop
all of our five senses

00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:53.990 align:middle line:84%
before we will
develop our sixth,

00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:56.382 align:middle line:84%
and she had them all
developed, without question.

00:45:56.382 --> 00:45:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
the thing too,

00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:01.390 align:middle line:84%
going into the areas
of sound frequencies,

00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:05.510 align:middle line:84%
of color, even simple
meditations and exercises

00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:10.410 align:middle line:84%
for us today, such as being able
to hold a color or a colored

00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:13.740 align:middle line:84%
object in our mind clearly
for even a minute, even two

00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:15.950 align:middle line:90%
minutes, begins that process.

00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:17.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LAHR: Absolutely.

00:46:17.110 --> 00:46:21.472 align:middle line:84%
And as we discussed earlier,
when she was at Trelyden,

00:46:21.472 --> 00:46:23.180 align:middle line:84%
and the children were
coming from London,

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:25.380 align:middle line:84%
and she was looking
after them, she

00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:28.470 align:middle line:84%
had them going out into
the woods collecting leaves

00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:31.530 align:middle line:84%
and petals, and she had
them close their eyes,

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:33.510 align:middle line:84%
and they have to
identify the flowers,

00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:37.590 align:middle line:84%
and they learned by this
feeling of the petals,

00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:40.930 align:middle line:84%
identify the leaves
or the bark and what

00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:43.320 align:middle line:90%
the tree was by the feel.

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:44.950 align:middle line:90%
You can do that.

00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:48.490 align:middle line:84%
You can develop these senses,
but you have to do it.

00:46:48.490 --> 00:46:50.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have
to train yourself

00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:51.764 align:middle line:90%
or be trained to do it.

00:46:51.764 --> 00:46:53.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
that is the business

00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:55.950 align:middle line:84%
of people who have
chosen repeatedly

00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:59.010 align:middle line:84%
to take these kind of
high leadership roles

00:46:59.010 --> 00:47:01.010 align:middle line:90%
throughout history.

00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And now I think it's important
to clear one thing up.

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:10.390 align:middle line:90%
This was in the Old Kingdom.

00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:12.045 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I read at
one point, I thought

00:47:12.045 --> 00:47:15.780 align:middle line:84%
it said Sekeeta was
7,800 years ago.

00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:18.112 align:middle line:90%
>>LAHR: Well, it was 3000 BC.

00:47:18.112 --> 00:47:19.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
only 5,000 years ago.

00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:21.528 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Yeah, I don't
remember the 7,800.

00:47:21.528 --> 00:47:24.360 align:middle line:84%
I remember it was
the Old Kingdom,

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:28.260 align:middle line:84%
and the Old Kingdom was
the most spiritual kingdom.

00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:32.280 align:middle line:84%
As you move to the present in
Egyptian history, the Middle

00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:37.360 align:middle line:84%
Kingdom, which is your
period of Ramoses and Seti,

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:42.030 align:middle line:84%
their priests became
master magicians and very--

00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:43.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very skillful.

00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Very skillful
magicians, and it was not

00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:47.634 align:middle line:90%
necessarily for the light.

00:47:47.634 --> 00:47:49.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --for
the good, exactly.

00:47:49.050 --> 00:47:51.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: And so Moses
was born, which

00:47:51.390 --> 00:47:53.160 align:middle line:90%
is about the birth of Moses.

00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:54.759 align:middle line:90%
You'll find magic being misused.

00:47:54.759 --> 00:47:56.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and we're
going to talk about that

00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:58.380 align:middle line:90%
in our second hour together.

00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:00.340 align:middle line:90%
I want to talk about that.

00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:02.400 align:middle line:84%
So she was really
trying to uphold,

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:08.490 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't as though all of
the kingdoms surrounding hers

00:48:08.490 --> 00:48:09.529 align:middle line:90%
were as well developed.

00:48:09.529 --> 00:48:10.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LAHR: No, that's right.

00:48:10.570 --> 00:48:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And she talks
about the various levels

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:15.380 align:middle line:84%
of development--
culturally, socially,

00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:15.747 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the
systems of justice.

00:48:15.747 --> 00:48:17.205 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Right,
Crete, for instance,

00:48:17.205 --> 00:48:20.160 align:middle line:84%
Crete, she considered
them children in Crete.

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:24.740 align:middle line:84%
They were not-- I mean, the
Egyptian culture at that point,

00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:29.550 align:middle line:84%
it was focused on spiritual
teachings and truths.

00:48:29.550 --> 00:48:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And death, which
was the transition

00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:37.110 align:middle line:84%
into the beautiful
country, as Joan calls it

00:48:37.110 --> 00:48:40.910 align:middle line:84%
in this incarnation,
was very important

00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:45.467 align:middle line:84%
so that your soul was going to
be weighed by the 42 assessors,

00:48:45.467 --> 00:48:46.800 align:middle line:90%
and you were going to be asked--

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:48.425 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk about
that for a moment.

00:48:48.425 --> 00:48:50.680 align:middle line:90%


00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:53.910 align:middle line:84%
We've heard about the feather
of Maat, your heart being

00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:55.410 align:middle line:84%
weighed against the
feather of Maat,

00:48:55.410 --> 00:48:56.840 align:middle line:90%
but what were these tenets?

00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: There were
42 assessors when

00:48:59.050 --> 00:49:03.780 align:middle line:84%
you died that will ask you 42
questions, and the questions--

00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:06.490 align:middle line:84%
and I do believe they are the
source of the Ten Commandments

00:49:06.490 --> 00:49:07.530 align:middle line:90%
much later.

00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:09.180 align:middle line:84%
But it's a very
different thing to say,

00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:12.700 align:middle line:84%
I command you not to kill anyone
than to ask you a question,

00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:15.760 align:middle line:84%
have you ever taken
a life in violence?

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever--
The first question,

00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:26.657 align:middle line:84%
which I think is so interesting,
have you treated your body as--

00:49:26.657 --> 00:49:27.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --like a temple.

00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:28.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: A vessel, a
temple of the soul.

00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:29.740 align:middle line:90%
That was the first question.

00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:31.036 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wow, interesting--
have you respected yourself

00:49:31.036 --> 00:49:31.536 align:middle line:90%
first?

00:49:31.536 --> 00:49:34.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: I haven't exactly
gotten the words-- well,

00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:38.610 align:middle line:84%
it's about honoring your
body as a temple of the soul.

00:49:38.610 --> 00:49:41.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean that's a very
interesting thing.

00:49:41.490 --> 00:49:43.110 align:middle line:84%
You know today
you have teenagers

00:49:43.110 --> 00:49:44.720 align:middle line:90%
that are cutting themselves.

00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:50.570 align:middle line:84%
That is a completely-- they
don't-- the body is the temple

00:49:50.570 --> 00:49:52.266 align:middle line:90%
of their soul.

00:49:52.266 --> 00:49:53.390 align:middle line:90%
Do we have a culture that--

00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:55.926 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we've been
so cut off from that.

00:49:55.926 --> 00:49:57.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: So that was
the first question.

00:49:57.550 --> 00:50:00.200 align:middle line:84%
The first five questions
really have to do with that.

00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:04.640 align:middle line:90%


00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:06.860 align:middle line:84%
For a man it would
be, have you lain

00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:13.800 align:middle line:84%
with a woman who did not
speak to your spirit,

00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:14.640 align:middle line:90%
in other words--

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, were
you a hypocrite?

00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:20.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: In other words, have
you-- the two at the end

00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:23.780 align:middle line:90%
are just extraordinary.

00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:29.140 align:middle line:84%
41 is have you
treated the animals as

00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:31.820 align:middle line:90%
though they were your brothers?

00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:34.640 align:middle line:84%
Because we were brothers
to animals before we

00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:35.930 align:middle line:90%
evolved into human beings.

00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:36.640 align:middle line:90%
We were rocks.

00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:37.740 align:middle line:90%
We were flowers.

00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:42.220 align:middle line:90%


00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And the last one,
have you treated

00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:47.840 align:middle line:84%
the plants and the
things that grow,

00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:51.280 align:middle line:84%
have you watered them if
they have been thirsty?

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:53.220 align:middle line:84%
Now this has nothing
to do with being

00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:56.280 align:middle line:90%
in dominion over the animals.

00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:59.050 align:middle line:90%
This is about nurturing life.

00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:04.440 align:middle line:84%
So those 42 questions, which
I think are extraordinary,

00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:08.190 align:middle line:84%
the dying Egyptian had
to answer honestly.

00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And if they hadn't handled
all of those issues,

00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:13.280 align:middle line:90%
they were reborn.

00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.510 align:middle line:90%
If they had, they are--

00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:18.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What a genuinely
beautiful form of evaluation.

00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:20.050 align:middle line:90%
And also, there is no judgment.

00:51:20.050 --> 00:51:23.050 align:middle line:84%
There's no supreme
anything lording

00:51:23.050 --> 00:51:26.200 align:middle line:84%
over the person that is
going through this evaluation

00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:26.760 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:27.676 align:middle line:90%
It's you and yourself.

00:51:27.676 --> 00:51:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Yes, they're answering,
well, I didn't really--

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:32.890 align:middle line:90%
I was jealous.

00:51:32.890 --> 00:51:33.910 align:middle line:90%
Jealousy is one.

00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:35.320 align:middle line:90%
Gluttony is another.

00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:38.840 align:middle line:84%
All of them are dealt
with, but exactly, it's

00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:41.154 align:middle line:90%
you really evaluating yourself.

00:51:41.154 --> 00:51:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's so beautiful.

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:47.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, gosh, my
house plants-- do I have one

00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:49.120 align:middle line:84%
that's really
suffering? [LAUGHS]

00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:51.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: [LAUGHS] Exactly,
but my daughter--

00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:53.800 align:middle line:84%
I have a wonderful daughter
who advocates for animals,

00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:54.820 align:middle line:90%
and she's vegan.

00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:58.200 align:middle line:90%
And I think, good for her.

00:51:58.200 --> 00:51:59.020 align:middle line:90%
Go, girl.

00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:02.030 align:middle line:90%


00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:05.140 align:middle line:84%
But indeed animals
are our brothers.

00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:09.070 align:middle line:84%
The plants, this whole
planet is sacred.

00:52:09.070 --> 00:52:09.737 align:middle line:90%
We really need--

00:52:09.737 --> 00:52:11.569 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that was
in the early kingdom.

00:52:11.569 --> 00:52:12.590 align:middle line:90%
It devolved after that.

00:52:12.590 --> 00:52:14.390 align:middle line:90%
Black magic started coming in.

00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:15.191 align:middle line:90%
>>LAHR: Decadence.

00:52:15.191 --> 00:52:17.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The priests,
decadence, money, and you

00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:20.970 align:middle line:84%
know, as we start looking
at more revisionist history

00:52:20.970 --> 00:52:24.300 align:middle line:84%
and archaeology, very
interesting timelines are

00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:26.160 align:middle line:84%
starting to come
up, and that's why

00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:29.360 align:middle line:84%
I said I wouldn't have any
problem whichever book I read

00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:32.260 align:middle line:84%
that that was 7,800 years ago,
if that was the case, that

00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:34.660 align:middle line:84%
would still be relatively
modern history compared to some

00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:38.090 align:middle line:84%
of the timelines now,
where the pyramids

00:52:38.090 --> 00:52:40.590 align:middle line:84%
are thought to be at least
11,000, 12,000 years old.

00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:43.720 align:middle line:84%
John Anthony Westwood
say perhaps 35,000.

00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:45.760 align:middle line:84%
There are other
ancient teachings

00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:50.160 align:middle line:84%
that say, no, the Great
Pyramid is 85,000 years old.

00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And then I know the teaching
that I had for years and years,

00:52:54.070 --> 00:53:01.240 align:middle line:84%
it was told that the development
of Egyptian culture in the very

00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:04.070 align:middle line:84%
earliest days, which was far
earlier than we understand

00:53:04.070 --> 00:53:08.090 align:middle line:84%
today, was concurrent with
the Atlantian cultures.

00:53:08.090 --> 00:53:16.825 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Yes, and, in fact,
in "Pharaoh," I think, yes, I

00:53:16.825 --> 00:53:19.820 align:middle line:84%
think that's right, and
there are references to that.

00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:22.280 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes, and so you're
talking about ancient--

00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:25.390 align:middle line:10%
>>LAHR: She talks about the
Great Pyramid in "Pharaoh"

00:53:25.390 --> 00:53:28.635 align:middle line:10%
when she's talking
about her initiation.

00:53:28.635 --> 00:53:32.550 align:middle line:90%


00:53:32.550 --> 00:53:34.070 align:middle line:90%
It's like a mastaba shape.

00:53:34.070 --> 00:53:35.970 align:middle line:84%
Where she was
initiated was different

00:53:35.970 --> 00:53:39.325 align:middle line:84%
than the Great Pyramid,
she said, because it was--

00:53:39.325 --> 00:53:40.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Different
purposes-- ziggurat

00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:43.380 align:middle line:84%
as a whole different
geometrical purpose

00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:46.010 align:middle line:90%
than the smooth-sided pyramid.

00:53:46.010 --> 00:53:49.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: But she said that
the Great Pyramid was

00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:54.140 align:middle line:84%
shining because
the limestone was

00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:57.590 align:middle line:90%
so polished that it reflected.

00:53:57.590 --> 00:54:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, well, I know the
"Winged Pharaoh," for anybody

00:54:00.550 --> 00:54:02.450 align:middle line:90%
who reads it, it stands out.

00:54:02.450 --> 00:54:05.620 align:middle line:84%
You can't say quite why it
stands out, other than it's not

00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:06.820 align:middle line:90%
just a beautiful tale.

00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:09.450 align:middle line:84%
It's because of the exquisite
pearls of wisdom intrigues us.

00:54:09.450 --> 00:54:11.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: Exactly, it's
not "truthiness."

00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:12.842 align:middle line:90%
It's truth.

00:54:12.842 --> 00:54:14.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's truth,
and I know my son--

00:54:14.550 --> 00:54:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LAHR: We've had a
lot of truthiness.

00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:17.699 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I turned him
on to it in his late 20s,

00:54:17.699 --> 00:54:20.530 align:middle line:84%
and that still remains
one of his primary guides

00:54:20.530 --> 00:54:23.550 align:middle line:90%
today when he thinks of justice.

00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:25.910 align:middle line:84%
He's always taken back
to the life of Sekeeta,

00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:28.470 align:middle line:84%
once she grew up into
the role of pharaoh

00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:31.970 align:middle line:84%
and the way people
were weighed and viewed

00:54:31.970 --> 00:54:34.280 align:middle line:84%
in this really true
authentic system

00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:35.610 align:middle line:90%
of wholeness and justice.

00:54:35.610 --> 00:54:37.030 align:middle line:90%
It's so beautiful.

00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:39.550 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile we have other
things to chat about

00:54:39.550 --> 00:54:41.780 align:middle line:90%
because she wrote seven books.

00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:45.200 align:middle line:84%
And then there was
one subject she really

00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:48.430 align:middle line:84%
didn't choose to go into a lot,
so we're going to come back,

00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:51.720 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll do part
two of that conversation.

00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:52.695 align:middle line:90%
It's been fun so far.

00:54:52.695 --> 00:54:54.820 align:middle line:84%
I just love Joan Grant,
and I love that you're here

00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:56.070 align:middle line:90%
talking about her.

00:54:56.070 --> 00:54:58.340 align:middle line:10%
In our next conversation,
we'll discuss her life

00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:00.450 align:middle line:10%
as a Native American
and also the life

00:55:00.450 --> 00:55:02.110 align:middle line:10%
and times of Mary and Jesus.

00:55:02.110 --> 00:55:06.095 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.

00:55:06.095 --> 00:55:24.997 align:middle line:90%
