>>REGINA MEREDITH:
There are those among us

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.650 align:middle line:10%
who have had an open and alive
connection with other realms

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.330 align:middle line:10%
since the day they were born.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.030 align:middle line:84%
Often, that
connection shuts down

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.780 align:middle line:84%
while we go through
the process of finding

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.430 align:middle line:84%
our way through
the teenage years

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.800 align:middle line:84%
and into early adult life, only
to spring back into view when

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.110 align:middle line:90%
the time is right.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.120 align:middle line:84%
Belinda Womack is
one such person

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.890 align:middle line:84%
and she's with us today to speak
about the lessons she has been

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.290 align:middle line:90%
given by the 12 archangels.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say, I'm so
happy sitting here with you.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.090 align:middle line:84%
Jim Lehrer said, oh, you're
going to love this woman.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.430 align:middle line:84%
But just the conversations
we've had off-camera

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.350 align:middle line:84%
and then watching
how you're watching,

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.220 align:middle line:84%
watching how you're
assessing people

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.170 align:middle line:84%
and your levels of
sensitivity and such

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.715 align:middle line:90%
are really quite transparent.

00:01:10.715 --> 00:01:12.090 align:middle line:84%
It's like your
eyes and your skin

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.380 align:middle line:90%
are practically transparent.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.870 align:middle line:84%
So I think people are going
to enjoy getting to know you.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.880 align:middle line:84%
So let's start at the
beginning and what

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.105 align:middle line:84%
it was like for you
from birth, literally.

00:01:25.105 --> 00:01:27.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BELINDA WOMACK: Well,
Regina, I can remember.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.700 align:middle line:10%
This is actually
a delayed memory,

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.310 align:middle line:10%
but I can remember seeing
angels from the day I

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.500 align:middle line:10%
entered this incarnation.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.070 align:middle line:10%
And I needed those angels.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.780 align:middle line:84%
As many of us do, I signed
up for quite a childhood.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And as you shared
in your opening,

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.620 align:middle line:84%
I closed that
connection down when

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.750 align:middle line:84%
I was 12 because I decided I
was going to be a biologist

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.700 align:middle line:84%
and I was going to stand
in my logic and reason.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.650 align:middle line:84%
So that's when I tried to shut
the door-- to my sensitivities

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.470 align:middle line:84%
really was what I
was trying to do.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's go back into
what the sensitivities were

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.360 align:middle line:84%
from the time you were born,
how that appeared to you, how

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.410 align:middle line:84%
you interfaced with
it-- what your life was

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.220 align:middle line:84%
like in attendance
with these beings

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.720 align:middle line:84%
because most people
don't have this.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.594 align:middle line:84%
So they love to know
what that was like, what

00:02:21.594 --> 00:02:23.520 align:middle line:90%
the experience was like.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.500 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: Well, when
I was very little,

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.390 align:middle line:90%
I just believed in angels.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.880 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you that I remember
exactly what they looked like.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.090 align:middle line:84%
I just know that
they were with me.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.410 align:middle line:84%
But I was so
sensitive as a child

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.350 align:middle line:84%
that-- one of my
favorite stories--

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.830 align:middle line:84%
it's a little bit embarrassing
but I was around five,

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.480 align:middle line:90%
maybe six.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And my mother had a friend over
and I walked up to this woman.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.660 align:middle line:84%
They were having coffee or
probably a vodka and I said,

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, but you're
going to get a divorce.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what
a divorce is but would

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.536 align:middle line:84%
you like to sit down
and talk about it?

00:03:03.536 --> 00:03:04.336 align:middle line:90%
Because--

00:03:04.336 --> 00:03:05.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: With a five-year-old--

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.110 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: I was
so used to already

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.730 align:middle line:84%
being this counselor that just
picked up things about people

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.815 align:middle line:90%
and I just wanted to help them.

00:03:14.815 --> 00:03:15.940 align:middle line:90%
I just wanted to love them.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What happened there?

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: Oh, the friend of my
mother's got very, very upset.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.820 align:middle line:90%
She was shocked.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.350 align:middle line:84%
She said, there's something
wrong with your child

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:31.130 align:middle line:84%
and she told my mother that she
had to get me out of the room.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.250 align:middle line:84%
So that's probably
why I remember that.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were there other
times where what you saw,

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.090 align:middle line:84%
people were more
receptive to what you saw?

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And were they ever receptive
in your own family?

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.270 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: My family
now is very receptive.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.650 align:middle line:84%
I was pretty smart
as a little child.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.340 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm going to
keep this stuff to myself

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.630 align:middle line:84%
as much as I can because
I saw so many things.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And I would have
conversations with who

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.940 align:middle line:84%
I call now "Master Jesus"
and "Master Buddha."

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.087 align:middle line:84%
I would take walks in the woods
and see these two amazing--

00:04:12.087 --> 00:04:13.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Entities, yeah--

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.339 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: Entities that
they were just mostly light.

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:20.390 align:middle line:84%
They kind of looked
like male figures.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.100 align:middle line:90%
They were always together.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And so I would have
conversations with them.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.595 align:middle line:90%
And I--

00:04:26.595 --> 00:04:29.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What kind of
things did they tell you?

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: Oh, no one has
ever asked me that question.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.640 align:middle line:84%
They would say that
humanity is learning.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And I would say to Master
Jesus, I would say,

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.340 align:middle line:84%
you can't come back
because if you come back--

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.540 align:middle line:84%
I was raised in the Episcopal
tradition at that time.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.450 align:middle line:84%
If you can't come back, we'll
just do it all over again.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.350 align:middle line:84%
At that point in
time, I didn't realize

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.060 align:middle line:84%
that the whole resurrection
story was a myth

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.690 align:middle line:90%
and it was symbolic.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.400 align:middle line:90%
But I knew enough to know.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.270 align:middle line:84%
I said, this is all just
going to happen again.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.050 align:middle line:84%
I said, look, Jesus, we have
to figure it out for ourselves.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And I had that
conversation with him

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.710 align:middle line:84%
when I was 10
because I remember.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:24.540 align:middle line:84%
I said, you just need to
fill us all with that love

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.240 align:middle line:90%
and then we will get it.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.400 align:middle line:90%
We're going to figure this out.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
what we need to do.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.670 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, we're just going
to keep hurting each other.

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.080 align:middle line:90%
We have to do it ourselves.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.340 align:middle line:90%
And that was--

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.680 align:middle line:84%
Well that was quite
insightful for a young girl.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And what about
the being, Buddha?

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.740 align:middle line:84%
Did you have any insights
or exchanges there?

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: I didn't understand
who this best friend of Jesus

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.980 align:middle line:90%
was.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:05.180 align:middle line:84%
I just knew that he
made me really calm

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:10.060 align:middle line:84%
and that both of them had such
this amazing sense of humor.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.580 align:middle line:90%
And of course, they still do.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And they would tell me, it's
not all what it appears to be.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:25.410 align:middle line:84%
It's not always going to be
this challenging because again,

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:29.680 align:middle line:84%
things in my childhood
story were rich with trauma.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And they would reassure
me, it's not always

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.330 align:middle line:90%
going to be like this.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:35.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And why?

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.450 align:middle line:84%
What was going on
in your family?

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And why would such a
sensitive being-- why did you

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:43.520 align:middle line:90%
choose that?

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:49.520 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: Well, I believe that
I chose to come into my family

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:57.500 align:middle line:84%
because it's a rich heritage
of Celtic mysticism in my DNA.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And my parents were
so open-minded.

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:02.700 align:middle line:90%
They really were.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:07.700 align:middle line:84%
They were intellectuals
and they were alcoholics

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.820 align:middle line:84%
and they were brilliant
but they never

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.955 align:middle line:90%
shut me down, in that sense.

00:07:13.955 --> 00:07:15.004 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Perfect.

00:07:15.004 --> 00:07:16.170 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: Yeah, they didn't.

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that
that's why I picked them.

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:23.690 align:middle line:84%
They really didn't know me
but they didn't shut me down,

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:29.296 align:middle line:84%
even to the point of when the
angels came and drafted me

00:07:29.296 --> 00:07:30.920 align:middle line:84%
when I was-- that's
the way I call it--

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:36.440 align:middle line:84%
when I was working as a cell
biologist at a medical research

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.690 align:middle line:90%
institute.

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And that was during
my first Saturn return

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:43.970 align:middle line:90%
so I was 28 years old.

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:47.290 align:middle line:84%
I called up my
parents and I said,

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:50.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm leaving my work
as a biologist.

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And I had two master's degrees,
one in microbiology and one

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:56.810 align:middle line:90%
in environmental science.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And I was working as a cell
biologist, which I loved

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.090 align:middle line:90%
and I thought that was my life.

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And I called my dad and I said,
hey, I'm leaving this behind.

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:08.300 align:middle line:90%
And he said, OK.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.320 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, you've never
told a lie in your life

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.940 align:middle line:84%
and if you say
you talk to angels

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.110 align:middle line:84%
and you say that you
work with angels,

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:19.004 align:middle line:90%
then that's exactly what you do.

00:08:19.004 --> 00:08:20.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, was
there an event?

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:21.910 align:middle line:84%
I thought I had
read in your book

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:24.575 align:middle line:84%
that there was a kind of
out-of-body experience.

00:08:24.575 --> 00:08:25.640 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: Oh, yeah.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I know the kind
of room you're talking about.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:28.540 align:middle line:90%
I've been there.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.836 align:middle line:90%
Talk about that.

00:08:30.836 --> 00:08:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: So it
was a normal day.

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:34.770 align:middle line:84%
I was just doing a
routine experiment

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:39.450 align:middle line:84%
with actually preparing
a bone marrow sample.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:43.659 align:middle line:84%
And I call it my
"out-of-laboratory" experience.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And so I was holding the
syringe with one hand.

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:51.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm working in a sterile
hood and all of a sudden,

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:53.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm not in the lab anymore.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm not by the sterile hood.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:59.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm in a round room that
is very ancient-looking,

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.480 align:middle line:84%
with a dirt floor
and stone walls

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.510 align:middle line:90%
and I have no idea where I am.

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And this incredible
golden white light

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:17.050 align:middle line:84%
appears that's almost a feeling
as much as it is a color.

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And in that light
takes the form-- well,

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.200 align:middle line:90%
it's Archangel Gabriel.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And the only reason
I knew it was

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.550 align:middle line:90%
Gabriel because of the trumpet.

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, Gabriel
comes with a trumpet.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And the angel spoke
to me telepathically

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:37.860 align:middle line:90%
but with this energy.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.350 align:middle line:90%
My whole body was shaking.

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And I was so confused, Regina,
because I was like, well,

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:47.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm in a dirt room
and I'm supposed

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:50.480 align:middle line:84%
to be working with
sterile technique.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.870 align:middle line:90%
Where am I?

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:53.870 align:middle line:90%
I was definitely disoriented.

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And Gabriel said, Belinda, we
have new work for you to do.

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:03.100 align:middle line:84%
You are going to help
humanity to remember that they

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.640 align:middle line:90%
are God's divine children.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:09.350 align:middle line:84%
They've forgotten that
and as they remember,

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:15.380 align:middle line:84%
they will remember to
respect where they come from,

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.380 align:middle line:90%
what they're made out of.

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:21.590 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I don't have
the credentials for that.

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:23.260 align:middle line:90%
That's so what I said.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.620 align:middle line:84%
I said, that sounds
like I need a degree

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:27.960 align:middle line:90%
in psychology or something.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And Gabriel said, well,
all you need to know

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.910 align:middle line:90%
is in the book to your left.

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And so I turned to my left
and there was a stone table

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.460 align:middle line:90%
that was quite large.

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And on the stone
table was a book

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:52.070 align:middle line:84%
that my guess is it was three
feet wide and at least higher

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:55.825 align:middle line:84%
or deeper than a
foot-- so enormous.

00:10:55.825 --> 00:10:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh my gosh,
I'm supposed to know everything

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.360 align:middle line:90%
in this book?

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.370 align:middle line:84%
How many lifetimes is
that going to take me?

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And then the book opened up
before my eyes and in scarlet

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:12.210 align:middle line:84%
red-- I call it "holy
spirit"-- was the word "love"

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:13.810 align:middle line:90%
all on fire.

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:18.200 align:middle line:84%
I said, love-- I can
learn how to love.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.100 align:middle line:90%
I can do that.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And it seemed like I was in
this room for at least most

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:26.810 align:middle line:90%
of a day, if not even longer.

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:29.494 align:middle line:90%
And Gabriel said, we'll be back.

00:11:29.494 --> 00:11:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
what that meant.

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:33.990 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what the "we" was.

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And I was back in the lab
and again, my whole body

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:38.970 align:middle line:90%
was shaking.

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at my watch and
not even one minute had gone by.

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And that was my meeting
with the Archangel Gabriel.

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:52.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:53.790 align:middle line:90%
So now the story begins.

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:54.590 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: Yes.

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:57.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So then what happened?

00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:00.930 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: So it was
perhaps after a month

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:03.970 align:middle line:84%
that I had met the
Archangel Gabriel.

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:07.770 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what I
was supposed to do.

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:09.560 align:middle line:84%
I had just been given
this assignment,

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.810 align:middle line:84%
you're going to help
humanity, and I really

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:14.380 align:middle line:90%
didn't have a clue.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:18.580 align:middle line:84%
The next message came
from Archangel Michael,

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:23.040 align:middle line:84%
who I met Archangel Michael--
this was a little bit

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.000 align:middle line:90%
intimidating.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.860 align:middle line:84%
I was home just
not doing anything.

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:30.960 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of resting
and all of a sudden,

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:39.310 align:middle line:84%
with my eyes open, my bedroom
filled with sapphire blue eyes.

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:41.820 align:middle line:84%
The whole room was filled with
sapphire blue eyes looking

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:42.620 align:middle line:90%
at me.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:44.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You mean two huge
ones or a bunch of them?

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:45.430 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: Millions.

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:46.555 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Millions of them.

00:12:46.555 --> 00:12:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: Millions of them-- but
as I looked, I was like, well,

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:55.530 align:middle line:84%
they kind of look like wings,
like the eyes were covering

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:58.080 align:middle line:90%
these magnificent wings.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And then in a very
similar way to Gabriel,

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:04.870 align:middle line:84%
there was a voice that was
not outside of my head.

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:09.030 align:middle line:84%
It just came through as a
knowing but a very-- Archangel

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:13.340 align:middle line:84%
Michael's very
clear and grounding.

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:20.530 align:middle line:84%
And Michael said, you
can try to resist us

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:23.760 align:middle line:84%
but we are calling you
and we will let you

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:27.230 align:middle line:90%
know what your assignment is.

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:29.810 align:middle line:90%
But just trust.

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:35.440 align:middle line:84%
Just trust that everything
is as it needs to be.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And then I just started to
have all of these dreams

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:42.180 align:middle line:84%
and oh my goodness,
all these visitations,

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:44.480 align:middle line:84%
not just from the
angels but quite

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.890 align:middle line:90%
a number of ascended masters.

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:52.500 align:middle line:84%
Master Jesus came and woke
me up at 2:00 AM and said,

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.070 align:middle line:84%
I have to tell you something
about that resurrection story

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:56.995 align:middle line:90%
that you don't know.

00:13:56.995 --> 00:13:57.795 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Share.

00:13:57.795 --> 00:14:00.590 align:middle line:90%


00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:04.910 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: Said, I was a rabbi,
I was married to Mary Magdalena,

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:10.520 align:middle line:84%
we had three children, and
I didn't die on a cross.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:14.620 align:middle line:84%
It's symbolic, Belinda,
for the death of the ego.

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:19.360 align:middle line:84%
The ego must die in order for
it to come home to the heart,

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:25.330 align:middle line:84%
come home to the soul, to be
resurrected within oneness.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:31.550 align:middle line:84%
Our creator, Mother-Father
God, created the ego on purpose

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:32.350 align:middle line:90%
to believe.

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:36.080 align:middle line:84%
It is the part of the human
brain that has the ability

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.290 align:middle line:84%
to believe it is
separate from oneness

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:43.490 align:middle line:84%
so that it can discover
love and come back home

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:45.900 align:middle line:90%
to unity, to oneness.

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And so that is what death and
resurrection and ascension

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:52.330 align:middle line:90%
means.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.090 align:middle line:90%
So that was my big lesson.

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And again, my whole
body was shaking.

00:14:55.710 --> 00:15:01.400 align:middle line:84%
I was like, OK,
I'm not going crazy

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.340 align:middle line:84%
because this makes
such perfect sense.

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And whenever the
masters or the angels

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.400 align:middle line:84%
would come and
teach me-- because I

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.380 align:middle line:90%
wasn't reading books, Regina.

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:12.770 align:middle line:90%
They were teaching me.

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:15.960 align:middle line:84%
They were downloading
this information

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:23.940 align:middle line:84%
and it was all just so clear
and it made perfect sense.

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And even with the
angels, they would say,

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.980 align:middle line:84%
now, we understand
you need proof.

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:34.090 align:middle line:84%
You need tangible
proof that we exist.

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:38.640 align:middle line:84%
You knew us as a child but
now the rules have changed.

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:41.560 align:middle line:84%
So they said to me, so what's
the most impossible thing

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.760 align:middle line:90%
you can think of, Belinda?

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well-- and this may
sound kind of funny but I said,

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:49.130 align:middle line:84%
I want to be able
to go to the lab

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:53.590 align:middle line:84%
and work the hours that the
secretaries work because when

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:58.939 align:middle line:84%
you are in the technical
staff, we could get there

00:15:58.939 --> 00:16:01.230 align:middle line:84%
at 4:00 in the morning and
sometimes leave at midnight.

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:05.660 align:middle line:84%
It just depended
on what was needed.

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And I tell you, there wasn't
a time, no matter what I did,

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:18.955 align:middle line:84%
that I did not cross that
threshold before 9:00 AM.

00:16:18.955 --> 00:16:20.700 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing to me.

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:23.910 align:middle line:84%
I would get up
and be determined,

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:25.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to beat those angels.

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:27.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get there
by 7:00 this morning.

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:29.020 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't happen.

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
were out at 5:00.

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:31.830 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: I was out at 5:00.

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And they replaced me when
I left a few months later

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:40.050 align:middle line:84%
because the angel said,
we're going to show you

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:41.320 align:middle line:90%
when it's time to leave.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.690 align:middle line:84%
So it was about
five months later.

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:48.940 align:middle line:84%
It took them some
time because they had

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:50.490 align:middle line:90%
to replace me with four people.

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:53.894 align:middle line:84%
I was doing the work
of four scientists.

00:16:53.894 --> 00:16:54.810 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know that.

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:56.320 align:middle line:84%
They thought they were going
to be able to replace me

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.350 align:middle line:90%
with one person.

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:59.605 align:middle line:90%
But they discovered--

00:16:59.605 --> 00:17:02.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you were
working secretarial hours.

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:04.099 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: Right.

00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:05.660 align:middle line:90%
So that was my miracle.

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:09.579 align:middle line:84%
They kept giving me miracles
over and over and over

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:10.930 align:middle line:90%
and over and over.

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:14.050 align:middle line:84%
So I've shared with you how
I met Archangel Michael.

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And then I was invited
to go to an angel class.

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, well,
OK, I know two angels.

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:23.800 align:middle line:90%
I'll sign up for this.

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And at this angel class, we were
instructed to close our eyes

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:33.620 align:middle line:84%
and that in 90 minutes, we were
going to meet our one to three

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:35.350 align:middle line:90%
guardian angels.

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:41.250 align:middle line:84%
So I closed my eyes and
I saw this clear vision.

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:43.820 align:middle line:84%
There was my little
Belinda, my divine child

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:48.520 align:middle line:84%
that lives within me,
surrounded by 12 pillars

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.350 align:middle line:90%
of different colors of energy.

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And they started to sing and
they each gave her a gift.

00:17:56.460 --> 00:18:01.490 align:middle line:84%
So I knew immediately who they
were and they made that clear.

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And so then, time-wise,
that was at the end.

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:12.050 align:middle line:84%
I left working at the lab
about a month after that.

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And then I floundered
for a few months

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.660 align:middle line:84%
because I still didn't know
what I was supposed to do.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:19.720 align:middle line:90%
I was not independently wealthy.

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.680 align:middle line:84%
I was going to have
to earn my living

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.470 align:middle line:90%
and how was I going to do that?

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And I had some friends
thinking that I had really

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:29.220 align:middle line:90%
lost my marbles.

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:34.640 align:middle line:84%
But that's when I
learned you have to ask.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.440 align:middle line:90%
You have to ask.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:39.980 align:middle line:84%
So I went to this
committee of 12 angels

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:42.060 align:middle line:90%
and I said, OK, I work for you.

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:45.134 align:middle line:90%
You're my employers.

00:18:45.134 --> 00:18:46.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What do we do now?

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:47.100 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: Right.

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.284 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not into
playing the lottery

00:18:49.284 --> 00:18:50.700 align:middle line:84%
and I was living
in North Carolina

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:51.870 align:middle line:90%
and we don't have that here.

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:53.890 align:middle line:90%
So what's your plan?

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:58.680 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, we want
you to go to your computer.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And so I channeled
this little booklet

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:05.900 align:middle line:84%
from different angels
and different masters.

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:08.645 align:middle line:84%
And they said, OK, now you're
going to teach a class.

00:19:08.645 --> 00:19:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, well, who am
I going to teach the class to?

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:14.710 align:middle line:84%
But I shared this
information and sure enough,

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:17.860 align:middle line:84%
the people came and
I taught a class.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And one of the women that
came to that very first class

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:25.590 align:middle line:84%
that I taught called
me up on the phone

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:29.750 align:middle line:84%
and she was having
difficulty with her work.

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:32.690 align:middle line:84%
She actually sold
machinery, which was not

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:34.880 align:middle line:90%
common for a female to do.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And out of my mouth-- the way
angels can make things come out

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:42.877 align:middle line:84%
of our mouths-- I said, well,
I can help you with that.

00:19:42.877 --> 00:19:44.460 align:middle line:84%
Which you like to
make an appointment?

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:46.990 align:middle line:90%


00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out her guardian
angel's name was "Easy Road."

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:52.567 align:middle line:90%
I will always remember that.

00:19:52.567 --> 00:19:54.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so that
was your first client.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.670 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: That was 25 years ago.

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And so since that time,
I've worked with individuals

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:04.990 align:middle line:84%
from all walks of life,
helping them to see

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:07.540 align:middle line:90%
we create our own reality.

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:14.680 align:middle line:84%
We do and there is a fast way
to evolve and to transform.

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And it all comes home
to the child within us

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:22.720 align:middle line:84%
because that child is symbolic
for a part of our brains

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:28.680 align:middle line:84%
that rules-- or rules-- opens
us to the subconscious as well

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:33.710 align:middle line:84%
as the super conscious and can
unlock our past that is still

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:35.490 align:middle line:90%
creating our present.

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:38.590 align:middle line:84%
The angels say, as
the masters say,

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:41.660 align:middle line:84%
as many teachers
say, we human beings,

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:47.590 align:middle line:84%
we create our present with our
past because like the creator,

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:53.010 align:middle line:84%
we create with our thoughts, our
belief systems, our feelings.

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:57.400 align:middle line:84%
We are co-creators What we
human beings like to do,

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:01.130 align:middle line:84%
because we have that amazing
ego and that ego thinks

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:07.570 align:middle line:84%
in past, present, and future,
we keep creating the past

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:11.420 align:middle line:84%
and we keep bringing
it into the present.

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's what humanity
continues to do.

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.820 align:middle line:84%
So if we want to
make a difference,

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:23.570 align:middle line:84%
because we are all one, we
transform our own past swiftly

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:25.390 align:middle line:90%
but it does take determination.

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:28.090 align:middle line:84%
You've got to learn to
love transformation.

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:34.990 align:middle line:84%
But as we do that, our reality
changes and that tangible proof

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:39.880 align:middle line:84%
that our lives change, that wow,
they dramatically get better,

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:43.820 align:middle line:84%
then that can fuel our
human spirits to say,

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:47.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to keep doing
this transformation.

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:49.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to keep doing it.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And we are transforming
the past for all concerned.

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:58.200 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the 12 archangels,
they believe in humanity.

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:03.040 align:middle line:84%
They believe that yes, we can
because there are enough of us

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:06.180 align:middle line:90%
willing to do this work.

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So can you
speak about the process

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:13.330 align:middle line:84%
of that transformation that can
happen gracefully and quickly

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:16.160 align:middle line:90%
if one is open to it?

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:19.680 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: Well, as the
angels talk about in "Lessons

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:25.520 align:middle line:84%
from the 12 Archangels," when
we are like little children

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:28.750 align:middle line:84%
and we work with our
creative imagination

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:32.150 align:middle line:84%
and these amazing spiritual
batteries of energy

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:34.050 align:middle line:84%
that God has blessed
us with called

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:39.210 align:middle line:84%
"chakras," these
batteries of energy

00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:41.460 align:middle line:90%
make all things possible.

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And one of the favorite ones
that they like to work with

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.390 align:middle line:84%
is the chakra that's at the
top of our heads, the crown

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:52.120 align:middle line:90%
chakra, and the color violet.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And they're not-- I have to
say, angels are not picky.

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.710 align:middle line:84%
If you want to
work with lavender

00:22:56.710 --> 00:23:01.560 align:middle line:84%
or periwinkle or purple
or violet, it all works.

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And when we just
imagine that color

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:09.670 align:middle line:84%
and we put our past in the
color purple or in violet,

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:11.950 align:middle line:84%
things change
dramatically for us.

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:17.590 align:middle line:84%
I just taught a little class
in New York City at Namaste

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:20.890 align:middle line:84%
and I was amazed because the
angels came in and they say,

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:25.850 align:middle line:84%
we are just going to send
a violet fire tidal wave

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:28.970 align:middle line:84%
through every person
here and we're just

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:32.230 align:middle line:84%
going to transform
your past right now.

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:38.000 align:middle line:84%
So all you need to do is
say the words "I forgive."

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.030 align:middle line:90%
"I forgive it all."

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:42.980 align:middle line:90%
Just repeat that.

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:48.690 align:middle line:84%
It can be very gentle and very
kind, this transformation.

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And the color violet, which
is the energy of forgiveness

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:57.870 align:middle line:84%
and it is the energy
of transformation

00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:01.040 align:middle line:90%
makes it effortless.

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:04.850 align:middle line:84%
Sure, it still helps us,
that ego to get in there

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:08.200 align:middle line:84%
and to say, well, I was
really hurt as a child

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:12.440 align:middle line:84%
or I remember this past life
or hey, look at this baggage

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:14.760 align:middle line:90%
I got from these ancestors.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:18.360 align:middle line:90%
But the key is to forgive it.

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that
consciously, even though we

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:25.330 align:middle line:84%
don't know what we're
forgiving, because forgiveness

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:28.960 align:middle line:84%
is an energy and the only
energy that the angels work

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:34.310 align:middle line:84%
with is the power of love,
that forgiveness, that violet

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:37.720 align:middle line:84%
fire of the crown chakra,
it knows where to go.

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.230 align:middle line:90%
It knows how to go into the DNA.

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:41.530 align:middle line:84%
It knows how to go into
all those secret hiding

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:44.160 align:middle line:84%
places where we're holding
onto that resentment

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.500 align:middle line:90%
and guilt and the unforgiving.

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:50.026 align:middle line:84%
It can find it
through our intention

00:24:50.026 --> 00:24:55.120 align:middle line:84%
and again, being like a little
child and saying, all right,

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:56.680 align:middle line:90%
I'd like some happiness.

00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:00.171 align:middle line:84%
I'll sign up for that
happy childhood, thank you.

00:25:00.171 --> 00:25:01.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mmm, beautiful.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
I'll get into a little bit

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:06.670 align:middle line:84%
later is the nature of the
meditations in this book

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:08.380 align:middle line:90%
because there are a lot of them.

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And they're absolutely
stunning in the cleanliness

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:16.670 align:middle line:84%
and the vibration,
the frequency--

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:18.650 align:middle line:90%
very high frequencies.

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And so I totally
appreciated that.

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:25.090 align:middle line:84%
What I'd like to do is now,
for people that are thinking,

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:29.230 align:middle line:84%
hmm, I wonder how I can get more
in communication with my angels

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:31.620 align:middle line:84%
and guides and so forth,
let's talk about some

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:34.950 align:middle line:84%
of the more nuts and bolts
or practical elements

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:39.020 align:middle line:84%
of how we go about accessing
that because most people say,

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:43.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to listen to
an angel because, number one,

00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:46.230 align:middle line:84%
they haven't been trained
as to what to look for.

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:48.490 align:middle line:84%
So let's go through
a little course

00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:51.260 align:middle line:84%
on how we begin that
communication because so

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:52.230 align:middle line:90%
many people feel alone.

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:56.590 align:middle line:84%
They don't recognize they have
amazing beings surrounding them

00:25:56.590 --> 00:26:00.460 align:middle line:90%
right there at their disposal.

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:03.190 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: So just a
little introduction

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:09.840 align:middle line:84%
about the 12 archangels-- the 12
archangels work as a committee.

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And they say, don't get
caught up in our names.

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.770 align:middle line:90%
Our names are not important.

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:15.770 align:middle line:90%
It's our number that matters.

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:18.700 align:middle line:84%
We represent a cycle,
just like the 12 months

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:22.560 align:middle line:84%
of the year, the 12
signs of the zodiac--

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.150 align:middle line:90%
the 12 hours on a clock face.

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:30.610 align:middle line:84%
We exist to help
humanity to evolve.

00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:34.100 align:middle line:84%
They also exist to help
hold the universe together

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:39.870 align:middle line:84%
but they are here to
help us human beings

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:45.760 align:middle line:84%
to remember that we are
God's divine children.

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:52.020 align:middle line:84%
They say that angels are equal
in power to human beings.

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:56.060 align:middle line:84%
Please, they say, please
don't put human beings

00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:59.270 align:middle line:90%
as lower than an amoeba.

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:03.610 align:middle line:84%
Amoebas are important,
too, because all atoms,

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:08.280 align:middle line:84%
all particles of God's
energy are created from love.

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:11.770 align:middle line:84%
Here on planet Earth, which
is an amazing schoolroom,

00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:14.130 align:middle line:84%
we get to experience
the opposite of love.

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:15.870 align:middle line:90%
It's a school of duality.

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:19.250 align:middle line:90%
So we get to experience fear.

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:24.760 align:middle line:84%
So they understand about
the ego and they say,

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:29.710 align:middle line:84%
the ego in its nature wants
to believe it's alone.

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:34.800 align:middle line:84%
It thinks it's separate from
its body, from its emotions--

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.870 align:middle line:90%
from its past.

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:38.750 align:middle line:84%
That's the way
that the ego works.

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:43.600 align:middle line:84%
So the main thing about
working with angels

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:49.480 align:middle line:84%
is just to say, OK,
if you exist, help me.

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:56.300 align:middle line:84%
Those words, "help me,"
make everything change,

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.560 align:middle line:90%
Regina-- everything change.

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:04.300 align:middle line:84%
So whether we believe
or we don't believe,

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:09.710 align:middle line:84%
asking for help from the angelic
realms which cover-- they

00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:13.600 align:middle line:84%
are so omnipresent
here on our planet.

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:16.870 align:middle line:84%
They live in our
animals, in our trees--

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:20.530 align:middle line:84%
we have a nature
angel in our bodies.

00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:23.240 align:middle line:84%
We have guardian angels
that travel with us

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.630 align:middle line:90%
incarnation after incarnation.

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we have
these 12 archangels

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:31.620 align:middle line:84%
that are helping our
personal evolution

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:34.600 align:middle line:84%
and our corporal-- meaning
the whole human body--

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:37.120 align:middle line:90%
helping us to evolve.

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:41.750 align:middle line:84%
So they say, it begins
by saying, I need help

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:43.340 align:middle line:90%
and that's the first thing.

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:45.850 align:middle line:90%
I need help and I surrender.

00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Those two words,
"I surrender" make

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:54.930 align:middle line:84%
it so helpful for angels
to step into our movies

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:58.510 align:middle line:84%
and to help us to change
our reality because we

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:00.980 align:middle line:90%
are creating our lives.

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And so if we say, I
surrender and help me,

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:10.170 align:middle line:84%
that allows these kind of
awesome, wonderful executive

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:12.690 align:middle line:84%
producers to step
in and to help us

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:15.510 align:middle line:84%
to change the movie
we are dreaming,

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:17.120 align:middle line:90%
the movie we are writing.

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:17.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And I am constantly
amazed throughout my life

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:26.690 align:middle line:84%
when I say, hey, I need
some help with this one.

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:28.690 align:middle line:84%
Or even if I don't ask,
they know me well enough

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:30.240 align:middle line:90%
to know where I do.

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:37.180 align:middle line:84%
And the degree of creativity
to which they solve problems

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:38.860 align:middle line:84%
is mind boggling
to me all the time.

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:40.710 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I could
have never come up

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:42.020 align:middle line:90%
with that as a solution.

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:43.600 align:middle line:90%
That is brilliant.

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:49.160 align:middle line:84%
It's far beyond anything that
we would calculate on our own.

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:52.800 align:middle line:10%
>>WOMACK: But at the same time,
we're not giving our power away

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:55.060 align:middle line:10%
and they really make--
this is important,

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:59.700 align:middle line:10%
that they work through us,
through the concept of oneness,

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:02.340 align:middle line:10%
which, again, is
challenging for the ego

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:06.020 align:middle line:10%
to understand because the
ego thinks, hey, I'm it.

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:10.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm me and you're you and you're
over there and I'm over here.

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:13.570 align:middle line:90%
But really, we are all one.

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:15.520 align:middle line:90%
We are so connected.

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And so when we just
ask for help and we

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:25.665 align:middle line:84%
ask for help whatever the
problem is-- and as you know,

00:30:25.665 --> 00:30:29.950 align:middle line:84%
the more we ask, the
easier it becomes

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:34.520 align:middle line:84%
because our egos are starting
to realize, there's help for me.

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:38.300 align:middle line:84%
There's help and the more I
ask, then that help shows up.

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And then the ego begins to
be just like a scientist.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.820 align:middle line:84%
We start to see the proof,
the proof that we are helped.

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:49.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we have
to be willing to let

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.849 align:middle line:84%
go of our attachments when
we're given information.

00:30:52.849 --> 00:30:54.640 align:middle line:84%
It might not be the
thing we wanted to hear

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:58.690 align:middle line:84%
but it's exactly the thing that
we need in that moment, too.

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:02.540 align:middle line:84%
So there is that surrender
of ego even on that level.

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:04.640 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about how
the information comes in

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:08.630 align:middle line:84%
because you speak about how
it kind of spills and you

00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:11.900 align:middle line:84%
experience it on the right
side, through the right side

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:12.700 align:middle line:90%
of the brain.

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's the same
way I experience it.

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:16.090 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:18.410 align:middle line:84%
It's just like a
melding of something

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:20.690 align:middle line:84%
running through that
side of the brain.

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:22.370 align:middle line:84%
But for everyone,
it's different.

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:23.840 align:middle line:90%
And maybe you know.

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:24.640 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you see.

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.810 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you hear.

00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:28.480 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the different ways

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:31.470 align:middle line:90%
in which we know that we know.

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:36.100 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: So the angels
teach us that again,

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:39.420 align:middle line:84%
the more we can be
like a little child

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:44.740 align:middle line:84%
and to have that openness,
that innocence to try something

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:48.930 align:middle line:84%
new, for example, to
say, I'm willing to try

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:52.620 align:middle line:84%
to connect with my
angels and my loved ones

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:55.410 align:middle line:84%
in heaven-- we have
all of our ancestors

00:31:55.410 --> 00:32:00.620 align:middle line:84%
and we each have a whole
committee of great help

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:06.170 align:middle line:84%
that are co-directing our
movies, helping us to learn.

00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:13.130 align:middle line:84%
So when we can just close
our eyes and imagine a color,

00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:17.080 align:middle line:84%
any color of God's
rainbow, that helps

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:20.950 align:middle line:84%
to awaken the creative
hemisphere of the mind,

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:24.600 align:middle line:84%
the creative-- and I know
hemispheres are cliche

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:26.790 align:middle line:90%
but it helps to make it simple.

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:29.430 align:middle line:84%
So we have this
part of our brain

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:32.570 align:middle line:84%
that it's not
exactly in opposition

00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:35.970 align:middle line:84%
to the logical,
rational hemisphere

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:39.680 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't think in
past and present and future.

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:46.110 align:middle line:84%
It thinks in color and it thinks
in energy and it thinks in love

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:48.207 align:middle line:90%
and it thinks in the now.

00:32:48.207 --> 00:32:50.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
the creative part, too.

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:51.456 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: And
that's the creative.

00:32:51.456 --> 00:32:53.190 align:middle line:90%
Yes, thank you so much.

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:59.020 align:middle line:84%
The creative is what connects us
with the heart of the universe.

00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And so when we want to
communicate with spirit,

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:08.080 align:middle line:84%
it really does help
to awaken and to use

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:09.570 align:middle line:90%
that part of our mind.

00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:12.410 align:middle line:84%
Einstein says, human
beings, sometimes we only

00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:14.250 align:middle line:90%
use 10% percent of our brains.

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:18.310 align:middle line:84%
But when you start to work
with that creative imagination

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:22.200 align:middle line:84%
and that intuition just
starts to open and flow,

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:26.270 align:middle line:84%
then we use much more
of that amazing mind

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:29.110 align:middle line:84%
that God has blessed us
with, as you well know.

00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And so the more we do
that, we work with colors

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:35.780 align:middle line:84%
and we work with
intention-- and gratitude

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:38.110 align:middle line:90%
is a big piece of this.

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:41.850 align:middle line:84%
That gratitude is the
attitude that really

00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:44.130 align:middle line:90%
will shift our vibration.

00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:51.420 align:middle line:84%
It makes it easier for that
creative, spiritual, intuitive

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:55.410 align:middle line:84%
hemisphere to bring
through the guidance.

00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:58.610 align:middle line:84%
So how do we communicate
with the other side

00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:01.580 align:middle line:84%
because the other side
is just a vibration away?

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:05.870 align:middle line:84%
It's where there's just love,
just pure unconditional love.

00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:07.290 align:middle line:90%
Here on the Earth, we have fear.

00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:10.279 align:middle line:90%
So it's a bit like sludge.

00:34:10.279 --> 00:34:11.219 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:13.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: And if we
can think of heaven

00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:18.449 align:middle line:84%
as a reality of pure love,
that's like flowing water.

00:34:18.449 --> 00:34:24.960 align:middle line:84%
So as we hold that
intention to ask spirit

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:29.250 align:middle line:84%
to fill us with love, to
begin our day with-- this

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:32.469 align:middle line:84%
is my personal favorite-- thank
you, thank you, thank you,

00:34:32.469 --> 00:34:37.420 align:middle line:84%
Mother-Father God that my life
gets better by the hour today

00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:41.699 align:middle line:84%
and we just feel our vibration
rising up and we say,

00:34:41.699 --> 00:34:44.960 align:middle line:84%
thank you, thank you,
angels for helping me,

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:49.400 align:middle line:84%
even if you don't see them,
you're going to start to know.

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:52.989 align:middle line:84%
So that guidance is going to
come through as a knowing.

00:34:52.989 --> 00:34:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And the angels say that
that's the clearest form

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.341 align:middle line:90%
of the clairs.

00:34:58.341 --> 00:34:59.840 align:middle line:84%
They call it the
"clair," which just

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:02.190 align:middle line:90%
means "to experience beyond."

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:05.390 align:middle line:84%
So there's "clairvoyants"
to "see beyond."

00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:06.790 align:middle line:90%
Those are the visionaries.

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:09.890 align:middle line:84%
There's "clairgnosis,"
to "know beyond."

00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:12.380 align:middle line:84%
There's "clairsentience,"
to "feel beyond,"

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:14.690 align:middle line:84%
"clairaudience,"
to "hear beyond,"

00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:17.040 align:middle line:84%
and I never forget how
to pronounce the one that

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.999 align:middle line:90%
tells you you "smell beyond."

00:35:18.999 --> 00:35:20.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I don't know, either.

00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:21.640 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: But when we know
it in our guts, which means

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:31.510 align:middle line:84%
we know it and we feel
it, what the 12 archangels

00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:37.140 align:middle line:84%
teach us is that is the most
precise and accurate truth

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:39.610 align:middle line:84%
that you are bringing in
because you are getting

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:43.110 align:middle line:90%
that double confirmation.

00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:45.760 align:middle line:90%
We human beings, we're physical.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:48.710 align:middle line:84%
So when we feel
it, whether that's

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:53.290 align:middle line:84%
emotionally we feel an expansion
or physically we feel it

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:58.440 align:middle line:84%
in our guts, that knowing
whatever has come through--

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:02.150 align:middle line:84%
like when I was a child--
and I'm sure this is

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:08.080 align:middle line:84%
true for yourself-- when you
experience things as a child,

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:09.700 align:middle line:90%
you don't question it.

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.600 align:middle line:90%
It's like, yes, I feel it.

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:16.700 align:middle line:84%
So when we experience things
as a child, we trust it.

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:17.580 align:middle line:90%
We know it.

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:19.240 align:middle line:90%
We feel that truth.

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:23.370 align:middle line:84%
We don't go into that ego,
that grown-up ego that

00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:26.576 align:middle line:90%
says, oh, I can't believe this.

00:36:26.576 --> 00:36:29.230 align:middle line:90%
I need to doubt that.

00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:33.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And for you, you say
that when information is coming

00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:35.340 align:middle line:84%
through and sometimes
it feels distorted,

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:38.250 align:middle line:84%
your whole body will
start contracting

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:41.190 align:middle line:84%
and that's how you know
that something's distorted.

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:42.820 align:middle line:84%
You're not getting
the message clearly.

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is a good
point to make in having

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:48.220 align:middle line:84%
people understand
how to discern when

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:50.230 align:middle line:90%
they're hearing truth or not.

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:54.720 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: So truth for me is
a very, very clear and precise

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:55.610 align:middle line:90%
feeling.

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:56.960 align:middle line:90%
I can breathe.

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.940 align:middle line:90%
I feel expanded.

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:07.150 align:middle line:84%
I feel that I am surrounded
and filled and in love.

00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:09.360 align:middle line:84%
That's what truth
feels like for me.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And anything less than
that feels like fear.

00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:21.070 align:middle line:84%
So I feel contracted, I can
feel dizzy, I can feel nauseous,

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:27.520 align:middle line:84%
I can feel confused, and that's
how I know this is not truth.

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:29.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not
coming through clearly.

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: It's not
coming through clearly.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's also the case
if I'm communicating

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:39.320 align:middle line:84%
with another human being
or I'm reading something.

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:43.300 align:middle line:84%
I can really feel if
it's truth, if it's

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:47.250 align:middle line:84%
got some truth and
some not truth in it,

00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:50.260 align:middle line:90%
and we all have that ability.

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:55.480 align:middle line:90%
I believe that I use it.

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.520 align:middle line:90%
It's like a muscle.

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:57.840 align:middle line:90%
Intuition is a muscle.

00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:01.250 align:middle line:84%
So the more you use
it-- and I needed

00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:03.410 align:middle line:90%
it to survive in my childhood.

00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:06.100 align:middle line:90%
I needed to stay aware.

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:12.410 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that for those of
us who live by our intuition,

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:17.330 align:middle line:84%
it's because we really
do live and honor life

00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:22.070 align:middle line:84%
by trusting that that
inner voice, that truth,

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:26.790 align:middle line:84%
is always guiding us and helping
us to make those choices that

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:28.435 align:middle line:90%
are for our greatest good.

00:38:28.435 --> 00:38:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And in this
whole process where

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:35.320 align:middle line:84%
one is learning to attune and
be sensitive and pay attention

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:38.640 align:middle line:84%
to the feelings and which
of the clairs they are,

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:43.100 align:middle line:84%
really the chief
component that shuts

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:47.400 align:middle line:84%
that down is fear because
we're immediately contracted.

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:50.850 align:middle line:90%
We're not open to that.

00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:52.950 align:middle line:84%
Like you say, it's one of
the dominant frequencies

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:54.760 align:middle line:90%
on this planet is fear.

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:58.150 align:middle line:84%
So again, would you recommend
the same thing, using

00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:00.130 align:middle line:84%
the color and such,
to help people

00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:02.700 align:middle line:84%
just get out of the fearful
zone because sometimes, they'll

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:04.074 align:middle line:84%
want to go talk
with their guides

00:39:04.074 --> 00:39:07.210 align:middle line:84%
because they're in
fear over something?

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:11.510 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: So definitely
stay in the colors.

00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:13.260 align:middle line:90%
Stay in the divine love.

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:15.210 align:middle line:90%
So divine love comes in colors.

00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:17.360 align:middle line:84%
It's the colors
of God's rainbow.

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:21.660 align:middle line:84%
You really want to anchor in
that love, in that vibration.

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:26.000 align:middle line:84%
So you want to practice
feeling what love feels like

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.822 align:middle line:90%
and it feels wonderful.

00:39:27.822 --> 00:39:32.930 align:middle line:84%
It feels like pure childhood
happiness and freedom.

00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:35.910 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that
I feel is important,

00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:40.750 align:middle line:84%
Regina, is that we need to be
here now because sometimes when

00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:44.130 align:middle line:84%
we communicate with our
guides and our angels

00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:49.440 align:middle line:84%
and we've got some contamination
there from the wounded ego that

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:53.520 align:middle line:84%
wants to be powerful
or successful

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:59.040 align:middle line:84%
or become a billionaire
overnight, if we are grounded

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:03.390 align:middle line:84%
in the here and now, that's
when that intuition will say,

00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:06.150 align:middle line:90%
this is your next step.

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:10.060 align:middle line:84%
The flow from our committee
of guides and angels

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:13.540 align:middle line:84%
is very grounded
and very practical

00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:17.870 align:middle line:84%
and makes very good common
sense and only communicates

00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:20.160 align:middle line:90%
from a place of love.

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:22.260 align:middle line:84%
You're never going
to get a message that

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:30.130 align:middle line:84%
says, do something-- make this
choice because it will make you

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:31.630 align:middle line:90%
better than someone else.

00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:34.330 align:middle line:84%
They just don't
communicate in that way.

00:40:34.330 --> 00:40:41.140 align:middle line:84%
It's such a place of true
compassion and loving kindness.

00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And so what I teach
my students and when

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:49.500 align:middle line:84%
I work with my clients, I
say, you have to practice it.

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And again, you can
ask for confirmation

00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:56.860 align:middle line:84%
by connecting to that child
that lives within your heart

00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:59.330 align:middle line:84%
because then it comes
through as a feeling.

00:40:59.330 --> 00:41:00.570 align:middle line:90%
And does it feel good?

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:01.770 align:middle line:90%
And does it feel loving?

00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:03.410 align:middle line:90%
And does it feel kind?

00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And is it grounded
in the here and now?

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:07.920 align:middle line:90%
And does it make common sense?

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:09.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:12.370 align:middle line:84%
Right on-- wonderful,
wonderful explanation of it.

00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:14.350 align:middle line:84%
Another thing you talk
about is that when

00:41:14.350 --> 00:41:16.060 align:middle line:84%
the ego, that part
that's like, oh,

00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:17.280 align:middle line:90%
I want to be rich overnight.

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:18.140 align:middle line:90%
I want to be famous.

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:19.260 align:middle line:90%
I want to be powerful.

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:21.260 align:middle line:84%
I want everyone to
admire me, that part,

00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:24.210 align:middle line:84%
which is just the out of
balance part-- the ego

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:28.210 align:middle line:84%
itself is just the individuated
collection of experiences

00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:31.100 align:middle line:84%
that we've had throughout
our personal history.

00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:34.580 align:middle line:84%
It's not in and of
itself dark or negative

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:39.640 align:middle line:90%
or even self-centered per se.

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:41.620 align:middle line:84%
But it is individuated,
like you say,

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:44.530 align:middle line:84%
and that can cause that
sense of separation.

00:41:44.530 --> 00:41:48.750 align:middle line:84%
But as you say in the book,
the ego that's in balance

00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:52.690 align:middle line:84%
will defer to that
intuitive process always.

00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:54.170 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: Absolutely.

00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:55.040 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:59.170 align:middle line:84%
The ego wants to come
home to the heart.

00:41:59.170 --> 00:42:01.420 align:middle line:90%
We all want to belong.

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:03.880 align:middle line:90%
We all want to be accepted.

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:06.450 align:middle line:84%
The angels talk about
that human beings--

00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:11.020 align:middle line:84%
especially that human ego needs
three things for survival,

00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:14.340 align:middle line:84%
attention, affection,
and acknowledgement.

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:16.290 align:middle line:90%
That's what the ego needs.

00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And then it comes home
and it quiets down

00:42:18.830 --> 00:42:23.930 align:middle line:84%
and it says, OK, intuition,
OK, heart and soul-- intuition

00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:27.410 align:middle line:84%
is the voice of the heart
and soul-- I'll listen.

00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:29.530 align:middle line:90%
I'll step out of fear.

00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And we know when we're out
of fear when we breathe.

00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:38.430 align:middle line:84%
When the ego is in a place
of-- that's what causes the ego

00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:39.977 align:middle line:90%
to be separated is fear.

00:42:39.977 --> 00:42:41.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:42.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: And then
we hold our breath

00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:43.723 align:middle line:90%
and you can feel it immediately.

00:42:43.723 --> 00:42:45.080 align:middle line:90%
It's like, oh, goodness, OK.

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:46.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everything's
clamping down.

00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:47.648 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: Yep, not
breathing again.

00:42:47.648 --> 00:42:50.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Closing in on us--
so breath is another good one.

00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:52.410 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about
some specifics that

00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:55.030 align:middle line:84%
have been-- where information's
been shared with you

00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:57.680 align:middle line:90%
by the archangelic realm.

00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do with a
couple things and one of them

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:05.400 align:middle line:84%
is the soul and the
subject of miscarriage.

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:07.560 align:middle line:90%
And what's happening there?

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:13.190 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: So the way that the
12 archangels present this to us

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:18.270 align:middle line:84%
is they say that when
a soul is incarnating,

00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:23.520 align:middle line:84%
the soul will travel back
and forth between the realm

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:29.690 align:middle line:84%
of heaven and the realm of
Earth until the soul says,

00:43:29.690 --> 00:43:31.980 align:middle line:90%
yes, I'm going to stay.

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And so when we begin
any incarnation,

00:43:36.810 --> 00:43:39.900 align:middle line:84%
we actually begin as a cell
from our mother and a cell

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:41.130 align:middle line:90%
from our father.

00:43:41.130 --> 00:43:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And then that's when
soul starts to come in.

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:48.220 align:middle line:84%
So if the soul says-- soul
gives the spark of life.

00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:52.680 align:middle line:90%
But if soul says, I'm not ready.

00:43:52.680 --> 00:44:00.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to stay-- then
what happens is then that fetus

00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:01.960 align:middle line:84%
or that zygote--
it may not even be

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:07.640 align:middle line:84%
at the state of the fetus
at that time-- is just

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:08.440 align:middle line:90%
going to leave.

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:11.620 align:middle line:84%
So either through a
natural miscarriage

00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:13.920 align:middle line:84%
or through the
choice of abortion,

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:17.590 align:middle line:84%
what needs to be remembered,
according to the 12 archangels,

00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:22.560 align:middle line:84%
is it's all been agreed on
because the soul is in control.

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:26.140 align:middle line:84%
The soul is in control
of when it incarnates

00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:28.050 align:middle line:90%
and when it leaves.

00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:29.780 align:middle line:84%
So even in the
case-- which I know

00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:31.620 align:middle line:84%
you didn't ask this
question-- but even

00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:36.390 align:middle line:84%
in the case of if
there's a suicide,

00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:40.070 align:middle line:84%
the angels make it
very clear that soul

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:43.630 align:middle line:84%
has given that
individual permission

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:45.860 align:middle line:90%
to step out of that movie.

00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:49.790 align:middle line:84%
Life has become-- the drama
has become too intense.

00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And so that human
being, not only

00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:57.710 align:middle line:90%
do they have permission to exit.

00:44:57.710 --> 00:45:00.760 align:middle line:90%
They're supported in leaving.

00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that can be
traumatic for us, just as

00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:06.220 align:middle line:90%
in the case of a miscarriage.

00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:08.680 align:middle line:84%
But again, what's most
important to remember

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:12.260 align:middle line:84%
is when we step into
this life, we're

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:16.320 align:middle line:84%
stepping in on a movie
set or into a dream.

00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And we are learning and learning
and learning and learning.

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:28.120 align:middle line:84%
So if we step in for a
moment because the mother

00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:32.890 align:middle line:84%
or the parents have something
to learn by our quick exit,

00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:34.140 align:middle line:90%
as in the case of if a child--

00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:35.014 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Stillborn--

00:45:35.014 --> 00:45:36.200 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: Right-- or

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.366 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very challenging--

00:45:37.366 --> 00:45:44.480 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: Exactly or someone
dies in childhood, very often,

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:46.960 align:middle line:84%
I've found that that's
actually an angelic soul.

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:50.350 align:middle line:84%
Souls have their own
musical frequency.

00:45:50.350 --> 00:45:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's because that
human being said, well,

00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:55.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to be here long.

00:45:55.590 --> 00:46:00.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm coming in to give a
message, to teach a lesson,

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:03.890 align:middle line:84%
and then I'm going to return
to heaven because that's

00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:04.950 align:middle line:90%
where I want to be.

00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's true for
our pets, as well.

00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:11.770 align:middle line:84%
So it's hard for us because
again, that human being

00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:15.400 align:middle line:84%
gets so attached to this
physical vessel that we're in.

00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And the angels do teach,
respect your physical bodies.

00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:23.490 align:middle line:90%
Remember it is God's vessel.

00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:25.755 align:middle line:90%
God created you in God's image.

00:46:25.755 --> 00:46:27.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's your temple.

00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: Exactly, you are
a temple so respect that.

00:46:30.370 --> 00:46:35.390 align:middle line:84%
But when it is time to exit
this movie, don't fight it.

00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:36.470 align:middle line:90%
It's time.

00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:37.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And they also said that
regarding the vessel,

00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:46.070 align:middle line:84%
there's going to come a
time when we can transform

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:50.580 align:middle line:84%
our physicality, which, from my
understanding, we do, anyway.

00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:52.960 align:middle line:84%
We're tweaking those
frequencies before we

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:56.800 align:middle line:84%
come into the physical body once
that decision or agreement is

00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:59.050 align:middle line:84%
made and the fetus
is developing.

00:46:59.050 --> 00:47:01.010 align:middle line:84%
But they're saying
something beyond that,

00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:02.700 align:middle line:84%
once we're incarnated
into the world,

00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:07.510 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to be able
to epigenetically change

00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:10.320 align:middle line:90%
our physical realities?

00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:14.700 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: So the 12 archangels
say that that potential

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:15.500 align:middle line:90%
is right now.

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:16.610 align:middle line:90%
They make that very clear.

00:47:16.610 --> 00:47:19.380 align:middle line:90%
They speak about the now.

00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:21.460 align:middle line:90%
Angels do not talk in time.

00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:22.380 align:middle line:90%
They talk about--

00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:23.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, they don't.

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:25.220 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: They talk
about right now.

00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:25.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:26.380 align:middle line:90%
3,000 years?

00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:27.360 align:middle line:90%
That's not so long.

00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:28.800 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: Exactly.

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:32.950 align:middle line:84%
But what is required
for humanity

00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:37.630 align:middle line:84%
to really experience kind of
that immortal, eternal fountain

00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:40.620 align:middle line:84%
of love where-- fountain
of youth, excuse me,

00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:42.940 align:middle line:84%
which is a fountain of
love, where we would not

00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:49.020 align:middle line:84%
need to incarnate or die
at the end of incarnation

00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:52.970 align:middle line:84%
is that we all need
to be really holding

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:57.840 align:middle line:84%
love, the frequency of love in
every atom, in every molecule,

00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:02.530 align:middle line:84%
in every cell of our physical,
emotional, and mental beings.

00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:05.280 align:middle line:84%
We have to be able
to hold the love.

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:09.870 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it is fear
that causes us to age.

00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:13.090 align:middle line:84%
But it's important
to-- and this can

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:18.400 align:middle line:84%
be challenging for us--
to remember fear is just

00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:20.170 align:middle line:90%
an angel in disguise.

00:48:20.170 --> 00:48:25.750 align:middle line:84%
We came here so that the
creator could experience

00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:29.550 align:middle line:84%
what the opposite of
love feels like and looks

00:48:29.550 --> 00:48:34.560 align:middle line:84%
like because when
there is only love,

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:38.240 align:middle line:84%
we don't really get
to experience, well,

00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:40.420 align:middle line:90%
how valuable is that?

00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:42.730 align:middle line:84%
How valuable is
it to choose love?

00:48:42.730 --> 00:48:44.740 align:middle line:90%
Why do we want to choose love?

00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Why do we want to
have heaven on Earth?

00:48:46.830 --> 00:48:50.520 align:middle line:84%
Why do we want to have
abundance unless we

00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:54.082 align:middle line:84%
experience the opposite,
unless we experience--

00:48:54.082 --> 00:48:55.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It tempers us, yes.

00:48:55.290 --> 00:48:56.370 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: Exactly.

00:48:56.370 --> 00:49:00.790 align:middle line:84%
But it tempers the
entire universe.

00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:04.330 align:middle line:84%
We are in school here
for the entire universe

00:49:04.330 --> 00:49:07.410 align:middle line:90%
because we are all one.

00:49:07.410 --> 00:49:10.320 align:middle line:90%
So fear is a gift.

00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:13.770 align:middle line:84%
It does cause us to age but
another way to look at it

00:49:13.770 --> 00:49:18.510 align:middle line:84%
is we are learning about
fear as we get older.

00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And growing older can be
a most magnificent thing

00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:25.600 align:middle line:90%
to experience.

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:29.500 align:middle line:90%
It can be quite wonderful.

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:36.335 align:middle line:84%
And I love it that
merlins grow younger.

00:49:36.335 --> 00:49:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And so the angels teach us, be
the merlin and grow younger.

00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:42.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what you
say makes perfect sense.

00:49:42.550 --> 00:49:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And when you just stop
and feel it for a moment

00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:50.050 align:middle line:84%
and feel the frequency of that
larger, not attached, larger

00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:53.790 align:middle line:84%
unconditional kind of love, the
frequency of love, of course

00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:59.160 align:middle line:84%
that's going to keep your cells
in the most pristine condition.

00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:01.830 align:middle line:84%
It's the highest
frequency there is.

00:50:01.830 --> 00:50:03.830 align:middle line:84%
Versus fear, you know
what it does to you cells,

00:50:03.830 --> 00:50:06.960 align:middle line:84%
creating acidity in the
body and horrible reactions

00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:07.830 align:middle line:90%
within the cell.

00:50:07.830 --> 00:50:09.090 align:middle line:90%
It's the antidote.

00:50:09.090 --> 00:50:10.960 align:middle line:84%
So that's a very
beautiful explanation.

00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:12.010 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:14.540 align:middle line:84%
We have a little
bit of time left

00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:16.870 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to talk about
a few of the meditations

00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:19.930 align:middle line:84%
because as I alluded to
earlier in our conversation

00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:24.240 align:middle line:84%
and off-camera, I know
a lot of meditations.

00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:26.600 align:middle line:84%
I've guided them
for many, many years

00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:28.630 align:middle line:90%
and I use my own little toolbox.

00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:31.280 align:middle line:84%
But what I loved
about this-- which

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:33.220 align:middle line:84%
contains some of those
elements but-- was

00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:41.000 align:middle line:84%
the sparkling, pristine energy
by use of color and water

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:46.760 align:middle line:84%
and light and the natural
surroundings in some of these.

00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:51.940 align:middle line:84%
They're absolutely
sparkly, clean, clear,

00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:54.570 align:middle line:90%
and very high frequencies.

00:50:54.570 --> 00:50:56.150 align:middle line:84%
So I found this
was the first time

00:50:56.150 --> 00:51:00.850 align:middle line:84%
I've read a book of meditations
that I would actually

00:51:00.850 --> 00:51:03.870 align:middle line:84%
use before going to
sleep at night because I

00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:06.020 align:middle line:84%
tend to be-- I've kind of
seen it all, done at all.

00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:08.405 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, yeah, I've seen
that meditation before.

00:51:08.405 --> 00:51:10.280 align:middle line:84%
I tend to be a little
jaded just because I've

00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:13.310 align:middle line:84%
been in this part of my life
for a really long time now.

00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And I have seen a lot but again,
that clarity and cleanliness

00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:22.200 align:middle line:84%
and sparkliness of
these is really-- well,

00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:25.410 align:middle line:84%
I guess if they gave you them
with those colors and imagery

00:51:25.410 --> 00:51:27.050 align:middle line:90%
in mind, it's for a purpose.

00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:29.160 align:middle line:90%
It's very high frequencies.

00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:31.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: The 12
archangels want everything

00:51:31.550 --> 00:51:37.490 align:middle line:84%
that they teach to be accessible
to the five-year-old within us.

00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:41.070 align:middle line:90%
They are not intellectuals.

00:51:41.070 --> 00:51:42.340 align:middle line:90%
They are lovers.

00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:43.140 align:middle line:90%
They are lovers.

00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:44.848 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you can
feel that in these.

00:51:44.848 --> 00:51:47.970 align:middle line:84%
But if you go through
with the adult mind

00:51:47.970 --> 00:51:52.080 align:middle line:84%
and apply that into this
sparkly, colorful, beautiful

00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:57.147 align:middle line:84%
reality that's being created,
they're amazingly effective.

00:51:57.147 --> 00:51:59.730 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about a couple-- do
you mind talking about a couple

00:51:59.730 --> 00:52:00.130 align:middle line:90%
of them?

00:52:00.130 --> 00:52:00.700 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: That's wonderful.

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:01.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:04.740 align:middle line:84%
So one of them I really liked
was "Surrender, the Meditation

00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:07.860 align:middle line:84%
in the Garden of
Compassion." "So you

00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:11.710 align:middle line:84%
breathe in slowly and exhale
deeply, focusing on your breath

00:52:11.710 --> 00:52:13.750 align:middle line:84%
until you become
calm and centered.

00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:17.180 align:middle line:84%
Lie down on a huge
emerald stone.

00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:22.440 align:middle line:84%
Close your eyes and say, 'I am
surrender.' Golden angels come

00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:25.390 align:middle line:84%
to carry you to the
garden of compassion.

00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:28.510 align:middle line:84%
The angels of the garden
welcome you to bear your heart

00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:30.120 align:middle line:90%
and tell your troubles.

00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:34.830 align:middle line:84%
Breathe in the healing light
and exhale the discontentment.

00:52:34.830 --> 00:52:39.200 align:middle line:84%
Open to the golden light and
see it fill your heart, mind,

00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:40.250 align:middle line:90%
and body.

00:52:40.250 --> 00:52:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And say, 'I invite miracles
to come to me in abundance.

00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:48.610 align:middle line:84%
I welcome the peaceful
feelings of sweet surrender.'"

00:52:48.610 --> 00:52:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And so that emerald and
this golden light pouring in

00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:56.960 align:middle line:84%
and the notion that you can just
kind of give whatever it is up,

00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:59.750 align:middle line:84%
it's really beautiful and very
effective and very simple.

00:52:59.750 --> 00:53:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And all these
meditations are not

00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:04.910 align:middle line:90%
pages and pages of instruction.

00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:08.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: And in that one--
that's one of my favorites--

00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:11.910 align:middle line:84%
if you'll just
focus a little bit,

00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:18.850 align:middle line:84%
you will also see Siddhartha
Buddha will show up and help

00:53:18.850 --> 00:53:20.930 align:middle line:90%
with the surrender.

00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:23.320 align:middle line:84%
Siddhartha loves to
show up, especially

00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:25.770 align:middle line:90%
in that particular meditation.

00:53:25.770 --> 00:53:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to mention
about these meditations

00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:32.700 align:middle line:84%
very quickly that it's OK
if we're at the place where

00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:35.440 align:middle line:90%
we don't visualize easily.

00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:39.800 align:middle line:84%
Just holding the intention
and just reading the words

00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:41.770 align:middle line:90%
begins to move us forward.

00:53:41.770 --> 00:53:46.300 align:middle line:84%
So over time, you're
going to start to see.

00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:47.220 align:middle line:90%
You will.

00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:49.835 align:middle line:84%
It's the way-- the
vibration of the words,

00:53:49.835 --> 00:53:53.720 align:middle line:84%
the angels put their
vibration in every word.

00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:57.561 align:middle line:84%
So just reading will
also move us forward.

00:53:57.561 --> 00:53:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because these
are higher frequencies--

00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:01.650 align:middle line:84%
they're words of
higher frequencies,

00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:04.010 align:middle line:84%
colors and thoughts
of higher frequencies.

00:54:04.010 --> 00:54:06.490 align:middle line:84%
Another one here is
"Engaging Your Intuition."

00:54:06.490 --> 00:54:08.924 align:middle line:84%
There's another one
called "A Transformation

00:54:08.924 --> 00:54:10.465 align:middle line:84%
that's a Walk in
the Purple Forest"--

00:54:10.465 --> 00:54:11.589 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: I love that one--

00:54:11.589 --> 00:54:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again, those
very high frequencies

00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:15.980 align:middle line:90%
of purple and of violet.

00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:22.200 align:middle line:84%
Another one I recall
was allowing whatever

00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:26.200 align:middle line:84%
it is that you feel trapped
by or burdened by-- taking it

00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:29.690 align:middle line:84%
and removing it and dropping
it to the bottom of a river,

00:54:29.690 --> 00:54:30.897 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:54:30.897 --> 00:54:32.230 align:middle line:90%
And you can feel it go kerplunk.

00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:34.900 align:middle line:90%


00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:38.550 align:middle line:84%
But each one of them has that
same frequency and simplicity

00:54:38.550 --> 00:54:41.700 align:middle line:84%
to it that I think is
not only effective.

00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:42.580 align:middle line:90%
It's more than that.

00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:43.380 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:44.490 align:middle line:90%
It appeals to the child.

00:54:44.490 --> 00:54:47.870 align:middle line:84%
Each one of the meditations
is actually beautiful

00:54:47.870 --> 00:54:52.060 align:middle line:84%
and that's the thing,
really innate beauty.

00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:53.260 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: Well, thank you.

00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:54.060 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:55.800 align:middle line:90%
The angels thank you.

00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And they say that another
thing that is so fun

00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:02.900 align:middle line:84%
is that once you start to
work with these imageries,

00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:04.720 align:middle line:84%
then you start to
create your own.

00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:07.820 align:middle line:84%
The child within you
will give you new ones

00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:12.230 align:middle line:90%
so that it never turns boring.

00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:14.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, playful and
beautiful-- yes, you've

00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:18.290 align:middle line:84%
done a marvelous job of
chronicling all of that.

00:55:18.290 --> 00:55:19.980 align:middle line:84%
We only have a
minute or two left.

00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:23.330 align:middle line:84%
Any final thoughts you may
have or that your angels

00:55:23.330 --> 00:55:27.860 align:middle line:84%
may be sharing with you at this
very moment for our audience?

00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: The 12
archangels would

00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:33.580 align:middle line:84%
like to give the
message, "Humanity,

00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:37.480 align:middle line:90%
you are making great progress.

00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:39.750 align:middle line:90%
We thank you for choosing love.

00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:44.260 align:middle line:84%
We thank you for
filling your vessels

00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:47.330 align:middle line:90%
with respect for your divinity.

00:55:47.330 --> 00:55:49.680 align:middle line:90%
You are God's children.

00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:52.070 align:middle line:90%
You have not been abandoned.

00:55:52.070 --> 00:55:54.590 align:middle line:90%
Let go of your past.

00:55:54.590 --> 00:55:55.900 align:middle line:10%
Let it go.

00:55:55.900 --> 00:56:01.640 align:middle line:10%
Fill the present
with love and watch.

00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:08.030 align:middle line:10%
Watch as heaven and
Earth become one."

00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:11.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I appreciate
that message and thank them.

00:56:11.350 --> 00:56:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And I thank you for coming
here and you have just

00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:16.266 align:middle line:90%
such a sweet, loving energy.

00:56:16.266 --> 00:56:17.140 align:middle line:90%
You're a human being.

00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:18.770 align:middle line:84%
We all have our
challenges in life

00:56:18.770 --> 00:56:23.030 align:middle line:84%
but your innate energy really
does carry that message

00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:25.477 align:middle line:84%
that they have
perpetuated through you.

00:56:25.477 --> 00:56:26.560 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: Well, thank you.

00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:28.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I
wanted to thank you.

00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:30.380 align:middle line:84%
If someone wants to
reach through to you

00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:32.780 align:middle line:84%
on a personal level-- and I
imagine a number of people

00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:34.930 align:middle line:84%
will-- how do they
get hold of you?

00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:36.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: The best way
is just to contact me

00:56:36.900 --> 00:56:41.850 align:middle line:84%
through my website, which
is www.belindawomack.com.

00:56:41.850 --> 00:56:44.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, easy enough.

00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:46.520 align:middle line:84%
Thank you again so much
for being here with us.

00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:47.320 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:49.702 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: Thank you are
having me as your guest.

00:56:49.702 --> 00:56:52.160 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I found this book to
have a grace and beauty that

00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:54.380 align:middle line:10%
invites you to work
with the meditations,

00:56:54.380 --> 00:56:57.660 align:middle line:10%
again, the name "Lessons
from the 12 Archangels,"

00:56:57.660 --> 00:56:59.790 align:middle line:10%
which you can find
through major booksellers.

00:56:59.790 --> 00:57:02.630 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank you
for joining us here on Gaia.
