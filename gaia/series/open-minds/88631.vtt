00:00:22.405 --> 00:00:24.280 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: One
of my favorite stories

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.430 align:middle line:10%
in the world of
extraterrestrial contact

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.730 align:middle line:10%
is that of Val Thor,
after whom the book

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.720 align:middle line:10%
"Stranger at the
Pentagon" was written.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.930 align:middle line:10%
His story was brought out by
a man named Frank Stranges.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.040 align:middle line:84%
Since my original
fascination years ago,

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.830 align:middle line:84%
I've come into
contact with people

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.440 align:middle line:84%
who are also in
contact with Frank,

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.860 align:middle line:84%
including Hollywood film
director Craig Campobasso, who

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.900 align:middle line:84%
is now producing the film
about Val Thor, "Stranger

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:46.890 align:middle line:90%
at the Pentagon."

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.566 align:middle line:90%
I'm so happy to have you here.

00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:49.825 align:middle line:90%
This is just the best.

00:00:49.825 --> 00:00:51.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAIG CAMPOBASSO: I'm really
happy to be here to see you,

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.100 align:middle line:90%
Regina.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.440 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You
know, since I first

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.320 align:middle line:84%
came in contact with that
book years and years ago,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.930 align:middle line:84%
I thought-- it felt real
to me, but you always

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.559 align:middle line:84%
have to wonder is this
someone's imagination?

00:01:05.559 --> 00:01:06.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Sure.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.850 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.740 align:middle line:84%
I read it in the '80s myself,
and I thought the same thing.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.990 align:middle line:90%


00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.340 align:middle line:10%
But when I actually looked
at the photographs that

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.900 align:middle line:10%
were taken of Valiant Thor
and Vice Commander Donn

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.790 align:middle line:10%
and Jill, who was a wife of
another Vice Commander named

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.770 align:middle line:10%
Zann I later found
out from Dr. Frank,

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.110 align:middle line:10%
the photographs just
resonated with me.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They did
with me as well.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.670 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: They
just felt genuine,

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.350 align:middle line:84%
and they were also taken
by a retired Air Force

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.890 align:middle line:84%
photographer who was
also a ufologist.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you can
see in some of the photos

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.360 align:middle line:84%
that the group around them is
kind of looking at them like,

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.450 align:middle line:90%
who are these guys?

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.960 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: They actually are.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And those photographs were taken
on the Howard Menger's farm,

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.640 align:middle line:84%
who was also a contactee
way back in the day,

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.250 align:middle line:84%
and Dr. Frank actually connected
me to Howard and his wife.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And I spoke to his wife
Connie also about that day.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And she said every time
they had UFO lectures,

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.850 align:middle line:84%
there were always
visitors present.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.080 align:middle line:90%
She'd call them the visitors.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And she said sometimes they
would say who they were,

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.530 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes they wouldn't.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.860 align:middle line:84%
But this particular
time, they didn't.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what's
interesting about this

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.660 align:middle line:84%
is during that era,
when we're looking back

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.650 align:middle line:84%
at the '50s in
particular and even

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.670 align:middle line:84%
into the '60s, the
stories of alien contact

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.260 align:middle line:84%
had to do with people who
were humanoid, usually

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.290 align:middle line:84%
attractive, usually
nicely dressed.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Right.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Big shift from
what John Mack started

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.740 align:middle line:84%
dealing with in the '90s
and into the 2000s, which

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.420 align:middle line:84%
is this frightening gray
abduction scenario, which

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.480 align:middle line:84%
is what started taking over
the scene when people start

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.280 align:middle line:84%
thinking of the
word alien contact.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yes.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so this was
more in the sweet days

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.640 align:middle line:84%
when messages of
importance were being

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.730 align:middle line:84%
delivered in a
gentlemanly fashion.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:52.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yes.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And that there were,
in these early days,

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.330 align:middle line:84%
that there were many people
who were having contacts

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.930 align:middle line:90%
from beings all over the place.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.260 align:middle line:84%
I've gone and I've
studied especially

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260 align:middle line:84%
at the Integratron
back in the days

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.960 align:middle line:84%
when George van Tassel had his
UFO space conventions where

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.940 align:middle line:84%
anywhere from 5,000
to 10,000 people

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.270 align:middle line:84%
would go and camp
out in the desert.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.530 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Frank Stranges used to
host those things in the '50s

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:20.689 align:middle line:90%
and '60s as well.

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:21.772 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 5,000 to 10,000?

00:03:21.772 --> 00:03:23.022 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: 5,000 to 10,000.

00:03:23.022 --> 00:03:23.990 align:middle line:90%
I've seen photographs.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:25.073 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:03:25.073 --> 00:03:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And the congresses of today are
lucky to get 200 or 300 people

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.240 align:middle line:90%
to show up.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: And evidently,
back in those days,

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.660 align:middle line:84%
these beings from other places
were more accessible because it

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.730 align:middle line:84%
was new to them,
and they were coming

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.215 align:middle line:84%
because of the atomics
that started happening

00:03:40.215 --> 00:03:43.320 align:middle line:84%
in the '40s and the
danger it was posing

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.470 align:middle line:84%
to the rest of the universe,
and all those kinds of things.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.770 align:middle line:90%
But it was fascinating.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.750 align:middle line:84%
So I really-- people
still think the story

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:54.890 align:middle line:90%
might be a little crazy.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.090 align:middle line:90%


00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.250 align:middle line:84%
What I say is keep an open mind
and research George van Tassel

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.050 align:middle line:84%
and all of these people
from that era to see it.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.891 align:middle line:90%


00:04:07.891 --> 00:04:09.390 align:middle line:84%
The story is not
going to get proved

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.614 align:middle line:84%
unless Valiant Thor
walks in here himself.

00:04:12.614 --> 00:04:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, these are more
dangerous times to walk in.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.821 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yeah.

00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:19.579 align:middle line:84%
But it's still-- I really wanted
to make the film because I

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.835 align:middle line:84%
think it's a wonderful,
fascinating story.

00:04:21.835 --> 00:04:22.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:23.210 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.300 align:middle line:84%
So you say that Val Thor
was a created being.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.260 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.718 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Well,
a created being

00:04:28.718 --> 00:04:30.570 align:middle line:84%
is someone that doesn't
have a belly button.

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.590 align:middle line:84%
So they're actually
what we would

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.370 align:middle line:90%
call an angel in human form.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.926 align:middle line:90%


00:04:36.926 --> 00:04:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did he
ever explain how

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.380 align:middle line:84%
that happens-- how they're
able to come into and create

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.350 align:middle line:84%
any kind of physical
form and density?

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: And density?

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, we know from a lot of
previous teachings and things

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.090 align:middle line:84%
that I've read is
that created beings

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.360 align:middle line:84%
can be created through
the godhead, through--

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.260 align:middle line:84%
or the universal
head, however you

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.280 align:middle line:84%
want to look at it-- is that
they can create things at will.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.549 align:middle line:90%


00:05:10.549 --> 00:05:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not a
challenge for someone

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.430 align:middle line:84%
who understands the
creative process.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.700 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Exactly.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.241 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there are human
beings who can do this as well.

00:05:16.241 --> 00:05:18.420 align:middle line:84%
We have to understand,
to create something

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.690 align:middle line:84%
like Val Thor actually
is our birthright.

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.370 align:middle line:84%
We just haven't remembered
our way back to it yet.

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: That's right.

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:24.151 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:05:24.151 --> 00:05:26.330 align:middle line:90%
So he arrives at the Pentagon.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.650 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a look
at our very first clip

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.030 align:middle line:90%
from the film, OK?

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.531 align:middle line:84%
And set this up for
us a little bit,

00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:35.155 align:middle line:84%
because we want to know-- well,
first of all, I should ask you,

00:05:35.155 --> 00:05:36.210 align:middle line:90%
why did he come here?

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Well, he actually
came with a divine design,

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.195 align:middle line:84%
which was to help eliminate
sickness, disease, and poverty.

00:05:44.195 --> 00:05:45.400 align:middle line:90%


00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And it was a design from
the unification council

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.770 align:middle line:84%
of which he was a part of, of
which there are 12 members.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:58.680 align:middle line:84%
And it was for Eisenhower to
implement throughout the United

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.500 align:middle line:84%
States, and then once
that proved successful,

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.500 align:middle line:90%
throughout the world.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.380 align:middle line:84%
So on that first meeting, when
they met at the White House

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:07.880 align:middle line:90%
on--

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to see
that clip in a little bit.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.713 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: We're gonna see
that clip in a little bit.

00:06:11.713 --> 00:06:17.810 align:middle line:84%
But his main purpose was
coming just for that,

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.650 align:middle line:84%
and he was put on VIP
status by Eisenhower

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.120 align:middle line:84%
for three years where
he actually-- they

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.790 align:middle line:84%
discussed how they could do
this and how it could work

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:29.582 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:06:29.582 --> 00:06:31.290 align:middle line:84%
But of course, there
were major conflicts

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.090 align:middle line:84%
with all the other areas and
the joint chiefs and the CIA--

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:35.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, and that's
when he had that warning when

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.840 align:middle line:84%
Eisenhower left office, beware
of the military industrial

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.590 align:middle line:90%
complex.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.160 align:middle line:84%
Val Thor must've figured
prominently in that.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.220 align:middle line:90%


00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.750 align:middle line:84%
So there was a
reason Val Thor chose

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.410 align:middle line:84%
to connect with
Eisenhower specifically.

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:48.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yes.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.575 align:middle line:90%
Back in the day, so--

00:06:49.575 --> 00:06:50.422 align:middle line:90%


00:06:50.422 --> 00:06:52.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So he thought
he was a man that

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.588 align:middle line:84%
had enough conscience
that he could

00:06:53.588 --> 00:06:56.100 align:middle line:84%
be capable of helping
these reforms happen.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:56.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yes.

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:02.106 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Frank explained to me
that Eisenhower and Nixon, who

00:07:02.106 --> 00:07:03.980 align:middle line:84%
was Vice President at
the time, were actually

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.470 align:middle line:84%
very much in favor
of the proposal.

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And where they got
all of the conflict

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:14.740 align:middle line:84%
came in from all the other
areas, the military, the CIA,

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:18.560 align:middle line:84%
all of those different--
big industry.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And of course, in the
end, it was turned down

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.020 align:middle line:84%
because it would eliminate
pharmaceutical companies,

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:29.980 align:middle line:84%
doctors, lawye-- everything like
that and destroy the economy.

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:35.550 align:middle line:84%
So again, it went back
to a monetary system

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:37.430 align:middle line:84%
and didn't go back to
a humanitary system.

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:37.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.498 align:middle line:84%
So before we get too
far ahead ourselves,

00:07:39.498 --> 00:07:41.920 align:middle line:84%
let's take a look at the
clip where Val Thor arrives.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:42.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: All right.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.640 align:middle line:84%
So this clip is where
his craft, Victor One,

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.340 align:middle line:84%
which is 300 feet in
diameter, by the way,

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:52.440 align:middle line:84%
holds up to 200
people, is arriving

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.150 align:middle line:84%
on Earth for the first time
and is coming in for a landing.

00:07:55.150 --> 00:08:27.616 align:middle line:90%


00:08:27.616 --> 00:08:28.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beautifully done.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:29.531 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yeah.

00:08:29.531 --> 00:08:30.220 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.011 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was
really beautifully done.

00:08:32.011 --> 00:08:33.280 align:middle line:90%


00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And you said that a lot
of this is CG, of course.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yes, of course.

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Computer
generated graphics.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:41.299 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Exactly.

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:41.820 align:middle line:90%
Images.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:42.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:44.049 align:middle line:90%
Really well done.

00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:44.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:48.510 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about once
Val Thor arrived here.

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:51.540 align:middle line:84%
What was his original
experience like?

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:52.740 align:middle line:90%


00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.616 align:middle line:84%
How was he first greeted, and
then what was his experience

00:08:55.616 --> 00:09:00.120 align:middle line:84%
and the reception at
the Pentagon like?

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Well, he was
met when his craft landed.

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:07.000 align:middle line:84%
The first two on the scene
were two police officers.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And they actually
had their guns drawn.

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And when he walked off the
craft, when they looked

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:20.590 align:middle line:84%
upon him, they felt
the energy of this man,

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:22.920 align:middle line:84%
and they just immediately
just dropped their arms

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.426 align:middle line:90%
and walked up to him.

00:09:24.426 --> 00:09:25.800 align:middle line:84%
They actually had
a conversation.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.510 align:middle line:84%
He said he wanted to
see the President.

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:28.395 align:middle line:90%
They radioed ahead.

00:09:28.395 --> 00:09:30.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They said, hey,
we'll give you an escort.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:31.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: And
you have to remember,

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.030 align:middle line:90%
this is on a Saturday morning.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.110 align:middle line:84%
This was not-- he didn't
come during the week.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:38.760 align:middle line:84%
Actually, that would have caused
havoc, if you think about it.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:39.980 align:middle line:90%


00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:46.270 align:middle line:84%
It was March 16, 1957, and it
was 8:00 AM in the morning.

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:51.480 align:middle line:84%
So the city was awake,
but not at full function.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.865 align:middle line:84%
So they rushed him
to the Pentagon.

00:09:54.865 --> 00:09:58.050 align:middle line:90%


00:09:58.050 --> 00:09:59.690 align:middle line:84%
He met with the
Secretary of Defense,

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:01.570 align:middle line:90%
the Undersecretary of Defense.

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:03.500 align:middle line:84%
He met with some other
military officials.

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.800 align:middle line:90%
They were all being called in.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:09.830 align:middle line:84%
Eisenhower was being
called in, Nixon, everybody

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:11.090 align:middle line:90%
was then going.

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:15.260 align:middle line:84%
They all met with him at the
White House in the Oval Office,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.900 align:middle line:84%
and that's where the
first meeting took place.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And Eisenhower's
first words were,

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.870 align:middle line:84%
"I have a good feeling
towards you, sir.

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:24.069 align:middle line:90%
Please, what is your name?"

00:10:24.069 --> 00:10:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Should we take
a look at that clip now?

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:26.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yes.

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:27.080 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's do
clip number two,

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.310 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll get deeper
into the conversation.

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:32.240 align:middle line:84%
Where Valiant Thor
meets the President.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:41.530 align:middle line:90%


00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>>Of course you
know we've suspended

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:44.005 align:middle line:90%
all rules of protocol.

00:10:44.005 --> 00:10:45.661 align:middle line:90%


00:10:45.661 --> 00:10:47.600 align:middle line:84%
I have a good
feeling towards you.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.410 align:middle line:90%


00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:52.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm president Dwight Eisenhower.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:53.980 align:middle line:90%
Please sir, what is your name?

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:54.909 align:middle line:90%


00:10:54.909 --> 00:10:55.950 align:middle line:90%
>>Commander Valiant Thor.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:57.970 align:middle line:90%


00:10:57.970 --> 00:10:58.886 align:middle line:90%
>>Where are you from?

00:10:58.886 --> 00:11:01.260 align:middle line:84%
>>I come from the interior of
the planet your Bible calls

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.320 align:middle line:84%
the morning and
the evening star.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.001 align:middle line:90%
>>Venus?

00:11:04.001 --> 00:11:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:05.590 align:middle line:90%


00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:07.454 align:middle line:84%
>>What is the purpose
of this visit?

00:11:07.454 --> 00:11:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>>Your planet has been
under close observation

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:10.360 align:middle line:90%
for a very long time.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.550 align:middle line:90%


00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:12.530 align:middle line:90%
That is why I'm here.

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:14.360 align:middle line:90%


00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Have there been
any confirming documents,

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:22.160 align:middle line:84%
for example, by-- that were
ever discovered by Eisenhower

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.340 align:middle line:84%
or Nixon or anyone else
that was involved, military,

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:27.910 align:middle line:84%
regarding contact with this
stranger at the Pentagon,

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:29.820 align:middle line:90%
or was this very deeply hidden?

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:33.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Well, I've never
come across any documents.

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:35.130 align:middle line:90%
I myself asked Dr. Frank.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:36.695 align:middle line:90%
He didn't know of any documents.

00:11:36.695 --> 00:11:37.750 align:middle line:90%


00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:40.940 align:middle line:84%
The only thing
that is recorded is

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:44.860 align:middle line:84%
Harley Byrd, who was Admiral
Richard E. Byrd's nephew,

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:48.210 align:middle line:84%
was a part of Project
Blue Book at that time.

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And actually, in the
forward to the book,

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:55.690 align:middle line:84%
he confirms the entire story--
his arrival, his meeting

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:57.970 align:middle line:84%
with the President,
and him staying there

00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:59.820 align:middle line:90%
at the Pentagon for three years.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.917 align:middle line:90%
So he himself did confirm it.

00:12:01.917 --> 00:12:02.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Excellent.

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:03.760 align:middle line:90%


00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Explain Project Blue
Book for our viewers

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:08.379 align:middle line:84%
who aren't familiar
with these terms.

00:12:08.379 --> 00:12:09.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Well,
back in the '50s,

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:17.040 align:middle line:84%
they created an organization
to look into UFO sightings

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:21.290 align:middle line:84%
and people reporting
and all that.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:24.140 align:middle line:84%
So they would go out, and
they would investigate and see

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:27.670 align:middle line:84%
if things were correct, or
if people actually really saw

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:30.467 align:middle line:84%
something, or that
kind of thing.

00:12:30.467 --> 00:12:32.300 align:middle line:84%
So they would log things
and catalog things.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
was a governmental--

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.808 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: This was, yeah.

00:12:34.808 --> 00:12:35.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --study.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:36.020 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:36.530 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:38.020 align:middle line:90%
Just to set that straight.

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And then of course, I think
it was in the '90s they said,

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:42.191 align:middle line:90%
well, couldn't find anything.

00:12:42.191 --> 00:12:42.690 align:middle line:90%
Fables.

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:44.370 align:middle line:90%


00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:45.230 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:48.760 align:middle line:84%
There were only thousands and
thousands of documented cases

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:51.041 align:middle line:84%
before they threw
it out the window.

00:12:51.041 --> 00:12:51.540 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:55.290 align:middle line:84%
So when did Frank Stranges
come into the picture

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:57.730 align:middle line:90%
and meet with Valiant Thor?

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:01.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: He was doing a
lecture-- a two-week lecture

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:07.120 align:middle line:84%
in Washington, DC
in December of 1959.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:11.190 align:middle line:84%
And he actually was friends
with August Roberts, who

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:14.800 align:middle line:84%
took the photographs of
Valiant Thor and his crew

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.330 align:middle line:84%
members earlier at
the Menger farm.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:22.740 align:middle line:84%
And he had gone to Dr. Frank
with the photographs and said,

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:24.620 align:middle line:90%
these people are not from here.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:29.780 align:middle line:84%
That man right there had no
fingerprints, no palm prints,

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:33.200 align:middle line:84%
and when he looked at me, it
was like he was going deep

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.180 align:middle line:84%
into my soul, and that
you just felt different

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:38.390 align:middle line:90%
when you were around him.

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:39.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this has
been for-- many people have

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:40.060 align:middle line:90%
said the same thing.

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:40.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yes.

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:43.330 align:middle line:84%
They've all said the same
thing, even down to the thing

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:49.260 align:middle line:84%
that his pheromones are even
what you would call something

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:53.286 align:middle line:84%
that changes your senses
and brings you into that God

00:13:53.286 --> 00:13:57.730 align:middle line:84%
sort of centered place
where he resides.

00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:01.960 align:middle line:84%
So it's not only the
sight, but it brings you

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.480 align:middle line:90%
in through all the senses.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:12.220 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, he was there
doing this lecture,

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:14.420 align:middle line:90%
and he had the photograph.

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:16.942 align:middle line:84%
He had it blown
up, which I have.

00:14:16.942 --> 00:14:18.150 align:middle line:90%
I have the actual photograph.

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.066 align:middle line:84%
His wife just gave it
to me for the big movie.

00:14:20.066 --> 00:14:21.280 align:middle line:90%


00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And he would have
it up there, and he

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:26.040 align:middle line:84%
would talk about-- he'd
have the Adamski ships

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:26.957 align:middle line:90%
and talk about that.

00:14:26.957 --> 00:14:27.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.956 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: And talk about
things that were in the Bible

00:14:29.956 --> 00:14:32.360 align:middle line:84%
as well, and then
talk about Ezekiel,

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:36.210 align:middle line:84%
and he'd talk about--
then he would say,

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:40.640 align:middle line:84%
and this is a photograph of
a gentleman who is supposedly

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.820 align:middle line:90%
from another planet.

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:44.860 align:middle line:84%
He never said that he
was or that he wasn't.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:45.980 align:middle line:90%


00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And one of these nights at
the lecture, what he did was

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:55.290 align:middle line:84%
is he-- a woman came up to him
when he was signing books--

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:57.820 align:middle line:84%
he had a book then called
"Saucerama," which was all

00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:01.200 align:middle line:84%
about flying saucers and
photographs and stories.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.390 align:middle line:90%
And a woman came up to him.

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:06.030 align:middle line:84%
Her name was Nancy Warren--
changed, of course,

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:06.950 align:middle line:90%
for the book.

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:11.310 align:middle line:84%
And she put her Pentagon
badge underneath his face.

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at her, and
she pointed to the picture,

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:18.080 align:middle line:84%
and she said, he
wants to meet you.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:21.170 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I will pick you up
at your hotel tomorrow morning

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:22.800 align:middle line:90%
at 8:00 AM.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And so those
arrangements were made.

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:27.540 align:middle line:90%
She took him to the Pentagon.

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:33.240 align:middle line:84%
She took him in where-- they
went through two guard gates.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.340 align:middle line:90%
He didn't have a badge.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:36.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is like
this great story

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:40.000 align:middle line:84%
that-- I forget what
Dr. Frank called it.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.240 align:middle line:90%
It's like trans-imagery.

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.980 align:middle line:90%


00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:46.760 align:middle line:84%
So they are seeing
something that's not there.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.790 align:middle line:84%
So he would open his coat,
boom, there's a badge,

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:50.920 align:middle line:90%
but there's no badge.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.417 align:middle line:84%
And that's how he actually got
through the two guard gates.

00:15:54.417 --> 00:15:55.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And did he ever have--

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:59.320 align:middle line:84%
did Valiant ever
explain why he chose

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.580 align:middle line:90%
Frank for this particular--

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yes.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:03.735 align:middle line:84%
Yes, because he was
a UFO investigator.

00:16:03.735 --> 00:16:04.555 align:middle line:90%


00:16:04.555 --> 00:16:06.555 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But there were
many UFO investigators.

00:16:06.555 --> 00:16:09.710 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: There were,
but he was also very open.

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:11.030 align:middle line:90%


00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:12.690 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Frank, when you
got to know him,

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:14.496 align:middle line:84%
and I got to know
him very well, he

00:16:14.496 --> 00:16:17.710 align:middle line:84%
was-- not only was
he a very open man,

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:20.260 align:middle line:90%
but he was a very genuine man.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And he was kind and
trustworthy and all.

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:28.880 align:middle line:90%


00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.250 align:middle line:90%
I think that whole package--

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That innocence and
kindness probably resonated.

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:33.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: And
I think also being

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:37.230 align:middle line:84%
in the right place at the right
time didn't hurt, as well.

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:43.650 align:middle line:10%
So they had a first meeting, and
they discussed several things,

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:46.100 align:middle line:10%
one of which was his
space suit, which

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:48.590 align:middle line:10%
weighed six ounces
with the boots.

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And he said that,
at his urging, he

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.980 align:middle line:84%
had the government
do tests on it.

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:55.570 align:middle line:90%
They tried to burn it with acid.

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:56.820 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't burn.

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.150 align:middle line:90%
They fired a rifle at it.

00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:59.015 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't pierce.

00:16:59.015 --> 00:17:00.030 align:middle line:90%


00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:02.790 align:middle line:84%
And back then, they
were working on a laser,

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:05.060 align:middle line:84%
but back then it
was called a maser.

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:07.869 align:middle line:84%
So they even did
the maser on it.

00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:10.107 align:middle line:90%
Nothing would penetrate it.

00:17:10.107 --> 00:17:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Could
penetrate that fabric.

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:13.106 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: But
what he also did

00:17:13.106 --> 00:17:16.030 align:middle line:84%
is he told them some personal
things that he did not

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:16.845 align:middle line:90%
know himself.

00:17:16.845 --> 00:17:17.961 align:middle line:90%


00:17:17.961 --> 00:17:18.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: About himself?

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: About,
no, of Dr. Frank--

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.319 align:middle line:84%
that he didn't know
that his parents had

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:27.619 align:middle line:84%
had a child before him
that passed away at birth

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:33.330 align:middle line:84%
and that Dr. Frank was
going that same way

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:35.847 align:middle line:84%
but was helped along
to stay in this world.

00:17:35.847 --> 00:17:36.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:38.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: So
that, even there, it

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:44.330 align:middle line:84%
makes me even think was this
some predestined thing that

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:45.560 align:middle line:90%
was happening with Dr. Frank?

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it seems like
it because it was so profound.

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:49.930 align:middle line:90%


00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:51.630 align:middle line:84%
I want to just back
up for one second.

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:54.520 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned Adamski,
which was also

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.270 align:middle line:90%
being investigated at that time.

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:58.380 align:middle line:84%
And that being, who
was a human being,

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:02.620 align:middle line:84%
had a very similar kind of
be beatific, beautiful energy

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.520 align:middle line:90%
about him like Valiant Thor.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:05.980 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever--
Do you have any--

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, for
anybody watching,

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:10.720 align:middle line:84%
I did an interview with
Glenn Steckling on that

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:13.770 align:middle line:84%
because his father,
like Frank Stranges,

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:16.830 align:middle line:84%
followed the life
and times of Adamski.

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:18.580 align:middle line:84%
So you can watch
that in the archives.

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:23.107 align:middle line:84%
But what is your thought on
who Adamski may have been?

00:18:23.107 --> 00:18:25.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Well, I-- you
know, I kind of think that--

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did he have a belly
button, is what I'm asking.

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:30.085 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Well, I think
that George Adamski had a belly

00:18:30.085 --> 00:18:33.950 align:middle line:84%
button, but maybe
Orthon, is what they na--

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:38.430 align:middle line:84%
his person supposedly
from Venus as well,

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:41.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure was a-- could have
been a created being as well.

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:42.989 align:middle line:90%
But I don't think any--

00:18:42.989 --> 00:18:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A similar kind
of contact and messaging

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:45.570 align:middle line:90%
coming through.

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:46.986 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: But
here's the thing

00:18:46.986 --> 00:18:51.050 align:middle line:84%
that we do know about these
special beings-- created beings

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:55.350 align:middle line:84%
and fully conscious beings
who are in full power

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:58.400 align:middle line:84%
of 100% of their brain
power, where we're only

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:02.280 align:middle line:84%
in like 30-some
percent, is that they

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.880 align:middle line:84%
are balanced in
masculine and feminine.

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:08.496 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of times,
the men will come off

00:19:08.496 --> 00:19:13.770 align:middle line:84%
being-- even coming
off not feminine,

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:16.670 align:middle line:84%
but they have a lot
of feminine qualities.

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times they
look very androgynous,

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:23.120 align:middle line:84%
because the men like to
sometimes wear long hair.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.780 align:middle line:84%
Valiant Thor didn't,
but Orthon did.

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:29.510 align:middle line:84%
And if you didn't know and
you saw this pure face,

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:33.440 align:middle line:84%
because his face
was just of purity,

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.820 align:middle line:90%
you wouldn't know what sex.

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and I've seen
many depictions of these beings

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.612 align:middle line:90%
through many sources and it's--

00:19:39.612 --> 00:19:41.611 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: There's
lots of androgynous beings

00:19:41.611 --> 00:19:42.600 align:middle line:90%
through the universe.

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:43.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:44.290 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, going back
to Frank's story,

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:49.470 align:middle line:84%
over what period of time,
then-- was he in contact

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:51.240 align:middle line:84%
with Valiant Thor
those three years,

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.550 align:middle line:90%
and was that the only time?

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:55.310 align:middle line:84%
Or did Valiant Thor continue
being in contact with him

00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:56.740 align:middle line:90%
after his days at the Pentagon?

00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: He met him on--
I believe it was December 24.

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:04.850 align:middle line:90%
It was Christmas Eve, 1959.

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:10.530 align:middle line:84%
So Valiant Thor was leaving
Earth on March 16, 1960,

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:12.100 align:middle line:90%
the following year.

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.990 align:middle line:84%
So he didn't have
contact with him again.

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:20.500 align:middle line:84%
Valiant Thor returned, he
said, on March 16, 1961,

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:22.760 align:middle line:90%
and has been here ever since.

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:32.020 align:middle line:84%
And that he came back and
had a meeting with him.

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:33.896 align:middle line:84%
He actually was
driving in his car,

00:20:33.896 --> 00:20:36.030 align:middle line:84%
and he appeared in the
backseat of his car,

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:38.849 align:middle line:84%
he said, and scared the
beejeebies out of him.

00:20:38.849 --> 00:20:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And he pulled over, and
he got in the front seat,

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:42.760 align:middle line:84%
and then they had
a conversation,

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.915 align:middle line:84%
and that they've been
friends ever since.

00:20:45.915 --> 00:20:47.310 align:middle line:90%


00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:53.160 align:middle line:84%
But 1968 was the first time
that he went and visited

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:56.020 align:middle line:90%
Victor One, which was his craft.

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:58.460 align:middle line:84%
And he met a lot of
the crew members, which

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:03.020 align:middle line:84%
he became friends with
throughout the years,

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:05.050 align:middle line:90%
and had a lot of great stories.

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:07.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is
also featured in the film,

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:07.615 align:middle line:90%
am I correct?

00:21:07.615 --> 00:21:07.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: It is.

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:08.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:08.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
meeting of the crew?

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yes,
because a lot of people

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:13.400 align:middle line:90%
don't know about the crew.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And the crew is
extremely fascinating,

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:18.030 align:middle line:84%
because there's four
vice commanders.

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:28.030 align:middle line:84%
There's Teel, Zann, Thonn,
T-H-O-N-N, and Donn, D-O-N-N.

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:29.810 align:middle line:84%
So there's one
woman and three men.

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And then there is another
created being on board.

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:36.262 align:middle line:84%
His name is Uniah, and he
comes from Melchizedek.

00:21:36.262 --> 00:21:38.095 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Shall we take
a look at that clip?

00:21:38.095 --> 00:21:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yes.

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:39.650 align:middle line:84%
We do have a clip of
the vice commanders.

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:41.066 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's
take a look at it.

00:21:41.066 --> 00:21:45.400 align:middle line:90%


00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.090 align:middle line:84%
>>The Quyine have
infiltrated Earth.

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:50.280 align:middle line:90%


00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.840 align:middle line:84%
Our surveillance system did
not detect their arrival.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.570 align:middle line:84%
>>They've found a signal to
block the current system.

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Thonn, to circumvent this,
I have new residence field

00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:00.630 align:middle line:84%
signatures for you to implement
into the computer's brain.

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:02.400 align:middle line:84%
>>Capital City's
President is considering

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.566 align:middle line:84%
signing an agreement with
them for their technology.

00:22:04.566 --> 00:22:05.590 align:middle line:90%


00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:07.910 align:middle line:84%
>>This will set our
mission back decades.

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:10.627 align:middle line:84%
>>Melchizedek has looked
into all probable futures.

00:22:10.627 --> 00:22:12.960 align:middle line:84%
There is not one hopeful
outcome in the immediate years.

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.580 align:middle line:90%


00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:15.839 align:middle line:90%
The Earth is in grave danger.

00:22:15.839 --> 00:22:16.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:18.310 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting, yes.

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.810 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:25.690 align:middle line:84%
So after this period of
time, he started having-- he,

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:29.390 align:middle line:84%
over this period of time being
in contact with human beings

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:35.260 align:middle line:84%
and the military industrial
complex, large industry,

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:40.170 align:middle line:84%
corporate America at large-- how
did this start impacting him?

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And according to Frank Stranges,
what happened with Valiant

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:47.515 align:middle line:90%
in terms of his ideals?

00:22:47.515 --> 00:22:48.710 align:middle line:90%


00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:51.890 align:middle line:84%
Did he feel that there was a
possibility any of these ideals

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:53.850 align:middle line:84%
were going to be
met or that there

00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:55.190 align:middle line:90%
was going to be resistance?

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:56.930 align:middle line:90%


00:22:56.930 --> 00:23:01.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Well that
was interesting questions

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.250 align:middle line:90%
that I asked Dr. Frank.

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And then I had to even
take it a step beyond

00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:12.216 align:middle line:84%
because you have to think
the way a created being would

00:23:12.216 --> 00:23:12.715 align:middle line:90%
think.

00:23:12.715 --> 00:23:14.205 align:middle line:90%


00:23:14.205 --> 00:23:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And since we're
not created beings,

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:18.940 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to think
in their manner.

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:21.950 align:middle line:90%
But they're all knowing.

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:23.450 align:middle line:90%
They sense.

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:24.530 align:middle line:90%
They feel.

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:27.680 align:middle line:84%
So yes, they would know that
there would be conflict,

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:32.370 align:middle line:84%
but there might be several
avenues of which that conflict

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:34.715 align:middle line:84%
would present itself
in the end result.

00:23:34.715 --> 00:23:36.540 align:middle line:90%


00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:44.510 align:middle line:84%
But I think the thing
that was most touching

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:49.140 align:middle line:84%
is that when they experience
these things, being fully

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:53.220 align:middle line:84%
conscious, being beings
of total envelopment

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:57.070 align:middle line:84%
of unconditional love, not
being in duality like we're

00:23:57.070 --> 00:24:01.050 align:middle line:84%
in duality, and we live in
this world like we are today.

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:02.950 align:middle line:90%


00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:06.230 align:middle line:84%
But then to see the
horrors of things

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:09.140 align:middle line:84%
that were happening behind
the scenes, the things that

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:12.900 align:middle line:84%
were happening on the
Earth, wars, all of that,

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.850 align:middle line:84%
they would feel it on
a heightened level.

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:20.050 align:middle line:84%
So even how we feel when
we see everything that's

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:22.390 align:middle line:84%
happening in the
world even today,

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:26.090 align:middle line:84%
and we see how many people
die in a war, in a bombing,

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:28.230 align:middle line:84%
in a this, you take
it a step further.

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And for a created being and
a fully conscious being,

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:33.970 align:middle line:90%
it tears them up inside.

00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:36.310 align:middle line:90%


00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:38.909 align:middle line:84%
It just increases that
amount of emotion.

00:24:38.909 --> 00:24:39.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's magnified.

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:41.158 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: It's magnified.

00:24:41.158 --> 00:24:43.250 align:middle line:90%


00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:47.510 align:middle line:84%
So they're really here, he said,
because-- they're still here.

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:48.670 align:middle line:90%


00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:50.280 align:middle line:84%
That ship is stationed
at Lake Mead,

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:53.600 align:middle line:84%
and there are 103 of
these Victor class saucers

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.630 align:middle line:84%
stationed in and
around the Earth,

00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:58.070 align:middle line:90%
monitoring 287 locations.

00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:00.090 align:middle line:90%


00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And each craft holds up
to 200 people as well.

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:07.810 align:middle line:84%
So that's fascinating
to even think

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:09.310 align:middle line:84%
that that concept
could be going on.

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:14.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But are they slightly
phased off in density so

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.459 align:middle line:84%
that they're not
visible, I assume?

00:25:15.459 --> 00:25:16.583 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: That's right.

00:25:16.583 --> 00:25:18.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because I had a
very interesting experience

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.130 align:middle line:90%
on that level.

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:22.720 align:middle line:84%
Years ago, I went out
with Steven Greer's group,

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:26.110 align:middle line:84%
and I think this particular
time was in Crestone, Colorado.

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:27.340 align:middle line:90%


00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And it was interesting because
the way that protocol goes,

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:34.150 align:middle line:84%
everybody gathers,
you set an intention,

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:36.360 align:middle line:84%
and then those people
who can kind of see

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.940 align:middle line:84%
beyond time and space a
bit are asked to view.

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:41.715 align:middle line:84%
And then you view,
and you kind of-- you

00:25:41.715 --> 00:25:45.440 align:middle line:84%
can tell-- you're usually given
times and vectors, in terms

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.720 align:middle line:84%
of where there will be
some activity happening,

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.670 align:middle line:84%
and then you report
it back to the group.

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:53.060 align:middle line:84%
So everybody's
like this, looking.

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:53.777 align:middle line:90%
Oh, there's one!

00:25:53.777 --> 00:25:54.610 align:middle line:90%
Is that a satellite?

00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:55.980 align:middle line:90%


00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:57.760 align:middle line:84%
So you have all this
excitement going on.

00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:58.820 align:middle line:90%
So I close my eyes.

00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:01.950 align:middle line:84%
I was going inside because
in that kind of environment,

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:04.020 align:middle line:84%
I can usually see
beyond time and space.

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:05.920 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, it's
so interesting.

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:09.820 align:middle line:84%
We're looking like
this, but out behind us,

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:12.886 align:middle line:84%
there were several ships on
the ground slightly phased off.

00:26:12.886 --> 00:26:14.760 align:middle line:84%
So you couldn't see them
with your eyes open,

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:16.700 align:middle line:84%
but if you could see,
they're all around.

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:17.940 align:middle line:90%


00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is the
kind of contact that's

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.530 align:middle line:84%
happening from these
other subtle fields

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:26.860 align:middle line:84%
all the time that humanity's
not aware of because we're

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:29.780 align:middle line:84%
so dense in every single
way that we're still looking

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:31.585 align:middle line:84%
for the piece of
metal to descend.

00:26:31.585 --> 00:26:32.684 align:middle line:90%


00:26:32.684 --> 00:26:34.600 align:middle line:10%
>>CAMPOBASSO: And by the
way, when those ships

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:39.830 align:middle line:10%
are on the ground, they can
open up just a section of a ship

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:41.440 align:middle line:10%
so somebody could see.

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:44.169 align:middle line:84%
And those are called
vary shields, by the way.

00:26:44.169 --> 00:26:44.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:46.293 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: So
they can do like this

00:26:46.293 --> 00:26:47.880 align:middle line:84%
and just open up
a portion of it.

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.296 align:middle line:84%
Even when they're
in the sky, they

00:26:49.296 --> 00:26:50.560 align:middle line:90%
can open up a portion of it.

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And the metallics and the
metal, even when they're there,

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:57.900 align:middle line:84%
they can just hit
a sensor and then

00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:00.170 align:middle line:84%
they can look out into
the universe because then

00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:01.140 align:middle line:90%
it's like a window.

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:01.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.210 align:middle line:90%
It's just fascinating.

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a very--
much more graceful type

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:09.774 align:middle line:84%
of technology than anything
that we knowingly possess.

00:27:09.774 --> 00:27:11.940 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we know there
are Black Ops projects that

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:13.648 align:middle line:84%
have adopted a lot of
these technologies.

00:27:13.648 --> 00:27:14.700 align:middle line:90%


00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:16.615 align:middle line:90%
It's just not accessible to us.

00:27:16.615 --> 00:27:17.509 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yeah.

00:27:17.509 --> 00:27:18.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:20.279 align:middle line:84%
So one of the scenes that
we're going to watch next

00:27:20.279 --> 00:27:22.070 align:middle line:84%
has to do with what
you were talking about.

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:23.590 align:middle line:90%


00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:27.200 align:middle line:84%
Valiant has been exposed
to realities of life

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.879 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, other positions
that are maybe diametrically

00:27:30.879 --> 00:27:33.420 align:middle line:84%
opposed, which we'll get into
in a little bit, with what he's

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:34.320 align:middle line:90%
come to do.

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:38.490 align:middle line:84%
And he has a wife, Deena,
who is an actualized, fully

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:40.874 align:middle line:84%
open, fully aware
being who's with him.

00:27:40.874 --> 00:27:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And should we take a
look at this scene,

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:43.900 align:middle line:84%
or do you want to
set it up first?

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:45.316 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: I'll
just set it up.

00:27:45.316 --> 00:27:46.950 align:middle line:84%
She knows he's going
through conflict,

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:48.976 align:middle line:84%
and so she actually
comes to Earth

00:27:48.976 --> 00:27:50.850 align:middle line:84%
because she has to be
with him, because she's

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:54.570 align:middle line:84%
feeling this conflict of
everything that's going,

00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:56.290 align:middle line:90%
and it pulls her here.

00:27:56.290 --> 00:28:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And this is a scene
where they come together

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:03.949 align:middle line:84%
for the first time since
he's been on Earth.

00:28:03.949 --> 00:28:04.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:05.482 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:28:05.482 --> 00:28:06.970 align:middle line:90%


00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:09.740 align:middle line:84%
>>I want you to stay here on the
mothership, where it is safe.

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:11.363 align:middle line:90%


00:28:11.363 --> 00:28:12.738 align:middle line:84%
>>But I feel
something horrible's

00:28:12.738 --> 00:28:13.881 align:middle line:90%
going to happen to you.

00:28:13.881 --> 00:28:16.170 align:middle line:90%


00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:20.466 align:middle line:84%
>>I want you to summon up all
the strength that's inside you

00:28:20.466 --> 00:28:21.751 align:middle line:90%
until this is over.

00:28:21.751 --> 00:28:25.520 align:middle line:90%


00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:26.120 align:middle line:90%
Promise me.

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:31.952 align:middle line:90%


00:28:31.952 --> 00:28:32.924 align:middle line:90%
>>I promise.

00:28:32.924 --> 00:28:40.220 align:middle line:90%


00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:42.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very touching.

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:46.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's progress the
story a little bit further.

00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:48.160 align:middle line:84%
We talked about
Val Thor's arrival.

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.420 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about Frank
going in contact with him.

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:52.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, how did you come
into contact with Frank?

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:55.100 align:middle line:84%
We have one degree
of separation now.

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:57.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO:
Interestingly enough, I

00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:01.340 align:middle line:84%
met a couple who
were friends of his

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:06.890 align:middle line:84%
since the '60s who had met
Valiant Thor on two occasions--

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:09.410 align:middle line:84%
once in the '60s and
once in the '70s.

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And they were good
friends of him.

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And so they
introduced me to him.

00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And I went and I
had lunch with him.

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:18.365 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
this will be fun.

00:29:18.365 --> 00:29:20.630 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was going to
go and have a nice lunch

00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:22.900 align:middle line:90%
and that would be the end of it.

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And little did I
know that-- it's

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:30.020 align:middle line:84%
like when you meet somebody
and it's like old family.

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:31.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:34.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: So we
literally, up until his death,

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:36.390 align:middle line:84%
we talked on the
phone every day,

00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:40.290 align:middle line:84%
and we also had lunch
at least once a week.

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, I
was writing the script.

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:45.000 align:middle line:84%
We saw each other
quite a few times

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.250 align:middle line:90%
going over stories and things.

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So he
really revealed most

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.669 align:middle line:84%
of what he experienced
and understood and knew.

00:29:50.669 --> 00:29:51.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yeah.

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
the thing that

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:56.860 align:middle line:84%
was interesting in the
details-- and I've taught acting

00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:01.480 align:middle line:84%
as well as been a casting
director for many years.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.330 align:middle line:90%


00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:04.790 align:middle line:84%
We know when you're
making movies,

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:06.280 align:middle line:90%
it's in the little details.

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:09.230 align:middle line:84%
But he would be telling a
story, and then he would stop,

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:10.540 align:middle line:90%
and it would create a memory.

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:13.730 align:middle line:84%
And he would say, one
day, I was on the ship,

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:18.090 align:middle line:84%
and blah, blah, blah
came in and said this,

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:20.810 align:middle line:84%
and it just struck me
so funny in my soul.

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And it just made me
think differently.

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:27.060 align:middle line:84%
So there were these
little side stories

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:30.180 align:middle line:84%
that were different from the
stories that he was telling me.

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:32.770 align:middle line:90%


00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:35.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What were some of
the qualitative experiences

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:39.420 align:middle line:84%
and feelings he had when he was
on board the ship with the crew

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:41.830 align:middle line:84%
and those beings and
within their technologies?

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:44.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: He said that
they were so enveloped in love.

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:51.150 align:middle line:84%
He said they would just hug
him and hold him and just

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:55.610 align:middle line:84%
do that as long as he
needed, because they knew

00:30:55.610 --> 00:31:01.640 align:middle line:84%
that what he was doing--
because he went out for,

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.680 align:middle line:84%
since the '60s up
until his death,

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:06.220 align:middle line:84%
he went around the world
speaking about this.

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And at a certain point,
he was filling stadiums

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:11.440 align:middle line:84%
all over the world
telling this story.

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:15.080 align:middle line:84%
But they would do that
because he himself

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:17.340 align:middle line:84%
came up with so much
conflict over the story.

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:20.180 align:middle line:90%


00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:24.510 align:middle line:84%
But he said the great thing
about being on the ship

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:28.040 align:middle line:84%
is that if you have glasses,
you no longer need glasses.

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:31.240 align:middle line:84%
If you had a limp,
you no longer limped.

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:33.200 align:middle line:90%
And here's an interesting thing.

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:36.100 align:middle line:84%
One time when I was
writing, he told me

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:39.715 align:middle line:84%
he was going to the ship in the
middle of when I was writing.

00:31:39.715 --> 00:31:40.650 align:middle line:90%
And I said, great.

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And I said, tell
everybody that I said hi.

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:46.300 align:middle line:90%


00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And my phone rang, and I picked
it up, and he goes, "Hello,

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:52.440 align:middle line:90%
Craig?

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:54.522 align:middle line:90%
This is Frank!"

00:31:54.522 --> 00:31:56.450 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, who?

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:58.900 align:middle line:90%
It was this young voice.

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:00.150 align:middle line:90%


00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:01.800 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, who is this?

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:06.190 align:middle line:84%
It was actually Dr. Frank
calling me from the ship,

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:10.470 align:middle line:84%
but he sounded like he was
25 instead of in his mid

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:11.890 align:middle line:90%
to late '70s.

00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:12.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:18.870 align:middle line:84%
Did he ever talk to you about--
maybe I should back up a bit.

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:22.990 align:middle line:84%
Did Valiant ever explain to
him what the healing modalities

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:25.720 align:middle line:84%
and properties that he was
bringing to Earth at that time,

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:29.090 align:middle line:84%
or attempting to bring to Earth,
were based on or consisted of?

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:31.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: I asked
him if he knew, actually,

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:33.700 align:middle line:90%
what was in that proposal.

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:35.960 align:middle line:84%
And he said that
he never told him.

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And he said, there is one thing
that I never did, and I never

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:46.700 align:middle line:84%
wanted to overstep my bounds
with him, because he said,

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:48.790 align:middle line:84%
I never saw him
smile until the '70s.

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:50.110 align:middle line:90%


00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:57.040 align:middle line:84%
He said his job is extremely
serious with what he entails,

00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:00.230 align:middle line:84%
and that I still don't know
of all of what it entails.

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:05.680 align:middle line:84%
But we know that it's keeping a
watch over the Earth and things

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:06.740 align:middle line:90%
that are going on here.

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:08.122 align:middle line:90%


00:33:08.122 --> 00:33:09.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
interesting, though.

00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:13.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of reflecting back
just from my own understanding

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.880 align:middle line:84%
of things and through
the years of meditation,

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:18.380 align:middle line:84%
doing things,
books and so forth.

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:23.370 align:middle line:84%
This notion you keep bringing up
of this intense field of love,

00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:26.080 align:middle line:84%
which is kind of the
great all that there is.

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:29.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if we were to travel
out into the purest essence

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:32.290 align:middle line:84%
into the universe, it is
this field of unconditional,

00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:34.360 align:middle line:84%
not human love,
unconditional love.

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:38.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm wondering if it even may
have been steeped in something

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:41.900 align:middle line:84%
that basic and
simple, is creating

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:44.710 align:middle line:84%
these fields within our
own life experience, which

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:46.520 align:middle line:84%
is where spontaneous
healing comes from.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.394 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: We are.

00:33:47.394 --> 00:33:50.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so he was walking
into a created field of love

00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:53.130 align:middle line:84%
and being the beneficiary
while he was there of that.

00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like it reversed
all dysfunction, aging,

00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:57.960 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:58.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yes.

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:00.440 align:middle line:90%
All of that.

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he said it
was just amazing.

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:02.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It gives
us, maybe, a hint

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:04.100 align:middle line:84%
we can work with down
the road, anyway.

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:06.766 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: There's a lot that
we can work with down the road.

00:34:06.766 --> 00:34:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Because really,
with those fields

00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:11.790 align:middle line:84%
being created and them being
created through Dr. Frank,

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:13.639 align:middle line:84%
and now being created
through the film

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:17.469 align:middle line:84%
and being created
that way, people then

00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:21.310 align:middle line:84%
couldn't feel and
see for themselves.

00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:23.510 align:middle line:84%
They can take what they
will from the story.

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:26.150 align:middle line:84%
Whether they're a believer or a
nonbeliever, it doesn't matter.

00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:28.820 align:middle line:90%
It's still an incredible story.

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:33.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's an incredible story
that we are being watched after

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.900 align:middle line:84%
and we are being looked
after, and that we

00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:39.780 align:middle line:84%
are loved on such a deep
level that we don't even

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:45.070 align:middle line:84%
know how deep it is until
we get there in that depth.

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:47.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And interestingly,
this is divine timing,

00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:50.190 align:middle line:84%
but the very next interview
I'm going to be doing

00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:54.679 align:middle line:84%
is with a man who explains
how we-- our essence

00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:57.585 align:middle line:84%
and how we can move back
into that truest essence

00:34:57.585 --> 00:34:58.460 align:middle line:90%
of the field of love.

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:00.830 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to bring this
conversation up with him,

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:04.050 align:middle line:84%
because in that field, it does
collapse all time and space.

00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:05.980 align:middle line:84%
There's no linear
time, so disease

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:07.900 align:middle line:90%
can be reversed instantly.

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And we all have the
ability to do that.

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that's part of what
the message could've been.

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:13.471 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yeah.

00:35:13.471 --> 00:35:15.880 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and I think a
lot of it was creating

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:19.025 align:middle line:84%
that field of planetary
trust and love.

00:35:19.025 --> 00:35:20.960 align:middle line:90%


00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Because without the trust,
you can't have love.

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:24.505 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:35:24.505 --> 00:35:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's what was happening
in the '50s and '60s.

00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:28.470 align:middle line:84%
These beings were
trying to say, you're

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:30.620 align:middle line:84%
part of something
galactic and larger.

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:32.470 align:middle line:90%
Don't treat us as enemies.

00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:35.685 align:middle line:84%
We're all in this cosmic
situation together.

00:35:35.685 --> 00:35:36.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: That's right.

00:35:36.810 --> 00:35:37.351 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:35:37.351 --> 00:35:41.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, did you-- we're going
to have one more clip of film

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:45.510 align:middle line:84%
which gets into the darker
agenda and his interface

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:46.534 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:35:46.534 --> 00:35:47.950 align:middle line:84%
In fact, why don't
we do that now,

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:50.490 align:middle line:84%
and then I'm going to ask
you about you, whether or not

00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:53.270 align:middle line:84%
you ever had any
contact with Val Thor.

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.870 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:57.770 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at what
happened after Valiant started

00:35:57.770 --> 00:36:02.040 align:middle line:84%
realizing he was up against
some mighty earthly forces that

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:04.100 align:middle line:84%
really were not going
to relinquish control.

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:06.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: This is the
scene with the Imperian

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:12.290 align:middle line:84%
who is the head of the
corporate world of the men

00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:14.957 align:middle line:84%
who run the world
behind the scenes.

00:36:14.957 --> 00:36:16.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The shadowy few.

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:16.657 align:middle line:90%


00:36:16.657 --> 00:36:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: We call
them the Secret Shadow

00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:19.490 align:middle line:90%
Society in the film.

00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:21.118 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's
take a look at it.

00:36:21.118 --> 00:36:23.210 align:middle line:90%


00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:27.795 align:middle line:84%
>>We've heard of your
arrival from many sources.

00:36:27.795 --> 00:36:28.689 align:middle line:90%


00:36:28.689 --> 00:36:30.105 align:middle line:84%
>>What can I do
for you gentlemen?

00:36:30.105 --> 00:36:31.300 align:middle line:90%


00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:33.985 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, we're not in
need of your many cures.

00:36:33.985 --> 00:36:35.350 align:middle line:90%


00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:41.330 align:middle line:84%
Everything from cancer
to the common cold,

00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:42.610 align:middle line:90%
we already possess those.

00:36:42.610 --> 00:36:43.940 align:middle line:90%


00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:49.885 align:middle line:84%
But the general here tells us
that you have certain behavior

00:36:49.885 --> 00:36:50.385 align:middle line:90%
problems.

00:36:50.385 --> 00:36:51.820 align:middle line:90%


00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:54.390 align:middle line:90%
He's asked us to train you.

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:56.947 align:middle line:90%


00:36:56.947 --> 00:36:58.030 align:middle line:90%
>>I cannot be brainwashed.

00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:59.662 align:middle line:90%


00:36:59.662 --> 00:37:00.162 align:middle line:90%
>>Huh.

00:37:00.162 --> 00:37:01.920 align:middle line:90%


00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:07.400 align:middle line:84%
But you see, we have unsavory
contacts on other worlds

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:11.330 align:middle line:84%
who have taught us a great many
things about created beings.

00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:13.120 align:middle line:90%


00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:18.310 align:middle line:84%
This machine, for example,
was especially built for us

00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:23.580 align:middle line:84%
by our otherworldly allies
who, for some peculiar reason,

00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:24.985 align:middle line:90%
wish to see you fail.

00:37:24.985 --> 00:37:26.467 align:middle line:90%


00:37:26.467 --> 00:37:27.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:29.260 align:middle line:84%
I've done enough
shows on that subject

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:32.944 align:middle line:84%
to know what he was up
against, and it's like, oh.

00:37:32.944 --> 00:37:34.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yeah,
it's pretty intense.

00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:36.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know,
this is a very fine line

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:42.740 align:middle line:84%
to walk as humans, to allow
oneself to be made aware

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:44.270 align:middle line:90%
that these forces are real.

00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Just as the light and
the universal love

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:50.660 align:middle line:84%
is the solvent of the
universe, that's real.

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:52.570 align:middle line:84%
But also, there
are other energies

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:54.920 align:middle line:84%
that are shadowy that are
just slightly phased off

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:57.320 align:middle line:84%
that we can't necessarily
see, and embodied

00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:00.310 align:middle line:84%
in some of these characters,
that are equally present.

00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:03.530 align:middle line:84%
To understand that
reality and that we

00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:06.530 align:middle line:84%
chose to dance in
that zone and learn

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:09.430 align:middle line:84%
the difference between
the two and choose one,

00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:12.030 align:middle line:90%
choose to overcome that, wow.

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:14.930 align:middle line:84%
But how did he feel when
this was all said and done?

00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:18.530 align:middle line:90%


00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:21.302 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Dr. Frank told me
that all of the vice commanders

00:38:21.302 --> 00:38:29.865 align:middle line:84%
were-- they were all in a state
of incomprehensible sadness.

00:38:29.865 --> 00:38:31.140 align:middle line:90%


00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:33.340 align:middle line:90%
Teel, I know, cried.

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:34.625 align:middle line:90%
I know a lot of them cried.

00:38:34.625 --> 00:38:36.260 align:middle line:90%


00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:37.920 align:middle line:90%
He felt defeated.

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:39.620 align:middle line:90%
He felt a lot of things.

00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And if you can
imagine, again, going

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:48.460 align:middle line:84%
into the mind of really who and
what he is, to feel that defeat

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:54.220 align:middle line:84%
and people not treating
you with any respect

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:57.762 align:middle line:84%
and only wanting your
technology-- because you have

00:38:57.762 --> 00:38:59.971 align:middle line:84%
to remember, his technology
was spiritual technology.

00:38:59.971 --> 00:39:00.845 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:39:00.845 --> 00:39:03.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: It was not
technology that destroys.

00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:05.540 align:middle line:90%
It was technology that deflects.

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:07.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But as
he came physically

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:11.650 align:middle line:84%
to deliver these messages,
the other entities

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:14.230 align:middle line:84%
that work in other
shadowy realms

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:18.936 align:middle line:84%
with people in high places
redouble their efforts

00:39:18.936 --> 00:39:20.560 align:middle line:84%
when some kind of
light comes forward--

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:23.720 align:middle line:84%
which is why you see almost
kind of in the other dimensional

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:26.930 align:middle line:84%
realms, you could say a
battle's going on constantly.

00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:28.750 align:middle line:84%
The more people
awaken, the more light,

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:30.870 align:middle line:84%
the more possibility
comes in, the more you

00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:32.650 align:middle line:84%
start seeing the
darker influence, which

00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:35.820 align:middle line:84%
expresses itself in the
earthly realms in politics,

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:37.410 align:middle line:90%
media, entertainment, all of it.

00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:39.570 align:middle line:90%
Dark, down, down.

00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And so he could see that those
other forces were actually--

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:44.215 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: They're there.

00:39:44.215 --> 00:39:44.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:45.890 align:middle line:90%


00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:46.390 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:48.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, did you ever have
any personal experience

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:49.510 align:middle line:90%
with Val Thor?

00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:51.782 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Well, I wish
I could say I met him.

00:39:51.782 --> 00:39:54.240 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of people in the
world would love to meet him.

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:56.240 align:middle line:84%
I would love to
meet him as well.

00:39:56.240 --> 00:40:01.490 align:middle line:84%
But the day that I started
writing the script,

00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:05.300 align:middle line:84%
he came to me in a dream
and he spoke to me.

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And basically, it was
about him showing me

00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:13.510 align:middle line:84%
the path of the movie and
the path of shooting it

00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:16.840 align:middle line:84%
on a sound stage, and the
path how they were going--

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:20.740 align:middle line:84%
he was showing me this machine
that was a sound machine that

00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:25.300 align:middle line:84%
eliminated all negative things
so that this pathway would move

00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:25.800 align:middle line:90%
smoothly.

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:26.930 align:middle line:90%


00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:30.300 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about,
isn't it interesting

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:33.430 align:middle line:84%
how God puts people
together to work together?

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking, wow, this
is really an amazing thing

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:40.300 align:middle line:90%
that I get to do this story.

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:42.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you have that
same openness and sweetness

00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:43.800 align:middle line:90%
that Frank Stranges had.

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:44.722 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yes.

00:40:44.722 --> 00:40:46.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That kind
of an innocence

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:47.640 align:middle line:90%
which would be desirable.

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:49.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: But
the one that really

00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:56.180 align:middle line:84%
got me was years after I met
Dr. Frank, I at one point

00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:58.620 align:middle line:90%
had a bowel obstruction.

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And I was in extreme pain, and
I was rushed to the doctor.

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And then they rushed
me to the hospital.

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And they took x-rays,
and they told me

00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:09.140 align:middle line:84%
I was going to
have to be operated

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:10.970 align:middle line:90%
on first thing in the morning.

00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And so that night, I woke up and
I felt Teel standing over me.

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:19.845 align:middle line:90%
I was just woke up.

00:41:19.845 --> 00:41:22.820 align:middle line:84%
I was in twilight, where
you're awake and asleep

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:24.140 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And I felt her
energy, and I felt

00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:30.180 align:middle line:84%
bubbles going through
all my intestines.

00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And I knew when I
woke up in the morning

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:35.640 align:middle line:84%
that I wasn't going to
have to have an operation.

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:38.220 align:middle line:84%
So when I woke up in the
morning, I look over.

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:41.740 align:middle line:84%
Sitting in the chair across
from me is Dr. Frank.

00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me and he goes,
Teel called me this morning

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:46.590 align:middle line:84%
and said she fixed
you up last night.

00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:48.490 align:middle line:90%
And I went, I know.

00:41:48.490 --> 00:41:49.140 align:middle line:90%
Just like that.

00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And that was such a huge
confirmation for me.

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:54.800 align:middle line:90%


00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they did
x-rays again at my urging,

00:41:58.470 --> 00:41:59.990 align:middle line:90%
and said, oh, you're fine.

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:03.345 align:middle line:84%
And I walked out of the hospital
about 2 o'clock that afternoon.

00:42:03.345 --> 00:42:05.123 align:middle line:90%


00:42:05.123 --> 00:42:05.819 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:05.819 --> 00:42:06.610 align:middle line:90%
There's your proof.

00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:11.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: So that
was really big proof.

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:14.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so you're
in a film festival.

00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:16.050 align:middle line:90%


00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:17.260 align:middle line:90%
You were in a film festival.

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:18.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: No, we are.

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:19.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And you, what, an
official selection

00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:24.780 align:middle line:84%
at the Burbank
International Film Festival?

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens
from this point forward?

00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:29.092 align:middle line:84%
Because everybody's going
to want to see this film

00:42:29.092 --> 00:42:30.800 align:middle line:84%
that's watching this
interview right now.

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:31.966 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yes, they are.

00:42:31.966 --> 00:42:32.940 align:middle line:90%


00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:37.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, we made the film to
accompany our business package

00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:39.780 align:middle line:84%
with our entertainment
attorney to raise the money

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:41.412 align:middle line:90%
to make the big film.

00:42:41.412 --> 00:42:43.120 align:middle line:84%
So that's why you see
the visual effects,

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:45.902 align:middle line:84%
and everything is going to be
state of the art and things

00:42:45.902 --> 00:42:47.110 align:middle line:90%
that we've never seen before.

00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:48.990 align:middle line:84%
These are spiritual
technologies.

00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:52.720 align:middle line:84%
These are interfaces that
we have not seen before.

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
people of the world

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:58.120 align:middle line:84%
would like to see a movie
that's going to still entertain

00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:01.740 align:middle line:84%
them, be different,
unique, and is

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:04.990 align:middle line:90%
going to have a spiritual base.

00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:07.091 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are we going
to be able to get copies

00:43:07.091 --> 00:43:09.340 align:middle line:84%
of the short film before the
release of the long film,

00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:10.110 align:middle line:90%
the full length version?

00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:10.901 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yeah.

00:43:10.901 --> 00:43:13.840 align:middle line:10%
People can go to
strangeratthepentagon.com,

00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:15.387 align:middle line:10%
and they can get the book there.

00:43:15.387 --> 00:43:16.470 align:middle line:10%
They can also get posters.

00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:18.845 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk about some of
the other books, because you

00:43:18.845 --> 00:43:20.345 align:middle line:84%
have amazing things
that no one has.

00:43:20.345 --> 00:43:21.344 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: There are.

00:43:21.344 --> 00:43:24.105 align:middle line:84%
Well, all these books that Dr.
Frank wrote are out of print,

00:43:24.105 --> 00:43:27.550 align:middle line:84%
so the publisher has given me
the remainder of the books.

00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:29.320 align:middle line:10%
So there's "Stranger
at the Pentagon,"

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:34.590 align:middle line:10%
"UFO Conspiracy," "Outwitting
Tomorrow," which was also--

00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:37.860 align:middle line:10%
Valiant Thor was the adviser,
another one called "Millennium

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:40.220 align:middle line:10%
Seven," and then the
book that I wrote,

00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:42.140 align:middle line:10%
which is called
"The Autobiography

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:46.159 align:middle line:10%
of an Extraterrestrial
Saga-- I am Thyron."

00:43:46.159 --> 00:43:46.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:49.140 align:middle line:90%
So Valiant Thor.

00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:49.909 align:middle line:90%
He's still here.

00:43:49.909 --> 00:43:50.950 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Still here.

00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:52.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does he ever
appear physically to anyone

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:53.530 align:middle line:90%
these days?

00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:55.821 align:middle line:90%


00:43:55.821 --> 00:43:58.070 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: I have come
in contact with a few people

00:43:58.070 --> 00:44:00.717 align:middle line:84%
that he's appeared to, but
it was back in the '50s.

00:44:00.717 --> 00:44:02.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, and you know what?

00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:03.758 align:middle line:84%
I met someone at a
dinner party recently,

00:44:03.758 --> 00:44:06.050 align:middle line:84%
I meant to mention this a
while ago, Sharon Clark, who

00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:07.950 align:middle line:84%
you're now familiar
with as well.

00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:12.320 align:middle line:84%
She was telling me
that she was 14 or 15

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:16.490 align:middle line:84%
and her parents were among those
who would go out to these UFO

00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:18.860 align:middle line:84%
sightings back in
the '50s and '60s.

00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And she said she met
Valiant Thor back then.

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And again, this connection,
as soon as he looked at her,

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:29.160 align:middle line:84%
this melting away of
anything but love.

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:32.486 align:middle line:84%
And she was concerned as a
young child because of the Cuban

00:44:32.486 --> 00:44:34.360 align:middle line:84%
Missile Crisis and all
these things going on,

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:36.660 align:middle line:84%
the Cold War, that we were
going to nuke each other

00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:38.220 align:middle line:90%
and she would die.

00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And he told her this
will not be allowed.

00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:43.990 align:middle line:84%
This is not going
to happen here.

00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And so to rest assured
that there would not

00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:48.610 align:middle line:90%
be this annihilation on Earth.

00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:49.905 align:middle line:90%
It was all being taken care of.

00:44:49.905 --> 00:44:51.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: That's right.

00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:52.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So beautiful.

00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:53.642 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: That is.

00:44:53.642 --> 00:44:55.527 align:middle line:90%
And I get that message as well.

00:44:55.527 --> 00:44:56.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:56.110 --> 00:44:57.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: I've
gotten that very,

00:44:57.610 --> 00:45:00.174 align:middle line:84%
very strongly that that
is not going to happen.

00:45:00.174 --> 00:45:02.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Craig, thank you
so much for sharing this.

00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:03.697 align:middle line:90%
I just adore this story.

00:45:03.697 --> 00:45:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Thank you so much.

00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:06.569 align:middle line:90%
I loved being here.

00:45:06.569 --> 00:45:08.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As I said at
the top of the show,

00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:09.740 align:middle line:90%
this is a fascinating story.

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:12.530 align:middle line:84%
And thank goodness Craig is
bringing it to light via film.

00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:14.260 align:middle line:10%
