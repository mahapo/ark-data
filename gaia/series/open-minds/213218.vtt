00:00:15.188 --> 00:00:17.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: One of
the most enigmatic characters

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.500 align:middle line:84%
in the field of ufology has been
the one-armed Swiss farmer named

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.580 align:middle line:90%
Billy Meier.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.570 align:middle line:84%
Many have tried to discredit his
story out of envy or skepticism,

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.010 align:middle line:90%
yet it holds up.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.260 align:middle line:84%
The woman who has been
investigating this story

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.090 align:middle line:90%
for decades is Brit Elders.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And she's here to set the record
straight, once and for all.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.250 align:middle line:84%
Brit, I'm so happy
to have you here.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.490 align:middle line:84%
I've been following
this story for decades,

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.560 align:middle line:84%
following you
following the story,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:48.020 align:middle line:84%
and just noticed how mean
spirited the UFO community is

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:55.170 align:middle line:84%
about it when, certainly seems
it has the most evidence of most

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.770 align:middle line:84%
well-documented most advanced
methods of documentation

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.769 align:middle line:84%
for the day of anything,
any other story

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:05.850 align:middle line:90%
we've seen out there.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.930 align:middle line:90%
Yet, it continues.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.350 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about how
you and your husband,

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.290 align:middle line:84%
your late husband,
Lee Elders, became

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.060 align:middle line:84%
involved in
investigating this story.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.282 align:middle line:84%
Because this goes
back to the 1970s.

00:01:17.282 --> 00:01:18.240 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIT ELDERS: It does.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.830 align:middle line:90%
The case actually began in '75.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.270 align:middle line:10%
In January of '75,
a friend of ours,

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.800 align:middle line:10%
Lieutenant Colonel Wendelle
Stevens brought it to us in '76

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.610 align:middle line:10%
and said, this is something
you've got to be involved with.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.670 align:middle line:84%
The reason he felt so
strongly about that is Lee

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.140 align:middle line:84%
and I had a company
called Intercept,

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.760 align:middle line:84%
which was all about electronic
communication protection.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.490 align:middle line:84%
So we protected
telephones and computers

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.130 align:middle line:90%
from being eavesdropped on.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.730 align:middle line:84%
We weren't about to just
scrap our reputation

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.907 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, we're going
to go check out a UFO--

00:01:52.907 --> 00:01:54.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So why did he ask you?

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.190 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: Yeah, because we had
the investigative background.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And you were familiar
with technology

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.660 align:middle line:90%
that could investigate.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: And we knew how
to run an investigation.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.780 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't matter if it's
murder one, corporate espionage,

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.890 align:middle line:10%
or a UFO case.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.320 align:middle line:10%
You have criteria you follow.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's what makes an
investigation functional.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:14.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.680 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: Yeah.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.300 align:middle line:84%
So we, kind of, sat back
for about six months,

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.690 align:middle line:84%
and then decided, nope,
this is worth looking into.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.150 align:middle line:84%
We had a sweep of
electronics over in London.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.280 align:middle line:84%
We went from London
into Switzerland,

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.860 align:middle line:84%
ended up spending
a week with Meier,

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.280 align:middle line:84%
expecting to be able to
disprove it immediately.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.630 align:middle line:90%
We couldn't.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And just before we
left, he turned over

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.140 align:middle line:84%
inner negatives of the
photographs, movie footage,

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:51.070 align:middle line:84%
metal samples, audio recordings,
crystals, supposedly from Ã‰ire

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.460 align:middle line:84%
and introduced us to all
of these witnesses that

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.910 align:middle line:90%
had seen things.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:02.180 align:middle line:84%
So we had more than we expected
to ever have from any UFO case.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.385 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about his story, then,

00:03:04.385 --> 00:03:06.760 align:middle line:84%
and then we're going to go
back into some of the evidence

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.600 align:middle line:90%
later on.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.470 align:middle line:90%
But why Billy?

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.580 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he was modest.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.680 align:middle line:84%
He was a caretaker, a farmer, a
father, a husband, a modest man,

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.280 align:middle line:84%
but very, kind of-- it seems
like very open and, kind of,

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.980 align:middle line:90%
clear in his own psyche.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And so how did they
first contact him?

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And did they tell him
why they contacted him?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk
about how it first

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.313 align:middle line:84%
happened when the first craft
landed, and what he tried to do.

00:03:36.313 --> 00:03:37.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: Well,
let's take it back

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.730 align:middle line:84%
a little further, because there
are some aspects that people

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:41.870 align:middle line:90%
weren't aware of.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.200 align:middle line:84%
Billy claimed that he
had his initial contact

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.770 align:middle line:84%
when he was five years
old, with his father.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.960 align:middle line:90%
And so this was telepathic.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And it was continuing
over a period of time.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.920 align:middle line:90%
They were monitoring him.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And the reason they
were monitoring him

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.830 align:middle line:84%
is that they recognized
his vibrations

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.110 align:middle line:90%
from past incarnations.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.040 align:middle line:84%
So they understood his
reincarnation pattern,

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.300 align:middle line:84%
were able to recognize it,
and work with it, monitor him,

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.095 align:middle line:84%
and then set up contact,
face-to-face, in the '70s.

00:04:15.095 --> 00:04:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And some of the other
stories I've read about contact

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.890 align:middle line:84%
back from the '50s, '60s, and
'70s, the ones that are more

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.190 align:middle line:90%
credible, same thing.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.150 align:middle line:84%
They had these kind of
interdimensional contacts

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.000 align:middle line:84%
with beings for quite a
long time before anything

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.200 align:middle line:90%
physical showed up.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: That's true.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.320 align:middle line:84%
Even on into the '70s and '80s,
some cases down in South America

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.160 align:middle line:84%
had the same thing, happened
as kids, telepathic contact,

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.230 align:middle line:84%
monitoring, and
then moving forward.

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.810 align:middle line:84%
The Pleiadians talked
to Billy about this.

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.760 align:middle line:84%
And they say that
several times they've

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.970 align:middle line:84%
tried to make contact with what
they call Earth humans, us.

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And they haven't been able
to, because the person either

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.850 align:middle line:84%
becomes disloyal to the
thought, or they become somehow

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.800 align:middle line:84%
involved with manipulations
and issues with materialism,

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.680 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.590 align:middle line:84%
So they've broken
the contacts off.

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.710 align:middle line:84%
Billy, for the most
part, has remained

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.180 align:middle line:84%
fairly true to wanting
to continue the dialogue

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.620 align:middle line:84%
and the knowledge
that comes with that.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So let's start 1975.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.750 align:middle line:84%
What is the exact
date here, January--

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: January 28, yes.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.410 align:middle line:90%
So he gets an impulse.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And he says he gets this cooling
sensation across his forehead.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.350 align:middle line:84%
The impulse is to
get on his moped

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.050 align:middle line:84%
and go out into the
forest, which he does.

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens
is he's standing there.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.100 align:middle line:90%
And he hears the sound.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.170 align:middle line:90%
And he can't describe the sound.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:48.940 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a whirring, but
not quite anything he knows.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.850 align:middle line:90%
Suddenly, a ship appears.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.470 align:middle line:90%
It hovers for a while.

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:58.720 align:middle line:84%
It moves across the forest,
hovers again, and then slowly

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.430 align:middle line:90%
moves down towards the Earth.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.270 align:middle line:84%
Then he sees a woman
appear from behind him.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, he
was trying to-- as I

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.140 align:middle line:84%
read in your book,
beautiful book, by the way.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm so happy that
you put this one out

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.820 align:middle line:90%
with the complete illustrations.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.460 align:middle line:84%
It's a coffee table
book that I tend

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.180 align:middle line:84%
to share with a
number of people,

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.510 align:middle line:84%
especially those who
think it's not possible.

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.055 align:middle line:84%
But in any event,
in the book, you

00:06:21.055 --> 00:06:22.930 align:middle line:84%
say that Billy tried to
run toward the craft.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.420 align:middle line:84%
His initial instinct
was to run toward it.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.200 align:middle line:84%
Force field kind
of blew him back.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.117 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: He couldn't.

00:06:28.117 --> 00:06:31.930 align:middle line:84%
It just held him back so
that there was a protection

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:33.770 align:middle line:90%
field around the craft.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.100 align:middle line:84%
Later, Semjase told him
that they can actually

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.940 align:middle line:84%
put up a kind of
invisible barrier,

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.270 align:middle line:84%
so they can allow one person
to see the craft but not

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.530 align:middle line:90%
another person.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's all part
of this force field

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.040 align:middle line:90%
that goes around the craft.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now he
meets with Semjase.

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:51.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: Mm-hmm.

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She comes up from--

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.167 align:middle line:84%
she disappeared
from behind him--

00:06:55.167 --> 00:06:57.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: Behind the craft,
walks out towards the front.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk about
his first encounter

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.790 align:middle line:84%
with this female
from the Pleiades.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: Well, first
of all, they told him

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:10.490 align:middle line:84%
that they used
females, because males

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:12.320 align:middle line:90%
were less aggressive to them.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.680 align:middle line:84%
So it made perfect sense
that his first contact

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.420 align:middle line:90%
would be with a woman.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.720 align:middle line:84%
Later, he did have contacts
with Quetzal and Ptaah

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.600 align:middle line:90%
and others that are male.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.300 align:middle line:84%
But the first contact
always female.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is true in
other cases, too, I've noticed.

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And usually a very
attractive one.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:33.410 align:middle line:84%
So there's something
almost inviting

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:37.460 align:middle line:84%
where the man wants to talk to
a beautiful female who appears

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:38.840 align:middle line:90%
to be very non-threatening.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.580 align:middle line:90%
But she had messages for him.

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.800 align:middle line:84%
She had things to say about
what was going to happen.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.380 align:middle line:84%
What was the first
contact about?

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.755 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: Well,
the first contact

00:07:45.755 --> 00:07:48.380 align:middle line:84%
was sort of an
overview of everything

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:51.470 align:middle line:84%
that would be going on,
that they had selected him.

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And then they moved
forward from there.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:58.910 align:middle line:84%
Each contact didn't
have a specific focus

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:02.480 align:middle line:84%
about what was being said,
or what was going on.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.340 align:middle line:84%
It incorporated many,
many different things.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:10.490 align:middle line:84%
Most of them, you could take
a nugget of information.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.580 align:middle line:84%
They might be talking about
things going on at the farm

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.220 align:middle line:90%
with Billy or his family life.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:20.030 align:middle line:84%
But then there's this beautiful
nugget, like a spiritually

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:21.710 align:middle line:90%
developing person.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.920 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that catches your
attention, what is that?

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Or that Earth human creates
luck within themselves.

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:30.080 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.400 align:middle line:90%
All of that starts coming into--

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.730 align:middle line:84%
so when you're reading
these contact notes,

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:37.850 align:middle line:84%
you're reading family
issues, all of this.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:41.299 align:middle line:84%
And then you're getting this
beautiful, delightful piece

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:44.240 align:middle line:84%
of knowledge that
needs to be shared.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.935 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'll share
one of the passages

00:08:45.935 --> 00:08:47.060 align:middle line:90%
from your book in a second.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.630 align:middle line:84%
But interestingly,
many people, there

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.450 align:middle line:84%
are quite a few witnesses
right in his little area

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:56.360 align:middle line:84%
that had seen these craft,
but they were not approached.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.310 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't for them
to be approached.

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:00.950 align:middle line:84%
But they witnessed the
crafts coming and going.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:02.400 align:middle line:90%
And they became used to it.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: Yes--

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
there were what?

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:08.870 align:middle line:90%
105 encounters in three years?

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: That was
just the beginning.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they've so
many more since then.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:18.020 align:middle line:84%
But I interviewed the
postmaster from the little town

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:19.310 align:middle line:90%
of SchmidrÃ¼ti.

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:20.570 align:middle line:90%
And I walked up to him.

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, do you think
Meier's having these things?

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.100 align:middle line:90%
He's, oh, yeah.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.565 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, everybody knows it.

00:09:26.565 --> 00:09:27.690 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what they are.

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:28.760 align:middle line:90%
I don't care.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:29.712 align:middle line:90%
No, he's having it--

00:09:29.712 --> 00:09:30.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just accepting it--

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: Nonchalant,
just right there--

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.663 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was just part
of their everyday life,

00:09:34.663 --> 00:09:36.590 align:middle line:84%
because it was so
common in that area.

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And there was no one to
shoot them down, Swiss army?

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:39.890 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:41.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: Well, it
was very interesting,

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:47.150 align:middle line:84%
because above the hill where
Meier lived was a Swiss army

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:47.960 align:middle line:90%
base.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they never
tried to interfere.

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:51.517 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: They never
tried to interfere.

00:09:51.517 --> 00:09:54.230 align:middle line:84%
But we knew they were
monitoring everything going on.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.090 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to
learn from it too.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:57.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK.

00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:01.220 align:middle line:84%
So I'll share just one
little passage from Semjase.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:04.430 align:middle line:84%
She said, "we too are still
far removed from perfection

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.010 align:middle line:84%
and have to evolve constantly,
just like yourselves.

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:10.100 align:middle line:84%
We're neither superior
nor superhuman, nor are

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.060 align:middle line:90%
we missionaries.

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:14.120 align:middle line:84%
We feel duty bound to
the citizens of Earth,

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:18.320 align:middle line:84%
because our forefathers
were your forefathers".

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.170 align:middle line:84%
So tell me a little more
about expanding on that,

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:23.640 align:middle line:90%
and what he learned over time.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.000 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: Well, the
history of the Pleiadians

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.710 align:middle line:90%
is that they actually came here.

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:32.810 align:middle line:84%
They visited here eons ago,
as did other civilizations,

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:38.590 align:middle line:84%
so that it's not just that
we developed here on Earth,

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:44.710 align:middle line:84%
but we were actually interbred
with different civilizations

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:47.140 align:middle line:90%
from all over the universe.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.510 align:middle line:90%
The Pleiades happened to be one.

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:51.700 align:middle line:90%
So that's where that started.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:55.360 align:middle line:84%
We got into investigating
the history of the Pleiades

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.750 align:middle line:84%
as it worked with all
the different Indigenous

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:00.310 align:middle line:90%
ancient cultures.

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:03.070 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't a single
one where we couldn't

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:05.500 align:middle line:84%
find a reference
to the Pleiades,

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:10.030 align:middle line:84%
always as the Seven Sisters,
the harbingers of destiny,

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:14.650 align:middle line:84%
something beautiful, something
feminine, interesting,

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:20.450 align:middle line:84%
something that was
never derogatory at all.

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:23.990 align:middle line:84%
It was always something
that was helpful.

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:28.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I mean, some people
talk about noninterference

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:29.980 align:middle line:90%
as prime directive, and all.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:33.220 align:middle line:84%
They're not here to interfere
from my understanding.

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:36.440 align:middle line:84%
They're here to help
educate sometimes,

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.130 align:middle line:84%
just like a parent would with a
child to say, when I was a kid,

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:41.790 align:middle line:90%
I took that path.

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:43.800 align:middle line:90%
And it resulted in disaster.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.380 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just trying
to help you along,

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:49.620 align:middle line:84%
to make a better, wiser decision
than I. Is it kind of like that?

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:51.260 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: It is like that.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.020 align:middle line:84%
But also, when they
were here before,

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:59.930 align:middle line:84%
there was some interference,
because humans looked at them

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:03.365 align:middle line:84%
with this admiration that then
turned into this messiah--

00:12:03.365 --> 00:12:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Gods, yeah,
turned them-- and tried

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.200 align:middle line:90%
to turn them into gods.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: Exactly.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.720 align:middle line:90%
And that created more problems.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they
left for a while.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.665 align:middle line:84%
They didn't need to
be a part of that.

00:12:12.665 --> 00:12:14.940 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't why they were here.

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.530 align:middle line:84%
What happened at
that point was all

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:20.300 align:middle line:84%
these different
civilizations they

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:24.550 align:middle line:84%
had contacted continued
to use the information

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:25.840 align:middle line:90%
they got from them.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:30.760 align:middle line:84%
Some continue to revere them as
gods, even though they didn't

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.800 align:middle line:90%
consider themselves as such.

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.210 align:middle line:90%
They pulled back.

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:36.760 align:middle line:84%
Then they come forward,
again, with Meier

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.740 align:middle line:84%
and a few other Pleiadian
contactees as well.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And they did say
that in the Pleiades,

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.690 align:middle line:84%
they had encountered
all of the problems

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:49.930 align:middle line:84%
during their growth and
growing pains as civilization

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:52.660 align:middle line:84%
that we are encountering
here on Earth.

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:56.110 align:middle line:84%
Did they talk at any
point about going

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:58.330 align:middle line:84%
through the phase of
what happened when they

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:01.100 align:middle line:90%
became lost in materialism?

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:01.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: Yeah.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:06.490 align:middle line:84%
They talk about living on
Libra, a system in Libra.

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And they actually had
a thermonuclear war.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:12.980 align:middle line:90%
They had to leave in bunches.

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:13.840 align:middle line:90%
They took off.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.300 align:middle line:84%
They went to the Pleiades,
the Hyades, and Vega.

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:20.520 align:middle line:84%
They had to engineer planets
where they could live.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.790 align:middle line:84%
This is something we're
looking at doing now.

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:27.850 align:middle line:84%
But their issue with
thermonuclear war,

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:30.780 align:middle line:84%
and I think it's very
clear when they say,

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:34.110 align:middle line:90%
we cannot interfere yet.

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:39.180 align:middle line:84%
Because that issue of nuclear
war doesn't just affect Earth.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.820 align:middle line:90%
It affects the entire cosmos.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:44.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, my group of
beings that I'm associated with

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:46.030 align:middle line:90%
told me this 40 years ago.

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:48.610 align:middle line:84%
This is not about Earth,
once you start that game.

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:49.410 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: Exactly.

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:51.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's about the universe.

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And if you're going
to consider yourself

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.550 align:middle line:84%
part of this cosmic
family, you have

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:59.040 align:middle line:84%
to view yourself as part
of the cosmic family,

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.800 align:middle line:90%
and not be so self-centered.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.080 align:middle line:90%
It's not about us.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:04.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And toward that end,
there was a piece

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:11.100 align:middle line:84%
I did recently, a
commentary and a follow-up

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:16.830 align:middle line:84%
on it regarding Oppenheimer
and Einstein, who had written

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:20.890 align:middle line:84%
to President Truman after what
had happened saying, look,

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:26.280 align:middle line:84%
we need to establish some
sort of global organization

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:30.390 align:middle line:84%
of mature citizens that can
speak with the extraterrestrials

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:31.830 align:middle line:90%
that we brought on.

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:34.230 align:middle line:84%
They felt that the increase
in the UFO activity

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:37.380 align:middle line:84%
was really brought
on by our detonation

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:40.800 align:middle line:84%
of the atomic weapons,
and that, perhaps, we

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.130 align:middle line:84%
weren't mature enough, and that
perhaps we-- they even suggested

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:46.290 align:middle line:84%
at one point in the
six-page document

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:51.030 align:middle line:84%
that Earth might have
a friendly colonization

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:55.420 align:middle line:84%
to help us refine our thoughts
and understanding of things

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:56.220 align:middle line:90%
a bit.

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:59.190 align:middle line:84%
It was quite fascinating to
see that they were open to it

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:03.750 align:middle line:84%
and suggesting this because
of the nuclear detonations.

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:04.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: It is a problem.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:08.840 align:middle line:84%
But they do say that they can't
interfere yet, that yet, I

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.190 align:middle line:90%
think, is the operative word.

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:13.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think there have
been some incidences where there

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:16.620 align:middle line:84%
has been help and
interference in a good way,

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:19.440 align:middle line:84%
where there have been some
exchanges that were thwarted

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.772 align:middle line:90%
by beings from elsewhere?

00:15:20.772 --> 00:15:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: Well, look
at what was going on

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.815 align:middle line:84%
with some of the launches
with the space shuttle.

00:15:24.815 --> 00:15:25.615 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:25.615 --> 00:15:26.545 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: Mm-hmm?

00:15:26.545 --> 00:15:27.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:27.915 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: Same thing.

00:15:27.915 --> 00:15:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And look at the tests
and the analysis

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:31.900 align:middle line:84%
that was to be done in
space on the shuttle.

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:32.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:33.340 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: So yeah.

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:37.270 align:middle line:84%
So just behind the scenes,
a little bit of help

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:40.210 align:middle line:84%
were needed to stop some of
the disasters from occurring.

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:41.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: Yes.

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:43.353 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they said that
there are about 3,000 years

00:15:43.353 --> 00:15:45.730 align:middle line:84%
in advance of us
technologically, which,

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:48.160 align:middle line:84%
when you consider how fast
technology is advancing,

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.630 align:middle line:90%
that's quite a long way.

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: Yes.

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:53.350 align:middle line:84%
It's a long way,
but it's really not.

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:55.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you look
at where we've come

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.340 align:middle line:90%
to just in the last 50 years.

00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:58.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Crazy, yeah.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: Yeah.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And now with AI and
everything else,

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.800 align:middle line:90%
and we're keeping up with that.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:04.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.620 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah.

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:08.010 align:middle line:84%
Did they talk at all
about AI with Meier?

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:09.010 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: --they didn't.

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:09.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:12.640 align:middle line:84%
I was going to say I haven't
seen that in the-- yeah, OK.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:16.150 align:middle line:84%
So they say that the development
technologically that we're

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:17.560 align:middle line:90%
experiencing on Earth is--

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's natural
we're able to do it.

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And also, there
are people here who

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:23.230 align:middle line:84%
are incarnating
from other places

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:24.710 align:middle line:90%
or just bringing this forward.

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:27.210 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: And you've got all
this telepathic communication--

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:27.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS:
--indoctrination going on.

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:29.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.100 align:middle line:84%
So to develop the
technology isn't really

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:37.400 align:middle line:84%
as challenging as developing
the wisdom as a species.

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.550 align:middle line:84%
So tell us a little
bit more about what

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:42.430 align:middle line:84%
they say about that, before
they go into what they

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:44.860 align:middle line:90%
say the human is capable of.

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: Well, we've
got to get to a place

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:51.520 align:middle line:84%
where we stop
worshiping the material.

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.970 align:middle line:84%
And we have to move into
a balance, a harmony,

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:57.940 align:middle line:84%
of the spirit and
the material world.

00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.500 align:middle line:84%
We live in a
third-dimensional world.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:00.880 align:middle line:90%
You can't escape it.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.740 align:middle line:90%
You need material items.

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:06.230 align:middle line:84%
But we've lost connection
with our hearts.

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:07.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Totally.

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at people
like this and their cell phones

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:12.310 align:middle line:84%
watching the latest
influencer, you

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:14.710 align:middle line:90%
know, where everybody has had--

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:18.940 align:middle line:84%
so many people starting at such
young ages are having work done,

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:23.060 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, surgery done on
their faces and their bodies--

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: It's all about how
you look and what you have.

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:26.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:28.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's nothing to do
with why we're incarnated.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: That's right.

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:33.730 align:middle line:84%
It's about what's happening
in your heart, in your spirit.

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:35.620 align:middle line:90%
We've lost that connection.

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.360 align:middle line:84%
Until we get that
connection back,

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.460 align:middle line:84%
we're really not going
to progress much.

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:42.080 align:middle line:90%
We might, with technology.

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.540 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't
mean we're going

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:46.640 align:middle line:84%
to progress on a spiritual
or a heartfelt level.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And those are the ones that
we have to really work at.

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:54.370 align:middle line:84%
If we want to be part of
this cosmic world out there,

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:56.480 align:middle line:84%
we have got to
have that balance.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.730 align:middle line:90%
And we don't.

00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's really unfortunate
at this point in time.

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:04.750 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the reasons we
wanted to bring this book back,

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:07.270 align:middle line:90%
because it's 45 years later.

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:10.240 align:middle line:84%
There are new generations,
new open minds that

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:13.780 align:middle line:84%
are willing to accept it, want
to get into it, and, I think,

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.750 align:middle line:90%
can really garner the knowledge.

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:18.820 align:middle line:90%
There might be little nuggets.

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:22.200 align:middle line:84%
But it's enough knowledge to
get you started on a search

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.873 align:middle line:84%
and finding yourself
in your own spirit.

00:18:24.873 --> 00:18:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: True, because
the people incarnating

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:29.190 align:middle line:84%
now and into the
future are coming

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:32.250 align:middle line:84%
in really with a different
directive than up until now.

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:34.030 align:middle line:90%
I mean, whole different species.

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:37.150 align:middle line:84%
Some are saying literally, we're
becoming a different species.

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:40.320 align:middle line:84%
Some have said we're becoming a
species where the mind becomes

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:42.990 align:middle line:84%
literally not only in connection
with, but almost centered

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:43.860 align:middle line:90%
in the heart.

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:44.670 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: It should be.

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:45.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It should be.

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:46.265 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: Absolutely.

00:18:46.265 --> 00:18:49.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so this thing
we're seeing right now,

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:52.330 align:middle line:90%
the tail end of this kind of--

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:53.130 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:55.080 align:middle line:90%
I find it obscene personally.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:19:01.110 align:middle line:84%
I find the world of influencers,
and fake beauty, and fake gurus,

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:03.390 align:middle line:84%
and everything else
literally obscene.

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:05.940 align:middle line:84%
Once we start pulling our
own energy back, and learning

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:09.210 align:middle line:84%
how to use our own being as
tuning forks for discernment

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:12.330 align:middle line:84%
and truth, and come into our
connection with each other,

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:13.815 align:middle line:90%
that's what they're telling us.

00:19:13.815 --> 00:19:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: Our connection to each
other and connection to Earth.

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:17.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And to Earth, yeah.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: Yeah.

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.710 align:middle line:90%
Because Earth is mother.

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:20.890 align:middle line:90%
That's our ground.

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:24.190 align:middle line:84%
The connection to each other,
we are each other's siblings.

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:26.200 align:middle line:90%
We are all connected.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.670 align:middle line:90%
But that includes them.

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And we have to be
aware of that, if we

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:35.830 align:middle line:84%
have to be OK from the
standpoint of accepting them as

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:38.950 align:middle line:90%
well as they need to accept us.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:40.990 align:middle line:84%
But we can't do
that until we have

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:45.562 align:middle line:84%
that connection between the
material and the spiritual side.

00:19:45.562 --> 00:19:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So one
of the things they

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:51.490 align:middle line:84%
said is their lifespan is
roughly a thousand years old.

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:54.370 align:middle line:84%
And I guess there's no
need to be immortal.

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:59.170 align:middle line:84%
People now in the world of
AI, and uploading, and--

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:04.078 align:middle line:84%
I've been reading some very
interesting things about that.

00:20:04.078 --> 00:20:06.820 align:middle line:90%
That apparently exists.

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:10.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Pentagon has
very exotic technologies

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:16.810 align:middle line:84%
to extend the consciousness in
the same or different vehicles

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:20.080 align:middle line:84%
of people who believe that
this meat is all there is.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And so they'll do
anything to preserve.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: And to recreate
the vehicle itself.

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:25.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And to recreate
the vehicle itself, that's

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.190 align:middle line:90%
all going on behind the scenes.

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:29.350 align:middle line:84%
As we've all been told,
and you're fully aware,

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:32.140 align:middle line:84%
more than aware
than I, the military

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:35.500 align:middle line:84%
is far in advance of everything
we're seeing technologically,

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.300 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what's
been developed, so--

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:39.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: But don't you love
what they've come out and said?

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which
part, which thing?

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:41.815 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: It doesn't exist.

00:20:41.815 --> 00:20:42.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:43.578 align:middle line:90%
Of course, none of it exists.

00:20:43.578 --> 00:20:45.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: [LAUGHS] awareness--

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:47.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Greatest
disinformation artists.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:51.400 align:middle line:84%
So they said that
we ourselves can

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.190 align:middle line:84%
start living much
longer lifespans,

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:56.260 align:middle line:84%
once we can start
going into a more

00:20:56.260 --> 00:21:00.260 align:middle line:84%
peaceful relationship within
ourselves and with one another.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And this will, in
part, that's what

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:05.780 align:middle line:84%
it will be part of extending
the human lifespan.

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, I mean, living 80,
85 years is still rather short.

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:13.888 align:middle line:84%
When you have to
go through infancy,

00:21:13.888 --> 00:21:15.680 align:middle line:84%
you have to go through
developmental years,

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:18.560 align:middle line:84%
then you've got to decay, it
gives you a few good years

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:19.880 align:middle line:90%
to really learn a lot.

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.040 align:middle line:84%
It would be nice to live
a little longer anyway.

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.120 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what
they've said about that.

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: Well, in
the process of aging,

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:29.090 align:middle line:84%
it's that connection,
again, to spirit.

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:32.510 align:middle line:84%
It's the peacefulness
of spirit, that harmony.

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:36.150 align:middle line:84%
It's just urgently important
for anything you're going to do,

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:38.150 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the
extent of your life,

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:42.230 align:middle line:84%
or the development of
technology in conjunction

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:44.900 align:middle line:90%
with the peaceful spirit.

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And I just had a conversation
with Billy a couple of days

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.063 align:middle line:90%
ago about this.

00:21:49.063 --> 00:21:51.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, because you're
in regular touch still.

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:52.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: Yeah.

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him, I said, there
was a question that came to me.

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:59.550 align:middle line:84%
How does he define
good and evil?

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:00.350 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:01.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tell us.

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:04.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: --he said it's about
finding the calm in your spirit,

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:08.720 align:middle line:84%
and loving your enemy, no matter
how much they try to attack you,

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:11.250 align:middle line:90%
and being all right with that.

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's about finding
that inner knowledge.

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.070 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has it.

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:19.250 align:middle line:84%
Now you just have to
find it and live it.

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:20.960 align:middle line:90%
He says, that's good.

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:24.273 align:middle line:84%
And the evil is
there as a teacher.

00:22:24.273 --> 00:22:25.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
there as a teacher.

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:26.652 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: As a teacher.

00:22:26.652 --> 00:22:29.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think most of the
people listening to this show

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:32.020 align:middle line:84%
can appreciate what
you've just said.

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:35.920 align:middle line:84%
So now, so we have
the ability, if we

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.440 align:middle line:84%
can do this find this
more peaceful way,

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:41.320 align:middle line:84%
to start living in
collaboration with one another.

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Many people think, oh, but
it's almost over for Earth,

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:46.435 align:middle line:84%
because, a, we're
having climate change.

00:22:46.435 --> 00:22:48.380 align:middle line:90%
And, b, we have too many people.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:51.080 align:middle line:84%
Both those things seem to be
taking care of themselves.

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.800 align:middle line:84%
We're already where it appears
we're going into population

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.690 align:middle line:90%
decline at the moment.

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:58.000 align:middle line:90%
And so that takes care of that.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of climate change,
climate has always changed.

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.800 align:middle line:84%
This is a matter of
how we can healthfully

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:08.880 align:middle line:84%
interface with it so we don't
just pollute our planet.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.570 align:middle line:90%
That's a whole different thing.

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
that, because people

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:15.670 align:middle line:84%
go on with political agendas
around climate change,

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:18.070 align:middle line:84%
when they're really talking
about pollution for the most

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:19.760 align:middle line:90%
part.

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: The pollution, the
use of certain chemicals,

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.940 align:middle line:84%
things like that, the Pleiadians
are very concerned about.

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:28.060 align:middle line:90%
But Earth will survive.

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:31.360 align:middle line:84%
It's not anything that we throw
our hands up and go, my god,

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.980 align:middle line:84%
we've only got
seventy years left,

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:36.220 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it is this year.

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:37.810 align:middle line:90%
Earth is going to be fine.

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:40.780 align:middle line:10%
It's how we survive with it.

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:45.130 align:middle line:10%
Because Earth constantly
mutates, and grows, and changes.

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:47.800 align:middle line:90%
Humans need to do that too.

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And we have a tendency to
get stuck in our technology

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:54.830 align:middle line:84%
or whatever the thing
is, of the moment.

00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
we are right now.

00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:59.440 align:middle line:90%
We need to get unstuck.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do they talk at
all about, within this, about

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.325 align:middle line:90%
vibration, vibratory frequency?

00:24:04.325 --> 00:24:05.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: Absolutely.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it seems
to me if the Earth is going

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:10.690 align:middle line:84%
through her own transition
and refinement, which

00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:13.510 align:middle line:84%
would seem to me, bumping
up in a frequency range,

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:16.570 align:middle line:84%
you can't incarnate here, unless
you can keep step with it.

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:19.300 align:middle line:84%
There can't be a mismatch
on a frequency level.

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:21.340 align:middle line:90%
You have to go somewhere else.

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:22.853 align:middle line:90%
Every being has this choice.

00:24:22.853 --> 00:24:24.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: And they
have a frequency that

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.950 align:middle line:90%
doesn't harmonize well with us.

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:29.220 align:middle line:84%
When they come here,
they have to alter it.

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:31.910 align:middle line:84%
When we go there, they
would have to alter us,

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:35.330 align:middle line:84%
so that we could participate
in conversations.

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:41.330 align:middle line:84%
They have a term that I love
that they call auric stench.

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:42.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:43.550 align:middle line:90%
I read that, yes.

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:44.720 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: Earth humans have.

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A stench in our aura,
which is all the pollution

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:48.930 align:middle line:90%
of our thinking--

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:49.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: Our thought--

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:50.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --of our
belief systems.

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:52.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: --our
spiritual beliefs,

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:54.650 align:middle line:84%
the whole knowledge
base of our being--

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:56.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --is stinky to them.

00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:57.048 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: That's right.

00:24:57.048 --> 00:25:00.290 align:middle line:84%
So they can only be here
for a short period of time,

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:03.080 align:middle line:84%
working with one or
more individuals.

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.330 align:middle line:84%
They just can't go
any further than that.

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:08.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
that's really important

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:10.820 align:middle line:84%
to pay attention to,
because you can change that.

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:13.100 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
have auric stench.

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:17.450 align:middle line:84%
You can actually raise those
vibrations within yourself.

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:19.910 align:middle line:84%
And as the Earth
changes vibrations,

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:22.010 align:middle line:84%
and we change
vibrations, and there

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:26.430 align:middle line:84%
will be many of us doing
that, we move forward.

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:31.260 align:middle line:84%
If you don't change, and there
will be many that do not change,

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:32.790 align:middle line:90%
then they will be stuck.

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:33.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:37.080 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, my guides were
talking to me about this

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:40.052 align:middle line:84%
a couple of decades ago, saying,
there is no judgment in this.

00:25:40.052 --> 00:25:41.010 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: That's right.

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:43.925 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There is nothing
but time, or lack of time.

00:25:43.925 --> 00:25:45.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: It's a
growth pattern--

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:50.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's just everyone
has the, I wouldn't say luxury,

00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:54.750 align:middle line:84%
but choice, to evolve as
quickly or slowly as one wishes.

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:58.980 align:middle line:84%
And so if Earth is evolving
into a certain frequency range,

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:03.300 align:middle line:84%
and those beings on it choose to
refine themselves to stay pace

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.910 align:middle line:84%
with it, they can
continue evolving

00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:09.210 align:middle line:84%
with a continually
improving, and refining,

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:10.753 align:middle line:90%
and beautifying Earth.

00:26:10.753 --> 00:26:12.420 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, there are
other places to go.

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:15.420 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you're stuck, your
soul is in hell or damnation,

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:16.620 align:middle line:90%
and there's no judgment.

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:19.530 align:middle line:84%
If you just think, no,
anger feels too juicy,

00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:21.540 align:middle line:90%
you know, I just--

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:24.960 align:middle line:84%
I like it, I just-- this
is what gets me going

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.670 align:middle line:84%
and gets me up
every day, there'll

00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:27.870 align:middle line:90%
be another place to go to.

00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:30.090 align:middle line:84%
There are plenty of other
places besides Earth

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:32.020 align:middle line:90%
that you can embody to.

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:33.370 align:middle line:90%
That's my understanding.

00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:34.610 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: Right, I agree.

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:37.510 align:middle line:84%
I think the great thing
about what's happening here

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:41.830 align:middle line:84%
is we're looking at Earth now
in conjunction with ourselves,

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:46.940 align:middle line:84%
of how we can work together with
the planet to help the planet,

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:49.060 align:middle line:84%
but at the same
time, help ourselves.

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And in that, we're just
raising our own vibration,

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.840 align:middle line:84%
because it's knowledge
based from the heart.

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:54.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:55.645 align:middle line:90%
And it's not like--

00:26:55.645 --> 00:26:57.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even helping
the planet, when you say

00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:59.560 align:middle line:90%
that, just stop kicking her.

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:03.040 align:middle line:84%
Just stop being mean, and
disregarding her emotionally,

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:06.430 align:middle line:84%
and not even noticing this
beautiful host we have.

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:09.310 align:middle line:84%
Some of it is just pure
love and acknowledgment.

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And that feeds with
every being, whether it's

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:13.090 align:middle line:84%
an animal, whether
it's a person,

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:15.010 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's
Earth herself, you

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:17.810 align:middle line:84%
know, that circle of love
that goes between us.

00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And so many people
don't even notice her.

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:23.830 align:middle line:84%
We walk on her, use her
resources, it's rude.

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:25.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: I always
love to ask people,

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:27.880 align:middle line:84%
when was the last time
you really took a moment

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:30.780 align:middle line:90%
to watch a sunset or a sunrise?

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:33.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: It's unbelievable.

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:34.440 align:middle line:90%
They don't.

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:37.020 align:middle line:90%
They're missing out on so much.

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:38.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
that is really--

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:41.430 align:middle line:84%
just that simple
thing is the key

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:44.700 align:middle line:84%
to start beginning to come back
into an understanding of what

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:48.540 align:middle line:84%
we're actually here for, which
is to evolve, and find ourselves

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:51.480 align:middle line:84%
as a soul, and live
in companionship

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:54.430 align:middle line:84%
and collaboration with other
beings here and elsewhere,

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:55.230 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:56.310 align:middle line:90%
I mean, OK.

00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:59.410 align:middle line:90%
So that's my little soapbox.

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:00.910 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: That's a good one.

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:03.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So one of the
things he was told ages ago,

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:06.120 align:middle line:84%
because we're talking
about environmental stuff,

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:09.930 align:middle line:84%
was that long before it came out
in the world of science and news

00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:13.200 align:middle line:84%
was that there would become
a hole in the ozone layer.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.960 align:middle line:84%
So that in the '70s, '80s, and
'90s, it was spoken about quite

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:17.760 align:middle line:90%
a bit.

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:20.170 align:middle line:84%
You don't hear that
too much anymore.

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:22.000 align:middle line:84%
You just hear
climate change now.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk about
that, what he was shown.

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:27.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: The ozone
hole did start to close.

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:29.520 align:middle line:90%
And so that made a difference.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And that came from our
recognizing the fact

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:35.530 align:middle line:84%
that we were using chemicals
that should not be used.

00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And so hopefully,
that will continue.

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:38.350 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:39.225 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think so.

00:28:39.225 --> 00:28:41.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: --that's when
he talks about or tells us

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:44.980 align:middle line:84%
that different chemicals,
and different things

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:48.280 align:middle line:84%
that are used, fertilizers,
things like that,

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:52.310 align:middle line:84%
removing oil from the
Earth can be done,

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:56.140 align:middle line:84%
but it has to be substituted
with something else.

00:28:56.140 --> 00:29:00.520 align:middle line:84%
Because if you don't, let's say,
replace it with another liquid,

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:01.787 align:middle line:90%
you create an imbalance--

00:29:01.787 --> 00:29:03.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --imbalance
underneath, yes.

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:05.703 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: So little things
like that that the Pleiadians

00:29:05.703 --> 00:29:09.770 align:middle line:84%
have talked about to him,
it makes so much sense.

00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:13.830 align:middle line:84%
If we would just take a step
back and think about it,

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:15.680 align:middle line:90%
we could learn so much.

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:17.000 align:middle line:90%
And they're simple things.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
and they are, yes.

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:19.920 align:middle line:90%
And you're right.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look at what happened
with catalytic converters,

00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:23.330 align:middle line:90%
and all this.

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:25.250 align:middle line:90%
And now you don't--

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:29.120 align:middle line:84%
Beijing, China is the
fastest growing country

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:31.530 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the development
of electric cars.

00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:33.470 align:middle line:84%
We're just-- a very
short time ago,

00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:35.282 align:middle line:84%
you could barely
breathe from my friends

00:29:35.282 --> 00:29:36.740 align:middle line:84%
that have gone over
there from what

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:38.960 align:middle line:90%
they said the air was so foul.

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: But look what
they're doing to the Earth

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:44.150 align:middle line:84%
by taking the rare Earth
elements necessary to make

00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:45.170 align:middle line:90%
those electric cars.

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:47.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
you got that too.

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:50.120 align:middle line:84%
And then you're taking it under
the ocean, from the ocean.

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:51.632 align:middle line:90%
It's all a balancing thing.

00:29:51.632 --> 00:29:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And I guess it's
going to come down

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:56.240 align:middle line:84%
to being able to create
those, an alternative way

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.922 align:middle line:84%
or to recycle all
those elements.

00:29:57.922 --> 00:29:58.880 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: That's right.

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
happening now.

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:01.130 align:middle line:90%
That's starting.

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:01.820 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: It's beginning.

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:04.237 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're getting there,
you know, little by little.

00:30:04.237 --> 00:30:06.293 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: If we take
baby steps, that's OK.

00:30:06.293 --> 00:30:07.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, we
take baby steps.

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:10.950 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing but
time, or whatever time

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:11.950 align:middle line:90%
is perceived to be.

00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: Exactly.

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when
we go back to now,

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:16.570 align:middle line:84%
we go back to the
evidence for this case.

00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:19.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, these witnesses,
they were subjected

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:23.250 align:middle line:84%
to lie detector tests, as
Billy was, and other people.

00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:25.920 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out it
doesn't appear anybody was

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:27.360 align:middle line:90%
lying about this experience.

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:28.470 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: That's right.

00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:29.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:31.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: Everyone that
we talked to, that did

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:34.120 align:middle line:84%
go through psychological
stress evaluation,

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:37.470 align:middle line:84%
things like that,
they did not tell

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:41.340 align:middle line:90%
any form of dishonest thought.

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:43.980 align:middle line:84%
That's the way they put
it, dishonest thought.

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:47.685 align:middle line:84%
Because they believed what
they saw was factual to them.

00:30:47.685 --> 00:30:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And Billy had
to go through it too.

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:53.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: Oh, we put him
through a very rigorous

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:57.270 align:middle line:84%
psychological stress evaluation,
brought everything back, had

00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:59.280 align:middle line:90%
it analyzed here in Colorado.

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And it was remarkable, because
the worst of his answers was,

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:07.980 align:middle line:90%
do you drink coffee?

00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And he had just
promised his wife

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:12.150 align:middle line:84%
that he was going to
stop drinking coffee.

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:15.960 align:middle line:84%
And it came up so deceptive
that we think, what is that?

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.790 align:middle line:90%
But have you seen a UFO?

00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:18.720 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.100 align:middle line:90%
Have you met with Pleiadians?

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:22.470 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes, all very --

00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:23.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Do you drink coffee?

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:24.660 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:25.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: Yeah.

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:27.122 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:27.122 --> 00:31:28.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
actually, kind of, cute.

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:29.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: Yeah.

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:32.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so when
it comes to the film,

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:36.060 align:middle line:84%
and there were also some metal
samples that didn't match up

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:37.170 align:middle line:90%
with what we have here.

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:38.130 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: That's right.

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:40.470 align:middle line:84%
The metal samples, I
thought were fabulous,

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:44.520 align:middle line:84%
because we worked first
with Marcel Vogel of IBM,

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:47.250 align:middle line:90%
held a number of patents, had--

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:50.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just an
incredible, brilliant man.

00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:55.680 align:middle line:84%
But he saw that the
metal was perfectly

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:58.800 align:middle line:84%
just one metal, nickel,
let's say, and then

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:02.520 align:middle line:84%
a crystalline structure,
and then another pure metal,

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:05.580 align:middle line:84%
and then another crystalline
structure, something

00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:09.930 align:middle line:84%
we could not do on this
planet at that time.

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:12.240 align:middle line:90%
This is back in the '70s.

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:15.630 align:middle line:84%
He had it under electron
scanning microscopes,

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:19.000 align:middle line:84%
going through
everything in detail.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.580 align:middle line:84%
Could not figure out
how it was put together.

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:25.540 align:middle line:84%
It took getting into
space to be able to create

00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:30.100 align:middle line:84%
that purity of one element
separated by crystal, and then

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:32.290 align:middle line:90%
the purity of the next element.

00:32:32.290 --> 00:32:37.030 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just Marcel Vogel
that analyzed these metals.

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:39.430 align:middle line:90%
A sample went to MIT.

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:40.870 align:middle line:90%
And it disappeared.

00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:42.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that
seems to happen a lot.

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:46.220 align:middle line:84%
And the aerospace industry
is usually enlisted, right?

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:47.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: Sure.

00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:47.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:50.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: But then also,
there were other scientists

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.750 align:middle line:90%
that Marcel brought in, luckily.

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:54.340 align:middle line:90%
They went through it.

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And they found the same
thing that he found.

00:32:57.250 --> 00:33:02.690 align:middle line:84%
So the metals were so unique
at that point in time,

00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:05.600 align:middle line:84%
couldn't be manufactured
here on this planet.

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.980 align:middle line:90%
Where did they come from?

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:10.400 align:middle line:84%
How would Meier, this
farmer in Switzerland,

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.690 align:middle line:90%
get his hands on this?

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:12.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And they found that the 8
millimeter film even could not

00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:17.810 align:middle line:90%
have been adulterated.

00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:20.090 align:middle line:84%
It would take so
much sophistication

00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:23.540 align:middle line:84%
on the part of this farmer
to be able to put this

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:25.108 align:middle line:90%
together and dupe people.

00:33:25.108 --> 00:33:27.025 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk a little
bit about that process.

00:33:27.025 --> 00:33:29.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: Oh, I love this,
because so many people

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:34.740 align:middle line:84%
say, oh, my gosh, he hung
this UFO on a fishing pole.

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:35.540 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:39.240 align:middle line:84%
So we did that just to
see if it could happen.

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:42.530 align:middle line:84%
We hired Wally Gentleman,
who was the special effects

00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:43.880 align:middle line:90%
man for Kubrick.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:47.720 align:middle line:84%
This was before Industrial Light
and Magic, and all of that.

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:49.250 align:middle line:90%
He worked with Coppola.

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:50.450 align:middle line:90%
He was great.

00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:53.150 align:middle line:84%
He had won Academy
Awards, everything.

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:55.940 align:middle line:84%
Wally Gentleman
made us the model.

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:57.680 align:middle line:90%
And we hung it on a line.

00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:00.710 align:middle line:84%
And we took photographs
of it with cameras

00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:05.460 align:middle line:84%
that worked, which Billy didn't
even have a camera that worked.

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:07.240 align:middle line:90%
We could see it right away.

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And when you did the
edge enhancement,

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:12.165 align:middle line:84%
find out what the pixels
were along the edge,

00:34:12.165 --> 00:34:13.560 align:middle line:90%
oh, my gosh, you could tell.

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:15.600 align:middle line:84%
It was a very
small little model.

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:18.900 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't 21 feet in
diameter, like he claimed,

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:21.210 align:middle line:84%
and like his photographs
appeared to be.

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:25.409 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, we did everything we
could to either say it is or it

00:34:25.409 --> 00:34:26.580 align:middle line:90%
isn't.

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:29.520 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, you
know where it comes to?

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:33.540 align:middle line:84%
Each individual's heart,
what their knowledge base is,

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:37.650 align:middle line:84%
what their heart base
is, what they've learned,

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:39.659 align:middle line:90%
how they've been educated.

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:43.830 align:middle line:84%
Do they look up, or are they
stuck in their electronics?

00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:45.540 align:middle line:90%
It's all individual.

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:46.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:47.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:51.080 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going to go
into one more of the comments

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:51.880 align:middle line:90%
that they made.

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:54.179 align:middle line:84%
And this is more
technologically based,

00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:57.450 align:middle line:84%
since we're, kind of, in the
area of proofs and technology.

00:34:57.450 --> 00:34:59.860 align:middle line:84%
"Our spaceships are protected
by a screen of energy,

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:03.390 align:middle line:84%
which automatically ejects any
kind of resistance in every bit

00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:04.500 align:middle line:90%
of matter".

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And this-- yeah, anyway,
this is fascinating.

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:09.220 align:middle line:84%
"This protective
screen is, in fact,

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:13.020 align:middle line:84%
identical with the specific
gravitational field, which

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:15.180 align:middle line:90%
we build up around our ships.

00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:18.660 align:middle line:84%
With this protective screen,
we're able to neutralize

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:22.230 align:middle line:84%
the gravitational field
effect of any planet we want

00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:23.650 align:middle line:90%
to approach".

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:27.510 align:middle line:84%
So basically, grease
lightning, no resistance.

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:28.320 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: Exactly.

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:31.050 align:middle line:84%
You have to have a little
resistance as you're leaving,

00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:33.330 align:middle line:84%
or as you're entering
an atmosphere.

00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:34.830 align:middle line:90%
We went to Scotland.

00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:37.210 align:middle line:84%
We met with a man
named John McPhee.

00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:40.780 align:middle line:84%
He was an astronomer,
royal astronomer.

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:44.950 align:middle line:84%
Had done a lot of work on
what he called tachyon energy.

00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:46.880 align:middle line:90%
That's what they were using.

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And they would take
this little bit of time

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.160 align:middle line:90%
to exit an atmosphere.

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:54.460 align:middle line:84%
Bing, they were right into the
new atmosphere, and a little bit

00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:55.720 align:middle line:90%
of time to come out.

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:57.640 align:middle line:84%
We worked with
David Froning, who

00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:02.740 align:middle line:84%
was developing space planes
at McDonnell Douglas, Alan

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:03.970 align:middle line:90%
Holt of NASA.

00:36:03.970 --> 00:36:06.520 align:middle line:84%
All of these
different people could

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:10.750 align:middle line:84%
see how this is a
possibility in our future.

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:13.415 align:middle line:90%
So they absolutely understood.

00:36:13.415 --> 00:36:15.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They
understood the mechanics

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:17.530 align:middle line:84%
of why it only takes seven
hours for the Pleiadians

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:19.840 align:middle line:90%
to reach Earth, seven hours.

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: But the seven hours
is not from point A to B,

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:26.530 align:middle line:90%
because that's instantaneous.

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:28.860 align:middle line:84%
The seven hours is
leaving and getting back--

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:31.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where the little bits
of resistance you're talking

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:33.190 align:middle line:84%
about come into
play, and then, boom,

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:36.800 align:middle line:84%
it's instantaneous
between those--

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:38.050 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: The time of thought.

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, the
time of thought,

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:43.480 align:middle line:84%
which is-- what a kind
of fascinating future

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:45.440 align:middle line:90%
we have in store for us here.

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.170 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I wanted
to read that,

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:50.540 align:middle line:84%
just because I found that
fascinating, technologically

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:51.340 align:middle line:90%
fascinating.

00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And so Billy, a lot
of people say, OK,

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:55.330 align:middle line:84%
if all this is
real, then how come

00:36:55.330 --> 00:36:56.890 align:middle line:90%
they haven't landed in masses?

00:36:56.890 --> 00:36:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And I get of tired
of this question.

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:02.230 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, Billy asked
the same thing of them.

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:03.640 align:middle line:90%
And what did they say?

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:06.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: It doesn't
prove a point.

00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:08.660 align:middle line:90%
It does not have a purpose.

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:10.120 align:middle line:90%
What are they going to do?

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:11.380 align:middle line:90%
What are they going to say?

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:14.200 align:middle line:90%
They don't want to control us.

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:17.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you really
delve into the discussions,

00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:20.530 align:middle line:84%
we had so many with Meier
around his kitchen table,

00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:24.210 align:middle line:84%
all-night long discussions
would go on and on.

00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:28.200 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter, because
it's up to every individual

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:29.000 align:middle line:90%
to change.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can see it
there and totally deny it.

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:34.390 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter of what
you're open to, or not.

00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: But it's up to you
to change, to be open to it.

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:37.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:39.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: So that's
the importance of it.

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:43.600 align:middle line:84%
Why not come in and land
on the White House lawn?

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:46.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, unfortunately
at this point in time,

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:48.000 align:middle line:90%
we'd say, oh, it's AI.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Now you would.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: Yeah.

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:51.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I experienced that
recently and burst into tears.

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:55.510 align:middle line:84%
I was in London and saw
ABBA, their virtual show.

00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And I remembered hearing about
Project Blue Beam all those

00:37:58.390 --> 00:38:02.530 align:middle line:84%
years ago, and Drunvalo telling
me he had seen technology

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:05.680 align:middle line:84%
development of that
nature in the '60s.

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, we can't
tell truth anymore.

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.830 align:middle line:90%
So you're right.

00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:10.540 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's too late.

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's too late to do
anything of that nature.

00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:17.230 align:middle line:84%
So now we have to individually
grow up, and start tuning

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:20.390 align:middle line:84%
into what our potential
is and what's not.

00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:22.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: But the
individuality of us

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:26.710 align:middle line:84%
is our collective consciousness
too, which is so wonderful.

00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:28.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when
they spoke, they did--

00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:29.710 align:middle line:84%
I want to get a
little bit of this

00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:31.450 align:middle line:84%
in, because there are
other people who've

00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:33.500 align:middle line:84%
had such reflections
and visions too.

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:35.740 align:middle line:84%
They talked a little
bit about how they live.

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And so they have these
longer lifespans.

00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:41.620 align:middle line:84%
They talked about their
childhood development lasting

00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:46.180 align:middle line:84%
roughly, in our time,
70 years, a long time

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:47.642 align:middle line:90%
to learn relative to--

00:38:47.642 --> 00:38:48.850 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: We're babies, yeah.

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:49.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Babies, yes.

00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And that they live in
harmony with the land

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:54.890 align:middle line:90%
in these domed homes.

00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:57.230 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us a
little more about that?

00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:59.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: Yeah, their
homes are individual.

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:02.900 align:middle line:90%
They do have family units.

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:06.500 align:middle line:90%
They have male female energies.

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:09.663 align:middle line:90%
They eat meat, rabbit.

00:39:09.663 --> 00:39:10.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:12.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: They do have pets.

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:13.740 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:15.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They
procreate like we do.

00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:17.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: They do
propagate like we do.

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:17.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which is interesting.

00:39:17.970 --> 00:39:18.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: Yeah.

00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:21.690 align:middle line:84%
But again, it's just a
slight vibration that's

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:24.540 align:middle line:90%
different between us and them.

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:29.200 align:middle line:84%
It's not this massive
vibratory frequency change.

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:32.940 align:middle line:84%
It's enough so that they
still have a physical form

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:37.050 align:middle line:84%
and do propagate, not
in an energetic way,

00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:38.050 align:middle line:90%
but in a physical way.

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:38.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:40.650 align:middle line:84%
Because this is
often misunderstood.

00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:44.460 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people who study the
Pleiades and dimensions have

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:47.640 align:middle line:84%
an impression that once you hit
kind of a fifth-dimensional type

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:50.670 align:middle line:84%
of psychic energy, that
suddenly, we're shimmering,

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:55.260 align:middle line:84%
and populations are propagated
through the mind, and so forth,

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:57.735 align:middle line:90%
no.

00:39:57.735 --> 00:39:58.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: That's very true.

00:39:58.860 --> 00:39:59.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:00.540 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: Yeah.

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:02.760 align:middle line:90%
They still have a physical form.

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And that physical
form is still useful.

00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:07.110 align:middle line:90%
It's still does pass.

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:09.430 align:middle line:90%
They do have accidents.

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:12.110 align:middle line:84%
It's not like everything
is plotted out

00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:15.100 align:middle line:84%
for them from the day they're
born until the day they pass.

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:18.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's like a more
refined, gracious, longer

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:23.200 align:middle line:84%
lifespan, living in harmony
with one another and the planet.

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:24.190 align:middle line:90%
It makes sense.

00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we're aspiring to.

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: Well,
they have something

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:31.540 align:middle line:84%
that I think is much more
important to what they're doing.

00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And that is they have
the telepathic knowledge

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:37.600 align:middle line:84%
of each other, so they can
get out of their own way.

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:41.110 align:middle line:84%
They don't get into these
pretentious things of,

00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:42.100 align:middle line:90%
I am this.

00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:44.800 align:middle line:84%
Or I want to be that,
or the influencers,

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.880 align:middle line:90%
like you're talking about, yeah.

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:47.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:48.847 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: They already know.

00:40:48.847 --> 00:40:50.475 align:middle line:84%
They can look at
someone and know.

00:40:50.475 --> 00:40:51.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
we're headed there.

00:40:51.850 --> 00:40:54.760 align:middle line:84%
A lot of us are already
able to telepathically,

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:57.890 align:middle line:84%
even at very primitive levels,
communicate with each other.

00:40:57.890 --> 00:40:58.750 align:middle line:90%
We know things.

00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:01.630 align:middle line:84%
We know when the other one's
thinking of us, for example.

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:03.050 align:middle line:90%
We recognize each other.

00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:04.120 align:middle line:90%
So we're on our way.

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:04.720 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: We're moving.

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:05.928 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we're moving.

00:41:05.928 --> 00:41:07.390 align:middle line:90%
They don't use monetary systems.

00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:10.900 align:middle line:84%
It says here, everybody
contributes and does their part.

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:14.200 align:middle line:84%
But they're doing what
they're kind of born to do.

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: It's their lifeblood
that actually propels them

00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:18.860 align:middle line:90%
forward.

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:20.500 align:middle line:90%
Some need to go to space.

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:22.120 align:middle line:90%
Some need to be farmers.

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:25.510 align:middle line:84%
Some need to develop
different technologies.

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:27.830 align:middle line:90%
Some need to be educators.

00:41:27.830 --> 00:41:29.890 align:middle line:84%
Sort of, like we are
here, but we have

00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:32.110 align:middle line:90%
forgotten how to tap into that.

00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, I think a lot
of the old cultures did that.

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:38.570 align:middle line:90%
The Inca definitely did it.

00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:39.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:39.370 --> 00:41:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, modern education
has certainly

00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:43.660 align:middle line:84%
removed us from any
kind of instinct

00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:45.440 align:middle line:84%
about what we were
actually born to do.

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:46.240 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: Now we just want to
raise generic crops of kids.

00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:51.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Of kids,
yeah, that are

00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:55.620 align:middle line:84%
suitable to do generic jobs
that will feed a machine.

00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're all on
the same page on that.

00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And also with them, they say
reincarnation isn't a belief.

00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:02.590 align:middle line:90%
We're far beyond that.

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:03.820 align:middle line:90%
It's a reality.

00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:04.930 align:middle line:90%
So don't, yeah.

00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And it says here, "wisdom
is the mark of the existence

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:12.010 align:middle line:84%
of the spirit, and disguises
itself in the qualities

00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:16.540 align:middle line:84%
of truth, poise, knowledge,
beauty, harmony, and peace".

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:18.730 align:middle line:84%
These are the noble
truths on Earth

00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:23.290 align:middle line:84%
that the philosophers of ancient
times have always spoken of.

00:42:23.290 --> 00:42:26.035 align:middle line:84%
And they say the collective of
that is what they call wisdom.

00:42:26.035 --> 00:42:28.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: Mm-hmm.

00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that is one of
the most beautiful quotes

00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:33.043 align:middle line:84%
that the Pleiadians
have given Meier.

00:42:33.043 --> 00:42:34.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love that quote.

00:42:34.210 --> 00:42:36.070 align:middle line:90%
And here's another one.

00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:39.070 align:middle line:84%
It says, "wisdom
is also the mark

00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:42.400 align:middle line:84%
of a human who has recognized
the existence of his spirit,

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:45.520 align:middle line:84%
and works with it according
to the creational laws.

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:49.930 align:middle line:84%
For wisdom and the spirit are
two factors, which react as one,

00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:54.280 align:middle line:84%
much in the same way as the sun
and sunlight both give warmth

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.950 align:middle line:90%
and light".

00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:56.750 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:58.400 align:middle line:90%
So those two go together.

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.790 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted to share--
because your book has

00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:02.390 align:middle line:90%
so much beauty in it.

00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And then one other thing here
that I thought was kind of fun,

00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:06.760 align:middle line:90%
they talk about skepticism.

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:10.030 align:middle line:84%
You talk about skepticism in
the book by Morris Bender.

00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:12.550 align:middle line:84%
It says, "a skeptic is one
when faced with the handwriting

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:14.170 align:middle line:84%
on the wall, claims
it's a forgery".

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:14.970 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: Exactly.

00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:16.900 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:18.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're just
about out of time.

00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:22.360 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about,
again, why it's

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:25.000 align:middle line:84%
so important for you
and I to sit, and relax,

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:29.900 align:middle line:84%
and have this conversation
today after all,

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:32.800 align:middle line:90%
and it still continues, of the--

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:37.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, competition and
meanness around this story.

00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:39.490 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think
that even exists?

00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:41.140 align:middle line:84%
I would think that
people in ufology

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:44.890 align:middle line:84%
would be thrilled to
have actual evidence.

00:43:44.890 --> 00:43:47.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: I can't
speak for them.

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:52.030 align:middle line:10%
I can only speak to what I
have experienced and been told.

00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:54.100 align:middle line:10%
Some of it is jealousy.

00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:57.940 align:middle line:10%
Some of it is an
issue of we would not

00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:03.580 align:middle line:10%
release metal samples to some
member of an organization.

00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:05.890 align:middle line:90%
They did not like that.

00:44:05.890 --> 00:44:09.620 align:middle line:84%
They wanted us to give them
the documentation we had.

00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And when we didn't,
they went on the attack.

00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:13.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:17.450 align:middle line:10%
>>ELDERS: We felt that take it
to a scientist that really knew

00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:19.640 align:middle line:10%
what he was doing
was a smart thing

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:22.370 align:middle line:10%
to do, rather than to
give it to a UFO group.

00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:27.260 align:middle line:84%
There were only a handful of
groups out there at that time.

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:28.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it
persists to this day.

00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:30.070 align:middle line:90%
You still hear this.

00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:32.780 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you said there was an
interview you had lined up.

00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:35.582 align:middle line:84%
And the person went online,
did a little research online--

00:44:35.582 --> 00:44:37.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDERS: I had
written an article.

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And this woman said, I went
online, found out the Meier case

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:41.460 align:middle line:90%
is a hoax.

00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:43.200 align:middle line:84%
I can't use this
article, even though she

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:44.910 align:middle line:90%
had pushed me to write it.

00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:46.790 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK.

00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:49.040 align:middle line:90%
Just answer one question.

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:53.900 align:middle line:84%
What analysis was done on
what evidence of the case?

00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:55.820 align:middle line:90%
None.

00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:57.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: None.

00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:59.440 align:middle line:90%
That's the unfortunate thing.

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:05.020 align:middle line:84%
The fortunate thing is it's
coming back out for open minds,

00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:09.220 align:middle line:84%
for people that want to
learn, for new generations.

00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:12.190 align:middle line:90%
And that's up to them.

00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:15.730 align:middle line:84%
Nobody can really stop
it, because you find it

00:45:15.730 --> 00:45:18.515 align:middle line:84%
on a level that
connects with you.

00:45:18.515 --> 00:45:20.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I just
want to say thank you.

00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:23.170 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for not only
having taken all those years

00:45:23.170 --> 00:45:25.720 align:middle line:84%
to do the research, and for
staying in touch with Billy

00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:28.600 align:middle line:84%
as well, but also for
producing this body of work,

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:30.430 align:middle line:84%
where you have it all
laid out before you.

00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:31.930 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of undeniable.

00:45:31.930 --> 00:45:32.750 align:middle line:90%
And it's beautiful.

00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:33.990 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful book.

00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:34.790 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: Yeah.

00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:35.680 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:37.542 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you so
much for joining us.

00:45:37.542 --> 00:45:38.750 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate it, Brit.

00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:41.110 align:middle line:90%
>>ELDERS: It's been a pleasure.

00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:44.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This beautifully
illustrated coffee table book

00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:46.390 align:middle line:84%
called "UFO, Contact
From the Pleiades",

00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:50.350 align:middle line:84%
is available for you to purchase
and share with fence-sitters.

00:45:50.350 --> 00:45:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And you can go deeper
into Brit's work

00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:54.910 align:middle line:90%
on her website, Britelders.com.

00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:57.130 align:middle line:84%
At some point, we're going
to have to acknowledge

00:45:57.130 --> 00:45:58.480 align:middle line:90%
the writing on the wall.

00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on "Open Minds".
