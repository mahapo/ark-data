00:00:22.504 --> 00:00:24.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: One of
the most fascinating works

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.910 align:middle line:84%
I've come across in the
last few decades of research

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.600 align:middle line:84%
was a book titled
"Thunderbolts of the Gods."

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.530 align:middle line:10%
In it, authors David
Talbott and Walter Thornhill

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.240 align:middle line:10%
made a solid case for
the different alignment

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.130 align:middle line:10%
of the planets in ancient
times, an alignment that

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.970 align:middle line:10%
allowed the ancient
civilizations

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.040 align:middle line:10%
to see cosmic events
with their naked eye.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.540 align:middle line:84%
More so, they captured the
events in rock art, rock art

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.470 align:middle line:84%
that we have overlooked
as primitive,

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.770 align:middle line:84%
when in fact, it's giving us a
fascinating history of Earth's

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:52.550 align:middle line:90%
past.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.910 align:middle line:84%
David Talbott is here today
to share his findings on this.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And I have, I've looked forward
to meeting you for a long time,

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.105 align:middle line:84%
as we found out everybody at
Gaiam's been looking forward

00:01:01.105 --> 00:01:01.860 align:middle line:90%
to your arrival.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID TALBOTT: I'm
very glad to be here.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I first looked
through "Thunderbolts

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.300 align:middle line:84%
of the Gods," just
the first imagery,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.140 align:middle line:84%
I thought, it just strikes
you so deeply, how arrogant

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.210 align:middle line:84%
that we have
dismissed all of what

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.090 align:middle line:84%
we call the primitive
artworks throughout all

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.440 align:middle line:90%
the past cultures in the world.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.680 align:middle line:84%
It's not just
endemic to one area.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.820 align:middle line:90%
We overlooked it all.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.400 align:middle line:84%
What a mistake, as
we're going to find out.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.320 align:middle line:84%
There are the same images
showing up again and again,

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.250 align:middle line:90%
40,000 years ago, 20,000.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it goes
as recently as 10,000.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.750 align:middle line:84%
You can clarify
some of that for me.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.429 align:middle line:90%
>>TALBOTT: Perhaps so, yeah.

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:40.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: "Thunderbolts
of the Gods,"

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.820 align:middle line:84%
let's start with
the thunderbolt.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.260 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Oh, that's
an incredible image

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.200 align:middle line:84%
to start with, because
it had this value for us.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.880 align:middle line:84%
After I had been
working diligently

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.410 align:middle line:84%
for a couple of decades,
maybe a bit more

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:02.280 align:middle line:84%
than that, to reconstruct the
influences on human imagination

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.430 align:middle line:84%
at the birth of world
mythology, and symbolism,

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.840 align:middle line:84%
and the great
religious traditions,

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.070 align:middle line:84%
what was it that was
acting on human imagination

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.600 align:middle line:84%
to provoke this outpouring
of images, all of which

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.480 align:middle line:90%
looked so absurd?

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And gradually--
it's a long story--

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.420 align:middle line:84%
but I had come to a
sense of integrity

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.920 align:middle line:90%
around mythic archetypes.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.220 align:middle line:84%
The archetypes are patterns
that shouldn't be there.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.160 align:middle line:84%
For more reasons than
one, actually, they

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.350 align:middle line:90%
shouldn't be there.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.710 align:middle line:84%
One reason is they
don't point to anything

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.290 align:middle line:90%
in common experience.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.416 align:middle line:84%
And another is what they do
point to appears ludicrous.

00:02:41.416 --> 00:02:42.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: And everybody
knows that there

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.510 align:middle line:90%
are mythic archetypes.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.170 align:middle line:84%
But very few people
have actually

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.230 align:middle line:84%
asked about events in
the natural world that

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.470 align:middle line:84%
might have something to
do with this outpouring

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.210 align:middle line:90%
of symbolic imagery.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.455 align:middle line:84%
But I was working
with a possibility

00:03:02.455 --> 00:03:06.030 align:middle line:84%
of extraordinary natural
events in ancient times.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.800 align:middle line:84%
So I was asking
that question just

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.600 align:middle line:84%
in the natural course
of the investigation.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.410 align:middle line:84%
What unusual events in an
unusual solar system history

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.520 align:middle line:84%
provoked these
mythic archetypes?

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.220 align:middle line:10%
And that question
alone never stopped

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.980 align:middle line:10%
opening up new doors and
windows of investigation

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.460 align:middle line:10%
and adding to my confidence
that there's actually

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.262 align:middle line:10%
a unified story to tell.

00:03:35.262 --> 00:03:36.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, in
particular, when

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.880 align:middle line:84%
you start adding the
newer technology,

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.100 align:middle line:84%
cosmological technology,
Hubble and the like,

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.500 align:middle line:84%
where we're now able to
actually glimpse into, well,

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.520 align:middle line:84%
through a lens, but glimpse into
the phenomena that's out there,

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.370 align:middle line:84%
that we are no longer able
to see with our naked eye.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.840 align:middle line:90%
It's validating the rock art.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.940 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Well,
and you asked me

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.500 align:middle line:84%
about the cosmic
thunderbolt. And I

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.599 align:middle line:84%
should have drawn that
to a decisive point

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:05.890 align:middle line:90%
in the history of the research.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:06.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let
me give you this.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.510 align:middle line:90%
This is out of your book.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:08.176 align:middle line:90%
>>TALBOTT: Yeah.

00:04:08.176 --> 00:04:11.354 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: "It is the thunderbolt
that steers the universe."

00:04:11.354 --> 00:04:12.770 align:middle line:84%
We have a beautiful
image of this.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.800 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's talk about that.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.260 align:middle line:90%
>>TALBOTT: Indeed.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.880 align:middle line:10%
The cosmic thunderbolt
was, for me, my bridge

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.130 align:middle line:10%
to the research of
Wall Thornhill, who

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.160 align:middle line:10%
is the premier investigator
within the electric universe

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.100 align:middle line:10%
community.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.180 align:middle line:10%
There are many others,
but Wall Thornhill

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.460 align:middle line:10%
came to Portland,
Oregon late in 1996.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.040 align:middle line:10%
And he had seen these
reconstructions of my own.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And he was so convinced of the
meaning of that reconstruction,

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.430 align:middle line:84%
that he stayed in my
office for 30 days

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.880 align:middle line:84%
to persuade me that these
were electric discharge

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.680 align:middle line:90%
phenomena, his specialty.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.200 align:middle line:90%
And I was completely persuaded.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.340 align:middle line:84%
For this reason, once
it became clear to me

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.430 align:middle line:84%
that the mythic thunderbolt
in the antique world

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.080 align:middle line:84%
was a bridge between
the electric universe

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.210 align:middle line:84%
and my own work, we had the most
natural convergence between us.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.610 align:middle line:84%
So "Thunderbolts of
the Gods" actually

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.380 align:middle line:84%
gives us a point of
common discussion.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.860 align:middle line:84%
Because, as you said, the Hubble
telescope and other telescopes

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.710 align:middle line:84%
are now looking out across
the entire electromagnetic

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:26.210 align:middle line:90%
spectrum.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And they're seeing
spectacular events in the sky.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.540 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.370 align:middle line:84%
They reveal similarities
to the cosmic thunderbolt.

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:33.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.610 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: And
this is well worth

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.310 align:middle line:84%
investigating because,
I mean, I can tell you

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.210 align:middle line:84%
no one historically
wondering about what

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.980 align:middle line:84%
was acting on human
imagination ever-- ever-- even

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.307 align:middle line:84%
dreamt of something
electrical in the sky.

00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:50.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, once
you point it out.

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.980 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Inspiring
these images,

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.610 align:middle line:84%
once it's open for discussion,
everybody can see it.

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
experiencing right now.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.612 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's why your
work is so beautiful.

00:06:01.612 --> 00:06:03.070 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Well,
there's this sense

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:08.080 align:middle line:84%
now of a spectacular
unification of thought

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:14.860 align:middle line:84%
now about the origins
of human religions,

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.040 align:middle line:84%
institutional
interpretations of things

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.690 align:middle line:84%
that have made no sense to us,
all of the ritual practices,

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.510 align:middle line:84%
the magical practices,
the superstitions,

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.810 align:middle line:84%
the rock art, as you said,
all the great artistic motifs

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.950 align:middle line:84%
that dominated the early
phases of human history,

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.245 align:middle line:84%
the beginnings of
languages, and pictographs

00:06:33.245 --> 00:06:37.920 align:middle line:84%
that are inseparable from
those artistic traditions,

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.780 align:middle line:84%
the pictographs evolving
into abstractions that

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.460 align:middle line:90%
become alphabets, and so on.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.010 align:middle line:84%
This is just such an
interesting field,

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:50.164 align:middle line:84%
because in the points
of agreement between all

00:06:50.164 --> 00:06:51.580 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient
cultures, there are

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.580 align:middle line:90%
certain forms that stand out.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:58.050 align:middle line:84%
Now one, for example,
is this stupendous wheel

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.520 align:middle line:84%
turning in the sky,
just a wheel in the sky

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.450 align:middle line:90%
and an axle of the wheel.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And spokes that
are the extension

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.400 align:middle line:84%
of a star that is the hub
of the wheel with the axle

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.490 align:middle line:90%
in the center of it.

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just describing it
in words, many people who

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.510 align:middle line:84%
are familiar with ancient
art, they'll say, oh, yeah,

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:17.610 align:middle line:90%
well that is it.

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.780 align:middle line:84%
There's the rim of
the wheel, the axles.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.950 align:middle line:84%
There's the hub, and
then there's the axle.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:23.640 align:middle line:84%
But did you know
that the axle was

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.767 align:middle line:90%
identified as the Warrior-Hero?

00:07:25.767 --> 00:07:26.850 align:middle line:90%
Well, what does that mean?

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:31.440 align:middle line:84%
The moment you recognize that,
you have libraries of evidence

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.930 align:middle line:90%
that are opening up to you.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And then you hear that,
well, that star was

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.727 align:middle line:90%
identified as the planet Venus.

00:07:38.727 --> 00:07:39.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:40.685 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: And
you see, there are

00:07:40.685 --> 00:07:42.340 align:middle line:84%
these streamers
that actually are

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.630 align:middle line:84%
suggestive of
electric discharge.

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:46.210 align:middle line:84%
There's a symmetry
to them, and there

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:49.235 align:middle line:84%
is symmetry to electric
discharge activity.

00:07:49.235 --> 00:07:52.670 align:middle line:84%
What was happening to the
planet Venus that identified it

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:57.030 align:middle line:84%
as the hub and the spokes of
this spectacular turning wheel

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:58.450 align:middle line:90%
in the sky?

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:00.545 align:middle line:84%
And then you begin
to notice, well,

00:08:00.545 --> 00:08:04.600 align:middle line:84%
this wasn't just an esoteric
thought that occurred to them.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.612 align:middle line:84%
They were building
temples in cities,

00:08:06.612 --> 00:08:08.820 align:middle line:84%
and they were using this
wheel as the model for them.

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.320 align:middle line:84%
These were the wheel
cities, and so on.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.350 align:middle line:84%
So all of this
monumental activity,

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:18.310 align:middle line:84%
which was fundamentally
commemorative-- a monument

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.400 align:middle line:90%
is a commemoration of something.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:24.387 align:middle line:84%
And we just draw blanks when
we look back at this stuff.

00:08:24.387 --> 00:08:26.470 align:middle line:84%
We don't see commemoration
of anything meaningful.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:27.511 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, not at all.

00:08:27.511 --> 00:08:29.170 align:middle line:84%
It just looks like
primitive art.

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And partially because,
even as children,

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:35.280 align:middle line:84%
what are some of the most
common things we draw?

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.350 align:middle line:84%
It would be a sun, a
sun like a spoked wheel.

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:41.110 align:middle line:84%
It would be little
five-pointed stars.

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:43.865 align:middle line:84%
These are the most natural
expressions, globally

00:08:43.865 --> 00:08:46.320 align:middle line:84%
of children around
the world, that we

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.170 align:middle line:84%
start drawing as soon
as we're able to hold

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.560 align:middle line:90%
our pencils in our hands.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: This is in the area
of more speculation, lower

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.490 align:middle line:84%
level of confidence than
the reconstruction itself.

00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:00.000 align:middle line:84%
But there's evidence that
the events and the formations

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.970 align:middle line:84%
in the sky that
were experienced,

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:07.140 align:middle line:84%
persisted in the human psyche
as subconscious strata.

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is what
Carl Jung was saying.

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:13.510 align:middle line:84%
But he never wondered where
did these archetypes come from.

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:18.690 align:middle line:84%
But we're simply saying, hey,
extraordinary natural events

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:22.200 align:middle line:84%
provoked an outpouring
of human imagination.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
mythic archetypes.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
as above, so below.

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:26.461 align:middle line:90%
>>TALBOTT: Exactly.

00:09:26.461 --> 00:09:29.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You cannot disconnect
our electrical matrix with

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:31.370 align:middle line:90%
the cosmos.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:34.145 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: There must be much
more to that connectivity

00:09:34.145 --> 00:09:36.000 align:middle line:90%
than we've even dreamt of.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to
take a look at a little video

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:41.350 align:middle line:84%
about the origins of humans,
because we can't forget us

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:42.410 align:middle line:90%
in the whole mix too.

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:43.285 align:middle line:90%
>>TALBOTT: Excellent.

00:09:43.285 --> 00:09:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK?

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:48.060 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: How did
human history begin?

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:52.410 align:middle line:10%
The evidence may seem too
complex for generalization.

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:57.150 align:middle line:10%
Yet all of history can be
stated as just two stories.

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.640 align:middle line:10%
First, came the
story of mythology,

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.850 align:middle line:10%
filled with cosmic dramas
and celestial wonders.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:07.576 align:middle line:10%
We lived in the
presence of the gods.

00:10:07.576 --> 00:10:11.480 align:middle line:10%
It was the gods who determined
the fate of the world,

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.970 align:middle line:10%
demanding allegiance,
even as they called humans

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:17.160 align:middle line:10%
to sacrifice.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.130 align:middle line:10%
The gods were unpredictable.

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:23.320 align:middle line:10%
When angry, they
went to war, or they

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:26.520 align:middle line:10%
destroyed their own creation.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:29.810 align:middle line:10%
Over time, however, man's
quest for deeper meaning

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:33.910 align:middle line:10%
in the myths ignited sparks
of spiritual awakening.

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And it was from these sparks
that the great religions arose.

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:39.430 align:middle line:90%


00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:43.210 align:middle line:84%
But all of the world's religions
shared a taproot in mythology.

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:45.880 align:middle line:90%


00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And not one freed
itself entirely

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.490 align:middle line:84%
from the momentum
of the first story.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:55.170 align:middle line:90%


00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:59.440 align:middle line:84%
The second story arose from
doubt, as philosophers, poets,

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.910 align:middle line:84%
and naturalists began to
lose faith in the myths.

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:07.780 align:middle line:10%
And some stopped believing
in the gods altogether.

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:11.180 align:middle line:10%
That was because direct
experience under a familiar

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:14.510 align:middle line:10%
and highly predictable
sky gave no support

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:17.420 align:middle line:10%
to the archaic myths.

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.960 align:middle line:10%
Skepticism inspired
closer attention

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.400 align:middle line:10%
to nature, the
essential requirement

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.950 align:middle line:10%
for the rise of
science and technology

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:26.900 align:middle line:10%
that would change the world.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:31.140 align:middle line:10%
Thus, the heroic completion
of the second story,

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:34.925 align:middle line:10%
rational science rising to
vanquish myth and magic.

00:11:34.925 --> 00:11:38.970 align:middle line:90%


00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:41.640 align:middle line:10%
And so, the full
sweep of human history

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:46.520 align:middle line:10%
comes down to just two stories
in competition, a cliche,

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.990 align:middle line:10%
science versus
myth and religion.

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:52.130 align:middle line:10%
Well into the 20th
century, it seemed

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:56.040 align:middle line:10%
that we were forced to choose.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:59.200 align:middle line:10%
But a few have wondered,
could the myths

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.240 align:middle line:10%
harbor a truth that we
have missed, something yet

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:06.920 align:middle line:10%
to be discovered, a
message for science

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:09.950 align:middle line:10%
hidden in the myths and
symbols of deepest antiquity?

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:13.780 align:middle line:90%


00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was
absolutely beautiful.

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:17.460 align:middle line:84%
OK, before we go
any further-- I love

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:22.450 align:middle line:84%
that video-- Velikovsky's
hypothesis about the origins

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:25.580 align:middle line:90%
of humankind rocked your world.

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:28.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's just set this
conversation up with why?

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:32.920 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Well, at the
core of Velikovsky's work--

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this was the
culminating work, really,

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:39.420 align:middle line:84%
in his life-- was the idea that
the planetary system that we

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:41.290 align:middle line:90%
know today is new.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:43.930 align:middle line:84%
Planets haven't always
moved on these courses.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Science has been saying,
with full confidence,

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:49.780 align:middle line:84%
that planets have always
moved on these courses.

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:53.490 align:middle line:10%
So science, as a whole,
did not take kindly

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:56.970 align:middle line:10%
to Velikovsky's pronouncement
that the planet Venus was new

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:59.100 align:middle line:10%
and that it was
formerly a comet,

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:04.270 align:middle line:10%
and it was devastating in its
impact on all of humanity.

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And to say this, he
committed a crime.

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:12.740 align:middle line:84%
He used ancient
myths, and legends,

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:16.950 align:middle line:84%
and primitive
astronomical accounts

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:21.470 align:middle line:84%
to verify the
claimed role of Venus

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:23.680 align:middle line:90%
as a world-threatening comet.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.960 align:middle line:90%
And that was not permissible.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And so Velikovsky not only
saw his number one bestseller

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.530 align:middle line:84%
dropped by the
publisher, Macmillan.

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:39.250 align:middle line:84%
But this was a very
distinguished scientist,

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:42.870 align:middle line:84%
a colleague of Sigmund Freud
and of Albert Einstein,

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:48.850 align:middle line:84%
for example, who lost
all of his credibility

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:52.300 align:middle line:84%
in the eyes of
mainstream scientists.

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's a story unto itself,
the devastating impact that

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:58.990 align:middle line:90%
had on Velikovsky personally.

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:05.990 align:middle line:84%
But the space age, fortunately,
followed the publication

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:07.117 align:middle line:90%
of "Worlds in Collision."

00:14:07.117 --> 00:14:07.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:10.940 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: And the thing
about facts coming back to us

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:14.900 align:middle line:84%
from space is that
they didn't lend

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:20.810 align:middle line:84%
any veracity to the ideas that
were used against Velikovsky.

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:24.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is just
the historic record.

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.540 align:middle line:84%
We can no more say that
planets have always

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:28.950 align:middle line:84%
moved on the same
courses as they do today.

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:31.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all of the
historical evidence now,

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:35.060 align:middle line:84%
as we begin to actually
look at it systematically

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:37.575 align:middle line:84%
and logically,
rationally, the evidence

00:14:37.575 --> 00:14:40.600 align:middle line:84%
says that civilization
as a whole

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.470 align:middle line:84%
emerged out of
wholesale catastrophe.

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:49.200 align:middle line:84%
That was on their
minds day and night.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:53.500 align:middle line:84%
It's all in the mythology,
and mythology has

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:56.030 align:middle line:84%
an explanation and
concrete experiences,

00:14:56.030 --> 00:15:00.290 align:middle line:84%
concrete forms in the sky,
concrete sequences of events.

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And all we need to do
is pose the question.

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.850 align:middle line:90%
That's my message in a nutshell.

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:08.850 align:middle line:84%
We just pose the question,
because Velikovsky

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:12.850 align:middle line:84%
forged a path for us with his
claims about the planet Venus.

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:14.760 align:middle line:84%
He noticed that
different cultures

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:18.310 align:middle line:84%
were using different words
and different symbols.

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:21.330 align:middle line:84%
But they were all within the
context of these cultures'

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:23.147 align:middle line:90%
symbols and words for comets.

00:15:23.147 --> 00:15:23.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:25.400 align:middle line:90%
And this is really your work.

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And what you're
looking for is to find

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:30.789 align:middle line:84%
the consistency between
this global imagery

00:15:30.789 --> 00:15:31.830 align:middle line:90%
and these global stories.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying
science really has

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:40.340 align:middle line:84%
been foolish to totally
dismiss these consistencies

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:42.860 align:middle line:84%
throughout our history and
throughout our religions

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:43.810 align:middle line:90%
and cultures.

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: But we
can, I think, be

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.210 align:middle line:90%
sympathetic with that mistake.

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:50.350 align:middle line:84%
There's a fundamental
error of perception.

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:53.140 align:middle line:84%
But we can appreciate
it in one sense.

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:55.170 align:middle line:90%
It's all absurd.

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:59.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just consider
the absurdities

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.300 align:middle line:90%
of the ancient myth.

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:04.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the absurdity of a
dragon attacking a village.

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.370 align:middle line:84%
Follow that absurdity
backwards, and you

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:08.490 align:middle line:90%
get to a much bigger absurdity.

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:11.300 align:middle line:84%
That dragon was actually
attacking the world.

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:14.260 align:middle line:84%
The world is progressively
reduced by storytelling,

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:15.600 align:middle line:90%
that archaic world.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.810 align:middle line:84%
So now this is our village
was attacked by this dragon,

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:21.200 align:middle line:90%
and it carried off the princess.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But cosmologically,
what was the dragon?

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:27.100 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: It was this
huge and terrifying form

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:28.240 align:middle line:90%
of the comet Venus.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm oversimplifying
everything here,

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:34.980 align:middle line:84%
because there was a dynamic
relationship between plasma

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:38.010 align:middle line:84%
phenomena centered on
Venus and a connection

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:39.360 align:middle line:90%
to the planet Mars.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.610 align:middle line:84%
This, you have to get into
the reconstruction a bit

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:43.360 align:middle line:90%
to see that that is so.

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.630 align:middle line:84%
But Venus was the
mother of all comets.

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:48.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Terrifying
in the skies

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:48.395 align:middle line:90%
to the natives of the day.

00:16:48.395 --> 00:16:49.655 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Terrifying,
and everything

00:16:49.655 --> 00:16:51.071 align:middle line:84%
that the ancient
peoples ever said

00:16:51.071 --> 00:16:53.740 align:middle line:84%
about comets was
planted in their minds

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:55.500 align:middle line:90%
by the Great Comet Venus.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.500 align:middle line:84%
So a comet appears
into view, oh my,

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.070 align:middle line:84%
god, the world is going
to come to an end.

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:02.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that's
collective memory on some--

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:05.640 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Its collective
memory, exactly so.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:08.900 align:middle line:84%
Every culture was influenced
by the same human experience.

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:10.690 align:middle line:90%
And Venus was a comet.

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:14.599 align:middle line:84%
So Venus was a comet,
and the imagery

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:18.430 align:middle line:84%
that conditioned all of our
doomsday fears about comets

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:21.050 align:middle line:84%
can be traced right
back to the Great Comet.

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And when they say, the
comet appears in the sky,

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:24.800 align:middle line:90%
and the king is going to die.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.040 align:middle line:90%
The kingdom is going to fall.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the story
of the Great Comet.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was Venus,
the eye, heart,

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.610 align:middle line:84%
and soul of this
stupendous power

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:38.020 align:middle line:84%
that Velikovsky
identified as Saturn.

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:41.930 align:middle line:84%
So these planets are inseparably
connected to each other.

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:45.430 align:middle line:84%
You can't take a myth
about the Warrior-Hero,

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:47.430 align:middle line:84%
identify it with
Mars, and stop there.

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.930 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:50.660 align:middle line:84%
You have to see the
Warrior-Hero was the consort

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:54.680 align:middle line:90%
of the goddess who was Venus.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:58.000 align:middle line:84%
The goddess Venus was originally
the eye, heart, and soul

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.960 align:middle line:84%
of a universal sovereign figure,
a towering form in the sky,

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:05.890 align:middle line:84%
identified as the primeval sun
ruling before the present sun.

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:09.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a global
convergence of myth,

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:12.550 align:middle line:84%
and the planets cannot be
separated from each other.

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:13.550 align:middle line:90%
That's the heart of it.

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:14.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.770 align:middle line:84%
So from there, we're going
to go into the first story,

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:18.870 align:middle line:84%
second story, leading
to the third story.

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And you can do a brief overview
of, yeah, essentially story

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:23.050 align:middle line:90%
one.

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:25.258 align:middle line:84%
It was the gods who determined
the fate of the world.

00:18:25.258 --> 00:18:28.680 align:middle line:84%
Then we'll go to story two and
then to the age of rationalism.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.990 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Rationalism is
kind of like the second story.

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:37.200 align:middle line:84%
So, OK, the first
story is the story

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.500 align:middle line:84%
which gave rise to the
birth of the civilizations.

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.720 align:middle line:84%
As I was saying, it's the only
thing that was on their minds,

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:47.950 align:middle line:84%
these spectacular cosmic
events being reenacted

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:50.760 align:middle line:84%
and a desperate urge to
remember, not to forget,

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:53.340 align:middle line:84%
and to recover the Golden
Age, recover connections

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:57.800 align:middle line:84%
to the gods, maintain
a kind of innocence

00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:04.120 align:middle line:84%
in the eyes of the gods, to be
the ones that the gods favor.

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To go back
into the Golden Age

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.940 align:middle line:90%
and release all the struggle.

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:12.520 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Yeah, and to
be the children of God.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:13.164 align:middle line:90%
There's the--

00:19:13.164 --> 00:19:14.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That was it.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.163 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: To be the chosen
people, quite frankly.

00:19:16.163 --> 00:19:19.169 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To go back to
pre-cataclysmic times.

00:19:19.169 --> 00:19:19.960 align:middle line:90%
>>TALBOTT: Exactly.

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And every collective activity
of the early civilizations

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:29.040 align:middle line:84%
was guided by the
myth-making epoch.

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.420 align:middle line:90%
That's all it was.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.340 align:middle line:90%
It was self-serving.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:35.045 align:middle line:84%
And myths and symbols
became progressively

00:19:35.045 --> 00:19:40.660 align:middle line:84%
elaborated to make our
history cosmically important.

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:44.510 align:middle line:84%
So we became the children of
the primeval universal sovereign

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:45.010 align:middle line:90%
power.

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So everything
was inextricably

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:49.570 align:middle line:84%
tied to the gods, i.e., the
planets, the stars, the cosmos.

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:50.653 align:middle line:90%
>>TALBOTT: Everything was.

00:19:50.653 --> 00:19:55.135 align:middle line:84%
All of the regalia
of kings, the weapons

00:19:55.135 --> 00:20:02.390 align:middle line:84%
of warriors, that's the
connection of the first story.

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:06.020 align:middle line:84%
Everything that was
being said collectively

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:09.620 align:middle line:84%
was a reflection of
the myth-making epoch.

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:14.910 align:middle line:84%
But it was all
preposterous when seen

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:19.770 align:middle line:84%
with a degree of
rational independence.

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:22.065 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
rational Aristotle materials

00:20:22.065 --> 00:20:23.210 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] and
story number two,

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:24.751 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Aristotle
is a good figure

00:20:24.751 --> 00:20:29.840 align:middle line:84%
for that, because he carried
forward certain persuasions,

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.780 align:middle line:84%
like persuasions about comets
and the definitions of comets,

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:33.990 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:37.670 align:middle line:84%
But he wanted nature, as we
know it, to be the guide.

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And the naturalist Seneca,
for example, they all

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:50.140 align:middle line:84%
wanted to redeem the present
experience that didn't fit

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.310 align:middle line:90%
well with the myths, and so on.

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:56.600 align:middle line:84%
But well, what does all of
this experience of nature mean?

00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:00.900 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't find any real
explanation in these stories.

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:03.860 align:middle line:84%
So the stories are not
finding any support

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:06.360 align:middle line:84%
in the later
experience of nature.

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, in a current experience.

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:09.420 align:middle line:90%
We look out at the stars.

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:11.380 align:middle line:84%
The planets aren't
these towering forms.

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:13.250 align:middle line:90%
There are no dragons.

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:19.550 align:middle line:84%
So the seeming absurdity of
myth, as it began to stand out,

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:23.140 align:middle line:90%
caused doubt about the myths.

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:27.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, I mean, a poet like
Ovid, he was so respectful

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:31.940 align:middle line:84%
of the myths, but he couldn't
help laughing at times.

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And so, he would, in fact,
drop his comic line and say,

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:38.170 align:middle line:84%
"But to the myths
we must be true."

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:41.540 align:middle line:84%
So there was this respect,
and that's what he was doing.

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:44.220 align:middle line:84%
He was passing on the
stories, metamorphose,

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.720 align:middle line:84%
the gods metamorphosing
from one thing to another.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.410 align:middle line:90%
It's all kind of comical.

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:55.240 align:middle line:84%
But this was the perspective
in the classical era,

00:21:55.240 --> 00:22:03.230 align:middle line:84%
the introduction of rationalism,
and a naturalistic philosophy

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:08.070 align:middle line:84%
wanting the way we experience
nature now to tell us

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:10.110 align:middle line:90%
what to think about things.

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:13.060 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that that
progressively removes

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:14.650 align:middle line:90%
any credibility for the myths.

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:16.275 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it
removes all history.

00:22:16.275 --> 00:22:17.870 align:middle line:90%
>>TALBOTT: Yeah.

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:20.320 align:middle line:10%
The myths, in
particular, because they

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:24.840 align:middle line:10%
don't fit into anything and
the classical philosophers

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.810 align:middle line:10%
not really even
being in a position

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:32.310 align:middle line:10%
to reconstruct what was actually
happening behind the myths,

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:37.850 align:middle line:10%
the mythology was
fated of necessity,

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:42.760 align:middle line:10%
you might say, to fall
into complete disrepute.

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And that is the way
philosophy and then

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:50.340 align:middle line:84%
science arose, with
a first mission

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:54.770 align:middle line:84%
to rid ourselves of this
nonsense, this storytelling.

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:56.501 align:middle line:90%
And that succeeded.

00:22:56.501 --> 00:22:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was
story number two.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.070 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Yeah, story
number two was, hey,

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:01.180 align:middle line:90%
we're rational people.

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:02.150 align:middle line:90%
We can see the world.

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:03.810 align:middle line:84%
We can see what
this is all about.

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:04.225 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Look at
this silly art.

00:23:04.225 --> 00:23:06.350 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Forget these
silly myths, and so on.

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:07.804 align:middle line:90%
Come on, we're grownups, now.

00:23:07.804 --> 00:23:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was wondering
about this child-like art?

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:10.280 align:middle line:90%
>>TALBOTT: Yeah.

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:11.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:16.710 align:middle line:84%
So that did create a
window for the explosion

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:21.110 align:middle line:84%
of scientific exploration
where the elders

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:22.690 align:middle line:84%
and the traditionalists
are not going

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:25.560 align:middle line:84%
to tell us what we are
permitted to study, and so on.

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And there's no
religious oversight

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:30.560 align:middle line:84%
of what we're doing, telling
us what to believe in.

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And so that was
actually the opening

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:37.595 align:middle line:84%
for the scientific revolution,
which of course, blossomed

00:23:37.595 --> 00:23:42.425 align:middle line:84%
completely and gave rise to
overconfidence in the sciences,

00:23:42.425 --> 00:23:43.700 align:middle line:90%
I believe.

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And they forgot to ask a
completely legitimate question.

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:51.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, what caused
all of these stories

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:53.550 align:middle line:90%
that we find so ridiculous?

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:55.265 align:middle line:84%
There has to have
been a provocation.

00:23:55.265 --> 00:23:56.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:58.431 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Yeah, there has
to have been some reason why

00:23:58.431 --> 00:24:01.230 align:middle line:84%
these absurd ideas came
into human experience

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:02.792 align:middle line:84%
and just dominated
human history.

00:24:02.792 --> 00:24:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And continued
being passed down

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:05.333 align:middle line:90%
throughout the ages.

00:24:05.333 --> 00:24:08.660 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Yeah, and I
mean, with this huge power.

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:10.650 align:middle line:90%
And why mythic archetypes?

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:12.756 align:middle line:90%
Why common patterns?

00:24:12.756 --> 00:24:15.910 align:middle line:84%
These ancient civilizations
weren't talking to each other.

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:20.080 align:middle line:84%
So if there's an integral
story beneath all this clutter

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.070 align:middle line:84%
and confusion of
absurdities, there's

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:25.090 align:middle line:84%
actually a coherent
story that we can tell,

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:28.640 align:middle line:84%
you can't get away from having
to address and acknowledge

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.540 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:31.650 align:middle line:84%
And that, in effect,
is all we're saying.

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:32.880 align:middle line:90%
There is a story there.

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:37.590 align:middle line:84%
There are protocols for
drawing reliable conclusions

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:40.824 align:middle line:84%
from the convergence of
testimony globally, points

00:24:40.824 --> 00:24:42.490 align:middle line:84%
of agreement between
different cultures.

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:44.114 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
story number three.

00:24:44.114 --> 00:24:45.140 align:middle line:90%
>>TALBOTT: Exactly.

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:47.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Could it be that
by dismissing the myths,

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:50.500 align:middle line:84%
we've dismissed some
essential ancient truths?

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:51.560 align:middle line:90%
>>TALBOTT: Yeah.

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:53.890 align:middle line:84%
Our history, the
[INAUDIBLE] we've

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:59.290 align:middle line:84%
come to completely
misunderstand the forces that

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:04.340 align:middle line:84%
acted on human imagination
at the dawn of history.

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And the third story is appealing
to people who are, number one,

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:12.310 align:middle line:84%
not certain that science
has the picture right,

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:15.210 align:middle line:84%
and not certain that
institutionalized religions

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:19.730 align:middle line:84%
have the picture right,
strongly suspecting

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:25.840 align:middle line:84%
that if we drop our allegiances,
our dogmatic allegiances

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:29.320 align:middle line:84%
to these two, the religion
versus science thing,

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.180 align:middle line:84%
it just dissolves
in front of you,

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:33.280 align:middle line:84%
if you actually allow
the deeper questions in.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:38.326 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: And people are
actually ready for this.

00:25:38.326 --> 00:25:39.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think they are.

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:41.533 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's what's so
beautiful about this work

00:25:41.533 --> 00:25:44.430 align:middle line:84%
that you've put together
here, you and Wall Thornhill.

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:49.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're actually
showing how the cosmos has been

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:50.450 align:middle line:90%
reflected throughout history.

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And there is cross-cultural
agreement, as you say.

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And that is critical to giving
credence to this story again.

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:57.950 align:middle line:90%
>>TALBOTT: That's the key.

00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And the process of
reasoning from evidence

00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:05.530 align:middle line:90%
can be spelled out in detail.

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And following the protocol for
drawing reliable conclusions

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:12.657 align:middle line:84%
from unreliable witnesses,
just like a detective would do.

00:26:12.657 --> 00:26:13.740 align:middle line:90%
You know how a detective--

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:14.763 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:26:14.763 --> 00:26:17.054 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Well, they're not
all saying the same thing,

00:26:17.054 --> 00:26:20.620 align:middle line:90%
but all 5, all 10 said this.

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:21.890 align:middle line:90%
It's very specific.

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:22.980 align:middle line:90%
That can't be false.

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:24.560 align:middle line:84%
They weren't talking
to each other.

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, the early cultures
weren't talking

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:31.380 align:middle line:84%
to each other either, so highly
concrete points of agreement.

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:35.150 align:middle line:84%
For example, the Warrior-Hero
descends to the underworld,

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:37.080 align:middle line:84%
and it's in connection
with the formation

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:40.000 align:middle line:84%
of a great cosmic
mountain or a world pillar

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.630 align:middle line:90%
rising along the world axis.

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:45.020 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's so specific.

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:49.762 align:middle line:84%
If that doesn't have a reason,
a cause, then something just

00:26:49.762 --> 00:26:50.720 align:middle line:90%
isn't adding up at all.

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:50.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:52.286 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: It has
to have a cause,

00:26:52.286 --> 00:26:55.340 align:middle line:84%
because the evidence,
the stories are there.

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:57.622 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't be
there by accident.

00:26:57.622 --> 00:26:59.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I'd like to
go into some of these.

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:02.910 align:middle line:84%
One of them is, and it's
on page 2122 in the book,

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:07.335 align:middle line:84%
it's images of plasma discharge
as depicted in ancient stone

00:27:07.335 --> 00:27:08.460 align:middle line:90%
art.

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:11.750 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Oh, this
probably would take us

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:15.500 align:middle line:84%
right into the most important
juncture in the development

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:16.780 align:middle line:90%
of my own research.

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:20.170 align:middle line:84%
I had converged with
Wall Thornhill in the mid

00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:21.860 align:middle line:90%
to late '90s.

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And I was aware of incongruities
in rock art, many of which

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:28.700 align:middle line:90%
did not make sense to me.

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:31.500 align:middle line:84%
Because what I had
reconstructed didn't touch them.

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I would
find pointers that

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:37.080 align:middle line:84%
would say these rock art
images are very important.

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And for me, there was one
rock art image in particular,

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:44.240 align:middle line:84%
and it was called
"The Chain of Arrows."

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I called it
"The Chain of Arrows."

00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And the chain of arrows is a
worldwide motif, by the way.

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:51.160 align:middle line:84%
It's not just North
America, though it's

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:52.310 align:middle line:90%
all over North America.

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:55.530 align:middle line:84%
But a warrior launches
an arrow up into the sky.

00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And then he launches another
one, which fixes itself

00:27:58.220 --> 00:27:59.420 align:middle line:90%
in the previous one.

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:02.060 align:middle line:84%
And you get this conic,
embedded cone form.

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is this petroglyph
from Kayenta, Arizona?

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:06.444 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Well, it's
getting right to that.

00:28:06.444 --> 00:28:07.818 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
getting to it, OK.

00:28:07.818 --> 00:28:10.140 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: So there was
a chain of arrows theme

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:11.500 align:middle line:90%
that I was very interested in.

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is
from all over the world?

00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:14.216 align:middle line:90%
Yes, everywhere.

00:28:14.216 --> 00:28:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: It is actually
all over the world.

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:17.130 align:middle line:90%
It has different forms.

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:20.140 align:middle line:84%
But the chain of arrows is
one form that is quite global.

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:23.130 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't just something
originated in America

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:24.860 align:middle line:90%
and spread across North America.

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:26.620 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's in South America too.

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:28.950 align:middle line:84%
But then if you find it
in Africa, which you do,

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:31.940 align:middle line:84%
and in the South Pacific,
which you do, and then you see,

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:33.640 align:middle line:84%
well, the chain of
arrows is really not

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:36.570 align:middle line:84%
any different than
that world tree

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:38.620 align:middle line:84%
with the notches in
its trunk, and so on.

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:41.060 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole-- the flared
skirt of the mother goddess,

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:41.390 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:43.370 align:middle line:84%
You see the flared skirt
of the mother goddess.

00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:44.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
one arrow embedded

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:45.465 align:middle line:90%
in the other and the other.

00:28:45.465 --> 00:28:46.220 align:middle line:90%
>>TALBOTT: Yeah.

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:48.490 align:middle line:84%
It's the same
underlying experience,

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:50.290 align:middle line:90%
different mythic interpretation.

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:57.650 align:middle line:84%
So I focused in on this
chain of arrows motif

00:28:57.650 --> 00:29:00.820 align:middle line:84%
and deduced from
hundreds-- I mean,

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:03.880 align:middle line:84%
that there's no exaggeration
in this-- hundreds

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:08.400 align:middle line:84%
of subtle connections
between the chain of arrows

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:13.750 align:middle line:84%
and another mythic theme,
the ladder of heaven.

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw that, well,
they can't be separate.

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:20.460 align:middle line:84%
So whatever caused that
embedded cone form,

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:23.440 align:middle line:84%
it had to have divided
into a stack of toruses.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:29.860 align:middle line:84%
So I had this clearly in
mind, almost simultaneous

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:34.660 align:middle line:84%
with a discovery that in the
story of the chain of arrows,

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:38.710 align:middle line:84%
the chain of arrows becomes
a ladder to the sky.

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:40.120 align:middle line:84%
It becomes the
ladder to the sky.

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:40.730 align:middle line:90%


00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:42.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk about
what that means

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:44.140 align:middle line:90%
in terms of stacked toruses.

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:46.350 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Yeah,
exactly, exactly.

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:52.150 align:middle line:84%
So there's a connection that
brings all of this together,

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:56.230 align:middle line:84%
and it is the upward
winding filament or serpent.

00:29:56.230 --> 00:30:00.340 align:middle line:84%
The serpent that winds itself
up this pole of the caduceus.

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:04.000 align:middle line:84%
But 100, 1,000 other
images are suggestive

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.590 align:middle line:84%
of an upward spiraling
serpent form.

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And I came to the conclusion
based on one parallel

00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:16.160 align:middle line:84%
after another suggesting
the connection,

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:22.360 align:middle line:84%
an upward winding
plasma filament divided

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:26.370 align:middle line:90%
into a conical series of cones.

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:27.990 align:middle line:90%
They were actually toruses.

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:31.360 align:middle line:84%
The cones are actually
rotating their toruses.

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And then they spread out to
become more definitive toroidal

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:37.520 align:middle line:90%
forms, a stack of toruses.

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.415 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
do they represent

00:30:39.415 --> 00:30:40.540 align:middle line:90%
in the electrical universe?

00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:42.160 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: In the
electric universe,

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.800 align:middle line:84%
they are the natural
toroidal form.

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:48.670 align:middle line:84%
But, I mean, who am I
to say that this is all

00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:50.980 align:middle line:90%
explicable by plasma physics?

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:53.960 align:middle line:84%
But I knew there was
a plasma connection.

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And when Wall Thornhill
came to Portland

00:30:56.510 --> 00:31:00.690 align:middle line:84%
ahead of a conference
in September

00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:04.190 align:middle line:84%
on the electric universe, and
he was a featured speaker,

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:07.780 align:middle line:84%
I showed him the chain
of arrows imagery.

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:12.550 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Dave, that
has to be plasma discharge.

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:14.340 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
what's happening?

00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'll
have to look into it.

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:17.820 align:middle line:90%
Well, that wasn't satisfying.

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:22.840 align:middle line:84%
But we had invited
another man, probably

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:25.170 align:middle line:84%
the most distinguished
plasma scientist

00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:29.190 align:middle line:84%
studying high-energy electric
discharge in the plasma

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:32.680 align:middle line:84%
laboratory from Los
Alamos, Anthony Peratt,

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:35.160 align:middle line:84%
invited him to the
same conference.

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And it was the most
miraculous dramatic turn

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:44.080 align:middle line:90%
in my whole life of research.

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:48.150 align:middle line:84%
Immediately, in the
wake of Tony's presence

00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:53.050 align:middle line:84%
at the conference, we had a
private gathering of speakers.

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:56.580 align:middle line:84%
Tony was really,
really impressed

00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:58.810 align:middle line:84%
with what he saw
at the conference,

00:31:58.810 --> 00:32:02.490 align:middle line:84%
and that emboldened him
to stand up-- I mean,

00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:04.660 align:middle line:84%
12 speakers were
gathered there--

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:10.410 align:middle line:84%
to stand up at that meeting, go
up to this little white board

00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:15.680 align:middle line:84%
and describe this enigmatic
or really interesting

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:20.490 align:middle line:84%
form taken by electric discharge
in the plasma laboratory.

00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And he drew out the
chain of arrows.

00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:24.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:27.780 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: It was, I mean--
just even talking about it,

00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:32.540 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of like a shiver sort
of a thing, because I just have

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:34.000 align:middle line:90%
this-- I mean, this was 2000.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.990 align:middle line:84%
This was almost 15 years
ago, September 2000.

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, several
people in the group,

00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:46.330 align:middle line:84%
I had already presented the
chain of arrows theme to.

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And we were looking
at each other.

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And it was just such
an incredible moment.

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:56.680 align:middle line:84%
And I knew it wasn't just that
my life had taken a turn there.

00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:00.040 align:middle line:84%
I knew that this
fellow, Tony Peratt,

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:02.550 align:middle line:84%
would never be able to
walk away from this,

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:05.750 align:middle line:84%
when I would say
simply, Tony, you just

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:07.720 align:middle line:90%
drew the chain of arrows.

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So, OK, go ahead, yes.

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:10.580 align:middle line:90%
>>TALBOTT: OK.

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:12.050 align:middle line:90%
It has more to it.

00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:14.340 align:middle line:84%
Tony said, well,
how did that form?

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And I described upward
spiraling filament

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:19.901 align:middle line:84%
dividing into this
chain of arrows form

00:33:19.901 --> 00:33:20.900 align:middle line:90%
that then becomes more--

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Depending on
your point of view, yeah.

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:23.440 align:middle line:90%
>>TALBOTT: Yeah, yeah.

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:26.370 align:middle line:84%
That emerges as a stack
of toruses that was

00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:28.130 align:middle line:90%
called the ladder of heaven.

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And he said, that is the
evolutionary sequence

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:35.420 align:middle line:90%
of the Peratt Instability.

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:38.470 align:middle line:84%
His colleagues had
named it after him.

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Amazing.

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: And so, I mean, he
was never the same after that.

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, he was
really never the same.

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:49.050 align:middle line:90%
He gets back to Los Alamos.

00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:50.190 align:middle line:90%
He emails me.

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:52.550 align:middle line:84%
He says, I have to
see the rock art.

00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:55.840 align:middle line:84%
And I have thousands
of rock art images

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:58.040 align:middle line:84%
that would be useful
in substantiating this,

00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:00.450 align:middle line:84%
but I actually
just sent him one.

00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And it is the
Kayenta pictograph.

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And it is the stack of toruses,
but the edges are folded up.

00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:08.500 align:middle line:84%
And it has this eye
mask form below.

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:11.041 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to talk
about the eye mask in a moment.

00:34:11.041 --> 00:34:15.719 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: It captures the
entire sequence so beautifully,

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:18.280 align:middle line:84%
the completeness of this
form so beautifully,

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:19.920 align:middle line:90%
I just sent him that.

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:21.889 align:middle line:84%
I just had this
underlying confidence

00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:23.850 align:middle line:90%
he didn't need to see more.

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And when I sent that to
him, as he described it,

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:28.980 align:middle line:90%
his world ended.

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:29.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Amazing.

00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:31.346 align:middle line:90%
>>TALBOTT: He knew.

00:34:31.346 --> 00:34:32.929 align:middle line:84%
I mean, first, he
was a little fearful

00:34:32.929 --> 00:34:36.570 align:middle line:84%
that somebody had come in
and taken something out

00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:38.239 align:middle line:84%
of his computer
and gotten to it.

00:34:38.239 --> 00:34:39.600 align:middle line:90%
But he got the picture.

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:41.949 align:middle line:90%
It's an authentic pictograph.

00:34:41.949 --> 00:34:45.825 align:middle line:84%
And he changed his
life on the spot there.

00:34:45.825 --> 00:34:50.630 align:middle line:84%
He mobilized archaeologists
and rock art experts,

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:54.639 align:middle line:84%
and he began logging rock
art around the world.

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And what he did was
identify specific forms

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:02.980 align:middle line:84%
in specific regions,
carved on stone,

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:06.471 align:middle line:84%
with a clear indication of
the field of view to the sky,

00:35:06.471 --> 00:35:06.970 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:35:06.970 --> 00:35:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And so, he was able to enter
the data into the Roadrunner

00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:13.790 align:middle line:90%
computer at Los Alamos.

00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:16.320 align:middle line:84%
This is the most
powerful in the world.

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And the computer
was able to diagnose

00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:23.960 align:middle line:84%
what was seen from different
portions of the Earth,

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:25.700 align:middle line:90%
different places on Earth.

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:30.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, the story grows
more elaborate.

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:33.050 align:middle line:84%
I have to say, it grows a
little confusing at times,

00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:33.720 align:middle line:90%
because of what occurred.

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:35.344 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We'll skip
the confusing part

00:35:35.344 --> 00:35:37.240 align:middle line:84%
and get to the image
of what was produced.

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: So what was produced
was, I mean, for Tony Peratt,

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.550 align:middle line:90%
he had no doubt.

00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:48.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, he said to
me, Dave, my work

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:52.740 align:middle line:84%
has already confirmed
that you are correct.

00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And now, I'm out
chronicling the rock art.

00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And it is substantiating
how fully you

00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:03.410 align:middle line:84%
are correct in what
you had reconstructed.

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And he told me something
that I had never known.

00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And it had to do with an
image called the stickman.

00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:14.210 align:middle line:84%
And people who followed
our work at all,

00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:19.376 align:middle line:84%
they know there is carved on
a rock all over the world,

00:36:19.376 --> 00:36:20.750 align:middle line:84%
there are these
stickmen figures.

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:22.250 align:middle line:84%
They look like
they're just standing

00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:26.010 align:middle line:84%
like this and their legs like
this with two dots between.

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:27.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
under their arms.

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.500 align:middle line:10%
>>TALBOTT: Yeah,
under their arms.

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:32.390 align:middle line:10%
And he explained to me
what that image was.

00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:35.980 align:middle line:10%
And I said, I never
dreamt of what that was.

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:37.930 align:middle line:10%
I knew it was important,
but I couldn't fit it

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:39.870 align:middle line:10%
into the planetary explanation.

00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:42.140 align:middle line:84%
It's something actually
quite close to Earth.

00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:45.970 align:middle line:84%
But the amazing thing is
that he made clear to me

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:52.040 align:middle line:84%
that that stickman image is the
collapsed form of the Kayenta

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:53.570 align:middle line:90%
form.

00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:57.180 align:middle line:84%
The ladder of heaven with
these various toruses,

00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:59.870 align:middle line:84%
in the most violent
phase of that

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:02.200 align:middle line:84%
evolving electric
discharge form,

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:04.820 align:middle line:90%
collapses into the stickman.

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:08.039 align:middle line:84%
And even secondary forms
of stickmen, they get

00:37:08.039 --> 00:37:08.830 align:middle line:90%
formed out of this.

00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:10.980 align:middle line:90%
So it's very close to the Earth.

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:12.910 align:middle line:90%
It's almost like a super aurora.

00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:14.390 align:middle line:90%
And that's what he called it.

00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:16.140 align:middle line:84%
It would be higher
than our aurora.

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:20.280 align:middle line:84%
But in the dynamic interaction
between the Earth and planets

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:24.810 align:middle line:84%
close to the Earth, there is
this spectacular stickman form

00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:27.664 align:middle line:90%
all over the Earth.

00:37:27.664 --> 00:37:29.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
the ancients were seeing

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:31.000 align:middle line:90%
with their external vision.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.085 align:middle line:90%
This wasn't an internal vision.

00:37:33.085 --> 00:37:35.290 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: It clearly was
not an internal thing,

00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:37.700 align:middle line:84%
because field of view
is absolutely essential.

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:41.830 align:middle line:84%
He showed that
where that was, they

00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:45.464 align:middle line:84%
were working with blocks to the
synchrotron radiation, which

00:37:45.464 --> 00:37:46.130 align:middle line:90%
would be deadly.

00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:48.930 align:middle line:84%
You could be out in the
open in this intense phase,

00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:49.980 align:middle line:90%
and you'd die.

00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:51.530 align:middle line:90%
The radiation would kill you.

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:54.200 align:middle line:90%
And it was obviously happening.

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:57.440 align:middle line:84%
But there was this
incredible obsession

00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:59.440 align:middle line:84%
with recording
the evolving form.

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:01.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, what was on their
minds, causing them

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:03.860 align:middle line:90%
to do this with such dangers?

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:06.530 align:middle line:84%
But they would do
it behind shields.

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And he could show that the
shielding was absolutely

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:11.384 align:middle line:90%
essential to the field of view.

00:38:11.384 --> 00:38:13.800 align:middle line:84%
So he could work from the field
of view, to the shielding,

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:17.259 align:middle line:84%
to the form carved on the
stone, and it was there.

00:38:17.259 --> 00:38:18.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
was this phenomena

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:23.960 align:middle line:84%
producing functionally in
the sky, in the cosmos?

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:29.780 align:middle line:84%
The collapsing of these toroids
into this effective stickman?

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:31.130 align:middle line:90%
What did that mean to us?

00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:32.160 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Oh, What
did it mean to us?

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:32.868 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Uh-huh.

00:38:32.868 --> 00:38:35.970 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh, to our atmosphere.

00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:38.770 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: It's very
late in the evolution

00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:42.110 align:middle line:90%
of this planetary configuration.

00:38:42.110 --> 00:38:44.100 align:middle line:84%
You could call it
the last phase.

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:47.050 align:middle line:84%
You could call it the
phase out of which

00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:52.990 align:middle line:84%
a great deal of prehistoric
turmoil occurred

00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:56.310 align:middle line:84%
and a great deal of
wandering forms in the sky.

00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:57.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, see, we didn't
talk about what

00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:00.850 align:middle line:84%
happened to the
forms in the sky when

00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:05.550 align:middle line:84%
the pristine imagery of the
polar configuration broke down.

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:08.100 align:middle line:90%
But that's a phase of wandering.

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:10.580 align:middle line:84%
And these bodies actually
wandered to different places.

00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So everything was
kind of knocked off-kilter.

00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:14.380 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Yeah,
everything was off-kilter.

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And what was seen only in
the Northern Hemisphere,

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:23.120 align:middle line:84%
because it was aligned to
the polar axis of the Earth

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:25.480 align:middle line:84%
and centered on the
celestial pole from Earth,

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:26.950 align:middle line:84%
people in the
Southern Hemisphere

00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:30.720 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't see that part
around the celestial pole.

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:35.290 align:middle line:84%
But when you break down
that configuration,

00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:36.790 align:middle line:84%
and these bodies
have wandered off,

00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:38.206 align:middle line:84%
this is the wandering
of the gods.

00:39:38.206 --> 00:39:39.920 align:middle line:84%
You know how Isis,
when she wanders,

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:42.170 align:middle line:84%
and your wildly disheveled
hair, and so on,

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:43.530 align:middle line:90%
and ends up in the desert.

00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:46.060 align:middle line:84%
These are kind of
localized symbols

00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:51.030 align:middle line:84%
of this desert in the sky,
this chaos in the sky that

00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:51.530 align:middle line:90%
had ensued.

00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:53.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The world
had lost its bearings.

00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:55.300 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Yeah, the world
had lost its bearings would

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:57.230 align:middle line:90%
be a good phrase for that.

00:39:57.230 --> 00:40:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And then the forms
are being seen then

00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:01.720 align:middle line:90%
in the Southern Hemisphere.

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:08.330 align:middle line:84%
Now imagine that you are an
occupant of Easter Island.

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:11.120 align:middle line:90%
And you have a northern horizon.

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:15.109 align:middle line:84%
You've not been witness to
much of the activity that

00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:16.150 align:middle line:90%
was going on in the pole.

00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:middle line:84%
But what is occurring is these
spectacular forms are emerging.

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:22.050 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like up
out of the ocean.

00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the
eye mask formed and the--

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:28.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us
about the eye mask.

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:30.180 align:middle line:90%
I really like this one as well.

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: OK, now,
so here I am talking,

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:35.300 align:middle line:84%
trying to use
gesture to describe

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:36.670 align:middle line:90%
what something looked like.

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:39.670 align:middle line:84%
But you have a stack of
toruses along a central spine.

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And at the base, you have,
just imagine an eye mask form.

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:48.210 align:middle line:90%
And it is a toroidal form.

00:40:48.210 --> 00:40:51.860 align:middle line:84%
It's like a donut, and you're
looking into the donut.

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:55.830 align:middle line:84%
So when you're looking at a
certain angle in relationship

00:40:55.830 --> 00:41:00.840 align:middle line:84%
to that hollow interior, you
get the appearance of a hollow.

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:02.865 align:middle line:84%
So that was the--
see this is, you're

00:41:02.865 --> 00:41:05.240 align:middle line:84%
looking into an inner tube,
but it's something like that.

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:08.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And a lot of this
is depicted around the planet.

00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:11.560 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: It's one of the most
common symbols in the world.

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And this reconstruction
simply connects it

00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:17.730 align:middle line:90%
to the ladder of heaven.

00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And, if you look at the eye
mask forms in Easter Island,

00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:23.770 align:middle line:84%
they have a kind of an
aquatic nuance to them.

00:41:23.770 --> 00:41:26.360 align:middle line:84%
Because they were
imagining these things

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:28.340 align:middle line:90%
rising up into the sky.

00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:30.646 align:middle line:84%
Whereas things they hadn't
seen before but rising up

00:41:30.646 --> 00:41:31.420 align:middle line:90%
out of the water.

00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:36.400 align:middle line:84%
You get this aquatic
nuance to their rock art.

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:39.860 align:middle line:84%
But in the Southern
Hemisphere, these forms

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:41.310 align:middle line:90%
were clearly recorded.

00:41:41.310 --> 00:41:45.240 align:middle line:84%
You'll see them in Southern
Africa and elsewhere.

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:50.270 align:middle line:84%
So that is a story
of what happened

00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:51.230 align:middle line:90%
to the chain of arrows.

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:53.090 align:middle line:84%
It became the ladder
of the sky, and it

00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:58.560 align:middle line:84%
collapsed into the stickman
form, which becomes then

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:02.770 align:middle line:84%
a fundamental validation
of the plasma discharge

00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:05.420 align:middle line:84%
interpretation of this highly
energetic electrical activity.

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there must have
been a big blast of radiation.

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:08.796 align:middle line:90%
>>TALBOTT: Yeah, yeah.

00:42:08.796 --> 00:42:12.240 align:middle line:84%
Synchrotron radiation is the
most intense form of radiation.

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:14.820 align:middle line:84%
It's actually occurring along
the whole electromagnetic

00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:16.990 align:middle line:84%
spectrum, up to gamma
rays, and so on.

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:19.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But at this time, when
this would have been recorded,

00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:22.220 align:middle line:84%
this kind of burst of
energy would have done what

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:23.580 align:middle line:90%
to the life forms here?

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:26.670 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Well, it probably
destroyed a great deal of life

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:27.620 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:29.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I would just think
that would be definite.

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:31.616 align:middle line:90%
Some would find shelter.

00:42:31.616 --> 00:42:32.740 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there's this issue.

00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:36.332 align:middle line:84%
Why do people take shelter
in caves and dolmans?

00:42:36.332 --> 00:42:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For long
periods of time?

00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:40.070 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Yeah, apparently,
for long periods of time.

00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:41.240 align:middle line:90%
And what did that mean?

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:42.250 align:middle line:90%
Why was that?

00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:46.390 align:middle line:84%
There was, in connection with
this, two primary perils--

00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:48.550 align:middle line:84%
falling debris--
I mean, remember,

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:52.470 align:middle line:84%
these planets were discharging
profoundly and electrically.

00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:55.502 align:middle line:84%
So surfaces of planets like
Mars were being excavated.

00:42:55.502 --> 00:42:57.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can see that
the northern hemisphere

00:42:57.460 --> 00:43:01.110 align:middle line:84%
of Mars, the crust is not
a distortion of the planet.

00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:05.210 align:middle line:84%
The crust was actually
excavated six miles deep.

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And that material, that
rocky material, a lot of it

00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:12.290 align:middle line:84%
fell on Earth, which is one of
the reasons why scientists are

00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:18.140 align:middle line:84%
increasingly identifying
Martian atmosphere and Martian

00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:19.140 align:middle line:90%
meteorites.

00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:21.080 align:middle line:90%
They say, meteorites from Mars.

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:24.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, the ancients said
meteorites came from Mars.

00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:27.450 align:middle line:84%
That study has been
really quite thorough.

00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:30.280 align:middle line:84%
I should cite, if anybody's
interested in following

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:33.580 align:middle line:84%
meteorites from Mars-- and
what an interesting thought

00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:36.850 align:middle line:84%
that a planet, Mars, actually
could be the source of so much

00:43:36.850 --> 00:43:39.860 align:middle line:84%
meteoric material-- but
his name is F. Cochran.

00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:41.965 align:middle line:84%
And he read my book, "The
Saturn Myth" in 1980,

00:43:41.965 --> 00:43:43.560 align:middle line:90%
and we became partners.

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:47.350 align:middle line:84%
So I have collaborators in
one direction and another.

00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:52.730 align:middle line:84%
But F. Cochran really documented
well the Martian origin

00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:53.980 align:middle line:90%
of meteorites.

00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:55.885 align:middle line:84%
It's just an instance
of a perfect fit.

00:43:55.885 --> 00:43:58.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and
interestingly, in somewhat more

00:43:58.010 --> 00:44:00.950 align:middle line:84%
modern history, the
Babylonians were obsessively

00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:03.230 align:middle line:90%
speaking about this danger.

00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:05.460 align:middle line:84%
And this was depicted
a lot in their--

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:07.490 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Oh, no
question about it.

00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And Babylonian
texts, well, along

00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:16.660 align:middle line:84%
with the Egyptian sources,
are amongst the most complete

00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:19.970 align:middle line:84%
references that one
would want to explore

00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:21.590 align:middle line:90%
on many of these issues.

00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:25.840 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to the stickman,
and so on, that's so global.

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's so tied in with what
was going on with rock art,

00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:31.720 align:middle line:84%
and tied in with
Tony Peratt's work,

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:36.380 align:middle line:90%
that it stands on its own.

00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:38.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about another great icon

00:44:38.590 --> 00:44:43.090 align:middle line:84%
in history, Horus,
which was originally

00:44:43.090 --> 00:44:45.309 align:middle line:90%
considered a cosmic power.

00:44:45.309 --> 00:44:46.850 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
this a little bit?

00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:55.500 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Well, the figure
of Horus in Egyptian myth

00:44:55.500 --> 00:45:00.990 align:middle line:84%
has so many different roles to
play in this reconstruction.

00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:05.120 align:middle line:84%
Because Horus, of course,
is the son of Isis.

00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And the story of the
impregnation of Isis,

00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:11.890 align:middle line:84%
and the wandering of
Isis, and then the birth

00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:16.680 align:middle line:84%
of Horus in the papyrus
swamp, all these episodes

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:19.110 align:middle line:84%
are actually part of
the reconstruction

00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:21.650 align:middle line:84%
that I've presented
rather fully.

00:45:21.650 --> 00:45:24.935 align:middle line:84%
And you see these things
occurring in the sky.

00:45:24.935 --> 00:45:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And this has nothing to do with
stickmen or anything like that.

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:32.340 align:middle line:84%
So this is actually back in the
phase of archetypal mythology

00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:36.160 align:middle line:84%
reflecting the configuration
of planets close to the Earth.

00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And Mars was the prototype
of the Warrior-Hero.

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:46.800 align:middle line:84%
And for the Egyptians, Horus
was the preeminent instance

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:48.070 align:middle line:90%
of the Warrior-Heroes.

00:45:48.070 --> 00:45:51.770 align:middle line:84%
So everything that they
thought about the great warrior

00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:56.460 align:middle line:84%
in antiquity in
Egypt is encapsulated

00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:59.919 align:middle line:84%
in the story of Horus, and
the white crown of Horus,

00:45:59.919 --> 00:46:00.960 align:middle line:90%
and so many other things.

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:02.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And Horus
of the Horizon.

00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:08.410 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Yeah, well, they
translate Akhet as horizon.

00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:11.540 align:middle line:84%
But it literally does
not mean horizon.

00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:14.210 align:middle line:90%
And it's a perfect example.

00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:17.065 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what does
horizon mean in that parlance?

00:46:17.065 --> 00:46:19.190 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: It means the
mountain of fire and light.

00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:21.564 align:middle line:84%
And it's the great mountain
that I've been talking about.

00:46:21.564 --> 00:46:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And it has twin peaks,
so the twin peaks

00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:25.820 align:middle line:84%
is the cosmic mountain
or the crescent

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:27.320 align:middle line:90%
that we were talking about.

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:29.920 align:middle line:90%
All this is all interconnected.

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And Horus of the Harmachis,
or [EGYPTIAN] in Egyptian,

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:44.060 align:middle line:84%
is intimately associated
with these twin peaks that

00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:48.080 align:middle line:84%
are called by translators the
horizon, because they don't

00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:50.520 align:middle line:90%
have anything else to point to.

00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:52.930 align:middle line:84%
This is the fatal
flaw in attempting

00:46:52.930 --> 00:46:57.840 align:middle line:84%
to interpret ancient symbolism
through things occurring today.

00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:00.339 align:middle line:84%
Nothing is occurring
today like that.

00:47:00.339 --> 00:47:00.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And I've always wondered-- this
might be totally off-topic--

00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:06.750 align:middle line:84%
if horizon might not have
meant something else, which

00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:09.530 align:middle line:84%
is essentially almost
like an event horizon,

00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:12.070 align:middle line:84%
if you're listening to
Nassim Harramein, or someone,

00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:14.310 align:middle line:84%
coming from one
field into another.

00:47:14.310 --> 00:47:16.880 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: That twin
peak image in Egypt,

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:18.870 align:middle line:90%
it is just so present.

00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:20.630 align:middle line:84%
But if it's the
crescent, it's actually

00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:22.540 align:middle line:90%
an adaptation of that crescent.

00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:24.360 align:middle line:90%
Then that means what?

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:26.400 align:middle line:84%
It means that, well,
if it's the crescent,

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:29.620 align:middle line:84%
it was rotating in the sky with
the cycle of day and night.

00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:31.770 align:middle line:84%
So it was one of
those symbolic forms

00:47:31.770 --> 00:47:34.440 align:middle line:84%
that I zeroed in on,
because I had realized

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:35.969 align:middle line:90%
the crescent was up there.

00:47:35.969 --> 00:47:37.760 align:middle line:84%
OK, that's the horns
of the bull of heaven,

00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:39.410 align:middle line:84%
but it was also
called the twin peaks.

00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:40.790 align:middle line:90%
Well, now wait a minute.

00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:44.200 align:middle line:84%
If the crescent revolved with
the cycle of day and night,

00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:47.090 align:middle line:84%
then the twin peaks
weren't earthbound at all.

00:47:47.090 --> 00:47:49.080 align:middle line:84%
They were revolving
up there in the sky.

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And we'd have to
see them upside down

00:47:52.570 --> 00:47:56.650 align:middle line:84%
in the dimming of the cycle,
because the sun's up there.

00:47:56.650 --> 00:47:58.470 align:middle line:90%
And that's exactly so.

00:47:58.470 --> 00:48:01.370 align:middle line:84%
The inverted peaks mean
the phase of dimming.

00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And they mean absolutely nothing
in conventional approaches

00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:10.440 align:middle line:90%
to Egyptian symbolism.

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:11.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:15.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, OK, so we're going to go
through some more symbolism.

00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:17.390 align:middle line:84%
The divine thunderbolt,
what is the myth

00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:19.800 align:middle line:90%
behind the divine thunderbolt?

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:25.620 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Well, the thunderbolt
is the preferred weapon

00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:27.430 align:middle line:90%
of the gods.

00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:32.460 align:middle line:84%
But, see, I had
reached a conclusion

00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:37.085 align:middle line:84%
that all of these
warrior figures

00:48:37.085 --> 00:48:43.890 align:middle line:84%
are so often identified
with their weapon.

00:48:43.890 --> 00:48:46.930 align:middle line:84%
They are a form of
themselves of their weapon,

00:48:46.930 --> 00:48:49.850 align:middle line:90%
like the hammer of Thor.

00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, the hammer is
inseparable from Thor himself.

00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:59.220 align:middle line:84%
The warrior Mars, amongst
the Latins, the warrior Aries

00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:04.240 align:middle line:84%
amongst the Greeks, was
inseparable from his weapon.

00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:06.120 align:middle line:90%
He was his weapon.

00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:07.800 align:middle line:90%
Now, what does that mean?

00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:12.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, the weapon
of Mars was a form

00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:15.480 align:middle line:84%
in the sky, inseparable
from the appearance

00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:17.750 align:middle line:90%
of that sphere of Mars.

00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:21.610 align:middle line:84%
And that includes then the polar
column coming down to Earth.

00:49:21.610 --> 00:49:23.610 align:middle line:84%
OK, this is the
world mountain theme,

00:49:23.610 --> 00:49:30.270 align:middle line:84%
and it is identified
as the sword of Shiva

00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:32.970 align:middle line:90%
and other warrior gods.

00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And that weapon is so clearly
and completely identified

00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:40.925 align:middle line:90%
with the Warrior-Hero.

00:49:40.925 --> 00:49:45.190 align:middle line:84%
When I got to the thunderbolt,
I thought, well, OK,

00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:47.450 align:middle line:84%
what's the connection
of that thunderbolt

00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:49.450 align:middle line:90%
to the Warrior-Hero?

00:49:49.450 --> 00:49:52.720 align:middle line:84%
Because it wasn't
self-evidently clear to me,

00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:56.990 align:middle line:84%
though it was a verified
plasma discharge.

00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:59.360 align:middle line:84%
The more I looked
at it, I could see--

00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:02.100 align:middle line:84%
it's a little hard to discuss
this without an image in front

00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:07.850 align:middle line:84%
of me-- but there actually is a
core to the cosmic thunderbolt.

00:50:07.850 --> 00:50:15.070 align:middle line:84%
You look at the vajra or the
dorje, the kongo in Japanese,

00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:19.560 align:middle line:84%
the cosmic thunderbolt, it is
an electric discharge form.

00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:21.685 align:middle line:90%
And it is around the planet.

00:50:21.685 --> 00:50:24.990 align:middle line:90%
It's extended out and in.

00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:27.090 align:middle line:84%
The interpretation
I would offer now,

00:50:27.090 --> 00:50:29.130 align:middle line:84%
it's extended out
from the planet Mars.

00:50:29.130 --> 00:50:34.860 align:middle line:84%
So its identification with
Mars is, I believe, complete.

00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And so when I saw that
Aries, the planet Mars,

00:50:40.810 --> 00:50:44.330 align:middle line:84%
appeared in the sky as
the cosmic thunderbolt,

00:50:44.330 --> 00:50:46.980 align:middle line:90%
it made perfect sense.

00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And you can trace
now the relationship

00:50:50.010 --> 00:50:53.600 align:middle line:84%
between the cosmic thunderbolt
and the Warrior-Hero

00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:56.180 align:middle line:90%
from one culture to another.

00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:57.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it was
seen as a weapon.

00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:02.050 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: It was the hero and
his weapon were inseparable.

00:51:02.050 --> 00:51:04.860 align:middle line:90%
So I had made this statement.

00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:10.180 align:middle line:84%
I stated it aloud and publicly,
the hero is his weapon,

00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:11.830 align:middle line:84%
but whatever the
weapon is called,

00:51:11.830 --> 00:51:14.770 align:middle line:84%
whether it's an arrow,
or a sword, or a spear--

00:51:14.770 --> 00:51:16.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Zeus, whose
spear is lightning.

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:19.410 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Yes, yes,
Whatever it is called,

00:51:19.410 --> 00:51:24.070 align:middle line:84%
it is actually the
thunderbolt. The thunderbolt

00:51:24.070 --> 00:51:25.120 align:middle line:90%
is the prototype.

00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:27.209 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But a
thunderbolt equals weapon.

00:51:27.209 --> 00:51:28.250 align:middle line:90%
>>TALBOTT: Yeah, exactly.

00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:33.400 align:middle line:10%
It is the underlying
identity of all

00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:36.220 align:middle line:10%
of the great warriors' weapons.

00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:41.376 align:middle line:10%
Now, when I announced
that finding

00:51:41.376 --> 00:51:42.750 align:middle line:10%
that all of these
heroes' weapons

00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:44.291 align:middle line:10%
were the cosmic
thunderbolt-- there's

00:51:44.291 --> 00:51:48.860 align:middle line:10%
variations in the
morphology-- I thought,

00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:51.340 align:middle line:10%
actually, I was the
only one on Earth

00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:53.940 align:middle line:10%
who would've ever even
dreamt of such a thing.

00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:56.420 align:middle line:84%
But then I began to find
that, actually, this

00:51:56.420 --> 00:51:59.370 align:middle line:90%
has been studied.

00:51:59.370 --> 00:52:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And there's a really
interesting kind

00:52:02.010 --> 00:52:09.240 align:middle line:84%
of halfway esoteric philosopher
in French thought, Rene Guenon,

00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:11.300 align:middle line:84%
"King of the World," and
other books he wrote.

00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:16.030 align:middle line:90%


00:52:16.030 --> 00:52:18.460 align:middle line:84%
Under a little
section that he has

00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:20.640 align:middle line:84%
in one of his books
on the thunderbolt,

00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:24.410 align:middle line:84%
his conclusion was that every
weapon of the Warrior-Hero

00:52:24.410 --> 00:52:29.190 align:middle line:84%
was, in its origins,
the thunderbolt.

00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:31.830 align:middle line:84%
So through a back door, I
mean, actually, this was

00:52:31.830 --> 00:52:33.500 align:middle line:90%
before I ever started my work.

00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:35.880 align:middle line:90%
But it had already been stated.

00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:38.930 align:middle line:84%
But by following a reasoning
from ancient evidence

00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:42.590 align:middle line:84%
concluding that the cosmic
thunderbolt was actually

00:52:42.590 --> 00:52:48.060 align:middle line:84%
the essential identity of
the Warrior-Hero, that here,

00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:50.100 align:middle line:84%
this relationship to
the cosmic thunderbolt

00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:54.000 align:middle line:84%
has been acknowledged,
actually, for decades.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:54.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:52:54.570 --> 00:52:56.403 align:middle line:84%
And now, let's take it
into practical terms.

00:52:56.403 --> 00:52:59.590 align:middle line:90%


00:52:59.590 --> 00:53:03.730 align:middle line:84%
What must have the environment
been like at this time when

00:53:03.730 --> 00:53:07.490 align:middle line:84%
everyone was depicting
the Warrior-Hero

00:53:07.490 --> 00:53:08.390 align:middle line:90%
with his thunderbolt?

00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:11.280 align:middle line:84%
What was going on
electrically on this planet,

00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:12.770 align:middle line:84%
that this would
need to be captured

00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:14.560 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again?

00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:16.320 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Well,
I think that his

00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:20.310 align:middle line:84%
would have been the phase of
greatest turmoil on Earth.

00:53:20.310 --> 00:53:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we would
have seen massive amounts

00:53:22.350 --> 00:53:23.345 align:middle line:90%
of electrical fire.

00:53:23.345 --> 00:53:27.770 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: I would assume,
and it's possible that certain

00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:33.610 align:middle line:84%
things that geologists ascribed
to earlier eons in terms

00:53:33.610 --> 00:53:36.940 align:middle line:84%
of scarring on
surfaces of the Earth,

00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:40.400 align:middle line:84%
it's possible actually
that there was devastating

00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:41.665 align:middle line:90%
electrical activity on Earth--

00:53:41.665 --> 00:53:43.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I'm asking.

00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:47.490 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: --to the point
that entire regional cultures

00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:49.170 align:middle line:90%
were completely eliminated.

00:53:49.170 --> 00:53:52.360 align:middle line:84%
I tend to think
that that's like it.

00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:54.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It would
have to be, if it's

00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:57.250 align:middle line:84%
so prominent in the
mythology, in the pictographs,

00:53:57.250 --> 00:53:57.810 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:53:57.810 --> 00:53:59.518 align:middle line:84%
It would have to be
something seriously--

00:53:59.518 --> 00:54:02.100 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Well, certainly,
the most frightful experience

00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:03.390 align:middle line:90%
of humanity ever.

00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:07.945 align:middle line:84%
And there are episodes of
awe and episodes of terror.

00:54:07.945 --> 00:54:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Electrical
activity could have just

00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:11.630 align:middle line:90%
been frying whole regions.

00:54:11.630 --> 00:54:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: I think
probably that did occur.

00:54:14.970 --> 00:54:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And if you want an
illustration of how devastating

00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:23.480 align:middle line:84%
that electrical activity
could be on a planet,

00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:27.730 align:middle line:84%
the ideal reference for
this is the planet Mars.

00:54:27.730 --> 00:54:32.040 align:middle line:84%
Because if people
would pose the question

00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:33.790 align:middle line:84%
and will look at
what electricity

00:54:33.790 --> 00:54:38.330 align:middle line:84%
can do to a surface, and then
they look at the planet Mars,

00:54:38.330 --> 00:54:41.160 align:middle line:84%
they will ultimately
conclude-- this

00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:43.600 align:middle line:84%
takes a serious investigation
as to how things

00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:47.160 align:middle line:84%
are being explained and how well
the explanations are working.

00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:49.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're not
working at all,

00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:52.550 align:middle line:84%
and electrical discharge
will explain everything

00:54:52.550 --> 00:54:54.450 align:middle line:84%
that we observe on
the planet Mars.

00:54:54.450 --> 00:54:56.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, in this
reconstruction, the reason

00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:58.930 align:middle line:84%
I took an interest in
Mars was that there

00:54:58.930 --> 00:55:00.700 align:middle line:84%
were aspects of this
reconstruction that

00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:02.700 align:middle line:84%
were suggesting, I
mean, the hero who

00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:04.740 align:middle line:90%
wears this conical crown.

00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And it was suggesting that
this electrical activity

00:55:08.290 --> 00:55:12.220 align:middle line:84%
between planets, this white
crown was their mother goddess,

00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:16.920 align:middle line:84%
this electrical activity had to
show up on the surface of Mars.

00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:20.040 align:middle line:84%
The head of the warrior
is the planet Mars.

00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And this reconstruction
and that crown going up

00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:28.590 align:middle line:84%
toward the mother goddess, the
planet Venus, that would have

00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:34.280 align:middle line:84%
had to show up as a huge
hemispheric dichotomy on Mars.

00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:35.820 align:middle line:90%
So I started looking.

00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:39.850 align:middle line:84%
Now the result of
that was my DVD.

00:55:39.850 --> 00:55:41.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was a
full documentary,

00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:44.450 align:middle line:84%
"The Lightning
Scarred Planet Mars."

00:55:44.450 --> 00:55:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And that involves
much more evidence

00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:49.040 align:middle line:84%
than I could possibly
summarize here.

00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:51.860 align:middle line:84%
But there are no
surface features of Mars

00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:54.840 align:middle line:84%
that really stand
out as anything

00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:56.870 align:middle line:84%
other than electric
discharge phenomena.

00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:59.560 align:middle line:84%
You could take the great
mound of Mount Olympus.

00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:03.085 align:middle line:84%
You could take the huge trench
of Valles Marineris, all

00:56:03.085 --> 00:56:05.710 align:middle line:84%
of those sinuous reels
cut across the surface,

00:56:05.710 --> 00:56:08.600 align:middle line:84%
the unique cratering
patterns, they just

00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:10.820 align:middle line:84%
will not be explained
by things that we

00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:13.300 align:middle line:90%
think must have been going on.

00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And so, most of them just are
left hanging as a mystery.

00:56:16.300 --> 00:56:21.810 align:middle line:84%
Do you know that even today,
the most distinguished formation

00:56:21.810 --> 00:56:24.830 align:middle line:84%
on Mars is this Valles
Marineris, which

00:56:24.830 --> 00:56:28.390 align:middle line:84%
would have reached from like
San Francisco to New York.

00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:32.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it is this
incredible trench,

00:56:32.190 --> 00:56:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And, just an aside,
it's the scar

00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:36.860 align:middle line:90%
on the face of the Warrior-Hero.

00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:39.200 align:middle line:90%
He is Scarface.

00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:41.880 align:middle line:84%
It's the defining scar
by which he's recognized.

00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:44.950 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's the
Valles Marineris.

00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:49.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, well, it must have
been cut by water, they say.

00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:53.000 align:middle line:84%
But then they look, and they
say, now, wait a minute.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.470 align:middle line:10%
Something on this scale
being cut from water,

00:56:55.470 --> 00:57:00.550 align:middle line:10%
you would see evidence of
the outflow everywhere.

00:57:00.550 --> 00:57:02.560 align:middle line:84%
There's no evidence
of outflow at all.

00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:05.260 align:middle line:84%
But what there is evidence
of, across the entire surface

00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:11.750 align:middle line:84%
of Mars, is rubble-- sharply
shattered rubble across

00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:15.800 align:middle line:84%
the entire-- you cannot
find a portion of Mars--

00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:18.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So something violent
would create that, yes.

00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:20.600 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Oh, man,
the surface of Mars

00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:25.530 align:middle line:84%
had to have been sculpted
by this intensely

00:57:25.530 --> 00:57:29.500 align:middle line:84%
electrical activity between
Mars and something else.

00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:31.470 align:middle line:90%
And it was a planet.

00:57:31.470 --> 00:57:33.150 align:middle line:84%
This electrical
activity isn't going

00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:35.670 align:middle line:84%
to happen to Mars just
because it's sitting there.

00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:37.120 align:middle line:84%
It's going to take
some dynamic--

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:39.078 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's relating
to something else, yes.

00:57:39.078 --> 00:57:42.400 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Yeah, and so there's
a reason for looking clearly

00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:47.500 align:middle line:84%
at the worldwide myths of
the Warrior-Hero in terms of,

00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:51.600 align:middle line:84%
well, was that
electrical activity?

00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And do we see its
indication on planets?

00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:56.295 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, going
back to Tony Peratt.

00:57:56.295 --> 00:57:56.920 align:middle line:90%
>>TALBOTT: Yes.

00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:58.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I have a note here.

00:57:58.230 --> 00:58:01.370 align:middle line:84%
At Los Alamos, he
discovered these stick forms

00:58:01.370 --> 00:58:02.570 align:middle line:90%
that were recording events.

00:58:02.570 --> 00:58:05.920 align:middle line:84%
He said that
essentially, to us, if we

00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:07.420 align:middle line:84%
can see the Northern
Lights, that

00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:09.830 align:middle line:84%
might be the most bold
expression of electricity.

00:58:09.830 --> 00:58:12.600 align:middle line:84%
He said these would
be 1,000 times more

00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:14.280 align:middle line:84%
energetic than
anything we would see,

00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:16.210 align:middle line:90%
such as the Northern Lights.

00:58:16.210 --> 00:58:18.730 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Or, quite
frankly, 100,000 times more.

00:58:18.730 --> 00:58:20.591 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he himself
would say that.

00:58:20.591 --> 00:58:21.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So-- yeah, go ahead.

00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Well, that
then gets us again

00:58:24.250 --> 00:58:27.950 align:middle line:84%
to the impact on
human imagination,

00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:31.140 align:middle line:84%
and the role of fear,
and why they were

00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:33.240 align:middle line:90%
carving these images on stone.

00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:36.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, to me, it's still
a little enigmatic

00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:40.710 align:middle line:84%
why there was this
impulse, this obsession

00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:43.120 align:middle line:90%
to record these images on stone.

00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:45.670 align:middle line:84%
But I suspect it was
in the neighborhood

00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:46.910 align:middle line:90%
of self-protection.

00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:51.870 align:middle line:84%
I expect because this form
was evolving in the sky,

00:58:51.870 --> 00:58:56.990 align:middle line:84%
and it was very loud, and very
noisy, and it was very fearful,

00:58:56.990 --> 00:59:01.380 align:middle line:84%
I just suspect that there
was a sense of tracking,

00:59:01.380 --> 00:59:04.550 align:middle line:90%
of knowing what is happening.

00:59:04.550 --> 00:59:09.040 align:middle line:84%
What do we look for to
anticipate doomsday?

00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:11.690 align:middle line:84%
Because you look at all the
ancient calendar symbolism

00:59:11.690 --> 00:59:14.620 align:middle line:84%
and all the ways in which
magic and superstition

00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:17.490 align:middle line:84%
were used to anticipate
the return of doomsday.

00:59:17.490 --> 00:59:22.480 align:middle line:84%
So there is this active anxiety
on the part of the cultures.

00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:23.590 align:middle line:90%
How do we anticipate?

00:59:23.590 --> 00:59:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, all of
calendar symbolism, people

00:59:26.010 --> 00:59:28.590 align:middle line:84%
seem to not be
sufficiently aware of this,

00:59:28.590 --> 00:59:33.100 align:middle line:84%
but calendar symbolism
originated in a real need

00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:34.780 align:middle line:90%
to anticipate doomsday.

00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And they played
it out every year.

00:59:37.930 --> 00:59:41.660 align:middle line:84%
Every new year was a turn
of the full feel of time.

00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:44.214 align:middle line:84%
And, OK, the world just
came to an end, fireworks

00:59:44.214 --> 00:59:44.880 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And now a new world is
being born out of that.

00:59:48.570 --> 00:59:52.040 align:middle line:84%
So that's part of
this imaginative--

00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:55.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's in our
psyche of dream time, even.

00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:56.560 align:middle line:90%
>>TALBOTT: I believe so.

00:59:56.560 --> 01:00:00.950 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we didn't
free ourselves entirely

01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:06.002 align:middle line:84%
biologically, let's say, from
some encoded memory, however

01:00:06.002 --> 01:00:06.960 align:middle line:90%
that might [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:08.335 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
and why should we

01:00:08.335 --> 01:00:10.820 align:middle line:84%
assume those cycles
have finished?

01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:13.390 align:middle line:90%
That was a cycle.

01:00:13.390 --> 01:00:17.057 align:middle line:84%
And now we seem to be relatively
in a state of homeostasis

01:00:17.057 --> 01:00:17.640 align:middle line:90%
at the moment.

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:18.220 align:middle line:90%
>>TALBOTT: Yeah, quiet.

01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do we see
anything interesting

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:20.850 align:middle line:90%
happening in the cosmos?

01:00:20.850 --> 01:00:22.516 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Well, I
don't I think that we

01:00:22.516 --> 01:00:26.455 align:middle line:84%
see anything that would suggest
a return of these earlier

01:00:26.455 --> 01:00:28.010 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:31.270 align:middle line:84%
But we can never write
off the possibility

01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:36.130 align:middle line:84%
of the unexpected violent
turn to planetary instability.

01:00:36.130 --> 01:00:40.580 align:middle line:84%
But people are not
correct, I would say.

01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:44.620 align:middle line:84%
I'll see this in little
writings on forums, and so on.

01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:47.090 align:middle line:90%
But when is it going to return?

01:00:47.090 --> 01:00:50.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, there is nothing
in heaven or on Earth

01:00:50.190 --> 01:00:53.780 align:middle line:84%
that says that that prior
experience is going to return.

01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:56.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, why would we
want to even think

01:00:56.610 --> 01:00:57.980 align:middle line:90%
that it would return?

01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:00.670 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what's
around the bend cosmically.

01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:03.250 align:middle line:84%
The world is not the
entirely safe place.

01:01:03.250 --> 01:01:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Intruders coming in capable
of completely wiping out

01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:13.204 align:middle line:84%
civilization are not excluded by
scientific investigation, now.

01:01:13.204 --> 01:01:13.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And, as we're running
down on time here,

01:01:17.250 --> 01:01:20.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is so deeply
encoded in all of us,

01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:25.320 align:middle line:84%
not only the fear
of apocalyptic times

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:29.440 align:middle line:84%
but also the iconography
in our direct experience

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:32.670 align:middle line:84%
as electrical beings
with electrical circuitry

01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:35.440 align:middle line:84%
that allows us to even
access greater mind.

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:37.600 align:middle line:84%
All of that is through
electrical signals.

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:41.370 align:middle line:84%
So we're intricately
biologically

01:01:41.370 --> 01:01:42.905 align:middle line:90%
plugged in to this.

01:01:42.905 --> 01:01:44.280 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Well,
in recent years,

01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:48.360 align:middle line:84%
we've taken particular interest
in the electricity of life.

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:50.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, there is the
electricity of life

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:51.840 align:middle line:84%
which gets you
kind of concretely

01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:54.660 align:middle line:84%
into the nature of water,
and structured water,

01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:57.320 align:middle line:84%
and cellular behavior, and
the electrical activity

01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:00.010 align:middle line:84%
within cells, which is
really, at that scale,

01:02:00.010 --> 01:02:03.300 align:middle line:84%
it's a very powerful
electrical activity.

01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:07.050 align:middle line:84%
We have all of that
on the one hand.

01:02:07.050 --> 01:02:14.430 align:middle line:84%
But we have also a more esoteric
tradition that comes down,

01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:18.850 align:middle line:84%
and it sees a human
being in terms

01:02:18.850 --> 01:02:23.180 align:middle line:84%
of these archetypal images,
energy centers, and Kundalini

01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:24.840 align:middle line:90%
experience.

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And, well, what
is the connection

01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:30.780 align:middle line:84%
of that to that
primeval experience?

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:35.000 align:middle line:90%
And I would just go this far.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.700 align:middle line:84%
I use the phrase,
"the great analogy."

01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:40.960 align:middle line:84%
That formation in
the sky, retreat back

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:43.990 align:middle line:84%
to that cosmic
wheel, for example.

01:02:43.990 --> 01:02:47.860 align:middle line:84%
That cosmic wheel had
within it the seeds

01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:50.080 align:middle line:84%
of the entire
myth-making epoch-- what

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:52.330 align:middle line:84%
happens to the hero, what
happens to the goddess, what

01:02:52.330 --> 01:02:57.120 align:middle line:84%
happens to the overarching
Saturnian figure, the dying

01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:01.580 align:middle line:84%
god, the displaced, the
removed god, and so on.

01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:05.940 align:middle line:84%
All of these images
take you back

01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:10.440 align:middle line:84%
to a unified image of a
celebrated form, the wheel

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:12.200 align:middle line:90%
of life, the wheel of law.

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:13.230 align:middle line:90%
Well, why life?

01:03:13.230 --> 01:03:15.000 align:middle line:90%
Why law?

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.260 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, it was
the great analogy.

01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:20.940 align:middle line:84%
So whatever was needed
within a culture,

01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:25.620 align:middle line:84%
they had to find the analogy
in the inherited tradition.

01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:27.900 align:middle line:84%
Because it was
the truth speaking

01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:30.240 align:middle line:90%
to us across these generations.

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:32.230 align:middle line:90%
And you didn't trivialize it.

01:03:32.230 --> 01:03:33.470 align:middle line:90%
It's the truth.

01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:37.830 align:middle line:84%
So all of humanity was
looking for its guidance

01:03:37.830 --> 01:03:39.700 align:middle line:90%
from the great analogy.

01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:43.710 align:middle line:84%
So the lawgiver, he
had his archetypal form

01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:47.060 align:middle line:84%
in the Warrior-Hero
as judge and lawgiver.

01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And the queen of the kingdom,
or whatever, the queen

01:03:53.370 --> 01:03:58.190 align:middle line:84%
was the representation of
the mother goddess figure.

01:03:58.190 --> 01:04:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And everything in terms of
the structure of the city,

01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:06.410 align:middle line:84%
the structure of the town,
the structure of the temple,

01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:09.850 align:middle line:84%
the way we went to war,
the weapons we used in war,

01:04:09.850 --> 01:04:14.140 align:middle line:84%
our ideas about our enemies,
the fiends of chaos,

01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:19.190 align:middle line:84%
they all are finding their
analogs in formations,

01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:24.660 align:middle line:84%
both structured and chaotic,
in this primeval time.

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:28.820 align:middle line:84%
So that's the role
of the great analogy

01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:32.570 align:middle line:84%
in affecting all of humanity
for thousands of years.

01:04:32.570 --> 01:04:35.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, where did
humanity wander off

01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:38.585 align:middle line:84%
of that kind of
symbolic connection

01:04:38.585 --> 01:04:42.740 align:middle line:90%
into spiritual discernment?

01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:46.200 align:middle line:90%


01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:49.240 align:middle line:84%
There is an evolution
of human consciousness

01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:53.940 align:middle line:84%
toward spiritual discernment
that isn't dependent on myth.

01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:56.892 align:middle line:84%
So that's never, I
have to say this--

01:04:56.892 --> 01:04:58.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's another
overlay of consciousness

01:04:58.850 --> 01:05:02.190 align:middle line:84%
overall, that you have to
go into another realm there.

01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:04.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, here, I have
these notes here.

01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:07.810 align:middle line:84%
In the ancient test, the life
principles in Anima Mundi

01:05:07.810 --> 01:05:08.670 align:middle line:90%
are electricity.

01:05:08.670 --> 01:05:12.940 align:middle line:84%
They're the vivifiers under the
divine will of the architect.

01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:15.160 align:middle line:90%
>>TALBOTT: Yes.

01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:16.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Consciousness.

01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:17.130 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:05:17.130 --> 01:05:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: There's a
spiritual orientation

01:05:19.290 --> 01:05:23.650 align:middle line:84%
to which many people who
have preoccupied themselves

01:05:23.650 --> 01:05:27.100 align:middle line:84%
with the mythic
traditions, they found

01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:34.620 align:middle line:84%
particularly deep interest in
a spiritual vision of life.

01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, where did
the imagery of the yogi

01:05:40.070 --> 01:05:42.650 align:middle line:90%
come from, for example?

01:05:42.650 --> 01:05:47.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he emerges out of myth,
and he brings a consciousness

01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:49.390 align:middle line:90%
of something that is not myth.

01:05:49.390 --> 01:05:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And you could say the
same thing about Jesus.

01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:55.060 align:middle line:84%
Jesus was born into
a culture dominated

01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:58.930 align:middle line:84%
by ritual, and
sacrifice, and all manner

01:05:58.930 --> 01:06:01.325 align:middle line:90%
of primitive symbolism.

01:06:01.325 --> 01:06:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we
have to say there

01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:05.250 align:middle line:84%
is a grand conscious
overlay to all of this

01:06:05.250 --> 01:06:07.990 align:middle line:84%
that we can't even get
into in this discussion.

01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And I guess to
simplify it before we

01:06:09.950 --> 01:06:12.500 align:middle line:84%
wrap our discussion
up, everything

01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:15.080 align:middle line:84%
is dependent upon
this spark of life.

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:19.010 align:middle line:84%
Once our electrical
signals cease to fire,

01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:23.570 align:middle line:84%
we no longer exist in a physical
level in this dimension.

01:06:23.570 --> 01:06:26.266 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: I'll accept
that completely, yes.

01:06:26.266 --> 01:06:28.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we thank
you for your life's work,

01:06:28.530 --> 01:06:32.740 align:middle line:84%
bringing all of this imagery
together to see it makes sense.

01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:34.040 align:middle line:90%
Something happened.

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:35.160 align:middle line:90%
We remember it.

01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:36.180 align:middle line:90%
We fear it.

01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:38.480 align:middle line:90%
Our ancestors drew about it.

01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:39.820 align:middle line:90%
They talked about it.

01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:42.360 align:middle line:84%
Now the laboratories are
showing us exactly what

01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:43.510 align:middle line:90%
that phenomena was.

01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:44.510 align:middle line:90%
>>TALBOTT: This is true.

01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:48.140 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And it's just an
amazing convergence of science

01:06:48.140 --> 01:06:50.090 align:middle line:10%
and an ancient understanding.

01:06:50.090 --> 01:06:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And you're right at
the epicenter of that.

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:52.440 align:middle line:84%
>>TALBOTT: Well,
thank you very much.

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:53.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank
you so much, David.

01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:55.090 align:middle line:90%
>>TALBOTT: All right, bye now.

01:06:55.090 --> 01:06:55.804 align:middle line:90%
See you, now.

01:06:55.804 --> 01:06:58.220 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I hope you enjoyed
this journey into the heavens

01:06:58.220 --> 01:06:59.890 align:middle line:10%
of our ancestors and back.

01:06:59.890 --> 01:07:03.010 align:middle line:10%
You can tune into David's
work at thunderbolts.info.

01:07:03.010 --> 01:07:04.950 align:middle line:84%
It's a story that's
evolving by the day

01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:07.420 align:middle line:84%
as more scientists
step out of the closet

01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:10.740 align:middle line:84%
and share their astounding
discoveries under microscopes

01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:13.050 align:middle line:84%
and in the super
scopes of space.

01:07:13.050 --> 01:07:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
