00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.470 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: We're not alone.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:11.943 align:middle line:84%
There is life all
over the place.

00:00:11.943 --> 00:00:13.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: All over.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.379 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Potentially, every kind
of life form that you can think

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.070 align:middle line:90%
of and even you cannot think of.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.412 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So if you
want to make contact

00:00:20.412 --> 00:00:24.750 align:middle line:84%
to intelligent beings that
lives outside of this reality,

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.350 align:middle line:84%
you have to somehow compress
frequencies in a way

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.298 align:middle line:84%
that you can
directly access them.

00:00:30.298 --> 00:00:32.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are they more
ordered toward the notion

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.420 align:middle line:84%
that AI and technology is
superior to the human matrix?

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.230 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Oh, yes.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.190 align:middle line:90%
100%.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.590 align:middle line:84%
The level six
consciousness is basically

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.300 align:middle line:84%
the opposite of level
three consciousness,

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.240 align:middle line:84%
which is the space
outside of time and space.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: They gave so
many infos about what

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.370 align:middle line:84%
can be done when the machine,
so to speak, that we already

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.620 align:middle line:90%
have is so powerful.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And they gave examples
which are full of wonder

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.503 align:middle line:84%
that it's kind of hard
to even speak about.

00:01:00.503 --> 00:01:02.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so now
it's getting juicy.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.200 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, we're going to
dial in a little bit.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.410 align:middle line:90%


00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.780 align:middle line:10%
Audiences around the
world are continually

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.840 align:middle line:10%
fascinated with
extraterrestrial civilizations.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.960 align:middle line:84%
Toward satisfying that itch,
we have Tim with us today

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.290 align:middle line:84%
to discuss the nature of levels
of consciousness of various ET

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.060 align:middle line:90%
groups from his point of view.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.040 align:middle line:84%
More interestingly,
we're going to look

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.830 align:middle line:84%
at the nature of the
consciousness between them

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.110 align:middle line:84%
and the human species,
because to me, that's where

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.400 align:middle line:90%
it gets really interesting.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.970 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes,

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:31.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Welcome.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.100 align:middle line:84%
You've been in the Gaia studios
a lot, just not on this set

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.900 align:middle line:90%
with me.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:35.700 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: That's true.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.638 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:01:36.638 --> 00:01:38.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
wonderful to have you.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.900 align:middle line:84%
So I thought for this audience,
because some may have seen you

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.010 align:middle line:90%
and some may not--

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.230 align:middle line:84%
people kind of cruise
around Gaia here and there

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.000 align:middle line:90%
and take their pick--

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.400 align:middle line:84%
we'd start out getting
to know, first of all,

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.990 align:middle line:84%
about what the conditions
were for you when you first

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.820 align:middle line:90%
encountered other species.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And then have that
segue into what

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.090 align:middle line:84%
is the first species
you encountered

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.580 align:middle line:84%
and what was that like
in the very beginning

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.730 align:middle line:90%
of this journey for you?

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:05.690 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.520 align:middle line:84%
So I think the first
encounter that I had used

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.500 align:middle line:90%
to happen when I was a child.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.340 align:middle line:10%
But I don't recollect
that memory a lot.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.450 align:middle line:84%
It's just something that seems
to be in the back of my head.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.890 align:middle line:84%
I do have some kind of
flashbacks to it as well.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.353 align:middle line:84%
But that kind of seems
normal for a lot of--

00:02:27.353 --> 00:02:28.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Little kids.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.170 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: --for a lot
of little kids.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was it
more just a feeling,

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:37.840 align:middle line:84%
or was there a sense of a form
or more vague than that even?

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.700 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: A lot of
anxiety, I guess.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.637 align:middle line:84%
So that's, basically, the
memories that I recall.

00:02:42.637 --> 00:02:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Someone was there, and
it made you a little anxious?

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.950 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah, someone was there.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.740 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the whole family picked
up certain weird experiences.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's basically the first
memory and potential encounters

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.870 align:middle line:90%
that I had.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.580 align:middle line:84%
Later on, one of the most
fascinating experiences

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:13.690 align:middle line:84%
that we had was, basically,
conducting an experiment where

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.070 align:middle line:84%
a higher frequential
being was compressed so

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.030 align:middle line:84%
that it could fit
into our own frequency

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.810 align:middle line:84%
and that we could make contact
with them, which was basically

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.138 align:middle line:84%
one of the most relieving
experiences because--

00:03:31.138 --> 00:03:32.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's
back up a minute.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.950 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:33.280 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Oh, yeah.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.238 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That regard--

00:03:34.238 --> 00:03:36.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that has to
involve technology.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.230 align:middle line:84%
You're not talking
human to human.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.490 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about
technology being used.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.750 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that
means, usually when

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.200 align:middle line:84%
there's that kind of
technology, it's unknown,

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.560 align:middle line:84%
unacknowledged organizations
that some people say live

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.670 align:middle line:84%
in the shadows of
governments and such.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.490 align:middle line:84%
So it would be that
kind of experiment

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.282 align:middle line:84%
that was going on that
we're talking about?

00:03:53.282 --> 00:03:54.370 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes, 100%.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, and so
what was the intention

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:57.370 align:middle line:90%
of the experiment?

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.230 align:middle line:84%
And what was the preceding
history to even attempting

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.520 align:middle line:90%
the experiment?

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, so
basically, Germans

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.683 align:middle line:84%
have a long history of trying
to conduct that experiment.

00:04:13.683 --> 00:04:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
the military's had

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.690 align:middle line:84%
a history of interest
in the occult.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.110 align:middle line:90%
So has the American military.

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.350 align:middle line:84%
I think the American
military came a little later.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:22.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Later.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.480 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I think the Germans
have extensive experience

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.340 align:middle line:84%
in the 1920s, and so do
the Russians later on.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, very much so.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.370 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Very much so.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what was happening
in Germany that kind of

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.050 align:middle line:90%
is a back story to this?

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.190 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I think the back story
is that the Germans at that time

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.720 align:middle line:84%
realized that there is something
that they called [GERMAN],,

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.510 align:middle line:84%
which could be
translated as ghost.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.450 align:middle line:84%
But actually, that
word also means mind.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's basically the
mind from outside.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:05.020 align:middle line:84%
So it's, basically, a
intelligence that is outside--

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.570 align:middle line:84%
living outside of this reality
that we are experiencing once

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:09.370 align:middle line:90%
we're in.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So were
they looking at it

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:16.150 align:middle line:84%
as a singular vast
intelligence or connecting

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.450 align:middle line:84%
with individual
intelligences that are simply

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.580 align:middle line:90%
living outside of this density?

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.840 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, that's an
interesting question.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.460 align:middle line:84%
I think their
motivation was just

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:34.130 align:middle line:84%
to find someone to make an
alliance to that could help,

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.930 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.097 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it wasn't
discriminating at that point.

00:05:37.097 --> 00:05:39.015 align:middle line:84%
It's just whoever
you get through to.

00:05:39.015 --> 00:05:40.390 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: They were
basically hoping

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.510 align:middle line:84%
to find an intelligence big
enough and powerful enough

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.310 align:middle line:90%
to end the war in their favor.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.420 align:middle line:90%
That was basically--

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Oh, there's such interesting
stories about that.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.665 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Yeah, but that's
not how it actually works.

00:05:54.665 --> 00:05:56.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that
was their intention,

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.400 align:middle line:90%
to get military favor and help?

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.200 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.860 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:00.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.000 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Back at that time--

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.930 align:middle line:90%
1940.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So do you have any
idea of what level of success

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.330 align:middle line:84%
they had with the
technology that was

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:09.830 align:middle line:90%
available at that time?

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.440 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I only have
read some documents.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think they didn't
succeed at that time

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:22.340 align:middle line:84%
because the process is fairly
complicated in a way that

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.230 align:middle line:84%
if you want to make
direct contact,

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.860 align:middle line:84%
you have to set the freq--
because everything--

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.440 align:middle line:84%
so there's a model of
frequential harmonics,

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:35.592 align:middle line:84%
which means that every existent
is bound to a certain level--

00:06:35.592 --> 00:06:36.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of frequency.

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:37.505 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: --of
frequency, basically.

00:06:37.505 --> 00:06:37.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely, yes.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.560 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.860 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to make contact
to a intelligent being that

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.680 align:middle line:84%
lives outside of
this reality, you

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.610 align:middle line:84%
have to somehow compress
frequencies in a way

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.840 align:middle line:84%
that you can
directly access them.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think at that time,
that wasn't possible.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.430 align:middle line:84%
You could have made
contact, basically,

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.135 align:middle line:84%
which a lot of people do
outside by meditating.

00:07:01.135 --> 00:07:03.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and we're
going to talk about that.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.550 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: And I think through that
practice, a lot of the groups

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.480 align:middle line:84%
at that time had some
kind of success connecting

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.510 align:middle line:90%
to some outside intelligence.

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:17.360 align:middle line:84%
But then again, what we've
learned and what we've seen

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.830 align:middle line:84%
is that these beings outside
of our own frequency,

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:29.090 align:middle line:84%
they are very carefully caring
about not to be too invasive.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:32.510 align:middle line:84%
They do here and
there more or less

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:36.935 align:middle line:84%
all the time connect
with people and influence

00:07:36.935 --> 00:07:39.740 align:middle line:90%
how things turn out.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:44.750 align:middle line:84%
But they do so in a way that
people do not notice it.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.670 align:middle line:84%
It's like, for
example, spreading.

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:49.220 align:middle line:84%
So one of the
interesting thing was,

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:50.750 align:middle line:84%
and I've already
spoken about that,

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:55.370 align:middle line:84%
but it's the LSD basically,
which has been given as an idea

00:07:55.370 --> 00:08:02.450 align:middle line:84%
to a certain point in history
in order to prevent the war.

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And I found that
pretty interesting

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:08.360 align:middle line:84%
that even a intelligence that
is so experienced that they can

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.180 align:middle line:84%
alter and move
through time and even

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:15.620 align:middle line:84%
give impulses from
outside, they didn't quite

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:20.390 align:middle line:84%
succeed with it because the
way it has been spread--

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:24.420 align:middle line:84%
Hoffman didn't carry on
with the experiments.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And all that LSD effect
took place in the 1970s,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:33.740 align:middle line:90%
when the war was already over.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, exactly.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:38.910 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this can bring up a
number of different paths

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:39.710 align:middle line:90%
to go down.

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:41.793 align:middle line:84%
And one of them you alluded
to a moment ago, which

00:08:41.793 --> 00:08:45.950 align:middle line:84%
was in the '20s, because there
was a big transcendental kind

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:48.380 align:middle line:84%
of movement in the
US at the same time,

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:51.380 align:middle line:84%
you had a lot of people doing
seances and lots of things

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.760 align:middle line:84%
happening in lots of
parlors around the country,

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.700 align:middle line:84%
especially in the
East Coast, you know?

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.050 align:middle line:90%
New York City parlors.

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And there are books
written about the people

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:02.180 align:middle line:84%
of the day trying to
connect with beings

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.360 align:middle line:84%
from the other side, and
some quite successfully.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:10.220 align:middle line:84%
We even have some understanding
of Abraham Lincoln turning

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:14.240 align:middle line:84%
to a young girl who was psychic
to help him understand what

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.450 align:middle line:84%
was the best and highest
path for himself regarding

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:18.440 align:middle line:90%
the Civil War.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And so it's been utilized
throughout-- leaders

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:25.860 align:middle line:84%
have used beings from the
other side throughout history.

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:28.430 align:middle line:84%
So my question is,
why did the Germans--

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.770 align:middle line:84%
and then I assume it's
still the Germans working

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:34.400 align:middle line:84%
with this experiment
today in a new way when

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.900 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about
this experiment

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.360 align:middle line:90%
with this technology--

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.270 align:middle line:84%
why are they using
technology when humans have

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.550 align:middle line:90%
this capability to connect?

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:46.330 align:middle line:90%


00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:47.810 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: That's a good question.

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:50.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's basically
certain groups in Germany

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:56.498 align:middle line:84%
that are conducting
those experiments.

00:09:56.498 --> 00:09:58.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are they more
ordered toward the notion

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:02.620 align:middle line:84%
that AI and technology is
superior to the human matrix?

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:03.430 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Oh, yes.

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:04.610 align:middle line:90%
100%.

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:06.400 align:middle line:84%
Which is not my
personal view on it.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, but
that's what they're doing.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:08.520 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:13.360 align:middle line:84%
So if you're talking with
those scientists involved

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:18.460 align:middle line:84%
in those experiments,
they are 100% convinced

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:21.310 align:middle line:84%
that this reality that
we are experiencing

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:23.380 align:middle line:90%
is an AI simulation.

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:24.340 align:middle line:90%
100%.

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:25.630 align:middle line:90%
No doubt to them.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:27.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.000 align:middle line:84%
That flattens us out
to one dimension.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.140 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:32.470 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: It basically does.

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:35.230 align:middle line:84%
But it also gives a lot
of opportunities in a way,

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:38.542 align:middle line:84%
and options in a way, how
to handle reality because--

00:10:38.542 --> 00:10:40.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Explain that
a little bit more.

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:42.970 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Yeah, so the thing is,
if everything is a computer

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:48.310 align:middle line:84%
simulation and you find a lot
of evidence for that claim,

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:52.570 align:middle line:84%
then, basically, you can
hack reality pretty easily.

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And that thought
system brings them

00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:00.070 align:middle line:84%
to a point where they can
indeed alter and modify

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:01.670 align:middle line:90%
reality in that way.

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:04.660 align:middle line:84%
So if you're able
to access the code

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:08.860 align:middle line:84%
and access all these
simulations and structures,

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:13.270 align:middle line:84%
then you can just enter
whatever you want into that code

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:14.570 align:middle line:90%
and alter it.

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:15.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:16.912 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But how
does that interface

00:11:16.912 --> 00:11:21.600 align:middle line:84%
with human capacities of free
will, creativity, love, et

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.280 align:middle line:90%
cetera?

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.960 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Well, those people--

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They don't
think in those terms?

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:27.990 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah.

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:28.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.630 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: They think differently.

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:32.980 align:middle line:84%
But I think when we're
communicating-- so this being,

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:34.480 align:middle line:90%
we call it--

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.030 align:middle line:84%
well, actually I
translated it to being

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:43.090 align:middle line:84%
Six, which was the
translation to its name.

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:45.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does that mean
sixth dimension or something?

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.980 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.620 align:middle line:84%
So if you're thinking about
frequential harmonics,

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:55.564 align:middle line:84%
then the level six
consciousness is basically--

00:11:55.564 --> 00:11:59.570 align:middle line:84%
it's more or less the opposite
of level three consciousness,

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:03.230 align:middle line:84%
which is the space
outside of time and space.

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:04.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:04.510 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:05.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So they made it
pretty clear that technology

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.400 align:middle line:90%
is a possible way.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.100 align:middle line:84%
So they gave so many
infos about what

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:19.360 align:middle line:84%
can be done when people
focus on the body

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.920 align:middle line:90%
and on the consciousness.

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And they made it pretty
clear that the machine,

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:29.440 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, that we
already have is so powerful.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And they gave examples which are
so stunning and full of wonder

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:38.080 align:middle line:84%
that it's kind of hard
to even speak about.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now
it's getting juicy.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.520 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, we're going to
dial in a little bit.

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.860 align:middle line:84%
OK, when you say
"they," you're talking

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:48.700 align:middle line:84%
about the intelligence that
was contacted that's called Six

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:50.440 align:middle line:90%
from that sixth--

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.800 align:middle line:84%
you can say dimension, field,
reverse of Earth, whatever--

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.100 align:middle line:90%
outside of time and space.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:58.270 align:middle line:84%
So I would like you to
share with us that bit

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:01.900 align:middle line:84%
because this is what
humans need to be, I think,

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:03.820 align:middle line:90%
persistently reminded of.

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:05.620 align:middle line:84%
Or many people
haven't even heard it

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:10.060 align:middle line:84%
for the first time what this
incredible matrix that's

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.640 align:middle line:84%
open to all the information
in the universe is all about.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.120 align:middle line:84%
So tell us how
they explained us.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:20.890 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I happily do so because
it's a wondrous experience.

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And it gives sense to everything
we're experiencing in the world

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:29.974 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:13:29.974 --> 00:13:34.220 align:middle line:84%
It's basically us in a way
that is more experienced.

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:38.320 align:middle line:84%
So we are speaking
about the universe

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:43.910 align:middle line:84%
in terms of experiences in
a certain amount of space.

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:46.300 align:middle line:84%
So this is what
people talk about when

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.850 align:middle line:90%
they say density in that way.

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And the universe is always
creating new information.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:58.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's a self-learning
organism basically.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:04.615 align:middle line:84%
We are one gigantic life form
that is learning all the time.

00:14:04.615 --> 00:14:08.360 align:middle line:90%


00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And this is a intelligent
pattern of the universe

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:17.950 align:middle line:84%
that there are always
parts of the universe that

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:21.130 align:middle line:84%
have more experiences
than yourself

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:25.460 align:middle line:84%
and parts that have
less experiences.

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:27.670 align:middle line:84%
So the universe basically
gives information

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:30.310 align:middle line:84%
and experiences
down the way down

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:33.110 align:middle line:90%
to other aspects of itself.

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And they alter and
modify that experience

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.637 align:middle line:90%
and keep on learning.

00:14:37.637 --> 00:14:39.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Each evolves
in its own way.

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:40.760 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes, 100%.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:45.170 align:middle line:84%
So this being-- and we
could call it a collective

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:46.590 align:middle line:90%
of beings--

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:50.930 align:middle line:84%
so it's kind of
hard to say "it,"

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:53.570 align:middle line:90%
"he," or "they," whatever.

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:54.830 align:middle line:90%
Basically, it's us.

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:59.960 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very experienced
form of ourselves

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.865 align:middle line:84%
that already lives
outside of time.

00:15:01.865 --> 00:15:04.760 align:middle line:90%


00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.530 align:middle line:90%
So yes, that's basically it.

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:09.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what did
they say about us if--

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:13.790 align:middle line:84%
their view of us-- what we look
like, what we're capable of,

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:16.680 align:middle line:84%
and the way to access
these things in ourselves

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:17.480 align:middle line:90%
to activate them?

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Right, so
the main question

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:25.760 align:middle line:84%
is what's their interest
in ourselves, basically?

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
thing is that all

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:35.090 align:middle line:84%
these beings that compose this
lifeform Six or being Six,

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:39.090 align:middle line:84%
they had a pretty easy and
smooth evolution over time.

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:45.320 align:middle line:84%
They haven't had all that
controversial experiences

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:51.440 align:middle line:84%
that people have on the
surface of this planet.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And then, the evolution
of consciousness

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:57.020 align:middle line:90%
is pretty smooth in that way.

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not as
much resistance.

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:00.950 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Exactly, right.

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:05.840 align:middle line:84%
But this being also
hits a point where

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:10.040 align:middle line:84%
it has to deal with opposing
intelligences, which

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:13.520 align:middle line:90%
we have in this universe.

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:20.690 align:middle line:84%
There still is the
antithesis to good in a way.

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:23.570 align:middle line:84%
So you could call
it bad or whatever.

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:27.780 align:middle line:84%
But it's self-destructive
patterns in that way.

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:33.170 align:middle line:84%
So this being still has to
deal with self-destructiveness.

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And that is basically
the question for it

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:40.880 align:middle line:84%
how to deal with
it because it's so

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:45.740 align:middle line:84%
nonexperienced in
defensive mechanisms.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:48.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they actually
can observe and interact

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:53.960 align:middle line:84%
and see how the human is
able to transform negativity?

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:55.070 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes, right.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:57.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is a real
learning experience for them?

00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:58.340 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And that is basically the answer
why a lifeform on level six

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.750 align:middle line:84%
depends on a life
form on level three

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:09.200 align:middle line:84%
because level three
lifeforms, they still

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.319 align:middle line:84%
have their choices and
a way ahead of them.

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And they can choose and learn
how to deal with negativity.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And we see that on
this planet a lot.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:23.510 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of opportunities
to deal with certain opposing

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:25.260 align:middle line:90%
forces.

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is, basically,
the main interest, yes.

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Interest-- so
they view the human capacity

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:37.910 align:middle line:84%
to be able to move
between polarities

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:41.750 align:middle line:84%
and to be able to integrate
or transform and come

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:43.910 align:middle line:84%
to understand how these
can live side by side

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:45.930 align:middle line:90%
or just flat out transform them.

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:50.270 align:middle line:84%
This is something that they find
unique in the human species?

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:53.450 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: It's unique to
warrior-type species, which

00:17:53.450 --> 00:18:01.850 align:middle line:84%
are basically species that
are capable of having wars.

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:03.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, that's us.

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:04.760 align:middle line:90%
We're still there.

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:05.780 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah, It's true.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:10.010 align:middle line:84%
But the question is,
is a species that

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:18.740 align:middle line:84%
is able to defend and be
a warrior-type species, is

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:25.853 align:middle line:84%
that species able to transform
that energy in becoming

00:18:25.853 --> 00:18:31.640 align:middle line:84%
self-sustaining and sustainable,
or is it self-destructive.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.160 align:middle line:84%
And self-destructive
behavior in the universe

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:39.500 align:middle line:84%
will lead to, well, basically,
a failed timeline, a failed

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:40.865 align:middle line:90%
opportunity.

00:18:40.865 --> 00:18:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, that's
something I think about.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And there are different
theories on this.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.010 align:middle line:84%
Dolores Cannon-- the
work of Dolores Cannon--

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:51.920 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people revealed--
and not just her but others--

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:56.000 align:middle line:84%
that the Earth itself has
other iterations of itself

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.920 align:middle line:84%
in different densities
depending on the level

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:04.040 align:middle line:84%
of ability and learning
of the individuals.

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.290 align:middle line:84%
You can incarnate
into any one of them.

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:09.380 align:middle line:84%
If there are very dense
basic levels still

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:11.940 align:middle line:84%
being learned, which may
include a lot of violence,

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:14.040 align:middle line:84%
there's an iteration
of Earth for that.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And for those who
have chosen to move

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:20.390 align:middle line:84%
beyond that kind of conflict
and to be able to learn to live

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:23.420 align:middle line:84%
and what it means to live
in cooperation, acceptance,

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:26.520 align:middle line:84%
and harmony with others,
there's a different iteration.

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.610 align:middle line:84%
So then it gets into
what version of Earth

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:29.880 align:middle line:90%
are we talking about, right?

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:30.680 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Have you also
been exposed to the notion

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:35.630 align:middle line:84%
that there are other densities
and iterations of Earth?

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:36.890 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: There are, actually.

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:38.960 align:middle line:84%
So this is basically
one of the things

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:43.430 align:middle line:84%
that I've learned
is that there are

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:45.250 align:middle line:84%
different versions
of the universe

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:48.850 align:middle line:84%
and different versions
of Earth as well.

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:56.080 align:middle line:84%
So basically, the evolution
of beings on Earth as it's

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:58.960 align:middle line:84%
going through certain
cycles over time,

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.420 align:middle line:84%
and they have made
it pretty clear

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:03.880 align:middle line:84%
that we are coming to
an end of this cycle.

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:05.722 align:middle line:90%
Or we, basically--

00:20:05.722 --> 00:20:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a
bifurcation point.

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:07.570 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:07.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:09.190 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Basically, right.

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And some versions already went
through this and succeeded.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And these versions,
for example, they

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:22.750 align:middle line:84%
do not rely upon
extraterrestrials.

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:25.870 align:middle line:84%
So they basically have not
experienced the presence

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:28.900 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrials because
they came to an understanding.

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.330 align:middle line:84%
You're more or less
a hive intelligence,

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:35.290 align:middle line:90%
that we are just one being.

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:37.420 align:middle line:90%
And they have gone--

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:40.310 align:middle line:84%
they went a different
way with that.

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:44.260 align:middle line:84%
But basically, this version of
Earth and everyone watching--

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:46.600 align:middle line:90%
you, me, everyone else--

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:51.490 align:middle line:84%
we all learned that
we're not alone.

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:53.390 align:middle line:90%
There's life all over the place.

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:54.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All over.

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:54.430 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Everywhere.

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:55.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There are
humanoids all over.

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:56.730 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Everywhere.

00:20:56.730 --> 00:21:01.150 align:middle line:84%
Humanoids, but also exotic
and potentially every kind

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:05.650 align:middle line:84%
of lifeform that you can think
of and even you cannot think

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:07.750 align:middle line:90%
of.

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
and one thing that I

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:14.410 align:middle line:84%
know that my own beings/guides
that I speak with and have been

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:17.290 align:middle line:84%
with me forever have
said that people

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:19.900 align:middle line:84%
tend to put a lot of
judgment on this in terms

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:23.530 align:middle line:84%
of the multiple Earth scenario
because as people right

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:25.360 align:middle line:84%
now, as this bifurcation
is happening,

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.460 align:middle line:84%
it's just on a
level of frequency.

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:29.440 align:middle line:84%
There's no right,
and there's no wrong.

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.830 align:middle line:84%
Just as in amoebas learning its
lessons, we're learning ours.

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And if it takes being a
little bit longer to learn

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:40.450 align:middle line:84%
that to exploit or to
cause harm to another

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:45.280 align:middle line:84%
doesn't work well in anyone's
favor, it just takes longer.

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.470 align:middle line:90%
It's not a denigration.

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:51.400 align:middle line:84%
It's just a level of
learning and evolvement

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.370 align:middle line:84%
and that we have to stop
judging one another.

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:54.170 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:56.380 align:middle line:10%
So this version
of the Earth right

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:59.770 align:middle line:10%
now is pretty interesting
because a lot of the problems

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:04.090 align:middle line:10%
and challenges have
not been solved yet.

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:08.800 align:middle line:10%
So basically, we are
dealing with a version

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:13.570 align:middle line:10%
of the universe that projects
its challenges outside.

00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:17.350 align:middle line:84%
So basically, all the
challenges that occur

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:22.060 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of Earth, we find
an equivalent outside of Earth.

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of accelerates
the opportunities and the way--

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:30.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
so because it puts

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:34.780 align:middle line:84%
more like-frequencied
beings together

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:37.630 align:middle line:84%
to be able to accelerate
whatever that path of learning

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:40.510 align:middle line:84%
is, whether it's a challenging
one, or whether you say,

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:43.690 align:middle line:84%
to expedite learning toward
the higher potential.

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:48.220 align:middle line:84%
It's not being served now to
have such diverse learning

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.050 align:middle line:90%
happening all in one place.

00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:52.150 align:middle line:90%
One is dragging the other down.

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:54.580 align:middle line:84%
It's almost gratuitous
at this point.

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.830 align:middle line:84%
Where others really have
gotten to the point where,

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:58.760 align:middle line:90%
how can this be happening?

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.820 align:middle line:84%
How can war-- how
can a country just

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:03.220 align:middle line:84%
pick a war with another
country in this day and age?

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's interesting
because that's

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:06.460 align:middle line:90%
something we used to accept.

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And right now,
we're seeing things

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:10.720 align:middle line:84%
play out in Russia and
Ukraine, in particular,

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:14.360 align:middle line:84%
and the world is watching,
thinking, how'd that happen?

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:17.680 align:middle line:84%
How does that happen
in today's world?

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:20.950 align:middle line:84%
We thought we'd grown
beyond letting that happen.

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:23.550 align:middle line:84%
So there is a lot of growing
and learning happening here.

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:24.350 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: There is.

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:26.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So some of the ET
species that you've dealt

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:27.040 align:middle line:90%
with--

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:28.582 align:middle line:84%
I know that you've
dealt a little bit

00:23:28.582 --> 00:23:31.780 align:middle line:84%
with Greys and Ebens, and you've
been in the company of them.

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you say in
the company of them,

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:36.955 align:middle line:84%
is that interdimensionally
or physically?

00:23:36.955 --> 00:23:38.080 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: No, it's physically.

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I don't need
to ask you where you were.

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:44.110 align:middle line:84%
But whenever you were
in the company of them,

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:45.370 align:middle line:90%
was this invited?

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:47.950 align:middle line:90%
Was this by arrangement?

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:50.230 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, it was
arranged in that way.

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:57.080 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, basically, arranged
meetings over some time.

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:59.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so what
was in it for you

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.360 align:middle line:84%
and the people you
were involved with?

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:02.860 align:middle line:90%
And what was in it for them?

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:04.480 align:middle line:90%
And what came of those meetings?

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And how did you initially
feel in their company?

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:09.310 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Well, initially--

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:10.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And why are they here?

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.850 align:middle line:90%
Why are they still here?

00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: That is actually the
main question why we did that--

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:18.580 align:middle line:90%
the motivation.

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:20.420 align:middle line:90%
Who are they?

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:21.860 align:middle line:90%
Because at that time--

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:28.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, 1947, when the first
crashes got public and people

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:32.650 align:middle line:84%
in the US learned about the
presence of other beings,

00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:35.530 align:middle line:84%
there was a lot of
fear and false--

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:41.590 align:middle line:84%
mainly hoaxes that were
involved and confusion.

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:42.870 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:43.670 align:middle line:90%
Who are they?

00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:44.540 align:middle line:90%
Why are they here?

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And how do we defend,
potentially, against them?

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:50.068 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It became
an enemy immediately

00:24:50.068 --> 00:24:52.610 align:middle line:84%
because that's how we think--
we were thinking in those days.

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:54.350 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: That is actually how--

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:59.780 align:middle line:84%
yeah, basically, how humanity
in certain circles think.

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:04.970 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, the question
remains, who are they?

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:06.800 align:middle line:90%
What's their motivation?

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.895 align:middle line:84%
Are they going to
take over the planet?

00:25:08.895 --> 00:25:09.695 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I say no.

00:25:09.695 --> 00:25:10.070 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:11.460 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: No, definitely not.

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:13.190 align:middle line:84%
It's super interesting
because they

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:18.200 align:middle line:84%
made it super clear that they
have no interest at all taking

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:21.470 align:middle line:84%
over the planet or something,
because they couldn't even--

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:25.140 align:middle line:84%
from their point of view,
it's a vast and raw planet.

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:29.263 align:middle line:84%
It has winds, water,
dust, pollution.

00:25:29.263 --> 00:25:30.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Bad weather.

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:31.940 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Bad weather.

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:32.764 align:middle line:90%
Digestions.

00:25:32.764 --> 00:25:34.020 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:34.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Poo.

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:35.680 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Poo.

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:36.680 align:middle line:90%
Right, basically, poo.

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:39.725 align:middle line:84%
So this was super
interesting to learn.

00:25:39.725 --> 00:25:42.750 align:middle line:84%
It's a different
perspective because--

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:43.550 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So their culture,
where they're from--

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:48.020 align:middle line:84%
and where did they
say they were from?

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:51.410 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, they,
basically-- their origin

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:56.660 align:middle line:84%
is coming from a planet in
the Orion star system, which

00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:00.350 align:middle line:84%
is the reason why we have
all these strange structures

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:02.940 align:middle line:84%
around the world that
point towards Orion.

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:03.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:08.477 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So a lot of their
influences societywise--

00:26:08.477 --> 00:26:10.310 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking about
the Greys right now.

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:12.270 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking
about being Six.

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:13.370 align:middle line:90%
I have to point that out.

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:13.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:14.860 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about the Greys.

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:17.900 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Right, a lot of their
influence from their society

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:21.530 align:middle line:84%
has been passed
down onto humanity.

00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:26.390 align:middle line:84%
We see a lot of patterns
that, basically, humanity

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:30.440 align:middle line:90%
has learned from them.

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:35.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But what do they want?

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:37.590 align:middle line:90%
OK, let me ask you something.

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:41.650 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that the whole
Project Serpo thing was real?

00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:42.620 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: The what?

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:45.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The Project
Serpo with the US program--

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:46.930 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Going to Serpo?

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:47.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:51.850 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I've learned about
that from, basically,

00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:55.220 align:middle line:84%
Richard Doty who gave me
some of the documents.

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:56.485 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:26:56.485 --> 00:26:58.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
jury might be out.

00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:00.963 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Len Kasten writes quite
a bit about it, I believe.

00:27:00.963 --> 00:27:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: But we're
basically talking

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:03.850 align:middle line:84%
about the different
species there.

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:07.730 align:middle line:84%
So Project Serpo has to do
with the so-called Ebens.

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:08.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ebens.

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:10.280 align:middle line:90%
And we confuse the two here.

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:11.780 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Yeah, because
they all have--

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:13.270 align:middle line:84%
so there are
different species that

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:16.600 align:middle line:84%
have gray skin, which
makes it easy to say,

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.023 align:middle line:90%
oh, they're all Greys.

00:27:18.023 --> 00:27:19.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they're
different species.

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:20.170 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: They're a
different species.

00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:22.795 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They just have certain
things in common and that they

00:27:22.795 --> 00:27:25.810 align:middle line:84%
tend to be slender, larger
heads, kind of larger eyes,

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:30.080 align:middle line:84%
and not a lot going on in terms
of olfactory and so forth,

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:33.200 align:middle line:84%
because they don't need it and
they're not digesting food--

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.000 align:middle line:90%
a lot of them.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Basically, one of
the main differences between

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:43.930 align:middle line:84%
the Ebens, which was the species
that has crashed 1947 in Nevada

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:47.240 align:middle line:90%
in the desert, and the Greys--

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:50.230 align:middle line:84%
so the Greys, they have
fiber-printed bodies.

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:53.620 align:middle line:84%
They got rid of the
biological nature bodywise.

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:57.310 align:middle line:84%
They still have a
consciousness that is--

00:27:57.310 --> 00:28:00.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Inserted into
a fiber carbon vehicle.

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:01.570 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: 100%, yes.

00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:04.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
there's no need for poo.

00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:07.750 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: That's what they
made pretty clear, yes.

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:09.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, but
there's an awful lot

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.020 align:middle line:84%
you're also done
with when you don't

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.630 align:middle line:90%
have this wonderful vehicle.

00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:15.443 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah.

00:28:15.443 --> 00:28:17.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So tell me about the
nature of the conversations

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:20.290 align:middle line:84%
that you had with them, why
you were meeting with them,

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:22.780 align:middle line:84%
and what they want
from us, and what

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:24.010 align:middle line:90%
your people wanted from them.

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Yeah, so basically,
they have a lot of--

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:33.280 align:middle line:84%
they got their stock, so to
speak, in humanity in that way,

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:38.860 align:middle line:84%
that they influenced the
genetic code of humanity

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:41.260 align:middle line:90%
as well as other species.

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:44.230 align:middle line:90%
And they also have done that.

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:46.960 align:middle line:84%
Where the Greys are
pretty much interested

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:54.130 align:middle line:84%
in regaining some of their
spiritual nature that they got

00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:55.120 align:middle line:90%
rid of.

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.970 align:middle line:84%
So they basically
found that emotions

00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:05.750 align:middle line:84%
are kind of hindering and
blocking some decisions.

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:08.950 align:middle line:84%
So they got rid of
emotions to a point

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:13.240 align:middle line:84%
that they have very little
emotions compared to a human.

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:16.120 align:middle line:84%
They do not reproduce
in that way.

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, humans,
and we all know

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:24.280 align:middle line:84%
that that the connection
between two beings

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:30.340 align:middle line:84%
can be a enormous, interesting
spiritual experience.

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:31.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or not.

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Or not.

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:33.085 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Have you seen
the movie "Idiocracy?"

00:29:33.085 --> 00:29:33.610 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:34.410 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: No.

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, you've
got to see it.

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:37.840 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I haven't seen
a lot of the movies.

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:38.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, no.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.370 align:middle line:90%
You got to see--

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:41.450 align:middle line:84%
everybody needs to
see "Idiocracy."

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:42.250 align:middle line:90%
You should rent it.

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:43.600 align:middle line:84%
I think you can
rent it on Amazon.

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:44.440 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Oh, interesting.

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:46.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's not always
a sacred act as people

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:46.990 align:middle line:90%
get dumber.

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:47.790 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:51.170 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Yeah, but it's
by design, actually.

00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:51.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:54.375 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, well,
go ahead on that one.

00:29:54.375 --> 00:29:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I don't
know if I want to.

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:57.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, well,
please do because it does

00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:02.440 align:middle line:84%
seem things are going
in an interesting way

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.090 align:middle line:84%
where people are
not merging together

00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:05.440 align:middle line:90%
quite as easily as in the past.

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:06.680 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes, that is true.

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:10.720 align:middle line:84%
So there are basically
some species that--

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:15.040 align:middle line:84%
they want to lower the
evolutionary potential

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:17.140 align:middle line:90%
of the species.

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:18.535 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which
species, and why?

00:30:18.535 --> 00:30:21.640 align:middle line:90%


00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.780 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I try to be
diplomatic here.

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:30.937 align:middle line:84%
So what we've seen is that some
more lizard-connected species--

00:30:30.937 --> 00:30:32.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Reptile species.

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.468 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right.

00:30:34.468 --> 00:30:36.010 align:middle line:90%
They put a lot of--

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:38.692 align:middle line:90%


00:30:38.692 --> 00:30:43.240 align:middle line:84%
they are accused of having
put some systematic changes

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:47.170 align:middle line:84%
and modifications
into the system so

00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:51.730 align:middle line:84%
that, basically, the
capability of using language

00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:55.540 align:middle line:84%
for maneuvering
throughout the universe

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:59.380 align:middle line:84%
and through your
experience is getting

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:03.760 align:middle line:84%
harder and even
oppositional to what

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.770 align:middle line:90%
you might want to manifest.

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:08.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are you talking
about in modern society,

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:11.840 align:middle line:84%
the way language is being,
essentially, restricted?

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:12.640 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And so basically,
what we've seen

00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:18.100 align:middle line:84%
is-- so these
species, some of them

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:25.570 align:middle line:84%
are capable of modification
of temporal dynamics, which

00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:27.490 align:middle line:90%
basically is time traveling.

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:34.660 align:middle line:84%
So we've seen that by setting
up a certain educational system

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:41.680 align:middle line:84%
onto certain ancient
societies that languages got

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.660 align:middle line:90%
modified in a certain way.

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And in a way that
people sometimes

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:50.750 align:middle line:84%
want to express
something and language--

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:54.310 align:middle line:84%
so we basically know from
the ancient yogic tradition

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:57.680 align:middle line:84%
that everything in the universe
has a certain sound to it.

00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:01.570 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: And by
knowing these sounds,

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:09.190 align:middle line:84%
you basically call them in into
existence by combining these--

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:12.010 align:middle line:90%
your consciousness and sound.

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And what has been
done, which is obvious,

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:19.900 align:middle line:84%
is that language has been
altered over time in order

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:24.320 align:middle line:84%
to sometimes express,
basically, the opposite.

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:28.630 align:middle line:84%
So if you, for example,
promise something in German,

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:37.850 align:middle line:84%
it's the same word that also
expresses a miscommunication.

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:42.160 align:middle line:84%
So you're basically not
promising, but you're basically

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.657 align:middle line:90%
saying a lie or something.

00:32:43.657 --> 00:32:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:45.040 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:46.480 align:middle line:90%
So we've seen that a lot.

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:47.740 align:middle line:90%
And yeah--

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:49.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What
about, for example,

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:52.210 align:middle line:84%
truncated language such
as newspeak-- you know,

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Aldous Huxley's
newspeak-- where we

00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:57.100 align:middle line:84%
start losing the richness
of the language altogether

00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:59.350 align:middle line:84%
and words are
contracted so you barely

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:01.900 align:middle line:84%
have language left at all,
which, of course, is happening

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:02.930 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:05.710 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Yeah, so it's one of the
interesting things about this

00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:10.930 align:middle line:84%
is that a species normally
alters and modifies

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:12.430 align:middle line:90%
its language.

00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And that shows its
creative potential.

00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
I found pretty interesting

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:22.930 align:middle line:84%
is that most new words that
we have are basically brands,

00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:25.330 align:middle line:90%
so products or something.

00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:31.040 align:middle line:84%
So this whole language
thing is capitalized.

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.582 align:middle line:84%
It's based on
capitalism in some way.

00:33:32.582 --> 00:33:33.748 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, interesting.

00:33:33.748 --> 00:33:36.080 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So this is it's
an interesting fact, yes.

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:36.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:38.380 align:middle line:90%
And also what's interesting--

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:40.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what's
happening in Germany,

00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:43.930 align:middle line:84%
but in the United
States, there's

00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:49.090 align:middle line:84%
huge division over
language right now.

00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it is
really so essential.

00:33:51.610 --> 00:33:55.450 align:middle line:84%
It's at the core of
creation of male and female

00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:57.130 align:middle line:84%
where certain
language can't even

00:33:57.130 --> 00:34:00.890 align:middle line:84%
be used to identify what a man
is or what a woman is anymore.

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I read
recently when--

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:05.500 align:middle line:84%
I think it was a
professor in Finland

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:08.679 align:middle line:84%
was in the news
recently was facing up

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:12.310 align:middle line:84%
to three years in prison
for not going along

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:14.770 align:middle line:84%
with the new language
that's not explicit as

00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:16.780 align:middle line:90%
to what a man or a woman is.

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, this, where's
this coming from?

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:21.409 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: That's a good question.

00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:23.260 align:middle line:84%
I've thought about
that many times

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:25.369 align:middle line:84%
because it came
so surprisingly--

00:34:25.369 --> 00:34:26.169 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Quickly.

00:34:26.169 --> 00:34:26.969 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: --quickly.

00:34:26.969 --> 00:34:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And because it's so
disorienting at the foundation

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:30.880 align:middle line:90%
of what we are.

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:31.680 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:35.020 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, it offers a--
which I kind of like--

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:38.230 align:middle line:90%
I do see two sides of it.

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:40.960 align:middle line:84%
One side is that it
creates a lot of confusion

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:43.090 align:middle line:90%
in the way we set up language.

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:47.050 align:middle line:84%
But it also creates
a certain awareness

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:50.450 align:middle line:84%
that we might be
more than one gender.

00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:51.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Binary.

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:52.409 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Binary, right.

00:34:52.409 --> 00:34:54.159 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we're
much more than that.

00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:57.880 align:middle line:84%
But that's just one simple way
to put us together and make

00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:58.690 align:middle line:90%
more of us.

00:34:58.690 --> 00:35:00.560 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right, that is true.

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:04.220 align:middle line:84%
So basically, when this
cycle is coming to an end,

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:08.440 align:middle line:84%
the question for
everyone is, are you

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:13.930 align:middle line:84%
ready to accept that you are
more than the level three

00:35:13.930 --> 00:35:17.260 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, which is "I
am," whatever, you know?

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:20.320 align:middle line:90%
So basically--

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It takes
labels off, on one hand.

00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:26.620 align:middle line:84%
But I'm seeing labels come
on just as heavy-handedly

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:27.970 align:middle line:90%
from the very same side.

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:29.307 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah, it's complicated.

00:35:29.307 --> 00:35:31.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's-- yeah,
it's complicated right now.

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:34.510 align:middle line:84%
I just brought it up because
language and thinking

00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:37.600 align:middle line:84%
about the notion of newspeak
and contracted language,

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:41.140 align:middle line:84%
we're losing so much of the
original sounds of the universe

00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:44.140 align:middle line:84%
by reducing our languages,
and now reducing it

00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:46.390 align:middle line:84%
to texts, and from
text to symbols.

00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:48.070 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:51.340 align:middle line:84%
So basically-- so I've
done extensive research

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:54.010 align:middle line:84%
on the German language, a little
bit on the English language

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:54.810 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:57.407 align:middle line:84%
And I'm pretty happy to
talk about that right now.

00:35:57.407 --> 00:35:58.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Please do.

00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:59.040 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:03.400 align:middle line:84%
So some of the things
that has been deleted

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:06.440 align:middle line:90%
over the course of history--

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:08.770 align:middle line:84%
so basically, the
Germanic language

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:15.460 align:middle line:84%
knows two different words
for, basically, a play.

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:17.950 align:middle line:84%
So they know the
word for game, which

00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:23.170 align:middle line:84%
is also included in the
ancient yogic term of gum.

00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:24.160 align:middle line:90%
Game, you know?

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:29.020 align:middle line:84%
So there was this word
in the German language.

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is basically
a constellation

00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:36.640 align:middle line:84%
where two people play together
without a competition,

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:37.440 align:middle line:90%
without--

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:38.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's beautiful.

00:36:38.290 --> 00:36:39.160 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right?

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:40.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
how life should be.

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:41.100 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:45.790 align:middle line:84%
So basically, Germans only
know the word [GERMAN],,

00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:50.270 align:middle line:84%
which means, basically, one side
has to win over the other side.

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:52.330 align:middle line:90%
So basically, that got cut off.

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:55.120 align:middle line:90%
And so basically--

00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:57.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the word
that represented play

00:36:57.310 --> 00:37:00.380 align:middle line:84%
without needing to win was
cut out in favor of [GERMAN]??

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:01.180 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:03.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, which
is the one side wins?

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:03.220 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
words, for example,

00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:09.460 align:middle line:84%
if I would ask you maybe to get
your cup or something, which

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:13.210 align:middle line:84%
is the word "kriegen,"
you might be aware,

00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:14.545 align:middle line:90%
you already hear this.

00:37:14.545 --> 00:37:17.770 align:middle line:90%
This is the word for war.

00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:22.120 align:middle line:84%
So if I want to get something--
and this is actually

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:25.150 align:middle line:84%
the nature of the universe
that you get things for free,

00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:28.030 align:middle line:84%
the universe is
nurturing in itself.

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:29.540 align:middle line:90%
It's a--

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:30.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Abundant.

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:31.780 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Abundance, right.

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:35.590 align:middle line:84%
So basically, by placing this
word into the consciousness,

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:38.140 align:middle line:84%
everything you want to achieve
and everything you want

00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:39.940 align:middle line:90%
is through war.

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:41.320 align:middle line:90%
So that is basically--

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Through taking
by dominance, conquering.

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:44.640 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah.

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:48.310 align:middle line:84%
It's basically, actually, the
word, so "kriegen," which means

00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:51.350 align:middle line:84%
warring, to be at
war for something.

00:37:51.350 --> 00:37:55.990 align:middle line:84%
So if I just ask or see two
children speaking, like,

00:37:55.990 --> 00:38:01.330 align:middle line:84%
can I get the ball or something,
that would actually mean--

00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:06.260 align:middle line:84%
involve a certain competitive
and warlike nature to it.

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:09.910 align:middle line:84%
So that is the way
certain intelligences

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:15.770 align:middle line:84%
have altered the way species
and tribes on this planet got

00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:16.570 align:middle line:90%
along.

00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:18.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's just
take that right to the top.

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:21.730 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I interviewed a
fellow named John Warner IV.

00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And his father was
John Warner III,

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:27.010 align:middle line:84%
who was five times Senator
and Secretary of Defense,

00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:29.240 align:middle line:84%
I believe, at one
point prior to that.

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And so his son came with
him to the Pentagon, right?

00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:35.540 align:middle line:90%
And he met all sorts of people.

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And he allowed his son
to be where he wanted,

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:39.430 align:middle line:90%
ask what he wanted of people.

00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:41.170 align:middle line:90%
And John did ask--

00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:44.770 align:middle line:84%
young John asked an
admiral about the presence

00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:45.670 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrials.

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:48.310 align:middle line:84%
He basically said, son, you
can see him walking down

00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:50.020 align:middle line:84%
the halls of the
Pentagon for one.

00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And he said, that's
who's in control.

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:58.010 align:middle line:84%
Look there if you want
to know who's in control.

00:38:58.010 --> 00:38:59.530 align:middle line:90%
So this was-- he was young.

00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:01.570 align:middle line:90%
And this was disorienting.

00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And considering what
you've just said,

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:06.820 align:middle line:84%
tell us the implications
of those statements

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:10.670 align:middle line:84%
and what you know as a
potential truth in that.

00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, the potential truth
is that there are species--

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:18.860 align:middle line:84%
so basically,
parasitism, we're talking

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:23.660 align:middle line:84%
about certain kind of parasitism
and the social terminology

00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:24.560 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:31.400 align:middle line:84%
So basically, some species
are more experienced in how

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:35.120 align:middle line:84%
to deal with reality, how to
deal with the mind effects

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:36.770 align:middle line:90%
that we can have on each other.

00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
species that, basically,

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:41.757 align:middle line:90%
take advantage of that.

00:39:41.757 --> 00:39:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, I
would assume those

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:46.550 align:middle line:84%
that you're speaking about
that might be hanging out

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:50.050 align:middle line:84%
in the Pentagon might
be more of that nature.

00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:52.070 align:middle line:90%
Or is that an assumption?

00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I would say that,
at least in current times,

00:39:55.490 --> 00:40:04.490 align:middle line:84%
there is an effort to prevent
certain species from outside

00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:06.410 align:middle line:90%
having influences.

00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:09.980 align:middle line:84%
But again, through
time, what we see

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:13.070 align:middle line:84%
is that the system that we're
dealing with on this planet

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:18.920 align:middle line:84%
is pretty rigged and
pretty modified in a way

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:24.290 align:middle line:84%
that it's a disadvantage
to the species itself.

00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And that is because those
species accept something

00:40:28.850 --> 00:40:32.160 align:middle line:84%
and know something that humans
have a hard time dealing with.

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:32.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which is?

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:36.380 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Which is, basically,
the genetic nature of humanity.

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:40.985 align:middle line:84%
So humanity is
basically an ape race

00:40:40.985 --> 00:40:43.245 align:middle line:90%
with mixed nonterrestrial--

00:40:43.245 --> 00:40:44.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or hybrids.

00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:44.960 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: That's true.

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:45.760 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:49.220 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of the
subconscious patterns

00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:52.800 align:middle line:84%
come from being
connected to ape species.

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And if you know that
and if you know how--

00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:58.460 align:middle line:84%
for example, group
conformity, which

00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:02.330 align:middle line:84%
is something that has
evolved with ape species

00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:04.730 align:middle line:84%
and made them so
strong, you know?

00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
we see in the apes,

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:11.000 align:middle line:84%
that they try not
to fall out of line.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.890 align:middle line:84%
If they do-- for
example, if we see

00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:16.190 align:middle line:84%
a monkey that, for
example, falls off a tree,

00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:17.660 align:middle line:90%
it's an interesting behavior.

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:25.290 align:middle line:84%
They try to rub off the dust
and show that it was by accident

00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:30.470 align:middle line:84%
and that they are still capable
of being a productive part

00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:32.790 align:middle line:90%
of the whole group, the tribe.

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:38.030 align:middle line:84%
So this is something that we
see in the subconsciousness

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:41.390 align:middle line:84%
and subconscious
behavior of humans,

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:44.900 align:middle line:84%
basically, that there
is something that is--

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:46.712 align:middle line:90%
stick to group conformity.

00:41:46.712 --> 00:41:48.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, my
understanding is

00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:49.880 align:middle line:84%
that's true in ET
species, where you

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:52.460 align:middle line:84%
do what's best for the highest
and best good for the group.

00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:55.230 align:middle line:84%
The individuality isn't
even there in the same way.

00:41:55.230 --> 00:42:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Yes, but if you introduce
certain destructive patterns

00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:05.822 align:middle line:90%
to the group conformity--

00:42:05.822 --> 00:42:07.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: ETs or human?

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:09.408 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Humans are
following that pattern.

00:42:09.408 --> 00:42:10.208 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:42:10.208 --> 00:42:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: And we see
that through a lot

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:14.630 align:middle line:84%
of experiments with monkeys,
for example, and apes.

00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:17.960 align:middle line:84%
That once they have
learned a certain pattern--

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:22.730 align:middle line:84%
for example, not climbing a
ladder or something and they

00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:24.210 align:middle line:90%
get an electric--

00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:25.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Shock.

00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: --shock-- they give
that to their children

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:29.220 align:middle line:90%
without reflecting it.

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:32.090 align:middle line:84%
So even if the next generation
doesn't get anything,

00:42:32.090 --> 00:42:36.380 align:middle line:84%
the ladder becomes a no-go zone
because they give that false--

00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:37.430 align:middle line:90%
over generations.

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:38.360 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:39.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:43.100 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: And once an outside
species sees that pattern

00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:46.680 align:middle line:84%
and knows how it can
take advantage of it,

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:48.110 align:middle line:90%
they put something in it.

00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, the species
keeps on doing that.

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:56.330 align:middle line:84%
We all know that the system
that we have on this planet

00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:59.270 align:middle line:84%
is what we call a
lose-lose situation.

00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:01.130 align:middle line:90%
There's no winner.

00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:04.220 align:middle line:84%
There might be some people who
have a little more than others,

00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:05.780 align:middle line:90%
but they also lose.

00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:06.800 align:middle line:90%
They are also losers.

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:08.630 align:middle line:90%
Everyone loses in this game.

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:14.180 align:middle line:84%
So a different-- other species
would not only know that,

00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:16.280 align:middle line:84%
but they would
modify that pattern.

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:18.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But why would
another species bother?

00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:20.450 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
planets out there.

00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:23.090 align:middle line:84%
Why come and interfere
with a species

00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:27.400 align:middle line:84%
that is attempting to wake up
and remember their finer parts?

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:28.370 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:32.790 align:middle line:84%
Because-- and there, we
come back to your question,

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:36.860 align:middle line:84%
why do we get in contact
with being Six, for example--

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:41.840 align:middle line:84%
because humanity itself,
on the surface of it,

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:45.540 align:middle line:84%
because they have so
many challenges going on,

00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:48.120 align:middle line:84%
they have one of the highest
potentials in the universe.

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:48.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:53.460 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: They can evolve above
a lot of other species,

00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:58.940 align:middle line:84%
especially when they have a
moral and ethic center point

00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:05.720 align:middle line:84%
and use their capabilities to
defend and to structure things

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:08.090 align:middle line:90%
in a positive way.

00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:15.313 align:middle line:84%
Then they become a
potential disturber.

00:44:15.313 --> 00:44:16.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Disturber of what?

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:22.030 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that the ideal is that we
all evolve ethically, morally,

00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:25.007 align:middle line:84%
and we come into this oneness
and comprehension of this?

00:44:25.007 --> 00:44:25.840 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: That is true.

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:28.450 align:middle line:84%
But we've also seen
some species that

00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:33.940 align:middle line:84%
show extreme self-destructive
behavior patterns.

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And they are not likely
and unwilling to get rid

00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:43.420 align:middle line:90%
of that, which is an odd thing.

00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:45.550 align:middle line:84%
It's an odd pattern
of the universe

00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:48.790 align:middle line:84%
that there might
be lifeforms that

00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:51.680 align:middle line:84%
know that they are
self-destructive in that way,

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:53.570 align:middle line:90%
but they keep on doing that.

00:44:53.570 --> 00:44:58.630 align:middle line:10%
And they even fight for their
rights to be self-destructive.

00:44:58.630 --> 00:45:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And another species,
like humans,

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:07.660 align:middle line:84%
they could, basically,
become evolved

00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:10.887 align:middle line:84%
to a point where they
prevent other species from--

00:45:10.887 --> 00:45:11.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I see.

00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:13.360 align:middle line:90%
So they're afraid.

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:15.370 align:middle line:84%
This is all based
on fear that if we

00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:16.720 align:middle line:90%
become our true potential--

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:17.520 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:20.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --we could start
being the good guys and start

00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:22.930 align:middle line:84%
kind of in training people
toward a higher behavior

00:45:22.930 --> 00:45:24.430 align:middle line:90%
that they're not ready for yet.

00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:25.783 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:45:25.783 --> 00:45:27.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
we're out of time.

00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:28.840 align:middle line:90%
That's a good note to end on.

00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:29.740 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: OK, good.

00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:30.550 align:middle line:90%

another conversation

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:35.712 align:middle line:90%
that would be very interesting.
