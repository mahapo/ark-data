00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.581
(enchanting techno music)

2
00:00:30.591 --> 00:00:32.415 line:15% 
<v ->This is a second part of a discussion</v>

3
00:00:32.415 --> 00:00:34.890 line:15% 
with Jane Lahr, who was involved with Joan Grant

4
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.790 line:15% 
in examining previous lifetimes.

5
00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.241 line:15% 
A bond was formed, and Jane has dedicated

6
00:00:39.241 --> 00:00:42.365
some of her publishing career to keep Joan's work alive.

7
00:00:42.365 --> 00:00:45.241
In this conversation, we're going to speak of Joan's time

8
00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:48.691
as a Native American, and also with Mary and Jesus.

9
00:00:48.691 --> 00:00:50.616
And this is of particular interest to me

10
00:00:50.616 --> 00:00:53.116
because she chose not to publish

11
00:00:53.116 --> 00:00:55.541
this information in her lifetime.

12
00:00:55.541 --> 00:00:57.190
So we're going to talk about that.

13
00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.541
But let's launch in.

14
00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:01.191
We spent a good amount of time in our last conversation

15
00:01:01.191 --> 00:01:04.616
talking about Joan herself, and also the Winged Pharaoh,

16
00:01:04.616 --> 00:01:06.416
which is just a beautiful book.

17
00:01:06.416 --> 00:01:09.667
So I highly recommend anybody pick up a copy

18
00:01:09.667 --> 00:01:10.892
of Winged Pharaoh to start.

19
00:01:10.892 --> 00:01:12.991
<v ->What's interesting, excuse me, is that</v>

20
00:01:12.991 --> 00:01:15.216 line:15% 
it has been literally in publication.

21
00:01:15.216 --> 00:01:16.967 line:15% 
It has never been out of print

22
00:01:16.967 --> 00:01:19.616
since 1937!
<v Regina>37.</v>

23
00:01:19.616 --> 00:01:22.094
<v ->And this is 2014.
<v Regina>Almost 80 years.</v>

24
00:01:22.094 --> 00:01:23.170
<v ->Never out of print</v>

25
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.970
<v Regina>That's really phenomenal.</v>

26
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.020
<v ->It's one of the great spiritual books</v>

27
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.325
ever published.
<v ->It really is, it really is.</v>

28
00:01:29.325 --> 00:01:31.747
So now, she had a lot of other books too.

29
00:01:31.747 --> 00:01:33.272
<v Jane>She did, lots of incarnations.</v>

30
00:01:33.272 --> 00:01:34.724
<v ->Yeah, lot of incarnations.</v>

31
00:01:34.724 --> 00:01:36.648
We're going to talk about the life and time of Moses

32
00:01:36.648 --> 00:01:39.898
because in Sunday school, oh, and there he was,

33
00:01:39.898 --> 00:01:43.548
he was found in a little reed basket floating in the river

34
00:01:43.548 --> 00:01:46.174
and a wonderful lady came and found him

35
00:01:46.174 --> 00:01:46.948
and blah, blah, blah.

36
00:01:46.948 --> 00:01:50.323
So I want to get into some of the life and times

37
00:01:50.323 --> 00:01:51.274
and politics.

38
00:01:51.274 --> 00:01:55.348
And first, let's set up who Joan was in that lifetime.

39
00:01:55.348 --> 00:01:56.098
<v ->Right.</v>

40
00:01:57.574 --> 00:02:01.924
So I will call Joan, Neb, who was...

41
00:02:02.424 --> 00:02:05.425
Iit's the shorter version of his name because it's easier.

42
00:02:09.103 --> 00:02:11.377
He was the older brother of Ramoses II,

43
00:02:11.377 --> 00:02:15.352
who ended up being pharaoh, he was supposed to be pharaoh.

44
00:02:15.352 --> 00:02:18.602
But he adored Sensen and--

45
00:02:18.602 --> 00:02:19.903
<v Regina>Who is Sensen?</v>

46
00:02:19.903 --> 00:02:24.478
<v ->Sensen was at court with him, I think a cousin, I believe.</v>

47
00:02:25.053 --> 00:02:28.978
And he had loved her deeply

48
00:02:28.978 --> 00:02:32.453
and Seti I, in his wisdom, realized that

49
00:02:33.253 --> 00:02:37.778
Neb really should be with Sensen in a special place

50
00:02:37.778 --> 00:02:41.978
and have their own place and not at court.

51
00:02:41.978 --> 00:02:44.403
And it would be safer for Sensen because

52
00:02:44.403 --> 00:02:46.953
there was mischief at court.

53
00:02:46.953 --> 00:02:51.478
Ramoses' mother was very jealous of Sensen

54
00:02:51.478 --> 00:02:55.604
and wanted to see her out of the picture and so...

55
00:02:55.604 --> 00:02:57.779
Anyways so

56
00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:03.782
Ramoses II, who was younger than Neb

57
00:03:04.208 --> 00:03:05.458
and not as wise,

58
00:03:05.458 --> 00:03:09.383
I mean Neb had real wisdom, young, had energy,

59
00:03:09.383 --> 00:03:13.108
was a warrior, enthusiastic,

60
00:03:13.983 --> 00:03:16.159
would make a better pharaoh for that period.

61
00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.258
I think Seti was correct.

62
00:03:18.258 --> 00:03:22.934
And so Neb and Sensen,

63
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.060
Seti I gave them a piece of property

64
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.860
that was very special to Seti and his first wife,

65
00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.635
and it was a lovely area with a lake,

66
00:03:33.635 --> 00:03:37.985
and they went there and they had a community there

67
00:03:37.985 --> 00:03:41.435
that was very close to the earlier Egyptian culture,

68
00:03:41.435 --> 00:03:42.236
where there--

69
00:03:42.236 --> 00:03:43.611
<v ->Yes, much more wisdom.</v>

70
00:03:43.611 --> 00:03:45.738
<v ->There was wisdom, where people were treated,</v>

71
00:03:45.738 --> 00:03:48.987
animals and people were treated kindly and well.

72
00:03:48.987 --> 00:03:50.337
And that was lovely.

73
00:03:50.337 --> 00:03:52.854
And then Ramoses

74
00:03:52.854 --> 00:03:56.004
went back to be pharaoh,

75
00:03:56.004 --> 00:03:59.764
which is what his mother wanted, he was the second.

76
00:04:00.284 --> 00:04:02.954
The mother was the second wife of Seti I.

77
00:04:02.954 --> 00:04:07.304
<v ->And now, as pharaoh, he had a tremendous number of wives</v>

78
00:04:07.304 --> 00:04:08.414
and children.

79
00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:09.884
<v ->Yes, I mean he...</v>

80
00:04:09.884 --> 00:04:12.824
Well, on his way back to accept,

81
00:04:12.824 --> 00:04:16.306
after Seti I has died, he goes back to court

82
00:04:16.306 --> 00:04:20.026
and he meets a young girl who sees him as a boy

83
00:04:20.026 --> 00:04:23.564
and he sees her as a girl.

84
00:04:25.258 --> 00:04:27.778
There's love there, real love.

85
00:04:27.778 --> 00:04:29.656
<v ->Is this Habakkuk or is this before Habakkuk?</v>

86
00:04:29.656 --> 00:04:31.982
<v ->This is before, this is...</v>

87
00:04:31.982 --> 00:04:33.630
I think her name was Iry.

88
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.410
And so he goes back to court

89
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.412
and his mother, who's very manipulative

90
00:04:40.412 --> 00:04:44.730
and capable of poisoning and capable of very bad things,

91
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.610
you know, thinks she has control of Ramoses.

92
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.242
But Ramoses says, "I am Pharaoh,"

93
00:04:51.242 --> 00:04:53.340
and so he owns that.

94
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.898
But along with that, his relationship to women,

95
00:04:57.898 --> 00:05:00.660
given the mother he has, is quite complicated.

96
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.878
So he's always proving himself

97
00:05:02.878 --> 00:05:06.360
with different wives and concubines and yet

98
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.488
the young woman,

99
00:05:10.618 --> 00:05:14.248
Iry, he brings back to the palace, to court,

100
00:05:14.248 --> 00:05:18.748
and she becomes ill and really, I think the mother

101
00:05:18.748 --> 00:05:23.490
has her, a priest of omen ends up,

102
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.010
they get her a way to...

103
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.970
<v Regina>To poison her?</v>

104
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.538
<v ->Yeah, poison her, or she suffers from some magic,</v>

105
00:05:30.538 --> 00:05:34.018
and she ends up...

106
00:05:34.854 --> 00:05:38.186
No, she doesn't die but she goes to be with Neb and Sensen

107
00:05:38.186 --> 00:05:40.644
in their special area that I think it was called

108
00:05:40.644 --> 00:05:42.144
the Living Waters.

109
00:05:42.144 --> 00:05:46.752
And she's healed, she's healed there from the magic.

110
00:05:47.304 --> 00:05:50.792
And then Ramoses becomes very powerful.

111
00:05:50.792 --> 00:05:52.294
He's quite a good pharaoh, really.

112
00:05:52.294 --> 00:05:56.372
I mean, he keeps peace, he conquers the enemy,

113
00:05:57.582 --> 00:06:00.494
but he wants ah,

114
00:06:00.494 --> 00:06:04.582
he wants an heir that's winged.

115
00:06:05.474 --> 00:06:07.060
<v Regina>As the winged pharaoh once was.</v>

116
00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.836
<v ->He wants a true heir, someone--</v>

117
00:06:10.836 --> 00:06:13.972
<v ->Now he has over a hundred kids by the time,</v>

118
00:06:13.972 --> 00:06:15.683
as I understand, by the time Moses is born,

119
00:06:15.683 --> 00:06:18.286
he's had over a hundred but he's not finding the one?

120
00:06:18.286 --> 00:06:22.975
<v ->No, he isn't, but Neb, who has the real gift of dreaming,</v>

121
00:06:23.415 --> 00:06:25.245
would be able to identify.

122
00:06:25.245 --> 00:06:27.197
He was one of the brothers, there were three of them.

123
00:06:27.197 --> 00:06:29.775
<v ->Was it Neb that had the dream that you will have the heir?</v>

124
00:06:29.775 --> 00:06:32.087
<v ->Yes, and knew that he would have the heir.</v>

125
00:06:32.087 --> 00:06:35.995
And Ramoses had a dream that he would have an heir.

126
00:06:37.183 --> 00:06:38.385
So how do we do this?

127
00:06:39.883 --> 00:06:44.023
They wanted to have a virgin, so many, 20 virgins

128
00:06:44.023 --> 00:06:46.279
to have this child and...

129
00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:51.457
<v ->It was 28 nights, 28 different virgins</v>

130
00:06:51.457 --> 00:06:54.699
and he didn't know which one but of one of them,

131
00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:56.499
the heir was to be born, right?

132
00:06:56.499 --> 00:07:00.667
<v ->Now to have the Eyes of Horus, it's interesting,</v>

133
00:07:00.667 --> 00:07:05.137
to have the eyes of Ra means I see love in everyone.

134
00:07:05.137 --> 00:07:07.357
You can see the soul in everyone.

135
00:07:07.357 --> 00:07:10.659
But to have the Eyes of Horus, it means you see the good

136
00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:11.829
and the bad.

137
00:07:11.829 --> 00:07:14.649
You see the strength and the vulnerabilities.

138
00:07:14.649 --> 00:07:18.129
That's real wisdom, if you have the Eyes of Horus.

139
00:07:18.129 --> 00:07:20.467
You really see the whole picture.

140
00:07:20.467 --> 00:07:22.267
There's nothing missing.

141
00:07:22.267 --> 00:07:26.899
So they wanted that, he wanted that pharaoh, that pharaoh.

142
00:07:29.139 --> 00:07:31.237
On the last night, I think,

143
00:07:31.237 --> 00:07:32.769
a young girl comes,

144
00:07:35.013 --> 00:07:38.735
and Ramoses does not pretend to be pharaoh.

145
00:07:38.735 --> 00:07:42.813
He just pretends to be a soldier and the young girl

146
00:07:42.813 --> 00:07:44.775
is just a poor girl from...

147
00:07:45.303 --> 00:07:47.653
Actually, she was from an area where

148
00:07:47.653 --> 00:07:52.653
the semitic Jewish conclave.

149
00:07:52.723 --> 00:07:55.935
<v ->She was Jewish or Hebrew?</v>

150
00:07:55.935 --> 00:07:57.975
<v ->Right, Hebrew, Hebrew.</v>

151
00:07:58.595 --> 00:08:01.261
But she's very beautiful
<v Regina>And kind.</v>

152
00:08:01.261 --> 00:08:02.707
<v ->And kindhearted,</v>

153
00:08:04.919 --> 00:08:06.627
and they fall in love.

154
00:08:06.627 --> 00:08:09.869
I mean, he says, "Oh, the old man's asleep in there,

155
00:08:10.917 --> 00:08:14.185
"let's eat the meal that they have, he'll never wake up."

156
00:08:14.185 --> 00:08:17.007
And they fall in love.

157
00:08:17.007 --> 00:08:19.253
<v ->And she was very young, 15 year old.</v>

158
00:08:19.253 --> 00:08:21.705
<v ->Yeah, beautiful 15 year old.</v>

159
00:08:21.705 --> 00:08:26.121
And so she goes back and he wants to

160
00:08:26.121 --> 00:08:30.295
get her some gold sandals because

161
00:08:30.295 --> 00:08:32.963
she dreamed of having gold sandals.

162
00:08:32.963 --> 00:08:36.231
So he tells his brother, we're going to get her gold sandals

163
00:08:36.231 --> 00:08:37.703
and I will find her,

164
00:08:37.703 --> 00:08:41.061
and the brother says, "Oh my God, she was run over

165
00:08:41.061 --> 00:08:42.441
"by a chariot."

166
00:08:42.441 --> 00:08:45.141
<v ->Because, we have to explain the politics.</v>

167
00:08:45.141 --> 00:08:47.391
The Egyptian could not marry a Hebrew.

168
00:08:47.391 --> 00:08:49.911
<v ->No, this was not something.</v>

169
00:08:49.911 --> 00:08:54.443
And of course Ramoses is totally upset and depressed

170
00:08:54.443 --> 00:08:57.561
about all of this and in crisis about this

171
00:08:57.561 --> 00:09:01.311
and just outraged by it.

172
00:09:02.241 --> 00:09:04.799
But the dreams persist.

173
00:09:05.601 --> 00:09:10.129
Neb has another dream, Horus appears, golden feathers.

174
00:09:10.129 --> 00:09:11.457
This is, you know...

175
00:09:12.585 --> 00:09:15.825
It ends up coming out that in fact, the young girl

176
00:09:15.825 --> 00:09:16.967
did not die.

177
00:09:16.967 --> 00:09:18.827
The truth comes out.

178
00:09:18.827 --> 00:09:20.027
<v Regina>She had a baby.</v>

179
00:09:20.027 --> 00:09:22.697
<v ->Well, that's right, she's quite pregnant,</v>

180
00:09:22.697 --> 00:09:25.815
and they want to be there.

181
00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:28.275
Neb wants to be there, Ramoses wants to be there.

182
00:09:28.275 --> 00:09:31.995
And so the truth comes out,

183
00:09:31.995 --> 00:09:35.715
the brother confessed that he lied, she was Jewish.

184
00:09:35.715 --> 00:09:40.305
So that night that she's born, Ramoses, Neb,

185
00:09:40.305 --> 00:09:44.295
they go to this hovel and this beautiful girl

186
00:09:44.295 --> 00:09:46.993
is reunited with the man she loves.

187
00:09:46.993 --> 00:09:50.953
And this baby, Ramoses helps her give birth to his baby.

188
00:09:50.953 --> 00:09:54.733
So now, Ramoses has a baby

189
00:09:54.733 --> 00:09:57.735
with this Jewish woman and--

190
00:09:57.735 --> 00:09:59.293
<v ->And he can't claim her in court.</v>

191
00:09:59.293 --> 00:10:02.055
<v ->No, and the girl does not want to be queen.</v>

192
00:10:02.621 --> 00:10:04.423
She does not want to be queen.

193
00:10:04.423 --> 00:10:08.561
And so she is given the honor

194
00:10:08.561 --> 00:10:11.381
of being champion of pharaoh's heart,

195
00:10:11.381 --> 00:10:13.393
holder of pharaoh's heart.

196
00:10:13.393 --> 00:10:17.681
And Ramsey had a daughter

197
00:10:17.681 --> 00:10:21.161
who was trained as a priestess of Hathor.

198
00:10:21.161 --> 00:10:22.607
<v ->And I think she was barren or something.</v>

199
00:10:22.607 --> 00:10:24.015
<v Jane>She was barren, she couldn't have children.</v>

200
00:10:24.015 --> 00:10:25.035
<v ->Yes, yes.</v>

201
00:10:25.035 --> 00:10:27.075
<v ->But she was a priestess of Hathor,</v>

202
00:10:27.075 --> 00:10:30.197
Hathor is the goddess of love and nurturance and motherhood.

203
00:10:30.197 --> 00:10:34.333
And so they come up with this wonderful

204
00:10:34.333 --> 00:10:39.161
perfect plan that the daughter would adopt

205
00:10:39.161 --> 00:10:41.471
this baby as her own,

206
00:10:41.471 --> 00:10:45.463
and then Ramoses can honor this baby

207
00:10:45.463 --> 00:10:48.161
to be the next pharaoh, the winged pharaoh.

208
00:10:49.211 --> 00:10:50.773
But when they see the baby born,

209
00:10:50.773 --> 00:10:54.701
all of the symbols of Horus were there.

210
00:10:54.701 --> 00:10:58.361
They saw that this was an evolved soul

211
00:10:58.361 --> 00:11:01.091
that could be a winged pharaoh, basically.

212
00:11:01.091 --> 00:11:03.553
So they create this thing--

213
00:11:03.553 --> 00:11:05.473
<v ->And the girl, the mother, the real mother's</v>

214
00:11:05.473 --> 00:11:08.741
heart's desire, Habakkuk comes on as the wetnurse

215
00:11:08.741 --> 00:11:10.031
for the baby, as I recall.

216
00:11:10.031 --> 00:11:10.873
<v ->That's exactly correct.</v>

217
00:11:10.873 --> 00:11:14.081
<v ->And stays as a nurse so she's in companionship</v>

218
00:11:14.081 --> 00:11:14.949
with her son.

219
00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:17.289
<v ->And she is the holder of pharaoh's heart,</v>

220
00:11:17.289 --> 00:11:20.319
and so she raises the baby.

221
00:11:20.319 --> 00:11:24.911
It's adopted by this lovely daughter,

222
00:11:24.911 --> 00:11:28.695
and so indeed,

223
00:11:28.695 --> 00:11:30.527
Moses was an initiate.

224
00:11:30.527 --> 00:11:34.845
He was an initiate of the priesthood in Egypt, absolutely,

225
00:11:34.845 --> 00:11:39.285
and was also a gifted magician, actually.

226
00:11:39.285 --> 00:11:40.697
<v ->A gifted magician.</v>

227
00:11:40.697 --> 00:11:42.855
And so how's the story about being found in the little

228
00:11:42.855 --> 00:11:44.835
basket happen?

229
00:11:45.545 --> 00:11:48.431
<v ->I think they created</v>

230
00:11:48.431 --> 00:11:52.901
a little cradle, reed cradle and put the baby in it

231
00:11:52.901 --> 00:11:55.451
and they did a little theatrical with, you know--

232
00:11:55.451 --> 00:11:57.463
<v ->Oh, what a surprise!</v>

233
00:11:57.463 --> 00:11:58.601
A little baby!

234
00:11:58.601 --> 00:12:00.551
Shall we raise him as our own?

235
00:12:00.551 --> 00:12:03.371
<v ->Yes, yes, I will adopt him, he's so beautiful.</v>

236
00:12:03.371 --> 00:12:07.423
And so that is how Moses was born.

237
00:12:07.423 --> 00:12:11.111
So very interesting to me, of course

238
00:12:11.111 --> 00:12:15.189
and to anyone interested in the story of Moses as well.

239
00:12:17.379 --> 00:12:20.709
We want the next book, Joan of--

240
00:12:20.709 --> 00:12:22.333
<v ->Yes.
<v Jane>The Exodus book.</v>

241
00:12:22.333 --> 00:12:25.673
<v ->So really, that book gets up to the point where</v>

242
00:12:25.673 --> 00:12:28.795
he was born and what his Egyptian family background

243
00:12:28.795 --> 00:12:30.235
was all about.

244
00:12:30.235 --> 00:12:31.435
<v ->Now it's also interesting.</v>

245
00:12:31.435 --> 00:12:34.225
So if you go in Boston,

246
00:12:34.225 --> 00:12:38.485
to a great collection in Boston at the Museum of Fine Arts

247
00:12:38.485 --> 00:12:43.435
of Old Kingdom sculpture, you will see sculptures

248
00:12:43.435 --> 00:12:47.215
where Horus, you'll see a pharaoh and the wings,

249
00:12:47.215 --> 00:12:50.219
Horus head and wings,

250
00:12:50.219 --> 00:12:53.189
and that means it's a winged pharaoh.

251
00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:57.269
So you will find actually examples of winged Pharaohs.

252
00:12:57.269 --> 00:12:58.529
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

253
00:12:59.399 --> 00:13:01.823
I mean, we think of it as something whimsical

254
00:13:01.823 --> 00:13:06.263
or some kind of artistic depiction of someone,

255
00:13:06.263 --> 00:13:08.033
where there was actually, as you say,

256
00:13:08.033 --> 00:13:11.483
in the last interview, all this very rich initiatory

257
00:13:11.483 --> 00:13:14.153
history behind that individual to earn

258
00:13:14.153 --> 00:13:16.223
being depicted with wings.

259
00:13:16.223 --> 00:13:19.753
And so Moses was essentially a winged pharaoh

260
00:13:19.753 --> 00:13:20.853
in his own right.

261
00:13:20.853 --> 00:13:22.661
<v ->Right, in terms of the later kingdom.</v>

262
00:13:22.661 --> 00:13:27.243
He had the eyes of Horus, which is that knowing,

263
00:13:27.243 --> 00:13:29.703
seeing the whole truth.

264
00:13:29.703 --> 00:13:33.423
And then of course, I do believe the 10 Commandments

265
00:13:33.423 --> 00:13:37.381
are actually concised

266
00:13:37.381 --> 00:13:40.473
or a concised version of 42 questions--

267
00:13:40.473 --> 00:13:42.243
<v ->That we talked about in the last one, yes,</v>

268
00:13:42.243 --> 00:13:44.283
kind of got down to the bare-bones of it all.

269
00:13:44.283 --> 00:13:46.473
It was a little less subtle by this time.

270
00:13:46.473 --> 00:13:50.673
<v ->Right, but he was trying to control all of these people.</v>

271
00:13:50.673 --> 00:13:53.133
He was saying, "You must not," instead of

272
00:13:53.133 --> 00:13:54.513
asking them questions.

273
00:13:54.513 --> 00:13:55.953
It was a different problem.

274
00:13:55.953 --> 00:13:59.763
<v ->Yes. Now let's go to Nefertiti and Akhenaton</v>

275
00:13:59.763 --> 00:14:01.798
and that time in Egypt, because to me,

276
00:14:01.798 --> 00:14:06.080
that was the end of the potential for upholding

277
00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.102
any light before it descended into black magic.

278
00:14:08.102 --> 00:14:10.112
<v ->Joan, she didn't write about this,</v>

279
00:14:10.112 --> 00:14:14.852
but Ramoses II in So Moses Was Born,

280
00:14:14.852 --> 00:14:18.452
said he respected two women

281
00:14:18.452 --> 00:14:20.612
in the history of his country.

282
00:14:20.612 --> 00:14:21.930
And why?

283
00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:25.052
Because he thought

284
00:14:25.982 --> 00:14:29.846
that Nefertiti, it was really the one God,

285
00:14:29.846 --> 00:14:34.256
that she may have been Hyksos and therefore, semitic,

286
00:14:34.256 --> 00:14:37.776
and she may have had semitic blood and she...

287
00:14:38.726 --> 00:14:42.866
The idea of the one God was part of her experience.

288
00:14:42.866 --> 00:14:44.996
<v ->But I thought that was really more Akhenaton</v>

289
00:14:44.996 --> 00:14:46.136
because Akhenaton--

290
00:14:46.136 --> 00:14:50.090
<v ->Well, if she was Hyksos</v>

291
00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:52.520
and they believed in one God,

292
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.678
it would have been, yes, it was Akhenaton too.

293
00:14:54.678 --> 00:14:58.310
But it would have very much been, you know,

294
00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:01.400
it would have been Nefertiti as well.

295
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:05.990
<v ->Interesting, because she's relegated to being beautiful.</v>

296
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:07.760
<v ->Exactly, and she was.</v>

297
00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:11.840
But she was also blind in one eye and when she was sculpted,

298
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:15.860
the sculptor, it is the most beautiful sculpture

299
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:16.952
in the world of her.

300
00:15:16.952 --> 00:15:18.026
<v Regina>Are you talking about the one that's been</v>

301
00:15:18.026 --> 00:15:19.652
in Berlin--
<v ->Yes, exactly.</v>

302
00:15:19.652 --> 00:15:22.112
You'll see that she's blind in one eye

303
00:15:22.112 --> 00:15:23.402
if you look at that sculpture.

304
00:15:23.402 --> 00:15:25.694
<v ->Yes, and that's what was relayed by Joan also?</v>

305
00:15:25.694 --> 00:15:26.940
<v Jane>Yes</v>
<v ->At some point,</v>

306
00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:28.152
that she had been known.

307
00:15:28.152 --> 00:15:30.312
And her husband was called, "the heretic,"

308
00:15:30.312 --> 00:15:31.232
in Joan's parlance,

309
00:15:31.232 --> 00:15:32.734
her observation.
<v ->Well, that's right</v>

310
00:15:32.734 --> 00:15:34.612
because Seti I, heretic, my God,

311
00:15:34.612 --> 00:15:37.042
the old religion was he said there's one God

312
00:15:37.042 --> 00:15:40.012
and the Egyptians thought there were many gods, of course,

313
00:15:40.012 --> 00:15:41.422
and worshiped many gods.

314
00:15:41.422 --> 00:15:42.772
But it's all one.

315
00:15:42.772 --> 00:15:44.962
<v ->And you know, it's interesting because in this lifetime,</v>

316
00:15:44.962 --> 00:15:46.814
in the work that I do,

317
00:15:47.494 --> 00:15:49.294
I come across

318
00:15:49.294 --> 00:15:52.834
some of those priests.

319
00:15:52.834 --> 00:15:54.166
I don't know any other way to say it.

320
00:15:54.166 --> 00:15:55.438
<v Jane>You mean the Middle Kingdom priests?</v>

321
00:15:55.438 --> 00:15:56.548
<v ->Middle Kingdom priests.</v>

322
00:15:56.548 --> 00:15:57.688
<v Jane>The mischief makers.</v>

323
00:15:57.688 --> 00:16:00.268
<v ->I come across them, I know who they are.</v>

324
00:16:00.268 --> 00:16:03.028
I mean, I'll be sitting with them or even just reading

325
00:16:03.028 --> 00:16:05.936
their book and kind of suddenly see who this person,

326
00:16:05.936 --> 00:16:08.098
where they were in history at that time,

327
00:16:08.098 --> 00:16:11.038
and then it becomes so obvious why the reflection

328
00:16:11.038 --> 00:16:12.778
in their writing is as it is,

329
00:16:12.778 --> 00:16:15.778
and there are very divided camps about the Middle Kingdom

330
00:16:15.778 --> 00:16:17.578
and also the older kingdom.

331
00:16:17.578 --> 00:16:19.918
And usually, where you find a lot of criticism,

332
00:16:19.918 --> 00:16:22.078
those were the priests.

333
00:16:22.078 --> 00:16:24.628
Those were the more corrupt priests of the day

334
00:16:24.628 --> 00:16:26.878
that were really looking to gain back their money base,

335
00:16:26.878 --> 00:16:30.448
their power base, and those people are alive and well

336
00:16:30.448 --> 00:16:33.482
and out on tour doing a lot of, yeah.

337
00:16:33.482 --> 00:16:35.382
<v ->I've had that experience too.</v>

338
00:16:35.382 --> 00:16:38.052
Some of them have come to me and we've discussed

339
00:16:38.052 --> 00:16:40.928
doing books together, and I wouldn't do it.

340
00:16:40.928 --> 00:16:42.188
<v ->No, no.</v>

341
00:16:42.188 --> 00:16:43.898
As a publisher, you wouldn't do it, I know.

342
00:16:43.898 --> 00:16:44.916
I get it.

343
00:16:44.916 --> 00:16:46.176
(chuckles)

344
00:16:46.176 --> 00:16:49.103
So okay, so now we're going to move...

345
00:16:50.153 --> 00:16:51.373
I don't know if it's forward or backward,

346
00:16:51.373 --> 00:16:53.263
it sounds like it might even be backward,

347
00:16:53.263 --> 00:16:56.203
but now we're coming to Native American culture.

348
00:16:56.203 --> 00:16:59.248
<v ->Yes, Scarlet Feather.</v>

349
00:16:59.248 --> 00:17:03.130
Well, I must say Scarlet Feather

350
00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:05.125
is just a wonderful book.

351
00:17:05.125 --> 00:17:08.518
<v ->It's like Winged Pharaoh but it's set in the time</v>

352
00:17:08.518 --> 00:17:09.637
of the Native American culture.

353
00:17:09.637 --> 00:17:13.487
<v ->In the west, very ancient time in Native American culture.</v>

354
00:17:13.487 --> 00:17:17.547
And Piyanah and Raki.

355
00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:22.020
She's the daughter of the chief and--

356
00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.525
<v ->This is Joan now recalling this.</v>

357
00:17:23.525 --> 00:17:27.480
<v ->Right, she is the daughter of the chief of the tribe,</v>

358
00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:31.530
and I guess her cousin is Raki

359
00:17:33.732 --> 00:17:37.684
who were suckled together because his mother died.

360
00:17:38.344 --> 00:17:39.849
<v ->They're raised almost like twins.</v>

361
00:17:39.849 --> 00:17:42.229
<v ->They're raised like twins and they love each other.</v>

362
00:17:42.229 --> 00:17:45.371
But oddly enough, they're outside the tribe.

363
00:17:45.371 --> 00:17:48.206
Their camp is always outside the tribe,

364
00:17:48.206 --> 00:17:51.426
the chief never speaks to them, and

365
00:17:52.053 --> 00:17:55.693
you come to realize that the mother of these,

366
00:17:55.693 --> 00:18:00.485
the mother who's raising them had clairvoyant abilities

367
00:18:00.803 --> 00:18:04.435
and the chief was really afraid

368
00:18:04.435 --> 00:18:06.710
to incorporate her teachings and her ideas

369
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:09.230
into the life of the tribe.

370
00:18:10.067 --> 00:18:11.049
She believed in a...

371
00:18:12.124 --> 00:18:15.031
<v ->As I recall, didn't she have remembrances</v>

372
00:18:15.031 --> 00:18:17.131
of a much higher culture?

373
00:18:17.131 --> 00:18:20.806
Again, a higher culture, system of justice

374
00:18:20.806 --> 00:18:23.816
and it had descended by this time and chief was really

375
00:18:23.816 --> 00:18:26.686
having a look at, well, this is our inheritance now

376
00:18:26.686 --> 00:18:29.626
and she's going to be, could be a troublemaker almost.

377
00:18:29.626 --> 00:18:32.881
<v ->Exactly, so when she dies, the chief realizes</v>

378
00:18:32.881 --> 00:18:36.721
when this wonderful woman who's raising these children

379
00:18:36.721 --> 00:18:40.573
and raising them to be adventurous, curious,

380
00:18:40.573 --> 00:18:44.843
honoring nature, making canoes, you know,

381
00:18:44.843 --> 00:18:48.378
doing things children should do, and they were close

382
00:18:48.378 --> 00:18:50.494
and loved one another...

383
00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:55.497
So the chief, when she dies,

384
00:18:55.497 --> 00:18:59.622
realizes that in his tribe,

385
00:18:59.622 --> 00:19:02.244
the women of his tribe were treated really--

386
00:19:02.244 --> 00:19:03.469
<v Regina>Poorly.</v>

387
00:19:03.469 --> 00:19:06.059
<v ->Well, as slaves almost.</v>

388
00:19:06.059 --> 00:19:08.926
I mean, they would have children but they--

389
00:19:08.926 --> 00:19:09.871
<v Regina>They had no rights.</v>

390
00:19:09.871 --> 00:19:10.975
<v Jane>They had no rights.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

391
00:19:10.975 --> 00:19:12.197
<v ->There was no real marriage</v>

392
00:19:12.197 --> 00:19:14.894
or honoring of what they brought to it.

393
00:19:14.894 --> 00:19:18.584
It was all about the warriors and they were squaws

394
00:19:18.584 --> 00:19:21.284
in the way sort of--

395
00:19:21.284 --> 00:19:23.574
<v ->The way we classically understand it, yes.</v>

396
00:19:23.574 --> 00:19:27.558
<v ->And so he realized that these children,</v>

397
00:19:27.558 --> 00:19:30.710
Raki and his--
<v ->Piyanah.</v>

398
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:34.572 line:15% 
<v ->Piyanah, were brought up properly</v>

399
00:19:34.572 --> 00:19:37.062 line:15% 
and they were brought up as equals.

400
00:19:37.062 --> 00:19:39.340 line:15% 
So he wants the tribe to learn that,

401
00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:42.414
but the only way the tribe will learn that is if

402
00:19:42.414 --> 00:19:45.772
she becomes a warrior

403
00:19:45.772 --> 00:19:47.674
and he becomes a squaw.

404
00:19:47.674 --> 00:19:50.254
<v ->Yes, and this is really the crux of it.</v>

405
00:19:50.254 --> 00:19:54.506
They each had to fully play out and embody the other's role

406
00:19:54.506 --> 00:19:56.366
before they could lead together.

407
00:19:56.366 --> 00:19:58.166
<v ->Exactly, and it would be seven years.</v>

408
00:19:58.166 --> 00:20:01.916
But then, if they did that and they were respected,

409
00:20:01.916 --> 00:20:05.514
the tribe would see the equality,

410
00:20:05.514 --> 00:20:09.318
that there is the balance between the male and female,

411
00:20:10.748 --> 00:20:13.718
which will be honored.

412
00:20:13.718 --> 00:20:16.148
And of course, it is in that balance

413
00:20:16.148 --> 00:20:19.446
of the male and female energetically,

414
00:20:19.446 --> 00:20:23.076
and on the planet today, that if we don't bring it

415
00:20:23.076 --> 00:20:27.696
into balance, we will not heal the planet really,

416
00:20:27.696 --> 00:20:31.538
we will not, which is why Joan's message is so important.

417
00:20:31.538 --> 00:20:34.808
That doesn't mean women need to understand

418
00:20:35.478 --> 00:20:39.108
man's experiences and man needs to understand and speak

419
00:20:39.108 --> 00:20:41.308
to women with that understanding.

420
00:20:41.308 --> 00:20:43.620
<v ->And this really goes deeply into it because</v>

421
00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:46.950
she had to become a warrior, she had to become a hunter,

422
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:48.270
she had to--

423
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:50.950
<v ->She had to become a scarlet feather which means--</v>

424
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:52.088
<v Regina>And the scarlet feather.</v>

425
00:20:52.088 --> 00:20:55.522
<v ->The most courageous, she'd be incredibly courageous.</v>

426
00:20:55.522 --> 00:20:56.572
And indeed--

427
00:20:56.572 --> 00:20:58.672
<v ->And this is something that we see from that other</v>

428
00:20:58.672 --> 00:21:00.052
lifetime in the Winged Pharaoh.

429
00:21:00.052 --> 00:21:01.490
She was carrying through.

430
00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:02.512
<v Jane>Mmmhmm, mmmhmm.</v>

431
00:21:02.512 --> 00:21:03.724
<v ->And there wasn't the discrimination.</v>

432
00:21:03.724 --> 00:21:07.472
And didn't they then begin as leaders--

433
00:21:07.472 --> 00:21:08.914
<v Jane>Yes!</v>

434
00:21:08.914 --> 00:21:11.744
<v ->Exposing their tribespeople to the old ways again,</v>

435
00:21:11.744 --> 00:21:14.536
the more advanced old ways again.

436
00:21:14.536 --> 00:21:16.124
<v ->Exactly, exactly, exactly.</v>

437
00:21:16.124 --> 00:21:17.218
So they do.

438
00:21:17.218 --> 00:21:20.698
In Scarlet Feather, that's the teaching of it.

439
00:21:20.698 --> 00:21:25.568
It's finding that dyadic, the power of two relationship.

440
00:21:25.568 --> 00:21:27.490
And indeed that book--

441
00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:29.134
<v Regina>And it's beautiful.</v>
<v ->It's a joy to read.</v>

442
00:21:29.134 --> 00:21:32.164
<v ->Anybody that wants to look at the real co-mingling</v>

443
00:21:32.164 --> 00:21:34.894
of masculine and feminine energies and wisdom.

444
00:21:34.894 --> 00:21:37.084
Again, these aren't just stories.

445
00:21:37.084 --> 00:21:41.164
We're not bringing this up as just stories and experiences

446
00:21:41.164 --> 00:21:44.640
of Joan, but these are works of artistry

447
00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.408
and great wisdom

448
00:21:46.408 --> 00:21:49.168
that people can, they absorb it as they're reading it.

449
00:21:49.168 --> 00:21:51.178
<v ->Right. And one of the things, one of the reasons</v>

450
00:21:51.178 --> 00:21:55.555
Joan's books move into us when we read them

451
00:21:55.555 --> 00:21:57.690
is there's a lot of poetry.

452
00:21:57.690 --> 00:21:59.195
And I don't mean there are poems in them,

453
00:21:59.195 --> 00:22:02.467
but there's a rhythmic poetry in the way they're written,

454
00:22:02.467 --> 00:22:06.580
which just moves into our soul and our spirit

455
00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:07.589
as we read them.

456
00:22:07.589 --> 00:22:11.194
I think it's one of the reasons that they have that power.

457
00:22:11.194 --> 00:22:12.909
<v ->Yeah, I absolutely agree.</v>

458
00:22:12.909 --> 00:22:16.269
<v ->But in the Old Testament</v>

459
00:22:17.179 --> 00:22:20.849
the translation of a word that was mistranslated

460
00:22:20.849 --> 00:22:22.424
that I just want to share with you,

461
00:22:22.424 --> 00:22:26.136
Tsela, which was translated as a rib

462
00:22:27.951 --> 00:22:31.206
was mistranslated in that it means

463
00:22:31.206 --> 00:22:35.721
when Adam was to go to sleep,

464
00:22:35.721 --> 00:22:38.766
tsela means the other half.

465
00:22:38.766 --> 00:22:41.703
<v Regina>The other half.</v>
<v ->Out of the dream</v>

466
00:22:41.703 --> 00:22:43.663
comes the other half.

467
00:22:43.663 --> 00:22:46.076
That makes the man and woman.

468
00:22:46.076 --> 00:22:49.403
So the woman is from the intuitive dream side,

469
00:22:49.403 --> 00:22:53.255
but it isn't a rib, it's the other half.

470
00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.623
There's a huge difference.

471
00:22:55.623 --> 00:22:57.369
<v ->Huge difference.</v>

472
00:22:57.369 --> 00:23:02.041
I mean it has deep philosophical implications.

473
00:23:02.041 --> 00:23:06.276
If you're born into a culture that, as a woman,

474
00:23:06.276 --> 00:23:09.356
you come to understand that

475
00:23:09.356 --> 00:23:11.596
your entire lineage is from the rib,

476
00:23:11.596 --> 00:23:13.521
if you're going to take it literally anyway,

477
00:23:13.521 --> 00:23:14.603
you're from the rib of a man.

478
00:23:14.603 --> 00:23:15.548
<v ->You're the rib, honey.</v>

479
00:23:15.548 --> 00:23:16.735
<v ->Yeah, you're the rib, honey.</v>

480
00:23:16.735 --> 00:23:18.409
<v ->Not the other half.</v>

481
00:23:18.409 --> 00:23:20.367
<v ->I felt that even as a little child, I thought.</v>

482
00:23:20.367 --> 00:23:22.502
Oh really, I'm a girl, it's hmmm.

483
00:23:22.502 --> 00:23:23.656
Well, that's interesting.

484
00:23:23.656 --> 00:23:26.911
<v ->Well, this can actually segue into the Galiliean--</v>

485
00:23:26.911 --> 00:23:30.411
<v ->Yes it can, and do you want to go a little bit into</v>

486
00:23:30.411 --> 00:23:31.601
the Eyes of Horus first and--

487
00:23:31.601 --> 00:23:33.001
<v Jane>Yes, sure.</v>
<v ->Who were the watchers</v>

488
00:23:33.001 --> 00:23:33.802
of the horizon?

489
00:23:33.802 --> 00:23:35.482
What was trying to be carried forward?

490
00:23:35.482 --> 00:23:38.768
<v ->As we move to the Middle Kingdom,</v>

491
00:23:38.768 --> 00:23:41.358
into the Middle Kingdom, there were moments of decadence

492
00:23:41.358 --> 00:23:42.548
in Egypt.

493
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:46.010
There are the two books that John wrote.

494
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:48.635
Lord of the Horizon of Eyes of Horus,

495
00:23:48.635 --> 00:23:51.783
about really a rebellion to bring the truth

496
00:23:51.783 --> 00:23:53.640
back into the culture.

497
00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:56.644
And indeed in the Eyes of Horus,

498
00:23:56.644 --> 00:23:59.234
there is a fine pharaoh

499
00:23:59.234 --> 00:24:01.789
that is put into place after this revolution.

500
00:24:01.789 --> 00:24:04.694
Two books deal with the whole experience.

501
00:24:04.694 --> 00:24:06.129
<v Regina>Who were the watchers of horizon?</v>

502
00:24:06.129 --> 00:24:10.361
<v ->They were a group that wanted to get rid of this decadence</v>

503
00:24:10.361 --> 00:24:14.456
but the pharaoh that comes in,

504
00:24:15.946 --> 00:24:19.881
he says, "This is the first law of the land."

505
00:24:19.881 --> 00:24:24.293
And he says,

506
00:24:25.198 --> 00:24:29.505
"The law is seek for happiness

507
00:24:30.341 --> 00:24:32.615
"as lesser men seek power."

508
00:24:32.615 --> 00:24:34.680
<v Regina>Yes, wow. Yes.</v>

509
00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:37.935
<v ->Now, isn't it interesting that Thomas Jefferson</v>

510
00:24:37.935 --> 00:24:42.450
managed to get the word happiness into our

511
00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:44.151
declaration of independence?

512
00:24:44.151 --> 00:24:45.691
<v ->But he was a great student of the ancient</v>

513
00:24:45.691 --> 00:24:47.540
mysteries as well.
<v ->That's true.</v>

514
00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.745
So happiness.

515
00:24:49.745 --> 00:24:52.510
You know, when I walk around and see all these people

516
00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:56.185
looking at their cell phones or on the subways

517
00:24:56.185 --> 00:24:58.845
when I'm working in New York and on the subways in New York,

518
00:24:58.845 --> 00:25:01.050
do I see a happy face on the subways?

519
00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:02.760
<v Regina>No.</v>
<v ->Not one.</v>

520
00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:08.073
So happiness, we are supposed to manifest

521
00:25:08.073 --> 00:25:10.245
with joy and happiness.

522
00:25:10.245 --> 00:25:13.430
That is one of the assignments we human beings have.

523
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:14.375
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

524
00:25:14.375 --> 00:25:15.702
And as you're talking about that, and we talked

525
00:25:15.702 --> 00:25:18.432
a little bit off-camera about the notion that

526
00:25:18.432 --> 00:25:21.827
people's world has become encapsulated in this little device

527
00:25:21.827 --> 00:25:23.157
is sad.

528
00:25:23.157 --> 00:25:24.659
I mean, I'm in airports all the time and people

529
00:25:24.659 --> 00:25:27.039
are bumping into each other on their cellphones,

530
00:25:27.039 --> 00:25:30.049
nobody looks up, there's no connection between people.

531
00:25:30.049 --> 00:25:33.514
But talk about the antithesis to what Joan was saying,

532
00:25:33.514 --> 00:25:36.452
if you want to expand yourself into the all,

533
00:25:36.452 --> 00:25:38.659
you have to first develop your five senses.

534
00:25:38.659 --> 00:25:42.474
This is a total narrowing down of the senses

535
00:25:42.474 --> 00:25:44.294
to be addicted to this technology.

536
00:25:44.294 --> 00:25:45.026
<v ->Exactly.</v>

537
00:25:45.026 --> 00:25:47.966
It is a culture of addiction to technology.

538
00:25:47.966 --> 00:25:49.819
Television, the whole thing.

539
00:25:49.819 --> 00:25:50.976
<v ->Not good.</v>

540
00:25:50.976 --> 00:25:53.213
So now we can go to The Galilean.

541
00:25:53.213 --> 00:25:54.428
Yeah, go ahead.

542
00:25:54.428 --> 00:25:55.966
<v ->Okay, let's talk about The Galilean,</v>

543
00:25:55.966 --> 00:25:59.853
because when you realize that the male and female

544
00:25:59.853 --> 00:26:03.668
are really sacred parts

545
00:26:03.668 --> 00:26:07.133
of what we are,

546
00:26:07.133 --> 00:26:11.158
equal parts but with different scopes,

547
00:26:11.868 --> 00:26:16.448
so The Galilean, Joan in the's 40s, 1943, I think,

548
00:26:16.823 --> 00:26:19.028
started having regressions

549
00:26:19.028 --> 00:26:22.003
and contact with a Galilean.

550
00:26:22.003 --> 00:26:25.928
And this was (mumbles) in Wales,

551
00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.945
with her second husband,

552
00:26:29.945 --> 00:26:31.345
Charles Beatty.

553
00:26:31.345 --> 00:26:34.423
And these were profound,

554
00:26:34.423 --> 00:26:36.525
shocking experiences to her.

555
00:26:36.525 --> 00:26:39.465
She had no real upbringing in the church

556
00:26:39.465 --> 00:26:41.563
or Christianity.

557
00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:45.412
And at first she thought it was Nesera who had been

558
00:26:45.412 --> 00:26:49.227
her teacher, Cicada's teacher in the temple,

559
00:26:49.227 --> 00:26:50.485
she first thought.

560
00:26:50.485 --> 00:26:53.322
But then she thought, oh this is the Galilean.

561
00:26:53.322 --> 00:26:55.772
So that was the first encounter.

562
00:26:55.772 --> 00:27:00.457
And then later, she started having more.

563
00:27:01.327 --> 00:27:05.769
And in the 1970s, when I went to work with her,

564
00:27:05.769 --> 00:27:10.629
this is long before 1979 when Elaine Pagels

565
00:27:10.629 --> 00:27:13.011
published The Gnostic Gospels,

566
00:27:14.195 --> 00:27:17.520
Joan said to me, "He had blue eyes and red hair."

567
00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:21.228
She never said, I knew exactly who she was talking about.

568
00:27:21.228 --> 00:27:25.358
Everything Joan had ever said to me I found was true

569
00:27:25.358 --> 00:27:27.070
over the years.

570
00:27:27.839 --> 00:27:30.044
I would see, oh it's true.

571
00:27:30.044 --> 00:27:33.929
In the research I did, the line of Jesse,

572
00:27:33.929 --> 00:27:37.009
which is King David's line, which Jesus was,

573
00:27:37.009 --> 00:27:40.124
they had blue eyes and red hair, they were ruddy.

574
00:27:40.124 --> 00:27:41.279
They were red.

575
00:27:41.279 --> 00:27:44.042
So when she said this to me, but I knew,

576
00:27:44.042 --> 00:27:46.704
I mean, she just, I got blasted.

577
00:27:46.704 --> 00:27:48.139
I mean, I said, okay.

578
00:27:48.139 --> 00:27:50.624
So, but she didn't go on before.

579
00:27:50.624 --> 00:27:53.702
But then we found writings when we did this book

580
00:27:53.702 --> 00:27:56.434
about The Galilean, about the Magdalene.

581
00:27:56.434 --> 00:27:58.777
And so--

582
00:27:58.777 --> 00:28:01.329
<v ->First of all, why didn't she publish any of this?</v>

583
00:28:01.329 --> 00:28:02.521
<v Jane>Well, I think it was--</v>

584
00:28:02.521 --> 00:28:03.869
<v Regina>Was she just self conscious--</v>

585
00:28:03.869 --> 00:28:05.695
<v ->I think it was too loaded.</v>

586
00:28:05.695 --> 00:28:07.845
I just think it was to be loaded.

587
00:28:07.845 --> 00:28:10.769
I mean, she was a courageous woman but I think--

588
00:28:10.769 --> 00:28:12.195
<v ->Living in a very Christian world.</v>

589
00:28:12.195 --> 00:28:14.370
<v ->Yes, I think it was too loaded.</v>

590
00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:19.356
So what I know from what I read that she wrote

591
00:28:19.356 --> 00:28:20.706
is in the book.

592
00:28:21.556 --> 00:28:24.676
They taught together, they healed together.

593
00:28:24.676 --> 00:28:27.584
They were dyadic, they were the power of two.

594
00:28:27.584 --> 00:28:29.594
<v ->You're talking about Jesus and Magdalene, yes,</v>

595
00:28:29.594 --> 00:28:30.526
in The Magdalene.

596
00:28:30.526 --> 00:28:34.988
<v ->And then after he died, she took</v>

597
00:28:35.698 --> 00:28:39.808
80 or so of his followers on a boat

598
00:28:40.958 --> 00:28:42.668
and he told her to leave

599
00:28:42.668 --> 00:28:45.730
and to take them to the south of France.

600
00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:50.300
And of course, that's exactly what she did.

601
00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:53.882
And she ended up on an island off of...

602
00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:57.842
Near Marseille, I guess, a little island that they called...

603
00:28:59.652 --> 00:29:02.802
That the Gypsies called her the Egyptian,

604
00:29:02.802 --> 00:29:03.566
which is interesting.

605
00:29:03.566 --> 00:29:05.364
<v ->Yes, I was just going to ask you about that.</v>

606
00:29:05.364 --> 00:29:07.196
And they say she was Egyptian--

607
00:29:07.196 --> 00:29:08.546
<v ->Well, there's a thought.</v>

608
00:29:08.546 --> 00:29:11.152
Well, they are different.

609
00:29:11.682 --> 00:29:14.890
I did a book, ended up doing a book because of my

610
00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:16.302
association with Joan called--

611
00:29:16.302 --> 00:29:17.556
<v ->Yes, and I want to spend the rest of this time,</v>

612
00:29:17.556 --> 00:29:19.834
the interview, talking about your fascination,

613
00:29:19.834 --> 00:29:20.616
but go ahead.

614
00:29:20.616 --> 00:29:22.594
<v ->What I've discovered when I was researching</v>

615
00:29:22.594 --> 00:29:24.964
for Searching for Mary Magdalene,

616
00:29:24.964 --> 00:29:27.102
so it was a journey in art and literature

617
00:29:27.102 --> 00:29:30.985
that there was a place in Egypt called Magdalam.

618
00:29:30.985 --> 00:29:35.460
Not Magdala, there are two, but Magdalam,

619
00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:37.000
which was in Egypt.

620
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.102
And she may have been from Egypt.

621
00:29:39.102 --> 00:29:40.465
I mean, I don't--

622
00:29:40.465 --> 00:29:43.477
<v ->I mean a lot of the, again, revised history,</v>

623
00:29:43.477 --> 00:29:46.380
has her as a high initiate, not as a poor woman.

624
00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:47.570
<v ->Well, right.</v>

625
00:29:49.235 --> 00:29:53.785
We know she wore her hair free, and so a Jewish woman

626
00:29:53.785 --> 00:29:56.060
would not have worn her hair free.

627
00:29:57.290 --> 00:29:58.995
She might have been Egyptian.

628
00:29:58.995 --> 00:30:00.710
I think my research

629
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:03.760
(stutters)

630
00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.957
it says in the New Testament that she was healed

631
00:30:05.957 --> 00:30:07.005
of seven demons.

632
00:30:07.005 --> 00:30:09.420
It was, again, another mistranslation.

633
00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:12.675
I think it was, again, a kind of initiation.

634
00:30:12.675 --> 00:30:17.050
Maybe she was healed of spirits that, you know,

635
00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:19.185
the way in which I was healed by Joan,

636
00:30:19.185 --> 00:30:22.545
I mean, a piece of her that was outside.

637
00:30:22.545 --> 00:30:24.295
I think he may have done a healing for her.

638
00:30:24.295 --> 00:30:28.460
But in the Gnostic texts, in the Gospel of Mary,

639
00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:33.360
there is no question, she was his most significant disciple.

640
00:30:34.085 --> 00:30:36.710
She was the woman who knew the all,

641
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:39.860
and he was always surrounded by women.

642
00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:42.255
<v ->Let's talk about that because all we think</v>

643
00:30:42.255 --> 00:30:44.960
are his disciples that are well--

644
00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.010
<v ->Well, guess what?</v>

645
00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:48.600
I mean, there was Joanna, there was Salome,

646
00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:53.120
there was Mary, he was surrounded by women.

647
00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:59.070
And so the later church or Constantine in 325,

648
00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:04.965
because he was really his religion before Christianity,

649
00:31:04.965 --> 00:31:08.645
which was expedient for him to become Christian,

650
00:31:09.595 --> 00:31:14.365
he was a member of Mithraic religion and Sol Invictus,

651
00:31:14.365 --> 00:31:17.805
which was, these were both all-male warrior cults,

652
00:31:17.805 --> 00:31:20.885
so the women were not part

653
00:31:20.885 --> 00:31:22.245
of his religion.

654
00:31:22.245 --> 00:31:23.325
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

655
00:31:23.325 --> 00:31:26.047
<v ->Although there was at the time, I believe St. Brigid</v>

656
00:31:26.047 --> 00:31:29.489
who was a bishop in Ireland but she never got

657
00:31:29.489 --> 00:31:32.407
to sit down

658
00:31:32.407 --> 00:31:36.687
and work on the New Testament with the boys.

659
00:31:36.687 --> 00:31:40.967
So the women were really cut out of the religion

660
00:31:40.967 --> 00:31:44.329
and all of a sudden, it became a very something,

661
00:31:44.329 --> 00:31:45.689
you know, women became something else.

662
00:31:45.689 --> 00:31:49.127
But they were healing and teaching and doing his work,

663
00:31:49.127 --> 00:31:50.569
I do believe.

664
00:31:50.569 --> 00:31:52.809
So you know.

665
00:31:52.809 --> 00:31:56.369
<v ->So the one thing I wanted to get back to also in a moment,</v>

666
00:31:56.369 --> 00:31:58.769
because she was considered to be a high initiate

667
00:31:58.769 --> 00:32:00.329
and she--

668
00:32:00.329 --> 00:32:01.371
<v Jane>She was.</v>

669
00:32:01.371 --> 00:32:05.371
<v ->Yes, did she go into any of the other parts of his life</v>

670
00:32:06.251 --> 00:32:09.171
and Mary's life in terms of their being

671
00:32:09.971 --> 00:32:12.091
parents together and having--

672
00:32:12.091 --> 00:32:15.531
<v ->No, so that did not, no, that didn't come up.</v>

673
00:32:15.531 --> 00:32:17.971
We didn't have writings.

674
00:32:17.971 --> 00:32:21.413
However, supposedly there was a manuscript.

675
00:32:21.413 --> 00:32:25.211
And Nicky, we've all tried, Sophia, Nicky and I

676
00:32:25.211 --> 00:32:29.011
have all tried to find this manuscript but guess what,

677
00:32:29.011 --> 00:32:30.931
it hasn't emerged yet.

678
00:32:30.931 --> 00:32:32.891
But we do have some of the writings.

679
00:32:32.891 --> 00:32:35.371
And the information

680
00:32:35.371 --> 00:32:39.131
is that they healed together, they taught together

681
00:32:39.131 --> 00:32:42.131
and she was really his most important follower

682
00:32:42.131 --> 00:32:46.531
in the Gospel of Mary that was published in German in 1955.

683
00:32:46.531 --> 00:32:49.171
I don't think it was translated into English

684
00:32:49.171 --> 00:32:51.491
until much, much later.

685
00:32:51.491 --> 00:32:54.611
And Joan, of course, didn't speak German.

686
00:32:54.611 --> 00:32:58.971
But the Gospel of Mary, it's clear that she was really,

687
00:32:58.971 --> 00:33:00.651
she was the one.

688
00:33:01.521 --> 00:33:04.071
<v ->And so you went ahead and wrote the book,</v>

689
00:33:04.071 --> 00:33:05.631
Searching for Mary Magdalene.
<v Jane>Yes.</v>

690
00:33:05.631 --> 00:33:08.273
<v ->Let's talk about your work and why you did that.</v>

691
00:33:08.273 --> 00:33:09.471
I mean, was it Joan's work

692
00:33:09.471 --> 00:33:10.953
that stimulated yours?
<v Jane>Exactly.</v>

693
00:33:10.953 --> 00:33:12.633
<v ->And so you went to try to figure out</v>

694
00:33:12.633 --> 00:33:14.315
other pieces of this story.

695
00:33:14.315 --> 00:33:16.353
Tell us the story as you know it.

696
00:33:16.353 --> 00:33:20.833
<v ->Well, I wanted to show, include in the book,</v>

697
00:33:20.833 --> 00:33:24.313
all of the references to the Magdalene

698
00:33:24.313 --> 00:33:26.193
in the New Testament.

699
00:33:26.193 --> 00:33:29.513
And then I wanted to include paintings and what have you.

700
00:33:29.513 --> 00:33:30.835
Then I brought it up,

701
00:33:30.835 --> 00:33:35.073
up through to the present really

702
00:33:35.073 --> 00:33:39.075
so you have the Magdalene was

703
00:33:40.633 --> 00:33:44.633
honored by Jesus but then Constantine

704
00:33:44.633 --> 00:33:47.353
put a lid on that and then later on,

705
00:33:47.353 --> 00:33:50.633
Pope Gregory put another lid on her

706
00:33:50.633 --> 00:33:53.223
by saying she was a whore basically.

707
00:33:53.223 --> 00:33:56.955
And then again, this is illustrated--

708
00:33:56.955 --> 00:33:58.153
<v ->That was a good way to put women in their place</v>

709
00:33:58.153 --> 00:33:59.193
for a long time.

710
00:33:59.193 --> 00:34:00.423
<v ->Absolutely!</v>

711
00:34:01.423 --> 00:34:05.115
And then during the Middle Ages, the real Magdalene

712
00:34:05.115 --> 00:34:08.039
went underground because

713
00:34:08.039 --> 00:34:11.159
there was understanding that she was.

714
00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:13.081
I mean, in the south of France,

715
00:34:13.081 --> 00:34:16.919
they knew she was a powerful figure in Jesus's life.

716
00:34:17.769 --> 00:34:20.759
I did not find

717
00:34:20.759 --> 00:34:24.599
any proof of a child, but there was no question

718
00:34:24.599 --> 00:34:28.879
that she was understood to be a very important person,

719
00:34:30.079 --> 00:34:32.199
partner, companion.

720
00:34:32.199 --> 00:34:35.879
And so I have many examples.

721
00:34:35.879 --> 00:34:37.439
<v Regina>Do, give them.</v>

722
00:34:37.439 --> 00:34:38.719
<v ->In the book.</v>

723
00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:42.401
But the Cathars and Albigensians

724
00:34:42.401 --> 00:34:47.119
who believed in reincarnation,

725
00:34:47.119 --> 00:34:51.239
were perfect Christians, healed, worked with the dying.

726
00:34:51.239 --> 00:34:54.159
They were deemed heretic by the Roman church

727
00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:58.359
and millions of them were burned at the stake.

728
00:34:58.359 --> 00:35:00.639
But they believed in reincarnations and they went

729
00:35:00.639 --> 00:35:01.921
to their deaths.

730
00:35:01.921 --> 00:35:06.639
But women and men were priests together

731
00:35:06.639 --> 00:35:09.163
and taught together

732
00:35:09.163 --> 00:35:12.563
and honored the Magdalene.

733
00:35:12.563 --> 00:35:16.165
But they were burned at the stake.

734
00:35:16.165 --> 00:35:18.723
<v ->What is the black Madonna?</v>

735
00:35:20.365 --> 00:35:23.085
<v ->Well, I guess if you're Egyptian,</v>

736
00:35:23.085 --> 00:35:24.285
(laughs)

737
00:35:24.285 --> 00:35:26.365
you're darker than--

738
00:35:26.365 --> 00:35:29.325
<v Regina>Yes, that's why I'm asking because I mean, again,</v>

739
00:35:29.325 --> 00:35:32.285
the gypsies of that region have passed down

740
00:35:32.285 --> 00:35:37.125
through the centuries that Mary was the Egyptian,

741
00:35:37.125 --> 00:35:38.885
and then there is--

742
00:35:38.885 --> 00:35:39.965
<v Jane>And indeed.</v>

743
00:35:39.965 --> 00:35:42.049 line:15% 
Indeed--

744
00:35:42.049 --> 00:35:43.889 line:15% 
<v Regina>She's depicted as dark skinned.</v>

745
00:35:43.889 --> 00:35:46.129 line:15% 
<v ->If Joan were here,</v>

746
00:35:46.129 --> 00:35:49.209 line:15% 
she might fill us in more

747
00:35:49.209 --> 00:35:50.889
about the color of her skin.

748
00:35:50.889 --> 00:35:53.969
But she did tell me about Jesus's hair and eyes.

749
00:35:53.969 --> 00:35:55.209
(laughs)

750
00:35:55.209 --> 00:35:57.609
<v ->So the black Madonna might be some reference?</v>

751
00:35:57.609 --> 00:36:00.009
<v ->Of course, of course, to the Magdalene.</v>

752
00:36:02.609 --> 00:36:07.329
So I became very interested, and I enjoyed

753
00:36:07.329 --> 00:36:10.009
wildly researching the book.

754
00:36:10.009 --> 00:36:11.651
It was a great joy for me.

755
00:36:11.651 --> 00:36:14.979
And it's won an award, and so I feel very honored.

756
00:36:14.979 --> 00:36:17.471
<v ->It's called, again, Searching for Mary Magdalene.</v>

757
00:36:17.471 --> 00:36:18.414
That's your work,

758
00:36:18.414 --> 00:36:22.261
basing it on Joan's work, but then going ahead

759
00:36:22.261 --> 00:36:23.689
and taking it further into the--

760
00:36:23.689 --> 00:36:26.069
<v ->Yes, I included every reference...</v>

761
00:36:27.311 --> 00:36:30.299
Every reference that is from the New Testament

762
00:36:30.299 --> 00:36:33.449
and also every apocryphal reference to the Magdalene.

763
00:36:33.449 --> 00:36:35.164
<v ->Does it have anything in the way it characterizes</v>

764
00:36:35.164 --> 00:36:37.194
her nature or the way--

765
00:36:37.194 --> 00:36:38.204
<v Jane>Yeah, she was--</v>

766
00:36:38.204 --> 00:36:41.524
<v ->Talk about what she was like and her effect on people.</v>

767
00:36:41.524 --> 00:36:46.519
<v ->Well, clearly, she understood his teachings</v>

768
00:36:47.196 --> 00:36:49.399
in the most profound way.

769
00:36:49.399 --> 00:36:50.484
And there were miracles.

770
00:36:50.484 --> 00:36:54.194
I mean, I think we have in here some of the miracles

771
00:36:54.194 --> 00:36:56.154
that they did together.

772
00:36:56.154 --> 00:36:59.094
And she talks about miracles, the issues of miracles.

773
00:36:59.094 --> 00:37:01.684
She writes about it in here.

774
00:37:01.684 --> 00:37:02.979
We have it in here.

775
00:37:05.079 --> 00:37:09.279
She was clearly the most beloved of...

776
00:37:10.394 --> 00:37:12.814
He loved her in a way that...

777
00:37:14.334 --> 00:37:17.606
She resented, one of the things Joan resented

778
00:37:17.606 --> 00:37:20.894
in this incarnation, she hated to see crucifixions.

779
00:37:24.634 --> 00:37:28.504
He was a vibrant, extraordinary soul.

780
00:37:28.504 --> 00:37:31.374
And to see a dead man on the cross, I can't,

781
00:37:31.374 --> 00:37:33.644
you know, this is not--

782
00:37:33.644 --> 00:37:36.129
<v ->This isn't the message, that wasn't the intended message.</v>

783
00:37:36.129 --> 00:37:38.054
<v ->No, that is not the message.</v>

784
00:37:38.054 --> 00:37:40.539
And of course, the medieval church was so punishing.

785
00:37:40.539 --> 00:37:42.849
There would be sermons about...

786
00:37:44.106 --> 00:37:46.169
Even if it's your sister and she's sinned

787
00:37:46.169 --> 00:37:48.094
and you could pull her back from hell,

788
00:37:48.094 --> 00:37:49.354
you are not to bring her back.

789
00:37:49.354 --> 00:37:52.121
I mean, very punishing.

790
00:37:52.121 --> 00:37:56.001
And so of course Joan hated that, just hated it.

791
00:37:56.001 --> 00:38:00.726
It was a misunderstanding of teaching life and light.

792
00:38:00.726 --> 00:38:02.513
<v ->Yes, not the message.</v>

793
00:38:02.513 --> 00:38:06.905
So what about the famous Last Supper and the--

794
00:38:06.905 --> 00:38:10.928
<v ->Oh well, indeed, the da Vinci picture does.</v>

795
00:38:10.928 --> 00:38:12.013
It's certainly--

796
00:38:12.013 --> 00:38:13.023
<v Regina>It looks like a woman.</v>

797
00:38:13.023 --> 00:38:14.103
<v ->There's no question about it.</v>

798
00:38:14.103 --> 00:38:18.453
And of course, you have to understand, with Leonardo,

799
00:38:20.943 --> 00:38:23.978
his teacher was the head librarian

800
00:38:23.978 --> 00:38:25.658
at the Medici library.

801
00:38:25.658 --> 00:38:29.788
The Medici library housed all the great

802
00:38:29.788 --> 00:38:33.918
hermetic manuscripts and was considered...

803
00:38:35.693 --> 00:38:38.003
I can't quite remember the name of the artist

804
00:38:38.003 --> 00:38:40.173
who he studied with for much longer

805
00:38:40.173 --> 00:38:41.853
than any apprentice would.

806
00:38:41.853 --> 00:38:42.938
He studied with him.

807
00:38:42.938 --> 00:38:45.458
And probably, when we leave here, I'll think of it.

808
00:38:45.458 --> 00:38:49.343
But he was the head librarian and that library

809
00:38:50.355 --> 00:38:54.940
contained all the great hermetic information.

810
00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:58.270
And so da Vinci was

811
00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:03.655
aware of these ideas, without question.

812
00:39:03.655 --> 00:39:04.700
<v ->That Mary Magdalene was that--</v>

813
00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:06.240
<v ->Yeah, without question.</v>

814
00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:08.305
He would have known that.

815
00:39:08.305 --> 00:39:11.368
He also had a sense of mischief,

816
00:39:11.368 --> 00:39:14.168
and so, you know,

817
00:39:14.168 --> 00:39:17.143
he would've, I do think it's the Magdalene.

818
00:39:17.143 --> 00:39:18.243
<v Regina>Yes, okay.</v>
<v ->I do, I do.</v>

819
00:39:18.243 --> 00:39:19.678
<v ->Just wanted to get that from you.</v>

820
00:39:19.678 --> 00:39:22.947
And so when we look at all of this, I mean,

821
00:39:22.947 --> 00:39:24.800
and there are other books as well,

822
00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:29.210
but let's sum up, have you sum up really

823
00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:32.495
what Joan, why she wrote these books and what the larger,

824
00:39:32.495 --> 00:39:35.400
overarching point of all of it was to us,

825
00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:38.055
why we should bother reading them, besides the fact

826
00:39:38.055 --> 00:39:39.455
they're poetic and beautiful.

827
00:39:40.765 --> 00:39:43.260
<v ->I mean, I'm in an arc of my life now,</v>

828
00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:44.870
the final arc of my life.

829
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:48.385
And so I'm losing friends and I'm facing death.

830
00:39:48.385 --> 00:39:52.915
Why? The books free us from a fear of death.

831
00:39:53.745 --> 00:39:55.425
Every one of them.

832
00:39:55.425 --> 00:39:57.105
Why should we be afraid of death?

833
00:39:57.105 --> 00:39:59.385
Joan said dying is nothing, it's like stepping out

834
00:39:59.385 --> 00:40:00.625
of an old dress.

835
00:40:00.625 --> 00:40:01.505
Well, she would.

836
00:40:01.505 --> 00:40:03.225
To punish her, I'd say, dying is nothing,

837
00:40:03.225 --> 00:40:07.065
it's like stepping out of an old tunic or whatever.

838
00:40:07.065 --> 00:40:10.395
But it is the same message.

839
00:40:11.145 --> 00:40:13.627
We are living in a time of terrorism.

840
00:40:15.157 --> 00:40:19.955
To be free of the fear of death is a gift like no other.

841
00:40:20.905 --> 00:40:22.945
So I think that's one of them,

842
00:40:22.945 --> 00:40:27.067
to inform us about how to be

843
00:40:27.067 --> 00:40:29.585
fuller human beings,

844
00:40:29.585 --> 00:40:34.027
developing our senses, having a sense of justice,

845
00:40:36.465 --> 00:40:39.865
and these books do that without question.

846
00:40:40.985 --> 00:40:43.665
So I think the greater teaching here,

847
00:40:43.665 --> 00:40:45.235
and that we...

848
00:40:45.947 --> 00:40:49.987
Freedom and happiness should be our heritage.

849
00:40:49.987 --> 00:40:51.265
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

850
00:40:51.265 --> 00:40:52.705
<v ->Not power.</v>

851
00:40:52.705 --> 00:40:55.505
And power seems to me,

852
00:40:55.505 --> 00:40:58.625
as I look around, in the East Coast we have fracking,

853
00:41:00.945 --> 00:41:04.385
the water is polluted, our children are getting,

854
00:41:04.385 --> 00:41:07.557
my generation of parents,

855
00:41:08.585 --> 00:41:11.609
our children are getting ill when we are not.

856
00:41:11.609 --> 00:41:16.337
My daughter came down with cancer in her 30s,

857
00:41:18.407 --> 00:41:21.727
colorectal cancer, unheard of in her 30s.

858
00:41:21.727 --> 00:41:23.007
There's no genetic.

859
00:41:23.007 --> 00:41:23.744
But I see that.

860
00:41:23.744 --> 00:41:25.447
I have many friends whose children are--

861
00:41:25.447 --> 00:41:27.164
<v ->Are dying before they are, yes.</v>

862
00:41:28.044 --> 00:41:29.707
Not a good inheristance.
<v ->So what is that telling us?</v>

863
00:41:29.707 --> 00:41:33.762
We are polluting our world, the things we eat, you know?

864
00:41:33.762 --> 00:41:35.012
Come on?

865
00:41:35.012 --> 00:41:36.633
How silly are we?

866
00:41:36.633 --> 00:41:38.341
We don't have to be this way?

867
00:41:38.341 --> 00:41:40.173
<v ->To not honor nature, and that's another big thing</v>

868
00:41:40.173 --> 00:41:42.363
in this book, is the honoring, and all the books,

869
00:41:42.363 --> 00:41:45.001
is the honoring of nature and working in companionship

870
00:41:45.001 --> 00:41:47.851
with the animal and plant kingdom and the cosmos.

871
00:41:47.851 --> 00:41:49.473
I mean, it's really very beautiful.

872
00:41:49.473 --> 00:41:50.463
<v ->It's clear.</v>

873
00:41:50.463 --> 00:41:53.333
And to destroy nature and not to see it all as sacred,

874
00:41:53.333 --> 00:41:55.521
this is all God.

875
00:41:56.501 --> 00:41:59.333
It's the living, anything that lives

876
00:41:59.333 --> 00:42:03.051
or the mystery, the Spirit, God, the gods,

877
00:42:03.051 --> 00:42:07.393
it's all sacral and you know,

878
00:42:07.393 --> 00:42:09.946
how foolish to think, oh gee,

879
00:42:11.516 --> 00:42:16.516
I'll trade that for stuff, for power, okay?

880
00:42:17.815 --> 00:42:22.612
You know, I think that's why the books are so important now.

881
00:42:22.612 --> 00:42:27.475
I think the reason I got on the plane to come here, frankly,

882
00:42:27.475 --> 00:42:30.205
is simply because right now,

883
00:42:30.205 --> 00:42:34.617
the teachings are as important as they were in 1938

884
00:42:34.617 --> 00:42:36.400
before the second world war.

885
00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:39.447
We need this teaching now.

886
00:42:40.667 --> 00:42:43.749
<v ->You know, we never got to it in the last program</v>

887
00:42:43.749 --> 00:42:46.127
because people are going to saying, God, oh, I would love

888
00:42:46.127 --> 00:42:47.912
to develop my abilities.

889
00:42:47.912 --> 00:42:51.554
And Joan, again, she said, first develop the five senses.

890
00:42:51.554 --> 00:42:53.127
This was in the first hour we spoke;

891
00:42:53.127 --> 00:42:54.247
and then go from there.

892
00:42:54.247 --> 00:42:56.069
But what were her own protocols?

893
00:42:56.069 --> 00:42:57.397
How did she go in?

894
00:42:57.397 --> 00:43:00.269
What kind of state did she go into and begin accessing

895
00:43:00.269 --> 00:43:02.644
what were called, what was hoves, the word hoves?

896
00:43:02.644 --> 00:43:04.151
<v ->Well, it was shifting levels.</v>

897
00:43:04.151 --> 00:43:06.914
And when we are hypnotized, there's no question,

898
00:43:06.914 --> 00:43:10.241
you will shift levels, there's no question.

899
00:43:11.161 --> 00:43:12.968
Sometimes, she would do it in a bathtub.

900
00:43:12.968 --> 00:43:15.508
<v Regina>Yes, because water is a great conductor that way.</v>

901
00:43:15.508 --> 00:43:16.659
<v ->Yes, exactly.</v>

902
00:43:17.508 --> 00:43:20.169
Or sometimes, it would just come on her and she'll say,

903
00:43:20.169 --> 00:43:23.669
I feel a hove coming on, you know, and she would shift.

904
00:43:23.669 --> 00:43:26.294
And she could do it.

905
00:43:26.294 --> 00:43:29.130
I mean, when I was working with K, her husband,

906
00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:32.350
her psychiatrist husband and being hypnotized,

907
00:43:33.151 --> 00:43:34.796
she would be in another room.

908
00:43:34.796 --> 00:43:36.091
She wouldn't be in the room with me,

909
00:43:36.091 --> 00:43:38.224
but she would be in the incident.

910
00:43:38.224 --> 00:43:40.361
And then finally, the last session I had,

911
00:43:40.361 --> 00:43:43.091
she came into the room and was in my incident,

912
00:43:43.091 --> 00:43:45.751
but she would, I think, it's...

913
00:43:45.751 --> 00:43:47.991
She would just shift levels.

914
00:43:47.991 --> 00:43:50.684
Now more than that,

915
00:43:50.684 --> 00:43:51.806
I do not know.

916
00:43:51.806 --> 00:43:53.241
Joan would have to tell us.

917
00:43:53.241 --> 00:43:54.323
<v ->Okay.</v>

918
00:43:54.323 --> 00:43:55.478
And I understand that.

919
00:43:55.478 --> 00:43:57.331
I mean, there is a process of shifting levels

920
00:43:57.331 --> 00:44:00.516
if you want to go to a certain area for information,

921
00:44:00.516 --> 00:44:02.758
for example, or to blend with other things,

922
00:44:02.758 --> 00:44:04.228
and that's a lifelong journey.

923
00:44:04.228 --> 00:44:06.468
That's what people, I mean, really, like she did,

924
00:44:06.468 --> 00:44:09.091
that's something one has to choose to discover

925
00:44:09.091 --> 00:44:09.898
for themselves.

926
00:44:09.898 --> 00:44:14.695
<v ->Now one of, I think, Joan's interest and certainly mine</v>

927
00:44:15.212 --> 00:44:18.922
is how do we educate our children?

928
00:44:18.922 --> 00:44:22.702
Why not find a way

929
00:44:22.702 --> 00:44:26.830
of educating our children to be sensitive to their senses

930
00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:29.840
instead of sticking them in front of computer screens,

931
00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:33.482
to be interested in history again.

932
00:44:33.482 --> 00:44:36.805
These is our history,

933
00:44:36.805 --> 00:44:41.672
to communicate with one another, to know that we learn

934
00:44:42.612 --> 00:44:46.215
in relationship, in the overlap.

935
00:44:46.215 --> 00:44:47.685
She would always do this.

936
00:44:47.685 --> 00:44:49.750
You learn in the overlap with another human being.

937
00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:51.257
I remember having--

938
00:44:51.257 --> 00:44:52.307
<v ->Where the fields meet.</v>

939
00:44:52.307 --> 00:44:53.879
<v ->Yes, where the fields meet.</v>

940
00:44:53.879 --> 00:44:58.044
And it would be wonderful

941
00:44:58.044 --> 00:45:02.244
to have a university or schools that encourage that.

942
00:45:02.244 --> 00:45:04.729
And maybe there are, maybe Montessori does

943
00:45:04.729 --> 00:45:05.671
and I don't know but--

944
00:45:05.671 --> 00:45:07.628 line:15% 
<v ->Waldorf does too at Fairmount, yes.</v>

945
00:45:07.628 --> 00:45:10.358 line:15% 
<v ->Yes, exactly, the Steiner schools.</v>

946
00:45:10.358 --> 00:45:14.838 line:15% 
But I think that's another area that we need to--

947
00:45:14.838 --> 00:45:16.588
<v ->Teach the children things that are meaningful,</v>

948
00:45:16.588 --> 00:45:18.896
don't have them become regurgitators of facts.

949
00:45:18.896 --> 00:45:19.983
<v ->Exactly.</v>

950
00:45:19.983 --> 00:45:21.590
<v ->Thank you so much for your time,</v>

951
00:45:21.590 --> 00:45:25.790
and I really so encourage people to dive into her works

952
00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:30.443
and go into this exquisite world of beauty and of truth

953
00:45:30.443 --> 00:45:32.230
on a different level.
<v ->Yes, wisdom.</v>

954
00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:34.014
<v Regina>Yes, absolutely.</v>
<v ->Thank you, Regina.</v>

955
00:45:34.014 --> 00:45:35.763 line:15% 
<v ->Well, we've only scratched the surface</v>

956
00:45:35.763 --> 00:45:37.739 line:15% 
of the information brought through by Joan Grant.

957
00:45:37.739 --> 00:45:39.463 line:15% 
She wrote seven books in her lifetime,

958
00:45:39.463 --> 00:45:42.888 line:15% 
including the wonderful Autobiography of Far Memory.

959
00:45:42.888 --> 00:45:45.139
This, along with Jane's work, can be found

960
00:45:45.139 --> 00:45:47.964
through major booksellers and is a very beautiful

961
00:45:47.964 --> 00:45:50.063
and worthwhile journey, in my opinion.

962
00:45:50.063 --> 00:45:52.164
Until next time, thank you for joining us here

963
00:45:52.164 --> 00:45:54.089
on Gaiam TV.
