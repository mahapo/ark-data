>> REGINA MEREDITH: The more
crowded and stressed we feel,

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.350 align:middle line:10%
the more nature's call
begins to have a lure.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.820 align:middle line:10%
Sitting under the stars,
kayaking on the river,

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.880 align:middle line:10%
or listening to the
morning's bird song,

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.140 align:middle line:10%
nature is one of the
only certain forces

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.770 align:middle line:10%
that can soothe and heal.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Yet many of us feel
intimidated to merge with it,

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.660 align:middle line:90%
its animals in particular.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Tamarack Song is here today to
share his lifetime of wisdom

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.710 align:middle line:84%
in "Becoming Nature," which is
also the title of your book.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And you have such a
lovely countenance.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Everybody here in the
studio was saying,

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.000 align:middle line:84%
I can't wait to hear
him speak, because you

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.070 align:middle line:84%
have this very obviously clear
way about you that obviously

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.090 align:middle line:84%
has to do with having
merged with nature, right?

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.840 align:middle line:84%
>> TAMARACK SONG: Well,
what a compliment.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.990 align:middle line:90%
I think we all have it.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.850 align:middle line:90%
We've just lost touch with it.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're going
to be talking about today.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, let's talk about
you and your early childhood,

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.100 align:middle line:84%
where you grew up in
quite a wild environment.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And I would like,
if you don't mind,

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.950 align:middle line:84%
to share with us a little
personal story about a pigeon,

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.410 align:middle line:90%
a guy named Sue, just to start.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.730 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Yeah.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.090 align:middle line:10%
That's a good start because
of my relationship with birds

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.920 align:middle line:10%
and my relationship
with animals in general.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.070 align:middle line:10%
I grew up very traumatized
in my childhood.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.510 align:middle line:10%
A distant father,
emotionally unavailable.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.360 align:middle line:84%
I watched the rape of a
close family member, which I

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.520 align:middle line:90%
can't disclose on the air here.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.620 align:middle line:84%
School was very
traumatizing for me.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.300 align:middle line:84%
If I was born in
this generation,

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.960 align:middle line:84%
I probably would have
been diagnosed with ADHD.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.030 align:middle line:84%
The nuns were constantly
hammering at me

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.240 align:middle line:84%
to stay in the desk, to do what
I was told, to listen rather

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.530 align:middle line:84%
than speak, to be uncreative,
just to regurgitate

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:12.830 align:middle line:90%
what was given to me.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.390 align:middle line:90%
So my refuge was nature.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting, because
I didn't see it as a refuge.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.360 align:middle line:84%
The animals, the plants, they
were my sisters and brothers.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.310 align:middle line:90%
They were my kin, literally.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.280 align:middle line:90%
I felt at home with them.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.600 align:middle line:90%
I felt relationship.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And continue on with
your dad and this thing that

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:32.710 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:33.510 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Yeah.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.280 align:middle line:84%
This was a very traumatizing
experience for me.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.560 align:middle line:84%
I was I think eight
years old, and I went out

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.720 align:middle line:90%
to visit a farm friend.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.760 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in a
small farming town,

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.530 align:middle line:84%
and my backyard was the
woods and the swamps

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.260 align:middle line:90%
and the fields, the prairies.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.510 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Northern Wisconsin.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.676 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Northern Wisconsin.

00:02:52.676 --> 00:02:55.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You know, most
people Wisconsin, cheese, dairy.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.200 align:middle line:90%
The cheese heads.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.395 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Right.

00:02:56.395 --> 00:02:56.720 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, this isn't
the cheese heads territory.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:59.470 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: No.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.810 align:middle line:90%
No cows in northern Wisconsin.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:01.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: So I went
out to his farm.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.400 align:middle line:84%
This is before we
moved further north.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.880 align:middle line:84%
And there was a pigeon
nest up in the silo.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And a young pigeon
fell out of the nest,

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.810 align:middle line:90%
and it was going to die.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't have any
time to raise pigeons.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.870 align:middle line:90%
They were farmers.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.190 align:middle line:84%
So he asked me if I'd like
to take the pigeon home.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And my dad,
miraculously, said yes,

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.220 align:middle line:90%
because he said no to dogs.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.940 align:middle line:90%
He said no to cats.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.960 align:middle line:84%
He said no to bringing-- well,
I could bring frogs and turtles

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.760 align:middle line:90%
home.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.270 align:middle line:84%
That was OK, because
he knew they weren't--

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Low maintenance.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:34.960 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Low maintenance, right.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.020 align:middle line:90%
You got it.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.860 align:middle line:84%
Tropical fish were OK,
but no big animals.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.584 align:middle line:84%
And he said yes to this
pigeon, and I found out later

00:03:42.584 --> 00:03:45.000 align:middle line:84%
that it was because he raised
pigeons when he was a child.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.290 align:middle line:90%
So we had some resonance there.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And this pigeon, I
thought was a female.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.490 align:middle line:84%
I raised the pigeon, and
we bonded very closely.

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.240 align:middle line:84%
He would-- he would
follow me to school.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.394 align:middle line:84%
And he would land
on my shoulder.

00:04:00.394 --> 00:04:02.060 align:middle line:84%
And I would walk
around town, and people

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.400 align:middle line:84%
would be amazed that there
was this pigeon sitting

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.690 align:middle line:90%
on my shoulder.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And there was feminine energy
there, so I named her Susie.

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.801 align:middle line:90%
And she turned out to be a male.

00:04:13.801 --> 00:04:14.800 align:middle line:90%
She was a boy named Sue.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.050 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: A boy named Sue.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.530 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Right.

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:17.330 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And I developed this very
close affinity with Susie,

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.990 align:middle line:84%
and with another pigeon
I caught in a coal barn.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.560 align:middle line:90%
And I raised them together.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And a couple years
later my dad said

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.760 align:middle line:84%
you have to get
rid of the pigeons.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.560 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Why all the sudden
did you have to get rid

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.280 align:middle line:90%
of them?

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.930 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: My dad
was an alcoholic.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.010 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't understand it.

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.755 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't
rationalize about it.

00:04:40.755 --> 00:04:42.755 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: He just made
his mind up, no pigeons.

00:04:42.755 --> 00:04:44.088 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: But he was an autocrat.

00:04:44.088 --> 00:04:46.760 align:middle line:90%
It's just pigeons have to go.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.300 align:middle line:84%
So I sold quote unquote sold
the pigeons to a neighbor who

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.160 align:middle line:90%
lived a couple houses down.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And he was going to keep
them, and I could come over

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.860 align:middle line:90%
anytime to see them.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, a couple weeks
later I went over

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.676 align:middle line:84%
and there was no Susie
and there was no Jimmy.

00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Were they
flying to see you?

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.756 align:middle line:84%
I mean, did the birds
try to find you?

00:05:05.756 --> 00:05:07.380 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: They would
fly back and forth,

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.030 align:middle line:84%
but Susie found a mate over
at this neighbor's house.

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.830 align:middle line:90%
So Susie--

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:12.630 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, that trumps you.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:13.660 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Yeah, exactly.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:14.500 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we were still friends.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:16.910 align:middle line:90%
We were still close.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:17.720 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: She had
a real partner.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:19.720 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: She had a real partner.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.940 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Or he
had a real partner.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:22.250 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Yeah.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, quote unquote she.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.730 align:middle line:84%
So I went over one day and
all the birds were gone.

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:28.970 align:middle line:90%
And I asked what happened?

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.428 align:middle line:84%
What happened with
Susie and Jimmy?

00:05:30.428 --> 00:05:31.910 align:middle line:90%
What happened to all your birds?

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.960 align:middle line:84%
I was probably 10
years old at the time.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And my neighbor didn't
want to tell me.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.010 align:middle line:90%
And it was snowing then.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.140 align:middle line:90%
The snow was getting deep.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And I was playing in the
fence row in the field behind,

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.100 align:middle line:84%
and I saw some
disturbance in the snow.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.330 align:middle line:84%
And I kicked around,
and I came up

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.940 align:middle line:84%
with these birds,
these headless birds.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And there were
various colored birds.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.670 align:middle line:90%
They were pigeons, I knew that.

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:59.990 align:middle line:90%
They were old.

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And I looked, and I
thought, probably this bird

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.370 align:middle line:84%
is the color of Susie,
but he's so small

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:08.560 align:middle line:90%
and he's all shriveled up.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.240 align:middle line:90%
This can't be Susie.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.820 align:middle line:84%
But in my heart, I
knew that was Susie.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:20.850 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And what did
that do to you at that time?

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it had to
be a complex series

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.660 align:middle line:84%
of responses and reactions,
emotions going on.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.360 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: Yeah, first
was deep sorrow.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.190 align:middle line:90%
Then anger, then resentment.

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.580 align:middle line:84%
The whole spectrum of
feelings, it was all there.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.240 align:middle line:84%
I was so immersed in this
life with not only with Susie

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.020 align:middle line:84%
and Jimmy, but they
were representative

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.650 align:middle line:90%
of my relationship with nature.

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:43.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: And this was a
tremendous blow to me,

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.110 align:middle line:90%
because nature was my refuge.

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:50.300 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know where to turn.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.320 align:middle line:84%
I could not talk with
my parents about it,

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.280 align:middle line:84%
because my dad said
they have to go,

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.920 align:middle line:84%
you know, your relationship
with pigeons is done.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't talk
with my friends

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.400 align:middle line:84%
about it, who had taken
over the caretakership,

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.740 align:middle line:84%
so I just retreated all
the more into nature.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And again, I did not
see it as a retreat.

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:10.270 align:middle line:90%
I saw it as a homecoming.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:11.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:12.440 align:middle line:90%
As a natural place for you.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.240 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Yeah.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What did you learn
from your relationship with

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.090 align:middle line:90%
Susie and Jimmy?

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:23.420 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: I learned about
the value of relationship,

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:24.800 align:middle line:90%
especially in later life.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.760 align:middle line:84%
I was able to start
attaching words

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.910 align:middle line:84%
to what relationship
meant to me.

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.400 align:middle line:84%
In my early 20s,
I was frustrated.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:37.450 align:middle line:84%
I was in my first marriage
and it was not working well.

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:40.820 align:middle line:84%
I had three businesses I
was running simultaneously.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What
kind of businesses?

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.620 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: I had a record shop.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.480 align:middle line:90%
I had a waterbed store.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.180 align:middle line:90%
And I had a restaurant.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wow.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.050 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Yeah.

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:49.290 align:middle line:90%
I was busy.

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:50.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
quite a schedule, yeah.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:51.180 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Yeah.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.700 align:middle line:84%
I did it all to be
able to fund my escape

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:56.190 align:middle line:90%
from the dominant culture.

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And I was running
these businesses,

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:01.390 align:middle line:84%
and it was frustrating for me
to have to work with the powers

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:02.350 align:middle line:90%
that be.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:05.100 align:middle line:84%
The restaurant business, I
don't recommend it for anybody

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.647 align:middle line:90%
unless you really love--

00:08:06.647 --> 00:08:07.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Pressure.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.820 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Oh, it's tremendous.

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:09.960 align:middle line:90%
It's tremendous.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.610 align:middle line:84%
You don't just order your
stock and put it on the shelf.

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:15.380 align:middle line:84%
You have to take
care of that stock.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.170 align:middle line:84%
You have health
inspectors coming

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:19.870 align:middle line:84%
who are going to make sure
you take care of that stock.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:22.600 align:middle line:84%
You have to deliver
it to your customers

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.414 align:middle line:84%
in a way that is presentable,
safe, and efficient.

00:08:26.414 --> 00:08:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You have to deal with
some of the chefs and cooks who

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.239 align:middle line:84%
can come and go and have very
temperamental dispositions.

00:08:32.239 --> 00:08:33.039 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Exactly.

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:34.820 align:middle line:84%
So I learned to put
on a plastic face.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:35.870 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't be myself.

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:37.909 align:middle line:84%
It was nothing like
my relationship

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:40.070 align:middle line:84%
with plants and
animals in the woods.

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:42.610 align:middle line:84%
So at a very young
age, at age 10,

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:44.220 align:middle line:84%
I was starting to
learn that I had

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.610 align:middle line:84%
to put on this plastic
face in order to survive.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:48.400 align:middle line:90%
I had to go to school.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.770 align:middle line:90%
I had to live with my parents.

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:53.770 align:middle line:84%
I had to deal with my neighbors,
whether they killed my best

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:55.120 align:middle line:90%
friends or not.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.440 align:middle line:90%
There I was.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:00.280 align:middle line:84%
So I learned to
create a facade that

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.940 align:middle line:84%
would be acceptable
to the greater

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:03.860 align:middle line:90%
number of people around me.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And in my early 20s,
I had the opportunity

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.240 align:middle line:90%
to rescue four wolf pups.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And I built-- I was living
in the country then,

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:18.800 align:middle line:84%
and I built a large enclosure
that came right up to my house,

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.900 align:middle line:84%
because I wanted to be a
part of this wolf pack.

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.710 align:middle line:84%
I had studied wolves
in college, and I

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:26.170 align:middle line:84%
knew that they were
going to evolve a pack.

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Their pack instincts were
imprinted in their DNA.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.280 align:middle line:84%
It didn't matter whether their
parents raised them or not.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.530 align:middle line:84%
So I raised these wolf
pups from 11 days of age

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:37.000 align:middle line:84%
when they were not
able to see yet.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.320 align:middle line:84%
So when they opened their eyes,
I was mom and dad to them.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.267 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Had their mother
been killed or disappeared, or--

00:09:43.267 --> 00:09:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: No, that's
another sad story.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:45.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:45.730 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:46.120 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Yeah.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:46.740 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to hear it?

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:47.010 align:middle line:90%
I'll--

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:48.093 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, go ahead.

00:09:48.093 --> 00:09:49.140 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: --tell you.

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:52.470 align:middle line:84%
I was running my record
store at the time,

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:56.610 align:middle line:84%
and I named it Freedom
Record Shop, because this

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:58.310 align:middle line:90%
was my gateway to freedom.

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:01.897 align:middle line:84%
And I had close relationships
with a lot of my customers.

00:10:01.897 --> 00:10:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And they would come in, and we
would talk about our adventures

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.550 align:middle line:90%
out in the woods and wilds.

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:10.600 align:middle line:84%
And one of my customers
came in and he told me

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.760 align:middle line:84%
about a trip he had just
taken up north, a weekend

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.840 align:middle line:90%
trip in northern Wisconsin.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And back then-- this was
back in the mid to late 70s--

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:27.620 align:middle line:84%
there were little roadside
zoos that had some deer.

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:28.930 align:middle line:90%
There was a petting zoo.

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:32.500 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they had some goats
and sheep and some raccoons.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:36.162 align:middle line:84%
Just representative wild
animals from the north woods.

00:10:36.162 --> 00:10:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And you could go,
and you could buy

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.560 align:middle line:84%
some popcorn to feed the bear,
and all that sort of thing.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And he said that he
stopped at this one

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:47.900 align:middle line:84%
zoo that had a pair of wolves,
and they just had pups.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And that piqued my
interest right away,

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:52.150 align:middle line:84%
because from my
earliest memories,

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:54.170 align:middle line:84%
I had this fascination
with wolves,

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:56.440 align:middle line:84%
because they were the
symbol of the wilds.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.730 align:middle line:84%
There were no wolves
left in Wisconsin,

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:00.780 align:middle line:84%
but I felt the
spirit of wolf yet.

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.500 align:middle line:90%
I knew they were there.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:06.040 align:middle line:84%
So when he told me about this
pair of wolves with pups,

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.660 align:middle line:84%
I had to go right up
there and see them and see

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:10.110 align:middle line:90%
what was going on.

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:11.700 align:middle line:84%
I went up, and I
talked with Jim,

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.870 align:middle line:84%
who was the owner and
manager of the zoo.

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And he told me that the
pups had to be taken away

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:21.840 align:middle line:84%
from the parents, because
the pair was in a small pen

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.010 align:middle line:90%
and it was just pitiful.

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:26.540 align:middle line:84%
The female was laying
there in the mud.

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:30.350 align:middle line:84%
There was literally mud, because
the wolves, the pair-- it

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:33.190 align:middle line:90%
was about a 12 by 12 foot pen.

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:36.332 align:middle line:84%
And the pair just pranced back
and forth and back and forth.

00:11:36.332 --> 00:11:37.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Paced, yeah.

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:38.090 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Yeah.

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:40.520 align:middle line:90%
They were so stressed.

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.270 align:middle line:84%
It was actually
prancing, not pacing.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:43.750 align:middle line:90%
They would prance.

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:46.290 align:middle line:84%
There was so much
pent up energy there.

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:48.540 align:middle line:90%
It was so sad to see it.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:49.460 align:middle line:90%
She was exhausted.

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:50.904 align:middle line:90%
She was laying there.

00:11:50.904 --> 00:11:52.320 align:middle line:84%
You could see she
had been nursing

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.004 align:middle line:90%
and she was traumatized.

00:11:54.004 --> 00:11:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Her pups were just taken
away from her the day

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.480 align:middle line:90%
before I got there.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And the male was
no longer prancing.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.440 align:middle line:84%
He was just standing
there over her panting.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.640 align:middle line:90%
And it was a pitiful sight.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.360 align:middle line:84%
So I asked what
happened to the pups,

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:11.520 align:middle line:84%
and he took me in
the house and took me

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.130 align:middle line:90%
into the bathroom of all places.

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:15.370 align:middle line:84%
I didn't expect to see
wolf pups in the bathroom,

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:20.190 align:middle line:84%
but there in the bathroom
tub were four wolf pups.

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And they had pink
and blue ribbons

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.160 align:middle line:90%
tied around their necks.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.980 align:middle line:84%
He had two daughters, probably
10 and 12 years of age,

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.650 align:middle line:84%
and they adopted
the pups right away.

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:30.090 align:middle line:90%
And they were taking care of--

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:30.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Puppies.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:30.800 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Yeah.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.640 align:middle line:84%
They were their
little puppies, yeah.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.250 align:middle line:90%
They were bottle feeding them.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And I asked what was going
to happen to the pups.

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And Jim said that
he wasn't sure.

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:41.935 align:middle line:84%
They were taking
off for the weekend,

00:12:41.935 --> 00:12:44.060 align:middle line:84%
and he didn't have anyone
to take care of the pups.

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't know what he was
going to do with them anyway.

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:53.630 align:middle line:84%
I asked if he might like to
sell them, and he said maybe.

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:57.120 align:middle line:84%
You know you have to have a
federal permit to keep wolves.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.610 align:middle line:84%
You have to have
a regulation pen.

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yeah, you know I
was a wildlife conservationist

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.695 align:middle line:84%
in college, and I'll take
care of all the requirements.

00:13:06.695 --> 00:13:08.070 align:middle line:84%
How much would
you like for them?

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:11.780 align:middle line:90%
And he quoted me a price.

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.640 align:middle line:84%
I at first was just
interested in one,

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.310 align:middle line:84%
and he quoted me a
price for one pup.

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized that these
pups have to stay together.

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:21.965 align:middle line:90%
It's all they have.

00:13:21.965 --> 00:13:23.550 align:middle line:90%
They just have each other.

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:29.580 align:middle line:84%
So I offered him half the
price he asked per pup,

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:31.112 align:middle line:90%
and he took it right away.

00:13:31.112 --> 00:13:32.570 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to get
rid of those pups.

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:34.236 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What
happened to the parents?

00:13:34.236 --> 00:13:35.257 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: I don't know.

00:13:35.257 --> 00:13:36.540 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:40.242 align:middle line:84%
What would have happened
had he just let them go?

00:13:40.242 --> 00:13:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: They would
probably not have survived.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.000 align:middle line:84%
They were-- there's
an interesting story

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.920 align:middle line:90%
behind the parents.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.040 align:middle line:84%
You may not be old enough to
remember the Walt Disney show.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.230 align:middle line:84%
Back when Disneyland
was on the air,

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:55.360 align:middle line:90%
there was a show called "Lobo."

00:13:55.360 --> 00:14:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And it was purportedly
the filming

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:03.490 align:middle line:84%
of a wild pair of wolves,
but what Disney did

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:09.270 align:middle line:84%
was to hire a team of trappers
to trap a pair of wild wolves

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:10.990 align:middle line:90%
and put them in an enclosure.

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
they were filmed.

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:16.234 align:middle line:84%
And this pair was
the result of that.

00:14:16.234 --> 00:14:17.034 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh.

00:14:17.034 --> 00:14:17.860 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:20.590 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: And what happened
to them after I left,

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:21.390 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:21.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:22.550 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:25.350 align:middle line:90%
So now you have four wolf pups.

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:26.870 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: Now I have
four wolf pups.

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And they imprinted
on me right away.

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:31.780 align:middle line:84%
They accepted me as
their pack leader.

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:34.890 align:middle line:90%
I was their mother and father.

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And I remained their pack
leader for the first two

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:40.000 align:middle line:90%
years we were together.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.620 align:middle line:84%
After that, I think
it was voluntary.

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:49.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't quite remember, but I
ended up being one of the pack.

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And one of the pups
was an alpha male.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Wolves are all genetically
programmed to perform

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.360 align:middle line:90%
different roles within the pack.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.870 align:middle line:84%
There are three
archetypes, which

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:04.810 align:middle line:90%
we humans manifest as well.

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:10.420 align:middle line:84%
There are nurturers, there are
leads, and there are guardians.

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:14.440 align:middle line:84%
And the lead male started
asserting his dominance.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.740 align:middle line:90%
And I accepted that.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:16.540 align:middle line:90%
I was--

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:17.914 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What's
that look like?

00:15:17.914 --> 00:15:19.460 align:middle line:90%
What did he start doing?

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:22.320 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: He started-- he was
the smaller of the two males,

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.120 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.600 align:middle line:90%
He weighed about 70 pounds.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:30.320 align:middle line:84%
His brother weighed 110
pounds, but the 70- pound male

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:34.400 align:middle line:84%
dominated easily because of
his demeanor, his stature.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:39.360 align:middle line:84%
The big male would-- the rough
on his neck would lay flat.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.040 align:middle line:84%
He would keep his
ears down whenever

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.360 align:middle line:84%
he was in the presence
of his smaller brother.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.922 align:middle line:84%
His tail would be
down and tucked in.

00:15:44.922 --> 00:15:45.880 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Subservient.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.046 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Subservience, yeah.

00:15:47.046 --> 00:15:49.280 align:middle line:84%
Just the same as you
see in dogs, actually.

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And the dominant male had
his tail up and arched.

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.570 align:middle line:90%
His ears were perked.

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:56.770 align:middle line:84%
He was standing up on his
toes, just very assertive,

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:58.960 align:middle line:90%
very present, right there.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.640 align:middle line:90%
Right in your face, if need be.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:04.260 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so with you,
you just started noticing these

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.560 align:middle line:84%
postures and realized
the time had come.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.740 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Yes.

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:09.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:10.570 align:middle line:90%
And I assumed my role.

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:12.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And your role was--

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: As a subservient
male in the pack.

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:17.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So how
does that play out?

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.910 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what's that's like
as a human among them.

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: Well, the story
behind that story is that

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:31.370 align:middle line:84%
my relationship with humans was
very dysfunctional at the time.

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:33.630 align:middle line:84%
I was struggling with
my employees at work.

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:35.710 align:middle line:90%
I was struggling with my wife.

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And I would bring this-- when I
spent time with the wolf pack,

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.002 align:middle line:90%
I would bring this to them.

00:16:41.002 --> 00:16:42.210 align:middle line:90%
And they would not accept it.

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:43.310 align:middle line:90%
They would see right through me.

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:45.190 align:middle line:84%
They would see right
through the plastic face

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:47.130 align:middle line:90%
that I had worn all day.

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny, because I would
go through the same posturings

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.220 align:middle line:84%
I did, because I'm a creature
of habit and pattern,

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:54.943 align:middle line:84%
the same thing I
did with a human.

00:16:54.943 --> 00:16:55.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you
were the alpha.

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:56.560 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Yeah.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:57.360 align:middle line:90%
I was the alpha.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was the
alpha with them,

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.250 align:middle line:90%
and I was the store manager.

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:03.150 align:middle line:90%
I owned the businesses.

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:05.400 align:middle line:90%
I called the shots.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.849 align:middle line:90%
They saw right through me.

00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And what was even more important
was the secondary emotions

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:11.460 align:middle line:90%
that they picked up.

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:14.440 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just whether I
was an alpha or a beta male.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.460 align:middle line:90%
It was how I was feeling.

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:18.470 align:middle line:90%
It was my emotions.

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:21.150 align:middle line:84%
It was my psycho-emotional
state that they

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:22.869 align:middle line:90%
were able to read so easily.

00:17:22.869 --> 00:17:25.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And how did
they respond to that level

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:28.359 align:middle line:90%
of frustration?

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:33.220 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: Well, if I came and
I was sad, they would whimper.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:34.020 align:middle line:90%
They would whine.

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:35.460 align:middle line:84%
They would come
and lick my face.

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:36.970 align:middle line:90%
They would console me.

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:39.230 align:middle line:84%
Even though I painted a
happy face when I went in,

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:40.700 align:middle line:90%
they saw right through it.

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And I would just come
to tears sometimes,

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.560 align:middle line:84%
because they were
so real with me.

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.006 align:middle line:90%
I feel like coming to tears now.

00:17:47.006 --> 00:17:48.380 align:middle line:84%
Those times just
come back to me.

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because they could
see you where humans couldn't.

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:51.510 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Yeah, exactly.

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:52.310 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:54.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's beautiful.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And so how long did this
relationship go on with them?

00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:00.180 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: For five years.

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Then what happened?

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:05.780 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: I ran into a little
trouble with the authorities.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:07.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Animal control?

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.130 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Animal control.

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:08.340 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:09.092 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, goodness.

00:18:09.092 --> 00:18:09.892 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Yeah.

00:18:09.892 --> 00:18:12.190 align:middle line:90%


00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.530 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to reintroduce
them into the wilds,

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:17.380 align:middle line:84%
or at least reintroduce their
offspring into the wilds.

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:20.620 align:middle line:84%
Attitudes were
changing toward wolves.

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:22.980 align:middle line:84%
Wildernesses were being
established around the country

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:24.710 align:middle line:90%
and in the state of Wisconsin.

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And there was talk
of reintroducing

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:31.340 align:middle line:84%
the apex predators, one
of which was wolves.

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And I bought a
large tract of land,

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:39.420 align:middle line:84%
almost a square mile of land,
up in northern Wisconsin.

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And I was going to fence
the whole thing in and allow

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:44.910 align:middle line:84%
the pack to run
in there, in order

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:48.920 align:middle line:84%
to raise pups that would
not be imprinted on humans.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.560 align:middle line:84%
So that they could
learn to hunt,

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.670 align:middle line:84%
I would release live animals
in there for them to hunt.

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And when the youngsters were
ready to go out on their own,

00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:58.230 align:middle line:90%
I would open up the gate.

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And they would just go
and acclimate themselves

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:03.900 align:middle line:90%
to the wilds.

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:05.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, I thought
it would really be

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:08.864 align:middle line:84%
good to get some publicity
for this program,

00:19:08.864 --> 00:19:10.697 align:middle line:84%
because it was going
to cost a lot of money.

00:19:10.697 --> 00:19:13.900 align:middle line:90%


00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:16.212 align:middle line:84%
I needed almost four
miles' worth of fencing.

00:19:16.212 --> 00:19:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And I thought there would
be a lot of interest in it.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:19.450 align:middle line:90%
And there was.

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And there was also
a lot of reaction,

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.460 align:middle line:90%
a lot of reactiveness.

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:25.920 align:middle line:90%
I got anonymous phone calls.

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:29.160 align:middle line:84%
The people who were living
adjacent to the area

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.987 align:middle line:84%
that I had purchased
told me that if I

00:19:31.987 --> 00:19:33.570 align:middle line:84%
brought the wolves
up, they were going

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:34.970 align:middle line:90%
to poison them immediately.

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because they were
afraid that they were a threat

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:37.380 align:middle line:90%
to their animals and--

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:38.210 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: And their children.

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:38.680 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And their children.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.846 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: They were convinced
these wolves were going

00:19:40.846 --> 00:19:42.559 align:middle line:90%
to break out and eat their kids.

00:19:42.559 --> 00:19:44.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, that's
what fairy tales tell us.

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.980 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: That's what
fairy tales tell us, yeah.

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:47.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:52.350 align:middle line:84%
So I had some friends
who shared the same dream

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:55.130 align:middle line:84%
as I did to reintroduce
wolves into the wilds.

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:57.280 align:middle line:90%
And I gave them the wolves.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.074 align:middle line:90%
They lived 150 miles away.

00:20:00.074 --> 00:20:02.240 align:middle line:84%
They were out of the viewing
range of the television

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:05.720 align:middle line:90%
network that aired the program.

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:10.410 align:middle line:90%
And they adopted the wolves.

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And they were working
on the same schematic

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.860 align:middle line:90%
that I had laid down.

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And they ran into
the same problem,

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.070 align:middle line:84%
only with their
immediate neighbors.

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:23.430 align:middle line:84%
It was hunting season,
deer hunting season,

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:29.487 align:middle line:84%
and 12 hunters walked up their
driveway with their guns.

00:20:29.487 --> 00:20:30.820 align:middle line:90%
They had just come from the bar.

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:32.920 align:middle line:84%
They were out hunting
early in the morning.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And they were going
to confront him,

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:37.050 align:middle line:90%
because they had the same fear.

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:39.424 align:middle line:84%
They were afraid the wolves
were going to get out and eat

00:20:39.424 --> 00:20:40.590 align:middle line:90%
their dogs and their kids.

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:43.900 align:middle line:90%
And my friend had a shotgun.

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:46.170 align:middle line:84%
He came out and he met
him with a shotgun.

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And he laid it over the
hood of his pickup truck,

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:51.330 align:middle line:90%
and he said stop right there.

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately enough,
they were sober enough

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:58.390 align:middle line:84%
to listen and heed, and
they turned around and left.

00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:59.900 align:middle line:90%
However, they called the DNR.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And the DNR said,
hey, you know, you're

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:03.640 align:middle line:90%
completely in your rights.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:04.880 align:middle line:90%
Everything is legal here.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:08.010 align:middle line:84%
However, we're really concerned
because of a volatile situation

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:08.810 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:10.110 align:middle line:90%
Somebody's going to get hurt.

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:18.140 align:middle line:84%
So the DNR wanted to confiscate
the wolves, and he agreed.

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:19.870 align:middle line:90%
And the wolf pack was split up.

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And they were dispersed to
various zoos around the state.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And I hatched to plan right
away to spring the wolves,

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:30.870 align:middle line:84%
but I realized I was
just going to get myself

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:31.610 align:middle line:90%
and the wolves in trouble.

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:32.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: In more trouble.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:32.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Yeah.

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What is the
truth about the wolves?

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:37.680 align:middle line:84%
When the people were afraid
they would eat their dogs

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.630 align:middle line:84%
and eat their
children and so forth,

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:42.970 align:middle line:84%
what is the truth about how
wolves function and would have

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:46.500 align:middle line:90%
functioned in that environment?

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:49.740 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: Those wolves
were imprinted on humans.

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:52.170 align:middle line:84%
It's very unlikely
that they would

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:57.050 align:middle line:84%
hurt a human unless they felt
an infringement on their pact

00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:58.090 align:middle line:90%
territory.

00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:00.410 align:middle line:84%
Other than that,
wolves are shadows.

00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:02.080 align:middle line:90%
They just disappear.

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.820 align:middle line:84%
They do not look
for confrontation.

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:07.380 align:middle line:84%
They kill only to eat,
or primarily to eat.

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.500 align:middle line:84%
I have seen a couple
of cases where

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:11.880 align:middle line:84%
wolves kill a
second animal where

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.600 align:middle line:84%
it is not necessary to
kill the second animal.

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:19.620 align:middle line:84%
But predators are
basically lazy.

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:20.420 align:middle line:90%
Dogs.

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:22.160 align:middle line:84%
Dogs with full bellies
will lay around

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:25.800 align:middle line:90%
in the sun and just sleep.

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.850 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who has a
hunting dog knows

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:30.130 align:middle line:84%
that you do not feed your
dog before you go out

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:31.050 align:middle line:90%
hunting with your dog.

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:32.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because
they're not motivated.

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:33.030 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: They're not motivated.

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:33.340 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:33.800 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:34.180 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:36.805 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: So these wolves are not
going to go out and kill other

00:22:36.805 --> 00:22:39.340 align:middle line:84%
dogs or kill children just
for the sake of killing.

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:40.820 align:middle line:90%
They're not bloodthirsty.

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:42.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:46.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, I assume that with them
is where your ability-- and I

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:47.670 align:middle line:84%
would assume with
the birds as well,

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:50.140 align:middle line:84%
because you have such a
deep connection with birds,

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:53.190 align:middle line:84%
your ability to begin
speaking with them

00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:57.490 align:middle line:84%
and understanding how they
speak and how they communicate.

00:22:57.490 --> 00:22:58.750 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Uh-huh.

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:02.120 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's interesting,
because some people ask me

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:04.570 align:middle line:84%
how do you learn the
language of animals,

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:05.870 align:middle line:90%
which I call animal speak.

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:06.920 align:middle line:90%
How do you learn it?

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
I tell them is

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:12.930 align:middle line:84%
that we don't have to learn it,
because the code is imprinted

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:13.960 align:middle line:90%
in our DNA.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.530 align:middle line:90%
We evolved with the animals.

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:17.170 align:middle line:90%
We evolved with each other.

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And there's this
nonverbal communication

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:21.600 align:middle line:90%
that is occurring all the time.

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.770 align:middle line:90%
It's occurring subconsciously.

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And what we have to do is peel
off the layers of acculturation

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:30.764 align:middle line:84%
that keep us from being
able to communicate.

00:23:30.764 --> 00:23:32.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's the reverse
of what people

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:38.460 align:middle line:84%
consider to be almost an
academic endeavor to learn

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:39.600 align:middle line:90%
another language.

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.160 align:middle line:90%
You learn Spanish.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.280 align:middle line:90%
You learn Latin.

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:44.520 align:middle line:90%
You learn animal speak.

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:45.846 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:23:45.846 --> 00:23:47.410 align:middle line:90%
And it's a universal language.

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:48.720 align:middle line:90%
It's occurring all the time.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.920 align:middle line:84%
All of the animals are
in constant communication

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:52.720 align:middle line:84%
with each other,
as are the plants,

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.870 align:middle line:90%
and the wind, the atmosphere.

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:56.450 align:middle line:84%
Everything is
communicating, which

00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:59.750 align:middle line:84%
is why there is such beautiful
synchronicity in nature.

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:01.140 align:middle line:90%
And we can be there too.

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:03.780 align:middle line:90%
We can be attuned to that.

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:06.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: In your book, you
talk about the fact that men

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:11.160 align:middle line:84%
have lost their abilities more
so than women to go into this

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.390 align:middle line:90%
more natural frame of mind.

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:16.010 align:middle line:90%
Could you explain that to us?

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:18.920 align:middle line:84%
Because we would tend
to flip it in our minds

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:22.060 align:middle line:84%
that men are more oriented
toward nature and perhaps women

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:22.860 align:middle line:90%
less so.

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:24.310 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: You'd think so.

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:28.750 align:middle line:84%
Men are more oriented toward
nature in a domineering sense.

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:31.200 align:middle line:84%
Women are more
oriented toward nature,

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.940 align:middle line:84%
and toward their own
kind, I think, in more

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:35.740 align:middle line:90%
of an interactive sense.

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's just plain
pure biological programming.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.770 align:middle line:84%
There's also
cultural conditioning

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:45.680 align:middle line:84%
and social realities,
which place

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:48.120 align:middle line:84%
men in a specific
role in this culture,

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:51.440 align:middle line:84%
and place women in a specific
role in this culture.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.550 align:middle line:84%
These boundaries are
eroding right now,

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:57.270 align:middle line:90%
but it's still very predominant.

00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:59.030 align:middle line:90%
We have male leaders.

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:02.410 align:middle line:84%
We have males who are
expected to be leads,

00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:07.160 align:middle line:84%
even though they are
biologically nurturers

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:09.220 align:middle line:90%
or guardians.

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:11.540 align:middle line:84%
They're still expected
to be assertive,

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:13.050 align:middle line:84%
to get out there
and make a living,

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:15.910 align:middle line:84%
to head up a family,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:20.510 align:middle line:84%
So men have, I think, more
layers of conditioning

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:23.590 align:middle line:84%
that they need to break through
than women do in general.

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:25.286 align:middle line:84%
That's a very gross
generalization.

00:25:25.286 --> 00:25:26.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Of course.

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:26.960 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.520 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: The last thing I want
to do is to start pigeonholing

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:30.180 align:middle line:90%
genders.

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:30.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:31.812 align:middle line:90%
Because that's all blending.

00:25:31.812 --> 00:25:32.770 align:middle line:90%
The lines are changing.

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:33.616 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Exactly.

00:25:33.616 --> 00:25:34.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And maybe to
bridge that part of the story,

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:44.040 align:middle line:84%
you also went into training with
the-- how do I say it again--

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:44.840 align:middle line:90%
Ojibwe.

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:45.640 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Ojibwe.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:47.300 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: The Ojibwe elders.

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.870 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us a little
bit about how that happened

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:52.650 align:middle line:84%
in your life and what you began
learning there that would then

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:54.730 align:middle line:90%
translate into this work?

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:55.530 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Yeah.

00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:56.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:57.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And tell
us about the Ojibwe.

00:25:57.670 --> 00:25:58.470 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Uh-huh.

00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:03.830 align:middle line:84%
The Ojibwe people are a tribe
in the Algonquin culture.

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:08.370 align:middle line:84%
Northeastern North America
is primarily Algonquin.

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:10.840 align:middle line:84%
There's an interesting history
with the Algonquin people.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:15.100 align:middle line:84%
They're woodland people,
hunters, gatherers, very little

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:17.180 align:middle line:90%
agriculture if any.

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:20.900 align:middle line:84%
They live by fishing,
hunting, gathering wild rice,

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:23.690 align:middle line:84%
gathering wild
berries and edibles.

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And there's just a little
interesting back story here

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:31.690 align:middle line:84%
in that the early
Norse people who

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:35.410 align:middle line:84%
came over and landed
on the east coast

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:37.230 align:middle line:84%
interacted with the
Algonquin people.

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:38.492 align:middle line:90%
And the Ojibwe language now--

00:26:38.492 --> 00:26:40.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's what
I was just going to ask.

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:41.120 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: You were.

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:41.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:42.030 align:middle line:90%
So go ahead, please.

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:43.613 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: Oh, it's a
fascinating story.

00:26:43.613 --> 00:26:44.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:47.600 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: There are Norse
words, old Germanic words,

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:51.310 align:middle line:84%
embedded in the
Algonquin languages.

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:55.530 align:middle line:84%
The five clans, the
five Algonquin clans,

00:26:55.530 --> 00:27:00.590 align:middle line:84%
are the same as the five Norse
clans, the ancient Norse clans.

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:04.230 align:middle line:84%
The sweat lodge ceremony
that is practiced

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:08.880 align:middle line:84%
in the Northeastern part
of the country is actually,

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:12.170 align:middle line:84%
you might say, the
preservation of the early sauna

00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:13.800 align:middle line:90%
tradition in Europe.

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.240 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
cross-cultural pollination

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:18.240 align:middle line:90%
that was going on there.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And I remember my grandmother,
my German grandmother.

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:25.170 align:middle line:90%
She would talk about her noggin.

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:28.770 align:middle line:84%
If I bumped my head when I was
a kid, oh, you hurt your noggin.

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:29.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:35.030 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: And the term for a
bowl in the Ojibwe language is

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:36.470 align:middle line:90%
[OJIBWE].

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And I see a ceremonial
crossover there,

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:45.110 align:middle line:84%
because skulls are used
as ceremonial receptacles

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:47.950 align:middle line:90%
and there's the same term.

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:50.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, I haven't confirmed
this with any linguists,

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:52.720 align:middle line:84%
but I just see
these relationships.

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:53.520 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: It just
seems so obvious.

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:58.260 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So now, back to
your relationship with them.

00:27:58.260 --> 00:27:59.690 align:middle line:90%
What age were you roughly?

00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And what was your motive
for your training with them?

00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:05.957 align:middle line:90%
And what did you learn?

00:28:05.957 --> 00:28:07.040 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: It started early.

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:09.790 align:middle line:84%
I was probably seven
or eight years of age.

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:11.930 align:middle line:84%
My dad would not come
straight home from work.

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:15.190 align:middle line:84%
He would stop at the bar and
he'd be there a couple hours

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:15.990 align:middle line:90%
and come home.

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:20.697 align:middle line:84%
One day he brought a Native
man home from the bar,

00:28:20.697 --> 00:28:23.930 align:middle line:84%
and he was going to
have supper with us.

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:24.750 align:middle line:90%
And I was a kid.

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:26.840 align:middle line:84%
We were playing cowboys
and Indians in the yard,

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.410 align:middle line:90%
and I was just fascinated with--

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:29.993 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You had
a real live Indian.

00:28:29.993 --> 00:28:32.530 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: Yeah, a real live
Indian at supper, yet.

00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And I peppered him
with questions.

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And he answered some
of my questions.

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes he
would just smile.

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And my dad said, hey, why
don't you just let him eat?

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And OK, I thought that
would be all right.

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.480 align:middle line:90%
Yet, the seed was planted.

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:50.920 align:middle line:90%
There were real live Indians.

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:53.180 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just cowboys
and Indians on television,

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:54.190 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:59.140 align:middle line:84%
So as I grew up, I
studied Native life way.

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:03.820 align:middle line:84%
I went to college and took
anthropology and psychology

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:04.970 align:middle line:90%
and botany classes.

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And I learned about
native plants,

00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:09.040 align:middle line:90%
the native uses of plants.

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.989 align:middle line:10%
And I started to spend
time on the reservations,

00:29:11.989 --> 00:29:13.197 align:middle line:10%
and I got to know the elders.

00:29:13.197 --> 00:29:16.790 align:middle line:90%


00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:19.590 align:middle line:84%
Two of the several times that
I dropped out of college,

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:21.660 align:middle line:84%
I hitchhiked around
the country looking

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:23.800 align:middle line:84%
for Native elders who
still practiced some

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.210 align:middle line:90%
of their old traditional ways.

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And I apprenticed to them
to learn about anything they

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:32.380 align:middle line:90%
would like to share with me.

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And this all relates to my
earlier story about my life

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:38.590 align:middle line:90%
with animals.

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And I saw the Native
people as being animals.

00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And here's part of the
disconnect, I think,

00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:52.950 align:middle line:84%
that we civilized people
experience, which is why we are

00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:54.450 align:middle line:90%
not attuned to nature speak.

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:58.170 align:middle line:84%
Which is why we use the Earth
as a garbage can, essentially.

00:29:58.170 --> 00:30:02.710 align:middle line:84%
We are not in relationship
with our surroundings anymore.

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And what I learned
from them is, first

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:08.410 align:middle line:90%
of all that I am an animal.

00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:10.090 align:middle line:90%
Biologically, I'm an animal.

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:10.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:13.770 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: My DNA,
it's animal DNA.

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:16.750 align:middle line:84%
My needs, my wants and desires,
are the same as any animal's

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:18.230 align:middle line:90%
needs, wants, and desires.

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:20.760 align:middle line:90%
There's really no difference.

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And that helped me to relax
around the distinctions

00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:28.680 align:middle line:84%
that I was forced to grow
up with about civilization

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:32.660 align:middle line:84%
and nature, about my nature
and nature out there.

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:35.830 align:middle line:84%
I learned from these elders
that my nature is nature.

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:36.830 align:middle line:90%
There is no difference.

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:38.490 align:middle line:90%
There is no distinction.

00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:41.860 align:middle line:84%
So I did not have to
be ashamed of my desire

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:44.320 align:middle line:84%
to be with animals
more than humans,

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:47.840 align:middle line:84%
because these animals were more
human than these humans were,

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.110 align:middle line:90%
as I saw it.

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They were acting in
a more logical rhythm of life

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:55.400 align:middle line:90%
in every way.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And they were in
deeper communication.

00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And you talk about this in your
book, about just our thought

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:05.490 align:middle line:84%
processes alone that you
have to merge with the animal

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:08.770 align:middle line:84%
and essentially
merge minds in order

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:11.740 align:middle line:84%
to be able to communicate
with animals, speak with them,

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:13.090 align:middle line:90%
understand them.

00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And yet we have
this block of using

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:23.030 align:middle line:84%
mostly words with our
minds, and projecting words.

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Thinking in these symbolic
terms instead of natural terms.

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:29.420 align:middle line:90%
And you were an educated man.

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:33.110 align:middle line:84%
So how did this process
begin for you, then,

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:36.400 align:middle line:84%
to really start understanding
the nuances of what

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:40.840 align:middle line:84%
it means to merge with an animal
and merge with an animal mind?

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:44.170 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: This is neat, because
several threads came together

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:45.240 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:48.880 align:middle line:84%
There was my relationship
with animals and nature.

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:52.060 align:middle line:84%
There was my
fascination with Zen,

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:55.750 align:middle line:84%
which I picked up at an
early age and followed

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:57.140 align:middle line:90%
and still follow.

00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And there was what
I was learning

00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:00.280 align:middle line:90%
from the native elders.

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And all of this was merging and
speaking about consciousness.

00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:07.260 align:middle line:90%
What is consciousness?

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And it seemed as though there
was a contradiction here,

00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:15.410 align:middle line:84%
because in order to be
immersed in nature, in order

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:19.120 align:middle line:84%
to be who I truly am, I
needed to be unconscious.

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:22.800 align:middle line:84%
I needed to strip away
any semblance of self.

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't a denial or
suppression of who I am

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.010 align:middle line:90%
or how I am by any means.

00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:33.680 align:middle line:84%
But it was a merging
of a one into the all.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:37.665 align:middle line:84%
A beautiful example is the
prey predator relationship.

00:32:37.665 --> 00:32:40.920 align:middle line:90%
A wolf will stalk a deer.

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And if the wolf says, I'm
a wolf, and I'm hungry,

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:47.160 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to kill that
deer, the deer is going

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.720 align:middle line:84%
to pick up on that
energy and bolt.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.730 align:middle line:90%
And it's not going to work.

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:55.280 align:middle line:84%
The wolf has to forget about
everything that the wolf came

00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:58.210 align:middle line:90%
here for and become the hunt.

00:32:58.210 --> 00:32:59.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And is
that what they do?

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:01.265 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: That's what they do.

00:33:01.265 --> 00:33:02.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And by
the same token,

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:07.290 align:middle line:84%
you say in the book that
from the deer's end,

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:09.980 align:middle line:84%
there can be a wolf
in the vicinity,

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:12.880 align:middle line:84%
but they can also merge with the
wolf and know that the wolf is

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.780 align:middle line:90%
not hungry.

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:16.160 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: This is nature speak.

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.540 align:middle line:90%
Deer can pick this up.

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:17.860 align:middle line:90%
They just--

00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:19.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And they'll
know not to be afraid.

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: They'll know
not to be afraid,

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.840 align:middle line:84%
even though there's
a wolf there.

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:24.480 align:middle line:84%
Wolf does not mean terror,
does not mean death,

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:27.810 align:middle line:84%
unless the wolf is
hungry and hunting.

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:32.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so they're
automatically merging with each

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.600 align:middle line:84%
other's field of
intelligence all the time.

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:35.720 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Yes.

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:36.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:39.587 align:middle line:84%
During the hunt, the
wolf and the deer

00:33:39.587 --> 00:33:40.670 align:middle line:90%
forget about who they are.

00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:42.300 align:middle line:90%
They become the hunt.

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:43.550 align:middle line:90%
They become this dynamic.

00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:47.290 align:middle line:84%
They are in relationship,
and they need each other.

00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:49.810 align:middle line:84%
They literally feed
off of each other.

00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:51.830 align:middle line:84%
The deer herd does
not stay healthy

00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:55.750 align:middle line:84%
if the wolf is not hunting
the deer, and vice versa.

00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:57.750 align:middle line:90%
So there's this interplay.

00:33:57.750 --> 00:34:01.030 align:middle line:84%
And there is fear
during a hunt, for sure.

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:02.670 align:middle line:90%
There's terror.

00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:03.470 align:middle line:90%
There's death.

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:05.429 align:middle line:90%
There's trauma.

00:34:05.429 --> 00:34:07.345 align:middle line:84%
However, they would not
have it any other way,

00:34:07.345 --> 00:34:09.739 align:middle line:90%
if they could make a choice.

00:34:09.739 --> 00:34:12.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Is that what you came
to understand when you began

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:14.969 align:middle line:84%
merging with their
consciousness?

00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:17.090 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Yes.

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:19.730 align:middle line:90%
It just is.

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:20.650 align:middle line:90%
Death isn't good.

00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:22.770 align:middle line:90%
Death isn't bad.

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:24.870 align:middle line:90%
The hunt isn't good or bad.

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:26.350 align:middle line:90%
I no longer judge hunters.

00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:31.340 align:middle line:84%
I had thought for a long time
that hunters, these men who

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:34.462 align:middle line:84%
go out with their
guns and shoot deer

00:34:34.462 --> 00:34:35.920 align:middle line:84%
and they don't
understand the deer,

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:39.620 align:middle line:84%
they don't have a
relationship with their prey.

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:41.179 align:middle line:90%
I judged them.

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:42.600 align:middle line:90%
This is bad.

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:46.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you need the
deer to feed your family,

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:47.750 align:middle line:90%
that's another story.

00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:49.610 align:middle line:84%
But if you're just going out
for the sport of the hunt,

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:50.460 align:middle line:90%
forget it.

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:55.310 align:middle line:84%
Once I understood what goes
on in the psyche of a hunter,

00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:58.810 align:middle line:84%
I had an entirely different
feeling toward hunters.

00:34:58.810 --> 00:35:01.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Did you feel that
somehow the act of human

00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:06.530 align:middle line:84%
hunting animal was mimicking
that natural cycle of the wolf

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:08.270 align:middle line:90%
and the deer?

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:12.480 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: We evolved as hunters.

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:15.870 align:middle line:84%
Early in human
evolution, my studies

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:20.440 align:middle line:84%
have shown me that
we started probably

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:24.380 align:middle line:84%
as primarily vegetarians,
as forest primates.

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:27.500 align:middle line:84%
When we moved out
into the savanna,

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:31.510 align:middle line:84%
we followed the packs
of the predators,

00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:33.320 align:middle line:84%
and started
scavenging, actually.

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:35.320 align:middle line:84%
We started eating
meat as scavengers,

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:41.010 align:middle line:84%
probably because pre-humans
were very small, very frail,

00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:43.500 align:middle line:84%
in comparison with the
other carnivores who

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:44.850 align:middle line:90%
are out there hunting.

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:49.520 align:middle line:84%
So we followed the
other predators around.

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:51.102 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Ate their spoils.

00:35:51.102 --> 00:35:53.310 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: Ate their spoils,
the marrow from the bones,

00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:55.060 align:middle line:90%
any scrap that they left behind.

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And we gradually
learned to hunt.

00:35:57.410 --> 00:36:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And we gradually became
a cooperative species

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:02.370 align:middle line:90%
through the hunt.

00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:05.190 align:middle line:84%
Just as a pack of wolves has
to be very coordinated to hunt,

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:07.360 align:middle line:84%
we learned to be very
coordinated to hunt.

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:09.460 align:middle line:90%
We were frail as individuals.

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:12.800 align:middle line:84%
However, as a pack,
we were strong.

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:17.610 align:middle line:84%
So this probably contributed
vastly to our human evolution,

00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:21.850 align:middle line:84%
toward becoming bipedal,
toward becoming taller,

00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:23.810 align:middle line:84%
toward our large
cranial capacity.

00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:26.500 align:middle line:84%
In order to coordinate
for the hunt.

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:28.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And yet at the
same time you can see a kind

00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:32.760 align:middle line:84%
of distinct difference
between hunters in terms

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:36.060 align:middle line:84%
of the motivations of one
hunter versus the other,

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:40.490 align:middle line:84%
where if there is just dominance
that's the concern, you know,

00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:41.710 align:middle line:90%
that's one mentality.

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:45.740 align:middle line:84%
Versus one that is more
in companionship, a need.

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:46.540 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:47.830 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Yeah, very much so.

00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:49.621 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And the
animal kingdom can sense

00:36:49.621 --> 00:36:50.840 align:middle line:90%
the difference in this too.

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:51.540 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Yes.

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:52.340 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:53.580 align:middle line:90%
Very easily.

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:55.260 align:middle line:90%
Very easily.

00:36:55.260 --> 00:37:01.020 align:middle line:84%
You notice when-- perhaps
you experience this yourself.

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:05.760 align:middle line:84%
When you go out in the woods
or the prairie or the lake

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:08.560 align:middle line:84%
shore, wherever you go,
and you want to go out.

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And you want to see the birds
and see the other animals.

00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:13.320 align:middle line:90%
And everything gets quiet.

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:14.990 align:middle line:90%
They disappear.

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:18.230 align:middle line:84%
They pick up on the
fact that you are out

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:20.960 align:middle line:90%
of place and out of sync.

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:25.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, that is not because we are
there, but because of the way

00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:26.150 align:middle line:90%
we're there.

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:28.460 align:middle line:84%
What we civilized
people typically do,

00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:31.350 align:middle line:84%
if there's a hill, we will
climb to the top of the hill,

00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:32.370 align:middle line:90%
because we want a view.

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:34.010 align:middle line:90%
We want this vantage point.

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:35.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, we stick out
like sore thumbs there.

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.509 align:middle line:84%
And all the animals
pick it up, and they--

00:37:37.509 --> 00:37:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They split.

00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:39.830 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: They split.

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:42.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we become a
shadow and walk around

00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:46.120 align:middle line:84%
the perimeter of the hill,
in the shadows of the trees,

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:49.530 align:middle line:84%
and we look out, we're
going to see so much more.

00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:51.460 align:middle line:90%
Everybody is aware of this.

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:53.740 align:middle line:84%
If you're walking down
a city street at night,

00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:57.280 align:middle line:84%
you can look into lit
windows very easily.

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:59.500 align:middle line:84%
You can look in from
the shadow to the light.

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:01.930 align:middle line:84%
But the people inside cannot
look out from the light

00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:03.020 align:middle line:90%
to the shadow.

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:03.820 align:middle line:90%
Duh.

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:04.640 align:middle line:90%
It's common sense.

00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:05.830 align:middle line:90%
We just don't realize it.

00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:09.310 align:middle line:84%
So if we carry this awareness--
we have the knowledge already.

00:38:09.310 --> 00:38:13.492 align:middle line:84%
If we just apply it to our time
in nature, it's going to work.

00:38:13.492 --> 00:38:14.450 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And you mentioned
this a moment ago,

00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:19.000 align:middle line:84%
that in the hunt, of
course, there's fear.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:19.800 align:middle line:90%
There's terror.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:20.950 align:middle line:90%
There's death.

00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And you state in the book we
have a romanticized notion

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:27.010 align:middle line:90%
of what nature is.

00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:30.460 align:middle line:84%
We think oh, god, in nature
everything's at peace

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:33.150 align:middle line:84%
and nature is
intrinsically peaceful.

00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying, no nature
is not intrinsically peaceful.

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:39.200 align:middle line:84%
Everything is
constantly communicating

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:45.710 align:middle line:84%
and in that is always a
sense of being on alert, too.

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Always.

00:38:46.850 --> 00:38:51.240 align:middle line:84%
Even when an animal is napping
or sleeping, an animal's alert.

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:55.540 align:middle line:84%
It's something that I learned
with guardian training.

00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:59.210 align:middle line:84%
I teach a class where I teach
guardian warrior skills.

00:38:59.210 --> 00:39:05.030 align:middle line:84%
One exercise we train for is
to wake up at any point in time

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:08.320 align:middle line:84%
in the night and
know what time it is

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:13.770 align:middle line:84%
and remember the
relationship from when

00:39:13.770 --> 00:39:16.290 align:middle line:84%
I went to bed to this
particular point in time.

00:39:16.290 --> 00:39:18.200 align:middle line:84%
What might have
transpired at this time

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:19.790 align:middle line:84%
so that I can be
on instant alert,

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:22.700 align:middle line:84%
and I can respond to
an emergency situation,

00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:23.650 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And animals are
always in this place.

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.830 align:middle line:84%
What do we do when
we go to sleep?

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:30.120 align:middle line:84%
First of all, we tune
out the outside world.

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:31.780 align:middle line:90%
We're not attuned to it.

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:34.610 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, we'll read a book
or watch a video or something

00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:36.740 align:middle line:84%
and we fall asleep
to that in our minds,

00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:40.080 align:middle line:90%
rather than clearing our minds.

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:42.960 align:middle line:84%
Rather than becoming attuned
to what's going on around us

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:46.960 align:middle line:84%
and drifting off as this
shadow within a shadow.

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And then if we do that, if
we wake up in the night,

00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:53.190 align:middle line:84%
we're instantly attuned to
what is going on around us.

00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:54.480 align:middle line:90%
So we are disconnected.

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:57.000 align:middle line:84%
We have this
intrinsic disconnect.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, I think I'm
probably one of the worst

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:03.950 align:middle line:84%
examples of it, in that I like
to sleep with all the windows

00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:07.468 align:middle line:90%
open, and doors ideally too.

00:40:07.468 --> 00:40:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And love to feel
the air, but I've

00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:15.600 align:middle line:84%
gotten to where I
really don't do well

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:18.990 align:middle line:84%
with the sound of the coyotes
killing the bunnies at night,

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:21.880 align:middle line:84%
and the screams and
howls and so forth.

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.690 align:middle line:90%
I find it very upsetting.

00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:25.680 align:middle line:84%
So I started sleeping
with earplugs.

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:27.440 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Oh boy.

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:28.240 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:30.100 align:middle line:84%
It's is a tough one
for a lot of people.

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:31.050 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: It just makes my
hair stand on end when I hear

00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:35.170 align:middle line:90%
a rabbit screaming in the night.

00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:36.250 align:middle line:90%
An owl grabs a rabbit.

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:37.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Hate it.

00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:37.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:38.180 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Yeah.

00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:39.471 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And I hear it a lot.

00:40:39.471 --> 00:40:41.540 align:middle line:84%
So I just thought, OK,
this is waking me up.

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm awake
and feeling sad.

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:45.950 align:middle line:84%
So just put some ear
plugs in if you're

00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:47.870 align:middle line:84%
going to leave all the
doors and windows open.

00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:48.671 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Sure.

00:40:48.671 --> 00:40:49.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:51.100 align:middle line:84%
I encourage you to
just be with it,

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:53.140 align:middle line:84%
because you're going
to feel OK with it.

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:54.940 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it's stressful.

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:57.810 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's traumatizing
for the animals involved.

00:40:57.810 --> 00:40:58.940 align:middle line:90%
This is life.

00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:00.080 align:middle line:90%
We're so protected.

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:02.720 align:middle line:84%
We're so isolated from the
means and ends of our existence

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:03.860 align:middle line:90%
that we don't feel this.

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:05.530 align:middle line:90%
We don't sense this anymore.

00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:07.030 align:middle line:90%
And what do we do?

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:08.870 align:middle line:90%
We need stress in our lives.

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:10.140 align:middle line:90%
We need this type of stress.

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:12.070 align:middle line:90%
So we go out and we create it.

00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:13.550 align:middle line:90%
You know, we're skydiving.

00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:17.505 align:middle line:90%
We're rafting down wild rivers.

00:41:17.505 --> 00:41:18.940 align:middle line:90%
We need it.

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:20.530 align:middle line:90%
It stimulates the system.

00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:21.660 align:middle line:90%
There's a joy in it.

00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:24.220 align:middle line:84%
There's a joy in trauma,
believe it or not.

00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:26.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And when you then
back up from that notion that

00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:29.650 align:middle line:84%
nature is intrinsically
not peaceful,

00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:33.240 align:middle line:84%
I guess you have to keep
backing up and to say this is

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:34.550 align:middle line:90%
a holistic system.

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:38.500 align:middle line:84%
So in the end, all is
at peace within that,

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:39.970 align:middle line:84%
even though its
own life may have

00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:41.960 align:middle line:90%
to be given to the situation.

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:42.850 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Exactly.

00:41:42.850 --> 00:41:43.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:45.070 align:middle line:90%
There's peace in turmoil.

00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:47.930 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: It's yin and yang.

00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:49.510 align:middle line:90%
You have to have both.

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:50.310 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:53.240 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk
about what you do

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:55.350 align:middle line:84%
when you take a city
slicker, you know,

00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:58.220 align:middle line:84%
you take someone out, somebody
who's totally stressed out.

00:41:58.220 --> 00:41:59.070 align:middle line:90%
They find you.

00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:00.930 align:middle line:90%
They find your work.

00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And they want to start going
into union with nature.

00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:08.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, how does that
usually start out?

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:10.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, aside from
the natural rhythms

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:13.310 align:middle line:84%
we didn't talk about, which
is the whole notion of going

00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:16.930 align:middle line:84%
to bed early, waking up with
the birdsong, and et cetera,

00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:18.580 align:middle line:84%
how do you start
training people back

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:20.955 align:middle line:90%
into relationship with nature?

00:42:20.955 --> 00:42:21.830 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Very simply.

00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:25.510 align:middle line:84%
The first thing I do is ask
them if they're wearing a watch.

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:28.190 align:middle line:84%
I ask them to set
that out on the table.

00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:31.900 align:middle line:84%
I ask them to set
their cell phone down.

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:35.610 align:middle line:84%
If they have a GPS
device for orienteering,

00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:38.290 align:middle line:84%
I ask them to set
all that aside.

00:42:38.290 --> 00:42:40.440 align:middle line:90%
Because these are the crutches.

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:43.570 align:middle line:84%
This is what keeps
us from relationship.

00:42:43.570 --> 00:42:46.030 align:middle line:84%
Even if they say, oh, I
won't look at my watch,

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:52.200 align:middle line:84%
or I'll put it in my backpack,
and I'll turn off my device,

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:54.760 align:middle line:84%
there is still
this inner knowing.

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:55.590 align:middle line:90%
We know it's there.

00:42:55.590 --> 00:42:58.100 align:middle line:84%
We know we can resort to
it whenever we want to,

00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:00.670 align:middle line:90%
whenever we feel the need to.

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And that short
circuits relationship.

00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:06.140 align:middle line:84%
It's a crutch, whether
we use it or not.

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:09.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's very important to just
set those aside, leave them

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:14.000 align:middle line:84%
back, and go out
there stripped naked.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.550 align:middle line:84%
Naked of all these accouterments
that are going to keep us

00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:18.430 align:middle line:90%
connected with civilization.

00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:20.810 align:middle line:84%
The second thing I
encourage people to do

00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:23.120 align:middle line:90%
is to listen and trust.

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:24.560 align:middle line:90%
Just be open.

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Most of our listening
is selective.

00:43:27.610 --> 00:43:29.830 align:middle line:90%
We hear what we want to hear.

00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:32.280 align:middle line:84%
We retain what we
want to retain.

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:33.760 align:middle line:90%
In nature, that doesn't work.

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:38.209 align:middle line:84%
We have to come from a
place of deep listening.

00:43:38.209 --> 00:43:39.250 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example.

00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:42.790 align:middle line:84%
Before I came, I was
sitting in my writing room,

00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:44.120 align:middle line:90%
finishing up a manuscript.

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And outside my window--
the north woods

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:51.230 align:middle line:84%
is right in my backyard,
the National Forest--

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:53.710 align:middle line:84%
and there was a squirrel
sitting there on a fallen tree.

00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:55.530 align:middle line:84%
If a tree falls in
my yard, it stays.

00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:57.470 align:middle line:90%
I don't pick it up.

00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:58.922 align:middle line:90%
That's another story.

00:43:58.922 --> 00:44:00.880 align:middle line:84%
But the tree was laying
there, and the squirrel

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:06.310 align:middle line:84%
was sitting on the fallen trunk
of the tree, flicking her tail.

00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And the reason squirrels flick
their tails is because tails

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:12.360 align:middle line:84%
are expendable,
and heads aren't.

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:15.200 align:middle line:84%
So if there's a
predator in the area,

00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:17.165 align:middle line:84%
the predator is going
to go for the movement.

00:44:17.165 --> 00:44:18.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:20.794 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was just because
they're agitated or something.

00:44:20.794 --> 00:44:22.710 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: Well, it is
because they're agitated.

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:23.550 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:24.716 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It has a purpose.

00:44:24.716 --> 00:44:27.124 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: They show the
agitation for a purpose.

00:44:27.124 --> 00:44:28.540 align:middle line:84%
If you've seen a
lot of squirrels,

00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:31.980 align:middle line:84%
you've undoubtedly seen some
squirrels with short tails.

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:32.780 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh.

00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:37.100 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: That is because the
predators go for movement.

00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And if they're not really
keyed into the animal,

00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:44.160 align:middle line:84%
they will go for
what's moving the most.

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And they will go off with the
tail, but the squirrel lives.

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:51.310 align:middle line:84%
So the squirrel was out
there flicking her tail.

00:44:51.310 --> 00:44:53.740 align:middle line:90%
And I knew something was up.

00:44:53.740 --> 00:45:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And our normal way of listening
is to go from A to B to C.

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:06.880 align:middle line:84%
I want to hear something,
so I key into what

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:08.420 align:middle line:90%
is making the noise.

00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And then I come to a rational
conclusion about what

00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:13.660 align:middle line:90%
this noise is all about.

00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:15.750 align:middle line:90%
Very linear thought process.

00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, that doesn't
work in nature,

00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:21.090 align:middle line:84%
because listening has
to be like a web, all

00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:22.300 align:middle line:90%
of this interconnection.

00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:25.800 align:middle line:84%
So here's this squirrel on
the trunk, flicking her tail.

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And I realize that
something's up.

00:45:27.490 --> 00:45:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And I look up, and there's
a Blue Jay sitting up

00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:30.470 align:middle line:90%
on a branch.

00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:32.630 align:middle line:84%
There's a big red pine
outside the window.

00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:34.670 align:middle line:90%
And the Blue Jay is nervous.

00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And then the Blue
Jay starts calling.

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And I realized there's
something else going on,

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:42.560 align:middle line:84%
because the Blue Jay is
the harbinger of danger

00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:43.360 align:middle line:90%
in the woods.

00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:45.320 align:middle line:84%
The Blue Jays make
a loud racket.

00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:47.280 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That loud call.

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: And I looked over, and
there was a Broad Winged Hawk

00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:52.630 align:middle line:90%
sitting a couple of trees over.

00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:55.110 align:middle line:84%
Not hunting at the time,
but these prey animals

00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:56.610 align:middle line:90%
are very nervous.

00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:59.980 align:middle line:84%
So here's this
interaction going on.

00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:01.716 align:middle line:84%
And if I just keyed
into the squirrel,

00:46:01.716 --> 00:46:03.090 align:middle line:84%
I would have missed
all the rest.

00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:03.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right

00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:05.500 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: So this is what
I call deep listening.

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:08.330 align:middle line:84%
It's not focusing on
what's making the sound

00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:10.920 align:middle line:84%
or what you want to make
the sound, such as you

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:13.400 align:middle line:84%
if you see a bird, I want
to hear that bird song.

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:14.900 align:middle line:90%
Well, why is that bird singing?

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:18.407 align:middle line:84%
We have to pull it all together
and listen to everything.

00:46:18.407 --> 00:46:19.990 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And when
you say listening,

00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:22.281 align:middle line:84%
you also mention in your
book, and devote a good amount

00:46:22.281 --> 00:46:25.600 align:middle line:84%
of time to it, the fact
that when you're dialing

00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:29.060 align:middle line:84%
into the bird community--
and that's one thing.

00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:31.120 align:middle line:84%
I do take my earplugs
out my morning

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:32.840 align:middle line:90%
so I can hear the birds.

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:34.270 align:middle line:90%
The cacophony of sounds.

00:46:34.270 --> 00:46:35.200 align:middle line:90%
So many birds.

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:38.850 align:middle line:84%
Or a symphony, either way, of
so many birds in the morning.

00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And you say to really understand
the language of birds,

00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:46.020 align:middle line:84%
you should put your
ear plugs back in.

00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:47.290 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Yes.

00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:49.640 align:middle line:84%
For exactly that
reason, because we

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:54.664 align:middle line:84%
are looking to key into
something and then identify it.

00:46:54.664 --> 00:46:56.830 align:middle line:84%
Bird watchers will take a
field guide out with them.

00:46:56.830 --> 00:46:58.720 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I want to
identify this bird.

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:01.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's just slapping
a label on the bird.

00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:03.910 align:middle line:90%
That's not knowing the bird.

00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:07.170 align:middle line:84%
To know the bird is to know
the relationship of the bird

00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:09.700 align:middle line:84%
with the hoop of life
and the hoop of relations

00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:12.200 align:middle line:90%
that the bird is immersed in.

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:15.980 align:middle line:84%
So in order to do that, we need
to put in ear plugs, literally.

00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:17.625 align:middle line:84%
I encourage people
to put in ear plugs.

00:47:17.625 --> 00:47:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I know.

00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:22.270 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: Because otherwise
we're satisfied right away.

00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:24.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm point A, and I
want point B in order

00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:26.040 align:middle line:90%
to come to a point C conclusion.

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:29.330 align:middle line:84%
Once I have it, even though I'm
still there, I'm still present,

00:47:29.330 --> 00:47:31.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm not fully attuned to
what else is going on.

00:47:31.690 --> 00:47:33.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you're
saying more to watch them?

00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:34.800 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Yes.

00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:37.500 align:middle line:84%
To watch them, and also to
watch the interactions, just as

00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:39.620 align:middle line:84%
the example I gave
of the squirrel.

00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:42.690 align:middle line:84%
Because that tells us a whole
lot more about the bird, about

00:47:42.690 --> 00:47:45.964 align:middle line:84%
the bird's personality,
about whether the bird

00:47:45.964 --> 00:47:48.130 align:middle line:84%
has a mate or not, whether
the bird is feeding young

00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:51.990 align:middle line:84%
or not, than just
listening to the bird song.

00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:55.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And there's another
bird story in there you have

00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:59.150 align:middle line:84%
about you were
calling to the ravens,

00:47:59.150 --> 00:48:01.750 align:middle line:84%
or chatting with
the ravens vocally.

00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:04.080 align:middle line:84%
And you started noticing
what was going on by way

00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:06.100 align:middle line:90%
of that human interface.

00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:08.890 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Oh, this is amazing.

00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:13.730 align:middle line:84%
I was working on bird
research at Cornell University

00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:15.470 align:middle line:90%
in Ithaca, New York for a while.

00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:18.125 align:middle line:84%
And they have a tremendous
library of bird songs.

00:48:18.125 --> 00:48:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And they have all the
bird songs categorized.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:26.594 align:middle line:84%
Each species has a Warning
call, a Mating call,

00:48:26.594 --> 00:48:30.230 align:middle line:84%
and five or six different
general categories.

00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And I attempted to
apply this to ravens.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And I got to know one family
of ravens where I used to live.

00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And I knew their specific
calls for various reasons.

00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And I moved 80 miles
away, and I got

00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:47.760 align:middle line:84%
to know another
family of ravens.

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And I was totally
confused, because they

00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:53.210 align:middle line:84%
had entirely different calls
fulfilling the same functions,

00:48:53.210 --> 00:48:55.030 align:middle line:90%
the same reasons.

00:48:55.030 --> 00:49:02.965 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that these
are not just rote animals

00:49:02.965 --> 00:49:03.765 align:middle line:90%
functioning--

00:49:03.765 --> 00:49:05.060 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They have dialect.

00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:05.860 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Yes.

00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:09.230 align:middle line:90%
There are languages here.

00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And these languages are
passed down in the families,

00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:15.490 align:middle line:84%
just like our languages, just
like our various languages.

00:49:15.490 --> 00:49:19.170 align:middle line:84%
They're not simple
animals who are just

00:49:19.170 --> 00:49:21.070 align:middle line:90%
doing knee jerk reactions here.

00:49:21.070 --> 00:49:23.550 align:middle line:84%
These are thinking,
feeling, caring animals,

00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:25.260 align:middle line:90%
and they're interactive animals.

00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And they can learn and adapt
and adjust just like we can.

00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:32.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So this is
maybe a little off topic,

00:49:32.410 --> 00:49:34.800 align:middle line:90%
but it's an experience I had.

00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And I was wondering about
the notion of telepathy

00:49:38.350 --> 00:49:39.790 align:middle line:90%
with animals.

00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And I was out in the desert
walking on one of my paths

00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:45.950 align:middle line:90%
out in Sedona.

00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking
through something.

00:49:48.490 --> 00:49:50.600 align:middle line:90%
And I came upon a solution.

00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:52.970 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, oh, that's good.

00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:53.770 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And just as I
thought that's good,

00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:57.630 align:middle line:84%
my field must have
opened up or something,

00:49:57.630 --> 00:50:01.540 align:middle line:84%
because three ravens flew
overhead and cawed three times

00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:03.520 align:middle line:90%
as they flew over me.

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:06.380 align:middle line:84%
So in your bird
speak, would that

00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:08.300 align:middle line:84%
be some kind of
telepathic connection

00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:11.660 align:middle line:84%
or empathetic connection
or what would that be?

00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:13.560 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: There is this
relationship there.

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And every once in a while,
our consciousness opens up,

00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:20.460 align:middle line:90%
and we get a glimpse.

00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And we call it an intuitive
impulse, or divine message,

00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:30.590 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, our guardian
angel speaking to us.

00:50:30.590 --> 00:50:32.870 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter what
label we place upon it.

00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:36.830 align:middle line:84%
This is occurring all the time
in our limbic process, which

00:50:36.830 --> 00:50:39.120 align:middle line:84%
is our animal mind,
our deeper mind,

00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:42.140 align:middle line:84%
which as neuroscience
research is discovering now,

00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:46.340 align:middle line:84%
is where 95% to 99% percent
of our mental processing

00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:47.560 align:middle line:90%
is going on.

00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:49.890 align:middle line:84%
We are just not
consciously aware of it.

00:50:49.890 --> 00:50:51.790 align:middle line:84%
So when something breaks
through like this,

00:50:51.790 --> 00:50:53.960 align:middle line:84%
we think, oh, I
had an inspiration.

00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:55.620 align:middle line:90%
Well, it was always there.

00:50:55.620 --> 00:50:58.620 align:middle line:84%
It was occurring
already, simultaneously

00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:00.870 align:middle line:90%
with their conscious process.

00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:02.370 align:middle line:90%
So and--

00:51:02.370 --> 00:51:04.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
just a validation.

00:51:04.070 --> 00:51:04.540 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Exactly.

00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:05.498 align:middle line:90%
It's just a validation.

00:51:05.498 --> 00:51:06.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:51:06.330 --> 00:51:07.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah

00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:09.400 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: And it's an
important validation.

00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:12.120 align:middle line:84%
This has a whole lot to
do with Native people

00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:14.310 align:middle line:84%
and their relationship
with animals.

00:51:14.310 --> 00:51:20.310 align:middle line:84%
Their very intimate relationship
with animals as animal guides.

00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:22.510 align:middle line:84%
There's this
communication going on,

00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:24.650 align:middle line:84%
and when they
receive confirmation,

00:51:24.650 --> 00:51:27.710 align:middle line:84%
or they receive guidance,
they can trust in it,

00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:30.700 align:middle line:84%
because they know that this
is the real communication.

00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:31.930 align:middle line:90%
This is nature speak.

00:51:31.930 --> 00:51:34.510 align:middle line:90%
This is the ultimate reality.

00:51:34.510 --> 00:51:36.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so that goes
hand-in-hand with the notion

00:51:36.970 --> 00:51:39.030 align:middle line:90%
of having totem animals.

00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:40.050 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Yes.

00:51:40.050 --> 00:51:40.850 align:middle line:90%
Same thing.

00:51:40.850 --> 00:51:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And each person
innately has one that

00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:46.334 align:middle line:84%
they're uniquely in
relationship with,

00:51:46.334 --> 00:51:47.500 align:middle line:90%
whether they know it or not?

00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:49.260 align:middle line:84%
Or is that something
that's more a process

00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:52.030 align:middle line:90%
of their own selection?

00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:55.060 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: There can
be animal helpers,

00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:59.780 align:middle line:84%
but what I learned from the
elders is that we each have one

00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:01.970 align:middle line:84%
animal with whom
we share in spirit.

00:52:01.970 --> 00:52:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And we're born with
that relationship.

00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And whether we are consciously
aware of it or not,

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:12.549 align:middle line:84%
it's there, because it's
happening on this deeper level.

00:52:12.549 --> 00:52:14.090 align:middle line:84%
And when we get
these glimpses of it,

00:52:14.090 --> 00:52:18.670 align:middle line:84%
this is why you see
an animal sometimes,

00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:23.560 align:middle line:84%
and you just feel some sense of
relatedness with this animal.

00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:24.890 align:middle line:90%
There's something there.

00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And what the elders
showed me to do

00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:33.210 align:middle line:84%
in terms of consciously
learning who my animal guide is,

00:52:33.210 --> 00:52:37.750 align:middle line:84%
is to look at these
synchronicities

00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:40.610 align:middle line:84%
and see that there's a
pattern going on here.

00:52:40.610 --> 00:52:43.380 align:middle line:84%
This isn't just some
random occurrence.

00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And when it happens
with the same animal

00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:49.030 align:middle line:84%
three or four times
in unique situations,

00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:50.890 align:middle line:84%
there's probably
something there.

00:52:50.890 --> 00:52:53.094 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what
is your totem,

00:52:53.094 --> 00:52:54.260 align:middle line:90%
if you don't mind my asking?

00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:55.640 align:middle line:90%
Your animal guide?

00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:56.660 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Owl.

00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:57.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Owl.

00:52:57.660 --> 00:52:58.670 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:52:58.670 --> 00:53:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And do the Natives that are
used to working in this realm,

00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:05.320 align:middle line:84%
can they also identify
that in someone else?

00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:09.790 align:middle line:84%
Where they see someone, they
can see their animal guide?

00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:11.940 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: Yes, but it's
a dangerous thing to do,

00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:13.860 align:middle line:84%
partly because of the
power of suggestion.

00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:14.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: I work with some people
as a guide who are looking

00:53:19.290 --> 00:53:20.850 align:middle line:90%
for their animal guide.

00:53:20.850 --> 00:53:22.390 align:middle line:90%
They want to know.

00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And if I were to say anything
to them, because they're

00:53:25.090 --> 00:53:27.720 align:middle line:84%
coming to me as a guide,
the power of suggestion

00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:29.190 align:middle line:90%
is very strong.

00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:30.670 align:middle line:90%
And there will be an imprint.

00:53:30.670 --> 00:53:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And they'll think,
well, maybe he knows.

00:53:32.530 --> 00:53:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And maybe I should listen
to what he has to say.

00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And the journey of discovery is
very much a personal journey.

00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And what I really need to
do is to step back and act

00:53:44.730 --> 00:53:47.120 align:middle line:84%
as a catalyst to
help that person

00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:52.120 align:middle line:84%
to discover his or her
relationship with his or her

00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:55.690 align:middle line:84%
animal guide in his own
way, in his own time,

00:53:55.690 --> 00:53:57.520 align:middle line:90%
so that it is authentic.

00:53:57.520 --> 00:54:00.250 align:middle line:90%
So that it is personalized.

00:54:00.250 --> 00:54:03.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's say we're
out in nature with you now,

00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:08.360 align:middle line:84%
and you're having us go into our
experiential type of thought,

00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:11.720 align:middle line:84%
beyond words, which a lot of
people lose their bearings

00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:12.520 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:14.270 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing to
hold onto, as you say.

00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:16.120 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Yeah.

00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:20.400 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, in Zen practice it would
be called entering the void.

00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:22.540 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing concrete.

00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:24.200 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing known.

00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:27.530 align:middle line:84%
We have to just
let go and trust,

00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:29.300 align:middle line:90%
trust in whatever is or isn't.

00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:30.740 align:middle line:90%
It's the only way.

00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:34.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And then you go into
the notion of seeing versus

00:54:34.830 --> 00:54:36.670 align:middle line:90%
looking.

00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:38.720 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Yeah.

00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:42.730 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there's a difference
between focused vision

00:54:42.730 --> 00:54:45.220 align:middle line:90%
and peripheral vision.

00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:48.390 align:middle line:84%
With focused vision I'm
looking for something

00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:53.950 align:middle line:84%
that fits this catalog of
images I have in my mind.

00:54:53.950 --> 00:54:57.510 align:middle line:84%
If I see an animal, I'm
looking through my catalog

00:54:57.510 --> 00:54:59.720 align:middle line:90%
to identify that animal.

00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:02.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, with peripheral
vision, with deeper vision,

00:55:02.930 --> 00:55:06.940 align:middle line:84%
that's not important,
because that animal may not

00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:10.810 align:middle line:84%
be why I am looking in
that particular direction.

00:55:10.810 --> 00:55:12.300 align:middle line:90%
That animal may have moved.

00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:14.910 align:middle line:84%
But, again, there's
something bigger going on.

00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:16.070 align:middle line:90%
Why did that animal move?

00:55:16.070 --> 00:55:17.390 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:55:17.390 --> 00:55:18.620 align:middle line:90%
It's the relationship.

00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:20.990 align:middle line:84%
And here's where a deeper
vision can connect us

00:55:20.990 --> 00:55:24.280 align:middle line:90%
with this-- I call it intimate.

00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:25.450 align:middle line:90%
This is true intimacy.

00:55:25.450 --> 00:55:27.901 align:middle line:84%
This intimate relationship
that's going on.

00:55:27.901 --> 00:55:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And I can be part and parcel
to that, rather than just

00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:33.590 align:middle line:84%
an observer, if I would just
back up and quit cataloging,

00:55:33.590 --> 00:55:37.690 align:middle line:84%
quit identifying, quit
labeling, and just

00:55:37.690 --> 00:55:40.470 align:middle line:84%
be a presence within
the greater presence.

00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:42.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that leads us
into the notion of knowing

00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:45.910 align:middle line:90%
about something, versus knowing.

00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:48.250 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Yes.

00:55:48.250 --> 00:55:52.330 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I oftentimes use
the example of let's say

00:55:52.330 --> 00:55:54.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm a young single
guy and I'm out

00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:58.660 align:middle line:84%
looking to create a
relationship with a woman.

00:55:58.660 --> 00:56:03.340 align:middle line:90%
And I meet somebody at a dance.

00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And I say, oh, I'm really
interested in getting

00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:09.000 align:middle line:90%
to know you better.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Just stay right there,
I'm going to go home now,

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.930 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to see
if you're on Facebook.

00:56:12.930 --> 00:56:14.263 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to blah blah blah.

00:56:14.263 --> 00:56:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to do some
research on you, essentially.

00:56:16.540 --> 00:56:18.304 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which is
what is done now.

00:56:18.304 --> 00:56:20.220 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: Which is what
is done, unfortunately.

00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:22.053 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we're getting
further and further away

00:56:22.053 --> 00:56:23.960 align:middle line:84%
from authentic
relationship, I think.

00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:26.300 align:middle line:84%
Rather than saying,
hey, let's be.

00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:27.720 align:middle line:84%
Let's be in each
other's presence.

00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:30.680 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what happens

00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:34.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so, when it
applies to nature, it's the--

00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:35.980 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Same thing.

00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:38.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Going in nature
versus going to the library

00:56:38.410 --> 00:56:39.860 align:middle line:90%
and learning about nature.

00:56:39.860 --> 00:56:41.000 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Yeah.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:41.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:42.690 align:middle line:90%
Same thing.

00:56:42.690 --> 00:56:43.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:47.150 align:middle line:84%
So let's say now we're
out in the woods with you,

00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:49.800 align:middle line:84%
and we've left all
these devices behind.

00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:53.150 align:middle line:84%
You do something called
shadowing, right?

00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:54.721 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell us what that is?

00:56:54.721 --> 00:56:57.220 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: Shadowing is becoming
a movement within the greater

00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:58.610 align:middle line:90%
movement.

00:56:58.610 --> 00:57:00.700 align:middle line:84%
It's the example I gave
earlier about going up

00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:01.840 align:middle line:90%
to the top of the hill.

00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:02.100 align:middle line:90%
Well--

00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You don't
want to do that.

00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:04.498 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: You don't
want to do that.

00:57:04.498 --> 00:57:06.940 align:middle line:84%
You want to not only
move in the shadows,

00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:08.840 align:middle line:90%
but you want to become a shadow.

00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:13.400 align:middle line:84%
When the trees bend in the
wind, this is a time to move,

00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:15.360 align:middle line:84%
because my movement is
going to be disguised

00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:16.980 align:middle line:90%
by the movement of the trees.

00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:20.150 align:middle line:84%
The sound of my moving
is going to be disguised

00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:22.480 align:middle line:90%
by the fluttering leaves.

00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:25.290 align:middle line:84%
When the trees stop
moving, I stop moving.

00:57:25.290 --> 00:57:27.530 align:middle line:84%
It's the same when I'm
tracking an animal.

00:57:27.530 --> 00:57:29.610 align:middle line:84%
When that animal's
moving, I move,

00:57:29.610 --> 00:57:32.320 align:middle line:84%
because I'm a movement within
the greater movement again.

00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:35.610 align:middle line:84%
If the animal moves
first and stops,

00:57:35.610 --> 00:57:37.860 align:middle line:84%
the animal is in a
state of alertness

00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:39.330 align:middle line:90%
when the animal stops.

00:57:39.330 --> 00:57:40.870 align:middle line:84%
That's not a time
for me to move.

00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:43.770 align:middle line:84%
I need to freeze as well, so
I'm shadowing that animal.

00:57:43.770 --> 00:57:46.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm showing that
animals movements.

00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And while I'm doing
that, I'm picking up

00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:55.880 align:middle line:84%
on the animal's needs and
desires and motivations

00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:57.690 align:middle line:84%
for doing what the
animal is doing.

00:57:57.690 --> 00:58:00.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm starting to gain a sense
for where the animal is going

00:58:00.650 --> 00:58:02.130 align:middle line:84%
and why the animal's
going there,

00:58:02.130 --> 00:58:05.490 align:middle line:84%
and whether the animal is
feeling courageous or fearful,

00:58:05.490 --> 00:58:07.210 align:middle line:84%
whether the animal's
thirsty or hungry.

00:58:07.210 --> 00:58:10.780 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the animal is going
down to a stream to drink.

00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:12.039 align:middle line:90%
I pick that up.

00:58:12.039 --> 00:58:13.830 align:middle line:84%
I sense that, and I
know where we're going.

00:58:13.830 --> 00:58:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And I can become all the
more a shadow of that animal.

00:58:17.310 --> 00:58:21.920 align:middle line:84%
So this is how I get into the
animal's mind, you might say,

00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:27.810 align:middle line:84%
so that I can feel the
animal's deep motivations,

00:58:27.810 --> 00:58:29.190 align:middle line:90%
feel her feelings.

00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:31.190 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I would
think this would take you

00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:35.320 align:middle line:90%
into a state of timelessness.

00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: There is
no time in the void.

00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:39.080 align:middle line:90%
There just is.

00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:40.880 align:middle line:84%
There's not even a
past and a future.

00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:42.650 align:middle line:90%
I just see it as a continuum.

00:58:42.650 --> 00:58:45.120 align:middle line:84%
It's just this continuum of
movement within the greater

00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:46.360 align:middle line:90%
movement.

00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:49.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Is this one of
the more beneficial aspects

00:58:49.330 --> 00:58:52.290 align:middle line:84%
of going into
relationship with nature,

00:58:52.290 --> 00:58:56.630 align:middle line:84%
to remove us from that
direct linear flow of time

00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:59.340 align:middle line:84%
in our lives that
we're all slaves to?

00:58:59.340 --> 00:59:02.070 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: I think it's
tremendously therapeutic.

00:59:02.070 --> 00:59:05.910 align:middle line:84%
One reason we get stressed
is because there is

00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:08.950 align:middle line:90%
no stress release in our lives.

00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:12.650 align:middle line:84%
We get up in the morning
to an alarm clock, those

00:59:12.650 --> 00:59:16.527 align:middle line:84%
of us who have 9:00 to 5:00
jobs, same time every morning.

00:59:16.527 --> 00:59:18.610 align:middle line:84%
We have a certain amount
of time to take a shower,

00:59:18.610 --> 00:59:21.960 align:middle line:84%
get something to eat, get on
the freeway to get to work.

00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:25.000 align:middle line:84%
And right away at work
we have specific tasks.

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.190 align:middle line:90%
And we have people to answer to.

00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And then we go home
at night, and we might

00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:30.440 align:middle line:90%
have our family waiting for us.

00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:34.320 align:middle line:90%
We have kids to interact with.

00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:35.730 align:middle line:90%
And we have a partner.

00:59:35.730 --> 00:59:38.375 align:middle line:84%
And then we go to sleep and do
the same thing all over again.

00:59:38.375 --> 00:59:39.175 align:middle line:90%
It's chronic.

00:59:39.175 --> 00:59:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That
sounds depressing.

00:59:40.730 --> 00:59:42.370 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Yeah.

00:59:42.370 --> 00:59:45.730 align:middle line:84%
So many people do it in various
and sundry ways, of course.

00:59:45.730 --> 00:59:47.600 align:middle line:84%
But that's what
it boils down to.

00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:50.090 align:middle line:90%
So there's no stress release.

00:59:50.090 --> 00:59:54.290 align:middle line:84%
And this is because we
are living a linear life

00:59:54.290 --> 00:59:56.720 align:middle line:84%
with a past, present,
and a future.

00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:59.790 align:middle line:84%
Every movement, every
decision we make

00:59:59.790 --> 01:00:02.507 align:middle line:84%
is based upon what
happened in the past

01:00:02.507 --> 01:00:04.840 align:middle line:84%
and how we can project that
into the future for a better

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:05.890 align:middle line:90%
outcome.

01:00:05.890 --> 01:00:09.034 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we can get away
from all of that and just be,

01:00:09.034 --> 01:00:11.450 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have a better
outcome in the future anyway,

01:00:11.450 --> 01:00:13.977 align:middle line:84%
without worrying about it,
without stressing about it.

01:00:13.977 --> 01:00:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And we are going to have
continual stress release,

01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:17.440 align:middle line:84%
because there's not
going to be the buildup--

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:17.635 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

01:00:17.635 --> 01:00:18.435 align:middle line:90%
The relief of that.

01:00:18.435 --> 01:00:21.470 align:middle line:84%
Just to be in the moment,
responding to everything

01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:22.270 align:middle line:90%
around you.

01:00:22.270 --> 01:00:23.070 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: Yes.

01:00:23.070 --> 01:00:26.500 align:middle line:90%
Time consciousness is stress.

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:28.470 align:middle line:90%
We can step aside from that.

01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:28.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's
what nature gives us.

01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:30.241 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: The stress disappears.

01:00:30.241 --> 01:00:33.140 align:middle line:90%
That's what nature gives us.

01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:35.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So we only have
a couple minutes left.

01:00:35.870 --> 01:00:39.490 align:middle line:84%
When you see people coming that
are-- they're stressed out.

01:00:39.490 --> 01:00:40.850 align:middle line:90%
They've heard about you.

01:00:40.850 --> 01:00:42.920 align:middle line:84%
They just want some relief
from their own lives.

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:47.790 align:middle line:84%
They love nature, but don't
know quite what to do with it.

01:00:47.790 --> 01:00:50.260 align:middle line:84%
How long does-- and I
know everyone's different.

01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:53.320 align:middle line:84%
How long can it take for
someone to essentially come in

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:58.330 align:middle line:84%
from the city, just put their
watch down, and then move

01:00:58.330 --> 01:01:00.392 align:middle line:84%
into some kind of
harmony with nature?

01:01:00.392 --> 01:01:02.850 align:middle line:84%
>> SONG: It usually it takes
three or four days on average.

01:01:02.850 --> 01:01:04.224 align:middle line:84%
For some people,
a little faster,

01:01:04.224 --> 01:01:07.410 align:middle line:84%
for some slower, but right
around three or four days.

01:01:07.410 --> 01:01:10.750 align:middle line:84%
Yet, I encourage people
not to worry about that.

01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:14.950 align:middle line:84%
I encourage people just
to commune where you are.

01:01:14.950 --> 01:01:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Now a good example is
Christine, the woman

01:01:17.370 --> 01:01:20.140 align:middle line:90%
who illustrated my last book.

01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:24.560 align:middle line:84%
She lives in Brooklyn on the
sixth floor of this high rise

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:25.360 align:middle line:90%
apartment.

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:25.590 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wow.

01:01:25.590 --> 01:01:27.010 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't know
it from her artwork.

01:01:27.010 --> 01:01:28.093 align:middle line:90%
>> SONG: No, you wouldn't.

01:01:28.093 --> 01:01:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's because
nature is right there.

01:01:30.810 --> 01:01:32.030 align:middle line:90%
She looks out her window.

01:01:32.030 --> 01:01:33.970 align:middle line:84%
