00:00:08.493 --> 00:00:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA AUSTIN:
They actually think

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.670 align:middle line:84%
the more spiritual aspect
of water is the observer.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.790 align:middle line:84%
One of the songs that I
did repeated studies with

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.530 align:middle line:90%
was "Stairway to Heaven."

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.240 align:middle line:84%
Every time I would
play that song,

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.510 align:middle line:84%
I would see a stairway
image appear in the ice.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.060 align:middle line:84%
Water freezes into
the energy of a word.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And when you eat that
ice, people have actually

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.310 align:middle line:90%
been having incredible results.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.710 align:middle line:84%
I took spring water and I put
it just right beside a 5G tower.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And we saw one of the
most disordered patterns

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.240 align:middle line:90%
I've actually seen.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.670 align:middle line:84%
I've done a lot of questions
like, what on Earth

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:43.628 align:middle line:90%
was inspired by aliens?

00:00:43.628 --> 00:00:46.003 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: Oh, and
there you've got the pyramids

Tell us how you capture
these images, in case

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.370 align:middle line:84%
some of our budding
scientists at home

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.510 align:middle line:90%
want to do this themselves.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.870 align:middle line:90%
>>VEDA: Absolutely.

00:00:58.288 --> 00:01:00.580 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Many of you have
heard of the brilliant work

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.760 align:middle line:10%
of the late Masaru Emoto, who
demonstrated that water is

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.680 align:middle line:10%
conscious and holds memory.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.670 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Emoto is gone, but a woman
from New Zealand, Veda Austin,

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.490 align:middle line:84%
has picked up where Emoto
left off, and has developed

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.460 align:middle line:84%
an even finer body of
images and information

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.930 align:middle line:90%
on the brilliance of water.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:17.860 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Veda.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:18.660 align:middle line:90%
>>VEDA: Thank you.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.920 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What an
absolutely amazing,

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.950 align:middle line:84%
stunning body of photographs
and video you have.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't
hyperbole when I said

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.980 align:middle line:84%
that this is an even finer body
than what Mr. Emoto produced

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.240 align:middle line:90%
within his lifetime.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.670 align:middle line:84%
So, first of all,
let's talk about how

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.220 align:middle line:84%
you started with water and maybe
what influence he had on you.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.020 align:middle line:90%
>>VEDA: Sure.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, Emoto really
was a pioneer.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.730 align:middle line:10%
And he opened the
doorway for people

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.060 align:middle line:10%
to see that they are
sensitive bodies of water--

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.130 align:middle line:10%
sensitive to thoughts and words,
emotions, feelings, music.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.980 align:middle line:10%
And he was inspiring to me
because I became very curious.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.450 align:middle line:10%
Does water really
store information?

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.040 align:middle line:90%
Does it have memory?

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.450 align:middle line:90%
Is it conscious?

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.620 align:middle line:90%
They're very big questions.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.289 align:middle line:84%
And I think that what I wanted
to do was to see for myself.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.440 align:middle line:84%
But all those years
ago, I didn't actually

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.970 align:middle line:90%
have a microscope.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.230 align:middle line:84%
But I realized that the secret
was in the freezing, where

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.250 align:middle line:90%
the unseen becomes seen.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.387 align:middle line:84%
And so I found a way to
really investigate for myself.

00:02:26.387 --> 00:02:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you have done an
amazing job and everybody here

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.160 align:middle line:84%
is going to have the benefit
of seeing these images.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, in a
moment, we're going

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.430 align:middle line:84%
to play a little
film that you made.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.400 align:middle line:84%
So, first of all, you say that
the water itself is an anomaly.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.790 align:middle line:84%
That it has 66 anomalous
properties to it

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.230 align:middle line:90%
that have never been explained.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Just give us a
little feel for that.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.060 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: Well, I mean,
it's interesting I

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.370 align:middle line:84%
call water the rebel
element because it

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.260 align:middle line:84%
defies the laws of
physics and gravity.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.130 align:middle line:84%
It can go upwards through trees
and it expands when it cools.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.510 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make sense.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
really interesting

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.370 align:middle line:84%
because, by molecular count,
not by volume, we're 99% water.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.820 align:middle line:84%
Our eye lens is 99% water,
which means we literally

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.340 align:middle line:84%
see everything through
the lens of water,

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.370 align:middle line:84%
and yet we know so
little about it.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely true.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.302 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like to
do to give people

00:03:19.302 --> 00:03:21.260 align:middle line:84%
an idea of what we're
going to be talking about

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.340 align:middle line:90%
is play a little film.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.180 align:middle line:90%
Can we do that?

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.250 align:middle line:90%
Let's play the little film.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.700 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: Water-- what do
we really know about it?

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Some scientists say it's seeded
the Earth from meteorites

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.370 align:middle line:84%
while others say it came up
from within the Earth's mantle.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.370 align:middle line:84%
Fondly known as
the rebel element,

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.820 align:middle line:84%
water defies both
physics and gravity.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.690 align:middle line:10%
It expands when it freezes
and makes its way upwards

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.700 align:middle line:10%
through tree trunks.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Water is mentioned 722
times in the Bible--

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.380 align:middle line:84%
more than faith,
worship, and love.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.720 align:middle line:84%
The Quran says we have created
every living thing from water.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And the Upanishads say the whole
universe is made up of water.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.180 align:middle line:90%
All beings are made up of water.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.850 align:middle line:84%
When we look at
a water analysis,

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.300 align:middle line:84%
we only learn about
what water holds.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:21.209 align:middle line:84%
But what do we learn
about water itself?

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.210 align:middle line:90%
Does it have a spirit or a mind?

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.410 align:middle line:84%
Does it have the
ability to store memory?

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.770 align:middle line:84%
Over the last decade,
I've been studying water

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.810 align:middle line:90%
in its state of creation--

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.570 align:middle line:84%
the phase between
liquid and ice.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And I've discovered
something extraordinary.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.900 align:middle line:84%
Water appears to intelligently
respond to human consciousness.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.450 align:middle line:84%
It uses its building
blocks of ice

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.420 align:middle line:84%
to design recognizable
pictographs,

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.150 align:middle line:84%
enabling it to
share its messages

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.480 align:middle line:84%
or acknowledgment back
to us in picture form.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.140 align:middle line:84%
Have you noticed a little
sailboat appearing in the ice?

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.490 align:middle line:84%
The influence was the
thought of a sailboat.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.430 align:middle line:84%
My first experience
of this phenomenon

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.040 align:middle line:84%
was when I projected
the thought of my hand

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.240 align:middle line:84%
into a Petri dish of water,
froze it, pulled it out,

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.600 align:middle line:84%
and in the architecture
of the ice was a hand.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.820 align:middle line:84%
I then froze some seawater and
an image of a fish appeared.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:29.800 align:middle line:10%
I now have over 40,000 photos
of water responding this way.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.730 align:middle line:10%
Here are a few examples showing
the influence on the right

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.400 align:middle line:10%
and the ice response
on the left.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:42.340 align:middle line:10%
I inspire water in many ways,
including thoughts, music,

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.540 align:middle line:10%
media, words,
photos, and emotions.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:52.420 align:middle line:84%
I've even spoken to water and
received written responses.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.830 align:middle line:10%
The photos you're seeing now
were all taken on my iPhone,

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.260 align:middle line:10%
not altered or photoshopped.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.820 align:middle line:84%
They were designed by water
and crystallized in ice.

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.890 align:middle line:90%
So what does this mean?

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.130 align:middle line:10%
Could the ancients and
Indigenous be right?

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.670 align:middle line:84%
Could water really
be a living being?

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.230 align:middle line:90%


00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I love that little
video because it has such

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:18.740 align:middle line:90%
a bang.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.380 align:middle line:84%
It has everything in it I wanted
to start so people could see

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.850 align:middle line:90%
what we're talking about here.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.160 align:middle line:84%
Because you've had
conscious conversations,

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.130 align:middle line:84%
you've been given answers
through images from water

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.220 align:middle line:90%
directly.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And so let's go back where
people are already comfortable,

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.660 align:middle line:84%
and that was the
world of homeopathy.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.280 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the people
watching this

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.390 align:middle line:90%
have used homeopathic remedies.

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And so 200 or 250
years ago in Germany,

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.430 align:middle line:84%
that's when they started really
producing these remedies.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And still today,
the homeopaths are

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.920 align:middle line:84%
arguing to have a
place in society

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.100 align:middle line:84%
despite the fact
of the clear effect

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.440 align:middle line:84%
that it has on people's
bodies and their emotions.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.590 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
homeopathy for a moment

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.030 align:middle line:84%
before we go into some of
the more esoteric stuff.

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:03.830 align:middle line:90%
>>VEDA: Absolutely.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, I actually have done
quite a lot with homeopathy

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.290 align:middle line:84%
as far as using my
crystallographic method.

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And when I've put little drops
of various homeopathic remedies

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:17.550 align:middle line:84%
into water and frozen
it using my technique,

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:22.160 align:middle line:84%
I have seen imagery that really
looks very similar to the plant

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.942 align:middle line:84%
that the homeopathic
remedy was originated from.

00:07:25.942 --> 00:07:26.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.030 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: And someone
was asking me,

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:32.060 align:middle line:84%
why do you think that
the higher dilutions

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.840 align:middle line:84%
of homeopathic remedies
actually work better?

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think of it in a
really interesting way

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.410 align:middle line:84%
after my observations of
interesting things that

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:47.470 align:middle line:84%
have happened with water, is
that the spirit of the plant

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:51.760 align:middle line:84%
essentially is expanding
the further away

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.830 align:middle line:84%
it gets from the
body of the plant.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And so I think
about liquid water

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:04.510 align:middle line:84%
as being the visible body that
houses the spirit of water,

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:08.060 align:middle line:84%
and the spirit of water
is in all living things.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:13.390 align:middle line:84%
So the further away the spirit
gets from the physical body

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:16.630 align:middle line:84%
within the water of
the homeopathic remedy,

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.520 align:middle line:90%
it's actually expanding.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:22.690 align:middle line:84%
Someone once said to me that
dying is like taking off

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:24.340 align:middle line:90%
an uncomfortable shoe.

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.740 align:middle line:84%
You are able to
expand much further

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.820 align:middle line:90%
and become more of an observer.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And I actually think the more
spiritual aspect of water

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.039 align:middle line:90%
is the observer.

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:34.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And when people die--

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.770 align:middle line:84%
this is just popping into
my head-- when people die,

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:40.480 align:middle line:84%
that little bit, that small
percentage of an ounce that

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.230 align:middle line:84%
disappears with them,
do you think that is

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:43.980 align:middle line:90%
part of the fluid of life?

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:44.780 align:middle line:90%
>>VEDA: I do.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.920 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's very relative
to the Maori word which

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.810 align:middle line:90%
is wairua for spirit.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:53.840 align:middle line:84%
Wai means water, rua
means two-- the physical

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.700 align:middle line:90%
and the spiritual waters.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's the
spiritual water that

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:02.690 align:middle line:84%
leaves the body alongside
consciousness, perhaps.

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Like I've said before,
my friend Joseph Hatman,

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:09.060 align:middle line:84%
he says that water is the glove
on the hand of consciousness.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And I think that it's water
transitioning from one phase

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:14.810 align:middle line:90%
to another.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Because many people talk
about spirit like a gas.

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:18.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:19.290 align:middle line:90%
>>VEDA: Yes, they do.

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So this is totally
random and not in our line

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:25.220 align:middle line:84%
of questioning, but what happens
to a human being or an animal

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:29.990 align:middle line:84%
or a plant or anything when
it becomes really dehydrated?

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:32.330 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: Well, a lot happens
through dehydration.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:35.990 align:middle line:90%
We start to have a fuzzy memory.

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:41.150 align:middle line:84%
We start to not be able
to think quite right.

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Even the smallest
amount of dehydration

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.130 align:middle line:84%
can really make quite a
big difference, especially

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.712 align:middle line:84%
around our memory, which
is quite interesting.

00:09:48.712 --> 00:09:49.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Around what?

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:50.210 align:middle line:90%
>>VEDA: Memory.

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:51.168 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Memory, yes.

00:09:51.168 --> 00:09:55.340 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: Yeah, and so
there's been a lot of talk

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:56.900 align:middle line:90%
around hydration.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And it seems that virtually,
everybody in the world

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.710 align:middle line:90%
has some level of dehydration.

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's more about
understanding that there

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:09.170 align:middle line:90%
are different kinds of water.

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And that comes into the
fourth phase of water.

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:14.780 align:middle line:84%
There's a liquid,
solid, gas, and then

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.310 align:middle line:90%
a type of gel or plasma.

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's the kind of
water inside of our cells.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.990 align:middle line:90%
And it's like a battery.

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So how do
we best feed that?

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.240 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: Well, I think
then understanding

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:31.920 align:middle line:84%
where this fourth phase water
is within the liquid water.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.940 align:middle line:84%
So Dr. Gerald
Pollack, he has a book

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:36.980 align:middle line:84%
called "The Fourth
Phase of Water."

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that he talks about

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:43.810 align:middle line:84%
is where you might find
fourth phase water.

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:48.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, you always
find it in cells.

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:52.000 align:middle line:84%
In liquid water, it's often
found in deep aquifers

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.860 align:middle line:90%
or deep underground springs.

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Because when there's pressure,
it creates this fourth phase.

00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:02.200 align:middle line:84%
Now a fourth phase
water is actually H3O2.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.480 align:middle line:90%
And it absorbs more light.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.400 align:middle line:90%
It has a negative charge.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.510 align:middle line:90%
It has an ordered structure.

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:10.135 align:middle line:84%
So it's really
important the negative--

00:11:10.135 --> 00:11:12.177 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What kind of
minerals it's exposed to?

00:11:12.177 --> 00:11:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: So minerals
are important.

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.562 align:middle line:84%
It's important because
it makes up human beings.

00:11:17.562 --> 00:11:19.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean in
these deep aquifers,

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:21.460 align:middle line:84%
there are minerals in the
stones that are running through.

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: Well,
actually, I think it's

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.260 align:middle line:84%
the minerals and the salts
that hold and store memory.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.920 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting because when I
use distilled water in my work,

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.580 align:middle line:84%
I see a signature pattern
of distilled water, which

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:35.800 align:middle line:84%
is a pattern that
commonly occurs

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.790 align:middle line:90%
for different types of water.

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:40.550 align:middle line:90%
But I don't see complex imagery.

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:43.190 align:middle line:84%
So I actually think that
it's because of the salts

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:47.420 align:middle line:84%
and minerals that the water is
able to store that information

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:49.190 align:middle line:90%
and share it.

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:53.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, I mean, another
aspect of homeopathy is cell

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:54.080 align:middle line:90%
salts.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.997 align:middle line:84%
The cell salts, and I
think there are about 12

00:11:55.997 --> 00:11:58.760 align:middle line:84%
of them, which also goes
with the Zodiac calendar.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And each person supposedly
has a cell salt that's

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:02.960 align:middle line:90%
aligned with them from birth.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And that must be part of
this hydration process

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.660 align:middle line:90%
and the holding of memory?

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:09.840 align:middle line:90%
>>VEDA: I believe so.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:13.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you take a look at
us, we're not distilled water.

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:16.460 align:middle line:90%
We're an ocean within a body.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And salt's an interesting
one because we're made--

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:21.380 align:middle line:90%
pardon the pun--

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:25.190 align:middle line:84%
if you boil it down, we
are water, salts, minerals,

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:26.730 align:middle line:90%
and consciousness.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:31.850 align:middle line:84%
The salts and minerals and
water both immortal things.

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:33.470 align:middle line:90%
So water doesn't die.

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:37.010 align:middle line:84%
It's always transitioning
from one a stage to another.

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And salt is really interesting
because when you put salt

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.590 align:middle line:90%
in water, it disappears.

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:44.680 align:middle line:84%
It gives the water
electrical charge.

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.750 align:middle line:90%
It becomes a liquid crystal.

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:49.270 align:middle line:84%
But then when the
water evaporates,

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:52.190 align:middle line:84%
hello, there's the
salt in its cubic form.

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:56.800 align:middle line:84%
So even when you're cremated,
the ashes are actually salts.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.680 align:middle line:84%
So when you think about
that, you think about,

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:03.400 align:middle line:84%
well, there's this combination,
this marriage of salt and water

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:08.020 align:middle line:84%
that has everything to
do with storing memories.

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:10.940 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What about --getting
another random one here--

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:15.220 align:middle line:84%
What about the notion of
deuterium depleted water?

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:16.480 align:middle line:90%
What's up with that?

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.150 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Jack Cruz and
others speak about this.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:22.660 align:middle line:84%
For acting as a healing
agent for certain conditions,

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:25.750 align:middle line:84%
what's deuterium
depleted water about?

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: Well, I mean,
my area of specialty

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:31.570 align:middle line:84%
is in crystallography, but
what I do know about deuterium

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:36.640 align:middle line:84%
depleted water is that
it's an interesting one.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Because when
scientists were trying

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:43.180 align:middle line:84%
to prove that water came from
outer space from meteorites,

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:46.180 align:middle line:84%
they based it on the
amount of deuterium

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:49.060 align:middle line:90%
that they found in these rocks.

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And it had the same
amount of deuterium

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:53.740 align:middle line:84%
as water on the
surface of Earth.

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:56.120 align:middle line:84%
But then when you
look at primary water,

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.660 align:middle line:84%
which is the water that's
held within the ringwoodite

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.700 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth's mantle.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And there is more
drinkable water

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:06.970 align:middle line:84%
inside the Earth's
mantle than all the seas

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:08.410 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of Earth.

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And we're told that
we're in this lack.

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.240 align:middle line:84%
But, sorry, and
that's another story.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:19.960 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but that type of water
is created within the Earth

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.480 align:middle line:90%
and it's deuterium depleted.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.510 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's supposed
to be the most true, pure,

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:27.910 align:middle line:84%
healing, hydrating
water for humanity.

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:31.570 align:middle line:84%
So in essence, you have access
to that through deep aquifers?

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:33.070 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: Yeah, well,
it's meant to be

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:36.860 align:middle line:84%
found by coming up through
very, very high springs.

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:39.740 align:middle line:84%
So if you've got a
spring bubbling up

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:41.660 align:middle line:84%
that's high on
top of a mountain,

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:44.490 align:middle line:84%
it's possible that
it's primary water.

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:47.780 align:middle line:90%
So there's a lot more to that.

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:49.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:52.760 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now let's get back
to these beautiful images

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:56.930 align:middle line:84%
and the artistic
creativity of water.

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And so what I thought
we'd do is take a look

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:01.880 align:middle line:84%
at a few photographs
that have been

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.360 align:middle line:84%
exposed to specific
pieces, musically speaking.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.440 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to-- which one would
you like to talk about first?

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: Well, I started doing
a lot of music influences,

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:15.310 align:middle line:84%
inspirations, I
prefer to call them,

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:19.540 align:middle line:84%
with water because my son
had seen Emoto's work, which

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:20.890 align:middle line:90%
was very contrasting.

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:24.520 align:middle line:84%
He showed heavy metal
versus classical music.

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And my son saw the
extremes, and he

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:29.980 align:middle line:90%
couldn't identify with either.

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:33.200 align:middle line:84%
So he came to me and he
said, I think water hates me.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.040 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, why?

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And he said, because I
like Tupac and Tupac swears

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:39.230 align:middle line:84%
and so, therefore,
water hates me.

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.398 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, no, water
is never in judgment.

00:15:41.398 --> 00:15:43.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm pretty sure whoever did
heavy metal didn't like it.

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:45.970 align:middle line:84%
So I did all these
genres of music.

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And what I discovered
is that water seems

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:52.040 align:middle line:90%
to pick up on words from songs.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And one of the songs that
I played repeatedly and did

00:15:56.260 --> 00:16:00.220 align:middle line:84%
repeated studies with
was "Stairway to Heaven."

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:03.010 align:middle line:10%
And so every time I
would play that song,

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:06.160 align:middle line:10%
I would see a stairway
image appear in the ice.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.260 align:middle line:10%
And I tested it again and
again, and then I ended up

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:10.790 align:middle line:10%
writing the word stairway.

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:13.160 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: It's absolutely
fascinating because you did

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.900 align:middle line:10%
repeat this experiment.

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:18.110 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, there's
consistency there.

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:20.900 align:middle line:84%
We saw little hints
also in the beginning

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:24.030 align:middle line:84%
of water being
exposed to images,

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:29.490 align:middle line:84%
pictures, your thoughts, and
it will reflect it back to you.

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:35.120 align:middle line:84%
It's like it's trying to
develop language with you.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: I did a podcast once
and the podcast ended up being

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:39.830 align:middle line:90%
called The Water--

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:42.080 align:middle line:90%
The Liquid Language of God.

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:45.740 align:middle line:84%
And so there is
definitely a relationship.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is built
on relationship.

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:50.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't see what I
do as experimenting.

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:51.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm a body of water.

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And what I see is that
water is responsive,

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.823 align:middle line:84%
not just reactive
to consciousness.

00:16:56.823 --> 00:16:57.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Responsive.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: And so it's literally
like a relationship.

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:04.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, it's reaching
through to communicate with you

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:07.555 align:middle line:84%
in direct response to your
questions and the images

00:17:07.555 --> 00:17:08.430 align:middle line:90%
you're putting forth.

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:11.549 align:middle line:84%
But it also shows the
incredible power of the mind.

00:17:11.549 --> 00:17:12.349 align:middle line:90%
>>VEDA: It does.

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:15.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what happens in
a field where so many minds are

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:18.950 align:middle line:84%
really in chaos
and fear and such,

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:21.859 align:middle line:84%
looking at it through
the lens of water?

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:24.829 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: Well, what
I like to see is

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:29.570 align:middle line:84%
that one drop of water
that has been blessed

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:33.830 align:middle line:84%
can completely
transform tap water.

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And tap water is often
really disordered.

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.220 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We're going
to look at that next.

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:38.490 align:middle line:90%
That's what I want to go to.

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: And so why I say that
is that so often, we can easily

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:47.390 align:middle line:84%
get caught up in what we
think is the collective fear.

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:53.340 align:middle line:84%
But actually, I see that
within the realm of water,

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:57.770 align:middle line:84%
water has the power to
transform a whole ocean

00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:02.400 align:middle line:90%
with one drop of pure love.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And this also happens with
tap water and spring water.

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:10.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It has to be
happening in our bodies.

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:11.152 align:middle line:90%
>>VEDA: Well, absolutely.

00:18:11.152 --> 00:18:14.940 align:middle line:84%
We have the power to
transform our entire life

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:17.820 align:middle line:84%
with a transformation
of our perception.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.500 align:middle line:90%
Water sees us.

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.160 align:middle line:90%
It reads potentials.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.790 align:middle line:84%
So something interesting
that I did recently

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:26.040 align:middle line:84%
was start putting
seeds in water,

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.650 align:middle line:84%
removing them, and
freezing them, the water

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:30.210 align:middle line:90%
that had been imprinted.

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:32.580 align:middle line:90%
And I did one with a sunflower.

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:35.370 align:middle line:10%
I put a sunflower
seed in the water

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:36.930 align:middle line:10%
for 30 seconds, removed it.

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:40.020 align:middle line:10%
And water read the
potential of the seed

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:43.680 align:middle line:10%
and designed an incredible
clear image of a sunflower.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.990 align:middle line:84%
I did the same thing
with a flax seed.

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:48.330 align:middle line:84%
But when I put a
pistachio shell--

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:51.120 align:middle line:90%
empty, with no pistachio in it--

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.490 align:middle line:84%
the water designed
the shell only.

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:56.620 align:middle line:84%
So it reads the
potential of things.

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think it
reads our potential.

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you mentioned
a moment ago the tap water.

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:04.060 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
look at some images.

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:06.130 align:middle line:90%
Just classic city yap water.

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:07.210 align:middle line:90%
City supplies.

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:09.850 align:middle line:84%
Some is fluoridated,
some is not fluoridated,

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:12.910 align:middle line:84%
or are they all
fluoridated, or just random?

00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:15.430 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: It's a little
random, but 90% of them

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:16.698 align:middle line:90%
are fluoridated.

00:19:16.698 --> 00:19:17.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And we can see here.

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:20.960 align:middle line:84%
So what is so stark
when you look at this?

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.530 align:middle line:84%
What surprised you
about this, initially?

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:25.990 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: Well, I guess,
I wasn't so surprised.

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.870 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:28.360 align:middle line:90%
To be honest.

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:31.000 align:middle line:84%
What we see is very
disordered patterning.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.410 align:middle line:90%
And it's consistent.

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:35.830 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I took some city
water from one of the hospitals

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:36.730 align:middle line:90%
in New Zealand.

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite
interesting because it

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:43.150 align:middle line:84%
was one of the most
disordered waters that we see.

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:45.745 align:middle line:84%
But that's because of
where it was coming from,

00:19:45.745 --> 00:19:48.310 align:middle line:84%
from that particular
area of the city.

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:50.980 align:middle line:84%
There's this municipal
tap water and you

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:53.270 align:middle line:90%
can smell the chlorine in it.

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:56.470 align:middle line:84%
So what we see is
water's response

00:19:56.470 --> 00:20:01.300 align:middle line:90%
to what could be seen as trauma.

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And at the same
time, after seeing

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:06.430 align:middle line:84%
and getting to know
those structures,

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:09.160 align:middle line:90%
I think what surprised me more--

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:11.920 align:middle line:84%
so I would basically
do the crystallography

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:15.430 align:middle line:84%
and then let that melt.
And then I would hold it

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:19.060 align:middle line:84%
to my heart in its liquid
stage for a minute in a very

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:19.990 align:middle line:90%
loving way.

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And then I put that same
exact water into the freezer

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:24.430 align:middle line:90%
and refroze it.

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And then it refroze into
incredibly beautiful fern

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.900 align:middle line:84%
patterns that were
very coherent.

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:34.510 align:middle line:84%
So there was a structural
change, but not

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:35.870 align:middle line:90%
a chemical change.

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:37.310 align:middle line:90%
So what does that mean?

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:42.130 align:middle line:84%
What that means is that water
is responding in what could

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:44.170 align:middle line:90%
be seen as an emotional way.

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:45.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:47.810 align:middle line:90%
To me, this is without end.

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:50.060 align:middle line:90%
It's endlessly fascinating.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And so then, in
contrast to that,

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:56.720 align:middle line:84%
you took really clear
fresh spring water.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:59.600 align:middle line:84%
And let's take a look at what
that image is showing us.

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: With spring
water, what we

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:04.590 align:middle line:84%
see is that it responds
in hexagonal patterns.

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:07.220 align:middle line:84%
So hexagons really
are the blueprint

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:10.798 align:middle line:84%
of water's original
point of health.

00:21:10.798 --> 00:21:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's like
the snowflake pattern.

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:12.980 align:middle line:90%
>>VEDA: Yes.

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.000 align:middle line:84%
It's very much like
the snowflake pattern.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.450 align:middle line:84%
And what we see
is that water that

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:19.460 align:middle line:84%
has been frozen
within half an hour

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:23.520 align:middle line:84%
from being taken from source
gives you the truest response.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:27.530 align:middle line:84%
So what we also know is
that spring water or waters

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:31.640 align:middle line:84%
from a deep aquifers that
are very, very vibrant

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:33.590 align:middle line:90%
form huge hexagons.

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:36.050 align:middle line:84%
I have taken a
photograph of water

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:40.220 align:middle line:84%
that was taken from
this beautiful cave

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:42.830 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of nowhere in the
top of the south island of New

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:43.630 align:middle line:90%
Zealand.

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And it formed a hexagon that
took up the entire Petri dish.

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:47.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wow.

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: That's very,
very rare to see.

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:55.020 align:middle line:84%
So what we also see, though,
is that hexagon shape

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:59.400 align:middle line:84%
starts to become smaller
as the longer the water is

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.640 align:middle line:84%
held in a bottle or the
longer it's not flowing.

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:07.020 align:middle line:84%
So you see, the hexagon turn
into this flower shape, which

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:11.850 align:middle line:84%
eventually turns into
this little hexagon, which

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:12.960 align:middle line:90%
then becomes a dot.

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And the hexagon is like
the outline of a hexagon

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:19.350 align:middle line:84%
without all of those
beautiful starry fern

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:21.300 align:middle line:90%
patterns in the middle of it.

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:22.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What happens then--

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.960 align:middle line:84%
because probably most of
the people watching this

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:28.860 align:middle line:84%
have some purification system
at the tap in their home.

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:32.310 align:middle line:84%
What happens then when
you take purified water?

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:34.080 align:middle line:90%
I mean, reverse osmosis, say.

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:37.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: Yeah, I've used all
different types of waters

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:38.490 align:middle line:90%
in my crystallography.

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:39.290 align:middle line:90%
And I found that--

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:40.998 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What's that
look like, though?

00:22:40.998 --> 00:22:42.602 align:middle line:84%
What does reverse
osmosis look like?

00:22:42.602 --> 00:22:44.560 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: Well, it has its
own signature pattern.

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:48.390 align:middle line:84%
So it looks a tiny bit like
the signature pattern of rain.

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:51.420 align:middle line:84%
So rain looks like
a fanning pattern.

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:54.240 align:middle line:10%
Whereas reverse
osmosis, for a fern,

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.990 align:middle line:10%
it has more lines that
look a little bit straight.

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a signature
pattern of reverse osmosis.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.960 align:middle line:90%
So it has its own pattern.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:06.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Not necessarily
incoherent then?

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:08.490 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: No, not
necessarily incoherent.

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:11.430 align:middle line:10%
Purified water, I
think it gives water

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:16.000 align:middle line:10%
a chance to breathe without
any toxins in there.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.530 align:middle line:10%
So I think there really
is a spirit of water.

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
my true realm lies.

00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:27.561 align:middle line:84%
I think we need to understand
what the crystallography is.

00:23:27.561 --> 00:23:31.680 align:middle line:84%
Is it that water is more
drinkable because it

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.000 align:middle line:90%
has beautiful hexagons?

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.960 align:middle line:84%
Or is it that the water is
having an emotional response?

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Is it showing its
state of health,

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:39.960 align:middle line:90%
its energetic state of health.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:41.710 align:middle line:84%
That's actually what
I think we're seeing.

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:44.703 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, and, of course,
everybody's wondering depending

00:23:44.703 --> 00:23:46.620 align:middle line:84%
on what they're putting
in their body and what

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:49.680 align:middle line:84%
they're consuming, does the
beauty and the beautiful

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:54.900 align:middle line:84%
crystal structure of the
water affect their mind, body,

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.510 align:middle line:84%
emotions when they take
in this beautiful water?

00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:00.570 align:middle line:84%
Even though that state
may be impermanent,

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:03.900 align:middle line:84%
but if they're taking it in
that fresh glorious state,

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:08.100 align:middle line:84%
like that huge hexagram from the
cave, what does that do to us?

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:09.570 align:middle line:90%
What do you think it does to us?

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:12.270 align:middle line:84%
Or is this still being
studied, obviously?

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: Yeah, well, I think that
we are the welcoming committee.

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:25.050 align:middle line:84%
I think whatever water that you
drink has a chance to heal you.

00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:29.080 align:middle line:84%
But it's very dependent
on how you receive it.

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:32.640 align:middle line:84%
So, of course, we all want
to drink the beautiful spring

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:35.680 align:middle line:84%
water that has giant hexagons,
but not everybody can do that.

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:36.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's right, yeah.

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: So I've done
studies on saliva,

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:43.260 align:middle line:84%
where, literally, you spit
into a dish and you freeze it.

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And what I've discovered
is that the last sentence

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:49.320 align:middle line:84%
or the last word
that you speak holds

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.340 align:middle line:90%
a vibration in your mouth.

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:53.980 align:middle line:90%
And that is so relevant.

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:59.160 align:middle line:84%
So when I've frozen the sample,
I see an image, literally,

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.100 align:middle line:90%
in the bubble.

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:02.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So if I say, oh,
I just made a wonderful lemon

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:03.630 align:middle line:90%
meringue pie.

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:04.470 align:middle line:90%
I love lemons.

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:05.520 align:middle line:90%
I love lemon trees.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.540 align:middle line:90%
Lemon, lemon, lemon.

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And then you took
the saliva, you'd

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:11.288 align:middle line:84%
probably see something that
looked like a lemon, really.

00:25:11.288 --> 00:25:13.830 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: I did one where I was
talking about the number eight.

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And the number 8 was
the last word I said.

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:22.950 align:middle line:84%
I froze the saliva, and
there was this, clear as day,

00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:24.810 align:middle line:90%
eight stamped into the bubble.

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:29.260 align:middle line:84%
So what's that really saying
is that the words that we speak

00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:31.580 align:middle line:84%
have a resonance
that is in our mouth.

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And when we drink
water, our saliva

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:37.528 align:middle line:84%
is the first liquid
that it touches.

00:25:37.528 --> 00:25:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And then that, of
course, that brings

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:43.610 align:middle line:84%
into the intelligence of our
body reading that information.

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
that water is also

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:49.100 align:middle line:84%
intertwining with the
information in the saliva.

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:51.520 align:middle line:84%
So that ties in with
saying a blessing

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:55.810 align:middle line:84%
or being grateful, or saying a
prayer before you drink water.

00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And how you receive
it, literally,

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:02.090 align:middle line:84%
is how the water is going
to respond in your body.

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:04.600 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't have
the perfect water,

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.400 align:middle line:84%
and all you have
is filtered water

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:11.470 align:middle line:84%
and you are consciously mindful
of that last word of how you're

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:17.540 align:middle line:84%
receiving this fluid which is
so life giving, that is where--

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's
going to imprint it.

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:22.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's like in Emoto's work,
it became very much part of pop

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:25.870 align:middle line:84%
culture to go to Whole Foods
and buy your clear glass

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:28.250 align:middle line:84%
bottle with love etched
on it, for example.

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:30.790 align:middle line:84%
So it's the same thing,
but you can do this simply

00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:33.460 align:middle line:84%
by bringing it into your
mouth with the thought of love

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:34.467 align:middle line:90%
and the feeling of love.

00:26:34.467 --> 00:26:35.800 align:middle line:90%
It's going to do the same thing.

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.660 align:middle line:90%
You don't need the intermediary.

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: Actually,
my children taught

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:40.810 align:middle line:90%
me something very interesting.

00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:45.640 align:middle line:84%
Even more than writing words
or saying words and drinking

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:46.840 align:middle line:90%
liquid water.

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:51.910 align:middle line:84%
As I've been doing my
crystallography, my daughter,

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:53.860 align:middle line:84%
I was holding up
a pretty sample.

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And she said, can
I have that, mommy?

00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:56.710 align:middle line:90%
And I said, sure.

00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:58.420 align:middle line:90%
So I gave her the ice.

00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:00.470 align:middle line:90%
And she started to eat it.

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh,
what are you doing?

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And she said, it's
good for me, mommy.

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:05.090 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, OK.

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:05.890 align:middle line:90%
I stored it away.

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And then a week later, my
son was doing the same thing.

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:09.790 align:middle line:90%
He said, can I have that?

00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:12.160 align:middle line:84%
He ate the ice and said
it was good for him.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And then as I've been
teaching my technique,

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:17.160 align:middle line:84%
I have all kinds of
parents, and they say,

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.160 align:middle line:90%
my children are eating--

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:18.880 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They want to lick it.

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:19.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.850 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: And so it's
quite interesting

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:23.920 align:middle line:84%
because what we've
started to see

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:29.920 align:middle line:84%
is that when you write words,
water reads the energy of words

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:32.590 align:middle line:84%
and freezes into the
energy of a word.

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And when you eat that ice,
although it's very, very

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:38.050 align:middle line:84%
early days, people
have actually been

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:41.200 align:middle line:84%
having incredible
results from headaches

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.360 align:middle line:84%
to stomach aches to
all kinds of things.

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Because if you think about
it, words have so much power--

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:50.270 align:middle line:84%
we've just talked about
that-- even the written word.

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And so if you have
insomnia, maybe,

00:27:54.310 --> 00:28:01.300 align:middle line:84%
and you write the word rest,
and then you're eating this ice,

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:03.460 align:middle line:84%
if you do it every
day for about a week,

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:06.047 align:middle line:84%
you really seem to start
noticing a huge difference.

00:28:06.047 --> 00:28:07.005 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:28:07.005 --> 00:28:07.870 align:middle line:90%
>>VEDA: Yeah.

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:09.745 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You were
talking about the saliva.

00:28:09.745 --> 00:28:11.565 align:middle line:84%
And what popped to
mind was a series

00:28:11.565 --> 00:28:12.940 align:middle line:84%
of books, the
"Anastasia" series.

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:14.190 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if you read them.

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:16.750 align:middle line:84%
But in book one, "Ringing
Cedars Series, Anastasia"--

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:19.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you can even buy
them now, which is a shame.

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:22.450 align:middle line:84%
But in the first book,
this amazing woman

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:26.320 align:middle line:84%
from the deep forest
in Siberia told the man

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:31.060 align:middle line:84%
who wrote the books that
what their practice was

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:35.140 align:middle line:84%
to take the seeds and
put them under the tongue

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:38.260 align:middle line:84%
and allow the saliva
to permeate the seed

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:41.440 align:middle line:84%
and then to plant the
seed so that it expressed

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:44.230 align:middle line:84%
all of the nutrients
and minerals

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:45.560 align:middle line:90%
your body personally needed.

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:46.360 align:middle line:90%
>>VEDA: Mm-hmm.

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:47.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:51.310 align:middle line:84%
I actually know someone
who has a farm that has

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:53.320 align:middle line:90%
said that is absolutely true.

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:56.680 align:middle line:84%
Although there is science
to say that it's not true,

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:59.367 align:middle line:84%
it's interesting
because you have

00:28:59.367 --> 00:29:01.700 align:middle line:84%
to wonder, well, what's really
true and what's not true.

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And if you have personal
experience of something,

00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:04.330 align:middle line:90%
then that's your truth.

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:04.960 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's your truth.

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.220 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:07.220 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:08.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:10.180 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to
get into a touchy one.

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:15.980 align:middle line:84%
And that is 5G and these
technological effects on water.

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:18.400 align:middle line:84%
So why don't we
take a look at what

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:20.890 align:middle line:90%
5G-exposed water looks like.

00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:21.790 align:middle line:10%
Here we can see this.

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:23.925 align:middle line:10%
And go ahead and explain
what we're seeing.

00:29:23.925 --> 00:29:24.730 align:middle line:10%
>>VEDA: Yeah.

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:27.620 align:middle line:10%
Well, what I did was
I took spring water,

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:29.820 align:middle line:10%
which I knew its beautiful
signature pattern,

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:32.700 align:middle line:10%
and I basically
put it in a bottle.

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:35.940 align:middle line:10%
And I put it just right
beside a 5G tower.

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:39.280 align:middle line:10%
I did one for 15 minutes
and one for half an hour.

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And when I did the
crystallography

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:45.630 align:middle line:84%
within half an hour of having
done that, we saw extremely

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:48.870 align:middle line:84%
disordered patterns, one of
the most disordered patterns

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:50.130 align:middle line:90%
I've actually seen.

00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:53.610 align:middle line:10%
So that was really
quite interesting

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:56.610 align:middle line:10%
because it was even more
disordered than when

00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:59.080 align:middle line:10%
I put the water by a router.

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And so I was curious
to see that if I

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:06.900 align:middle line:84%
let that water melt
and refroze it,

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:10.150 align:middle line:84%
would it continue
to express disorder.

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:12.360 align:middle line:90%
So I did that six times.

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:15.570 align:middle line:84%
On the sixth time of melting
and freezing the water,

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:18.480 align:middle line:84%
it. actually gone back
to its original pattern.

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:23.460 align:middle line:84%
So I found that to be at
least something to consider,

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:26.670 align:middle line:84%
is that the first
initial response was

00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:31.560 align:middle line:84%
like a shock, that water is able
to, and constantly seeks to,

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:35.370 align:middle line:84%
go back to its original patterns
if it's given the opportunity.

00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think within the
freezing, melting stages,

00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:42.200 align:middle line:84%
it helps water to go back
to its original patterns.

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So how would
you correlate that

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:48.060 align:middle line:84%
to the body's waters that
are being exposed to these

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:49.816 align:middle line:90%
frequencies?

00:30:49.816 --> 00:30:53.290 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: Again, I
think that EMF is

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:55.030 align:middle line:90%
very real for a lot of people.

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:58.900 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are very
sensitive to these frequencies.

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:03.610 align:middle line:84%
What we're seeing is water
responding and then finding

00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:05.750 align:middle line:90%
ways to self-heal.

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And I constantly see that
water will have a shock

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:11.030 align:middle line:90%
and react in a big way.

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And then if you keep
letting it melt and freeze,

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:15.710 align:middle line:90%
you see improvement.

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:18.760 align:middle line:90%
So I think that we--

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:22.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what can we
proactively do if people are

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:25.647 align:middle line:84%
living in an area that has
5G, maybe even has routers,

00:31:25.647 --> 00:31:27.730 align:middle line:84%
and maybe they're in an
apartment building, Wi-Fi,

00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:29.140 align:middle line:84%
everything is
running through them?

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:31.098 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: Do you know what
I've actually observed

00:31:31.098 --> 00:31:34.150 align:middle line:84%
is that when you
get magnesium oil,

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:36.710 align:middle line:84%
and you rub it on
your body, your skin,

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:39.317 align:middle line:84%
it actually does seem to
create some kind of a barrier.

00:31:39.317 --> 00:31:40.150 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: A shield.

00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:40.750 align:middle line:90%
>>VEDA: Shield.

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:41.875 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:31:41.875 --> 00:31:43.840 align:middle line:84%
What about if you take
magnesium internally?

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.850 align:middle line:90%
Or does it have to be external?

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:48.020 align:middle line:90%
>>VEDA: You can do both.

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:52.270 align:middle line:84%
I found that the external seems
to really create a shield that

00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:53.650 align:middle line:90%
can last for quite a long time.

00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:54.085 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:31:54.085 --> 00:31:55.300 align:middle line:90%
>>VEDA: Yeah.

00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:57.820 align:middle line:84%
So I would say that
would be something

00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:00.280 align:middle line:84%
that you could
definitely do that's good

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:03.590 align:middle line:90%
for you and it's easy.

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:08.090 align:middle line:84%
I also think that
understanding water

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:12.300 align:middle line:84%
and understanding the biowater,
the water inside of your body,

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:16.400 align:middle line:90%
and how it is intelligent--

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:23.480 align:middle line:84%
I think that sometimes we limit
water with our own limited

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:25.320 align:middle line:90%
understanding of it.

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:29.330 align:middle line:84%
But I think if we understood
that water constantly

00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:34.520 align:middle line:84%
seeks health, and its purpose,
really, is to improve things,

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:36.060 align:middle line:90%
it's always finding ways--

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:36.725 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So it has your back.

00:32:36.725 --> 00:32:37.790 align:middle line:90%
>>VEDA: It's got your back.

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:39.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's got your back.

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.310 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:42.530 align:middle line:84%
One of the surprises
you found also

00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:46.010 align:middle line:84%
was that you were able to read
the crystal structure of things

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:46.970 align:middle line:90%
like egg whites--

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:47.240 align:middle line:90%
>>VEDA: Yes.

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:48.242 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --and juice.

00:32:48.242 --> 00:32:49.700 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that for a moment.

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:51.117 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: Well, I
was wondering what

00:32:51.117 --> 00:32:55.140 align:middle line:84%
would be the most naturally
informed water on the planet?

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And so I always thought it
would be amniotic fluid.

00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And since that's not
readily available,

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.970 align:middle line:84%
the next best thing
was egg white.

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite good because
eggs are in little containers.

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:10.770 align:middle line:84%
So I found that when
you crack an egg open,

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:15.180 align:middle line:84%
the egg white or egg
albumin is in two parts,

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:19.240 align:middle line:84%
the gloopy, gelatinous part and
then the thin, more saliva-like

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:20.040 align:middle line:90%
part.

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:23.160 align:middle line:84%
When you freeze the thin,
saliva-like part, what

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:26.430 align:middle line:84%
you see in fresh,
free-range, happy hen eggs

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:30.670 align:middle line:84%
is these beautiful
very complex patterns.

00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And there are six of
them that I've named.

00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And what we see in
caged hens eggs,

00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:39.540 align:middle line:84%
it can only form two of
those patterns, and then

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:40.890 align:middle line:90%
the two most rudimentary.

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:42.585 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: In
standard formed eggs.

00:33:42.585 --> 00:33:43.115 align:middle line:90%
>>VEDA: Yes.

00:33:43.115 --> 00:33:43.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:44.600 align:middle line:90%
In factories.

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:45.450 align:middle line:90%
Factory eggs.

00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:48.150 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: And so what
was interesting--

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:51.210 align:middle line:84%
because I was inspired by a
man called Luc Montagnier who

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:55.440 align:middle line:84%
did something which is
known as DNA teleportation.

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:57.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was thinking,
what if I just

00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:00.600 align:middle line:84%
put a free-range egg
beside a caged hen egg

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.120 align:middle line:84%
and see if information
is exchanged.

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.380 align:middle line:90%
Will one affect the other?

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:05.800 align:middle line:90%
Or will nothing happen?

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:07.590 align:middle line:90%
And so I did that.

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:09.090 align:middle line:90%
And I left them overnight.

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And because I've done
thousands of these,

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:13.290 align:middle line:84%
I know they always
form the same pattern.

00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:16.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's not consciousness
affecting the eggs.

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:19.770 align:middle line:84%
These are very
repeatable patterns.

00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:23.489 align:middle line:84%
And so I'd never seen more than
two patterns in caged hen eggs.

00:34:23.489 --> 00:34:25.830 align:middle line:84%
But after I did
the crystallography

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:28.830 align:middle line:84%
of having the free-range
egg beside the caged hen egg

00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:31.350 align:middle line:84%
overnight, the caged
hen egg started

00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:34.290 align:middle line:90%
to form incredible patterns.

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:35.520 align:middle line:90%
It improved.

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And the free-range
egg stayed beautiful.

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:39.630 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't degraded.

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:42.923 align:middle line:84%
But when I shared that on
social media, everyone was like,

00:34:42.923 --> 00:34:43.840 align:middle line:90%
oh, yeah, that's cool.

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:48.360 align:middle line:84%
But what if you surround it
by bad eggs, so to speak.

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:49.860 align:middle line:90%
So I did that twice.

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:52.290 align:middle line:84%
I put a free-range
egg in the middle.

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:53.280 align:middle line:90%
I did controls.

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And I surrounded it by caged hen
eggs, all from the same batch.

00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:59.500 align:middle line:90%
And what we saw--

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:00.720 align:middle line:90%
and we left them overnight.

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:04.320 align:middle line:84%
What I saw was that there
was healing by proximity.

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:08.340 align:middle line:84%
The caged hen eggs that were the
closest to the free-range egg

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:12.600 align:middle line:84%
had all drastically improved to
look just like free-range eggs.

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:15.580 align:middle line:84%
The ones further away had
improved but not as much.

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And this happened
both times I did it.

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:22.590 align:middle line:84%
So what we're really
seeing is that it's

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:25.710 align:middle line:84%
very similar to the one
drop of blessed water

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:29.070 align:middle line:90%
into a giant ocean.

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:30.550 align:middle line:90%
It makes a difference.

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:33.750 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to look
at it in human terms,

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:37.430 align:middle line:84%
if we start to heal ourselves,
we naturally heal others.

00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:39.438 align:middle line:84%
My teacher in
India, he said some

00:35:39.438 --> 00:35:41.730 align:middle line:84%
of the greatest saints that
have ever walked the planet

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:44.820 align:middle line:84%
and the most beautiful
people that have been here,

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:47.400 align:middle line:84%
they're like vessels
of divine love.

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And their energy has
reached and healed people

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:54.420 align:middle line:84%
that they will never meet
because the energy has traveled

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:56.590 align:middle line:90%
so far across the world.

00:35:56.590 --> 00:36:00.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think that this
beautiful reality

00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:03.650 align:middle line:84%
that we're seeing in
eggs, which of course--

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:04.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's amazing.

00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:05.920 align:middle line:90%
What an amazing story.

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, it just shows in
living patterns entanglement,

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:10.560 align:middle line:90%
>>VEDA: Yeah.

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:13.555 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Entanglement on a
fundamental material level.

00:36:13.555 --> 00:36:14.355 align:middle line:90%
>>VEDA: Absolutely.

00:36:14.355 --> 00:36:17.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Have you talked with
Dean Radin and some of these

00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:20.410 align:middle line:84%
people in the fields of
consciousness and entanglement?

00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:22.945 align:middle line:84%
It seems like water should
be part of that story.

00:36:22.945 --> 00:36:23.945 align:middle line:90%
It is part of the story.

00:36:23.945 --> 00:36:25.682 align:middle line:90%
>>VEDA: It is part of the story.

00:36:25.682 --> 00:36:27.765 align:middle line:84%
It ties in with Rupert
Sheldrake's morphic fields.

00:36:27.765 --> 00:36:28.848 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:36:28.848 --> 00:36:30.450 align:middle line:90%
I absolutely agree with you.

00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:34.920 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: And I also think that
ancestral information is shared

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:36.225 align:middle line:90%
through the amniotic fluid.

00:36:36.225 --> 00:36:37.050 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:37.770 align:middle line:90%
>>VEDA: Yeah.

00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:39.075 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Including
in the eggs.

00:36:39.075 --> 00:36:39.810 align:middle line:90%
>>VEDA: Yes.

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:40.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the things I've
wondered about for many years,

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:46.410 align:middle line:84%
I just contemplate,
is the notion

00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:48.690 align:middle line:84%
that the bodies
of water on Earth

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:51.870 align:middle line:84%
are constantly receiving
cosmic information.

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:53.800 align:middle line:84%
They're part of
the solar system.

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And that information is here
to help humanity evolve.

00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:00.900 align:middle line:84%
So the waters, therefore,
with that implantation,

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:02.650 align:middle line:90%
have to be doing the same.

00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And then you have all of
the animals and mammals that

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:09.240 align:middle line:90%
live inside the water as well.

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:11.700 align:middle line:84%
So what can you share
about the great bodies

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:15.150 align:middle line:84%
of water, the cosmos, the
entanglement between the two,

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:18.150 align:middle line:84%
and maybe even species
like whales and dolphins?

00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:19.192 align:middle line:90%
>>VEDA: Big conversation.

00:37:19.192 --> 00:37:21.275 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, if you
could do it in one minute.

00:37:21.275 --> 00:37:22.890 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: I'll do
it in one minute.

00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:28.470 align:middle line:84%
So basically, the oceans,
they're like a source,

00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:29.460 align:middle line:90%
like source.

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And I always say that
water isn't a resource.

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:32.520 align:middle line:90%
It is source.

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:33.520 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Source, yeah.

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:35.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: And we often
forget that there's

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:39.090 align:middle line:84%
water in the air and
water in the universe,

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:44.730 align:middle line:84%
and the word hydrogen
means the creator of water.

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And some people
think that hydrogen

00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:48.990 align:middle line:90%
is the spirit of water.

00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And so it's quite interesting
because some people

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:54.660 align:middle line:84%
think that plasma
is the mind of water

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:57.970 align:middle line:84%
and that liquid water
is the body of water.

00:37:57.970 --> 00:38:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
think of the oceans,

00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:02.370 align:middle line:84%
the oceans are full
of salt. So they're

00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:04.230 align:middle line:90%
storing so much information.

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:05.790 align:middle line:90%
And they have electrical charge.

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:08.970 align:middle line:84%
I've always thought that
electrical charge and the water

00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:12.660 align:middle line:84%
in the air is the silver
thread that connects

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:14.500 align:middle line:90%
the spirit to the body.

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And so in water that's
without a body, as such,

00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:21.210 align:middle line:84%
is always in the
spiritual stage.

00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:24.330 align:middle line:84%
So there's constant
energetic information

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:28.170 align:middle line:84%
sharing from all planets,
stars, the universe.

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:31.320 align:middle line:84%
There is a constant
movement and sharing

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:34.920 align:middle line:84%
of information from planet
to planet, star to star,

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:36.930 align:middle line:90%
body to body, cell to cell.

00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:39.060 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And what
about, just quickly,

00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:41.760 align:middle line:84%
dolphins or whales and because
they're known as, well,

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:44.310 align:middle line:84%
whales in particular, as
memory keepers for the planet?

00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:46.610 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: Well, I have a
lovely story about whales.

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:47.685 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Please.

00:38:47.685 --> 00:38:51.570 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: There's a man in New
Zealand that does a lot of work

00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:53.280 align:middle line:90%
with water and sound.

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And he has a device that
essentially can pick up

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:02.850 align:middle line:84%
the sound of plants,
the sound of mushrooms,

00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:05.340 align:middle line:84%
the sounds of trees, the
sounds even of water,

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:07.620 align:middle line:84%
not just the trickling
noises of water,

00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:11.280 align:middle line:84%
but the actual
sound that it makes.

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And so in New Zealand, we
used to have a lot of whales

00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:17.010 align:middle line:90%
that would move past beaches.

00:39:17.010 --> 00:39:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And they make sounds
that travel very far.

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:24.090 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people
think that sound only

00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:25.500 align:middle line:90%
travels through the water.

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:28.740 align:middle line:84%
But actually, the sound
travels over through the water

00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:31.590 align:middle line:84%
and over into the beach
and then into the forests.

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And in New Zealand,
we have a sacred tree,

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:36.270 align:middle line:84%
a native tree called
the kauri tree.

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And the whales and the kauri
tree have conversations.

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And they know each
other's sounds.

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:45.960 align:middle line:90%
So he took the sound of water.

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And he thought,
well, I wonder if we

00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:50.580 align:middle line:84%
took the sound of
the kauri tree,

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:53.670 align:middle line:84%
and we went out
into the deep ocean,

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:56.550 align:middle line:84%
and we played the sound
of the kauri tree,

00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:59.010 align:middle line:90%
will the whales come?

00:39:59.010 --> 00:40:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking to
him just recently.

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And he was going out on a boat
to see if the whales came.

00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:06.210 align:middle line:90%
And to my knowledge, they have.

00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:07.085 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wonderful.

00:40:07.085 --> 00:40:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: So there is
communication between trees

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:10.745 align:middle line:90%
and whales as well.

00:40:10.745 --> 00:40:13.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So beautiful,
I mean, all of this.

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:15.960 align:middle line:84%
Most of the people that
are watching right now,

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:18.780 align:middle line:84%
it's taking you into a
magical understanding

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:21.180 align:middle line:84%
of life, the interconnectedness
of all of life.

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And we're simply another
vehicle within that, obviously,

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:26.590 align:middle line:84%
with a different type
of consciousness.

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:27.450 align:middle line:90%
So let's go.

00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:29.080 align:middle line:90%
We only have a few minutes left.

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:31.170 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to get some
more of the images in.

00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:34.890 align:middle line:84%
So one, you talk to your
mother on the other--

00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:38.110 align:middle line:84%
she's deceased, as you
mentioned-- on the other side.

00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:40.275 align:middle line:84%
And tell us about
that in this image.

00:40:40.275 --> 00:40:41.250 align:middle line:90%
>>VEDA: Sure.

00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:43.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is very
special to me.

00:40:43.350 --> 00:40:45.990 align:middle line:84%
So my mom was also
my best friend.

00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:48.510 align:middle line:90%
And she died in 1999.

00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And years and years ago,
I used to live in Japan.

00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And my mom and I, we would
write letters to each other.

00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
every letter, my mother

00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:58.260 align:middle line:90%
would attempt to draw a circle.

00:40:58.260 --> 00:40:59.640 align:middle line:90%
Her circles were terrible.

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And she'd draw a little
heart in the middle.

00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:04.720 align:middle line:90%
And I was missing her.

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:08.600 align:middle line:10%
And so I said to the water,
can you connect to my mom?

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:12.770 align:middle line:10%
And when I froze the
water after speaking that,

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:14.000 align:middle line:10%
I've pulled it out.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.710 align:middle line:10%
And there was this
misshapen circle

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:17.460 align:middle line:10%
with a heart in the middle.

00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:21.455 align:middle line:84%
And of all of the things that
water could have chosen to do--

00:41:21.455 --> 00:41:23.945 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's the one thing
so personal between you.

00:41:23.945 --> 00:41:25.820 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: So personal, I
wasn't expecting that.

00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:27.470 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't projecting that.

00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:29.012 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, it
wasn't your mind.

00:41:29.012 --> 00:41:32.030 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: But now every time
her birthday comes around,

00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:33.320 align:middle line:90%
I ask the same question.

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:34.895 align:middle line:84%
And I keep seeing
the same response.

00:41:34.895 --> 00:41:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh.

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:36.020 align:middle line:90%
>>VEDA: Yeah.

00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:37.910 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: That's just
very heartwarming.

00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And so also you
started asking water

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:43.530 align:middle line:84%
about what life might be
like on other planets.

00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:45.295 align:middle line:84%
So tell us about a
couple of these images.

00:41:45.295 --> 00:41:48.530 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: Yeah, there's no limit
to what you can ask water.

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:52.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, water really revealed
what looks like something

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:57.290 align:middle line:84%
from "Star Wars" a little bit,
like this long, tall buildings

00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:58.880 align:middle line:84%
and various different
kinds of shapes.

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:02.105 align:middle line:84%
And when I asked it to show
me what Mars looked like,

00:42:02.105 --> 00:42:03.770 align:middle line:90%
it looked--

00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:07.000 align:middle line:84%
even took on a reddish
color, which is interesting,

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.890 align:middle line:84%
because although you
can see colors coming

00:42:08.890 --> 00:42:11.080 align:middle line:84%
through the ice because
of the background,

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:13.690 align:middle line:84%
the ice is very thin,
I hadn't personally

00:42:13.690 --> 00:42:16.130 align:middle line:90%
noticed anything very red.

00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:21.640 align:middle line:84%
So there was a slight reddish
tinge to the crystallography.

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And I've done a lot of
things around asking

00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:29.840 align:middle line:84%
water questions like, what on
Earth was inspired by aliens.

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:30.640 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh.

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And there you got
the pyramids of Giza.

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:32.710 align:middle line:90%
>>VEDA: Aha.

00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:33.877 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, that image.

00:42:33.877 --> 00:42:35.440 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: And we got
an image very much

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:38.455 align:middle line:84%
like one of the pyramids
too, I think, in Mexico.

00:42:38.455 --> 00:42:39.476 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:42:39.476 --> 00:42:42.190 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA: So that was
kind of consistent.

00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:45.700 align:middle line:10%
So then it's, like,
well what is alien,

00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:47.830 align:middle line:10%
what is the word alien to water?

00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:50.390 align:middle line:84%
I actually asked water
what is its first memory.

00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:52.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think different
bodies of water

00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:54.250 align:middle line:84%
might have slightly
different memories.

00:42:54.250 --> 00:42:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And the image I saw
was fascinating.

00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:02.020 align:middle line:84%
It was this very clear
face with a very large eye.

00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:06.140 align:middle line:90%
And the words "I am" were there.

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And when I have asked water
who are you, I've got,

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:16.075 align:middle line:84%
"I am" and "I M" consistently
show up in the ice.

00:43:16.075 --> 00:43:17.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:19.665 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're just
about out of time.

00:43:19.665 --> 00:43:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And people are
listening to this.

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:22.957 align:middle line:84%
And you say you're not
using anything special,

00:43:22.957 --> 00:43:23.980 align:middle line:90%
no special effects.

00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:25.790 align:middle line:84%
You're using your
iPhone to capture it.

00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:26.590 align:middle line:90%
>>VEDA: Yeah.

00:43:26.590 --> 00:43:28.048 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So just
in the last bit,

00:43:28.048 --> 00:43:29.980 align:middle line:84%
tell us how you
capture these images,

00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:32.600 align:middle line:84%
in case some of our budding
scientists at home want to do

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:33.400 align:middle line:90%
this themselves.

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:34.660 align:middle line:90%
>>VEDA: Absolutely.

00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:36.910 align:middle line:84%
Basically, I get a
glass Petri dish.

00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:39.010 align:middle line:90%
Glass is important.

00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:41.710 align:middle line:84%
I put a small amount
of water in the dish.

00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And I freeze it for about
five minutes and 20s

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:48.890 align:middle line:84%
or until there's liquid
on top and ice underneath.

00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:49.990 align:middle line:90%
Then you pull it out.

00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:52.060 align:middle line:90%
You tip the liquid water away.

00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And then you quickly
photograph the ice that

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:57.243 align:middle line:90%
is stuck to the Petri dish.

00:43:57.243 --> 00:43:59.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Does it need to
be on a light background,

00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:00.380 align:middle line:90%
like on a slide?

00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:01.180 align:middle line:90%
>>VEDA: No.

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:03.108 align:middle line:84%
I hold it up to
the natural light.

00:44:03.108 --> 00:44:04.150 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Natural light.
